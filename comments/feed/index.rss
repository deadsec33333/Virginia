																						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-size:12px;"></p><p>Gov. Ralph Northam put out his administration&#8217;s energy plan Tuesday, a non-binding planning document that lays out a vision for the next decade of energy policy in Virginia. But it was met with some effusive praise by environmental groups and renewable energy and energy-efficiency interests.</p>
<p>&#8220;This plan represents the first time in Virginia history a governor has completed a truly forward-thinking outlook for our commonwealth’s energy future,&#8221; said Kate Addleson, director of the Sierra Club&#8217;s Virginia chapter. &#8220;The energy plan recognizes that Virginia needs to make significant changes in the way we produce, deliver and consume energy, including transforming our grid into one that can accommodate more renewable energy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Much of the<a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/secretary-of-commerce-and-trade/2018-Virginia-Energy-Plan.pdf" target="_blank"> 91-page plan</a> mirrors the major overhaul of utility regulation Dominion Energy pushed through the General Assembly this year, Senate Bill 966, or the Grid Transformation and Security Act.</p>
<p>Northam signed the legislation, though<a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/general-assembly/virginia-senate-passes-utility-regulation-overhaul/article_ecad021e-dccb-5ef3-b83b-c1215c5273e0.html" target="_blank"> he was criticized </a>for not driving a harder bargain on the bill, which allows the utility to offset hundreds of millions in  over-earnings with spending on grid upgrades and other eligible projects, and also commits to big increases in solar and wind development.</p>
<p>&#8220;The clean energy sector has the power to create new business opportunities, expand customer access to renewable energy, and spark the high-demand jobs of the 21st century,” Northam said in a statement Tuesday. “Virginia can shift to a more modern electric grid that is reliable, affordable, resilient, and environmentally responsible—and the commonwealth can lead this critical industry as a result. This plan sets an ambitious path forward for Virginia, and I am confident we will charge ahead towards progress over the course of my administration.”</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the kind of rhetoric renewable energy advocates have long been demanding in Virginia, where you can look over the border to North Carolina or Maryland to see states with<a href="https://www.seia.org/states-map" target="_blank"> more significantly installed solar capacity.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;With its 2018 energy plan, the Commonwealth of Virginia has taken another important step to expand solar energy and promote innovative technologies over the next 10 years,&#8221; said Sean Gallagher, vice president of state affairs at the Solar Energy Industries Association. &#8220;Gov. Northam deserves credit for his leadership on clean energy and for establishing goals that are aligned with business and the public’s desire for energy that is affordable, creates jobs, protects the environment and grows Virginia’s economy. The solar industry will work with policy leaders, manufacturers and installers across Virginia to meet these benchmarks.”</p>
<p>Among other recommendations, the plan calls for a comprehensive grid modernization planning process to aid implementation of the sprawling utility act; 3,000 megawatts of solar and onshore wind to be deployed by 2022; 2,000 megawatts of offshore wind to be deployed by 2028 and for Virginia’s utilities to collectively invest $115 million per year in energy efficiency programs.</p>
<p>Also included are recommendations to loosen rules around power purchase agreements, which allow customers to buy energy from third-party electric generators instead of utilities, and raising caps on net-metering, which allow owners of rooftop solar arrays to be compensated for the excess electricity they put onto the grid.</p>
<p>And it recommends including distributed energy planning and data collection (such as the smart electric meters Dominion is pushing to install) in long term utility planning documents, called Integrated Resource Plans, that utilities file to demonstrate how they intend to meet their customers&#8217; demand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don’t think anybody has a clear idea of what is worthwhile grid transformation and what is a waste of ratepayer dollars,&#8221; said Will Cleveland, an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center who focuses on utility regulation and renewable energy.</p>
<p>He added that there are &#8220;some good pro-consumer recommendations&#8221; in the plan, particularly lifting the cap on net-metering and adjusting rules on power-purchase agreements.</p>
<p>However, many of the recommendation require navigating a General Assembly in which Dominion has historically held sway on such policy.  And the energy giant has been hostile to allowing others to &#8220;use the grid for free,&#8221; as it has framed the debate.</p>
<p>&#8220;The proposals are largely sound,&#8221; Cleveland said. &#8220;It’s a little thin on the details of how we actually get to these things. Are these legislative proposals the governor is going to be fighting tooth and nail for or what?”</p>

Chris Jones, R-Suffolk, defended a remedial redistricting proposal that a House panel advanced last year on a party-line vote. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury - Sept. 27, 2018)</p><p>Republicans are sending a remedial voting map to the floor of the House of Delegates they say was drawn without considering racial data in a bid to fix 11 racially gerrymandered House districts in the Richmond area and Hampton Roads.</p>
<p>In a statement, Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat who has veto authority over any map the GOP-controlled General Assembly passes, said he was &#8220;disappointed&#8221; by the partisan display.</p>
<p>&#8220;I’m convinced now more than ever that a nonpartisan process is necessary to draw a map that is fair and meets the court’s requirements,&#8221; Northam said.</p>
<p>Del. Chris Jones, R-Suffolk, proposed the bill Wednesday. It kept the 32 affected districts &#8220;partisan-neutral,&#8221; as Jones called it, meaning no competitive district swayed significantly more or less toward one party.</p>
<p>After tense questioning from some Democrats, the map passed 12-10, with every Democrat on the committee opposing. The legislature has until Oct. 30 to finalize a map before the U.S. District Court redraws the districts. Jones said a month is plenty of time to get the work done.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a starting point,&#8221; Jones said during a Privileges and Elections Committee meeting, saying he was open to changes to be made on the House floor. &#8220;It&#8217;s a work in progress.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jones said he used the Democrats&#8217; proposed map, which was killed in the committee, also on a party-line vote, as a template and met with several Democrats from Hampton Roads to craft his proposal: Portsmouth Del. Steve Heretick, Norfolk delegates Matthew James and Jay Jones, Chesapeake Del. Cliff Hayes and Virginia Beach delegates Kelly Fowler and Cheryl Turpin.</p>
<p>Democrats&#8217; opposition centered around the question of whether a map drawn to maintain the political status quo could meet the requirements of a court ruling that said black voters were disenfranchised through racial gerrymandering. Norfolk Del. Joe Lindsey in particular pressed Jones on how a remedial map could be drawn without considering racial data.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Trying to get to a partisan-neutral and race-blind map is laughable in 2018 especially when African-Americans in Virginia vote above 90 percent for a specific party,” said Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News. “If the other side of the aisle wants to fix that they should work on their messaging and outreach, not try to fix it through racial gerrymandering.”</span></p>
<p>Jones said the absence of race as a consideration is the very reason it is responsive to the court order. Bristling at the criticism, he called the map put forward by Democrats last month just as politically motivated. That map targeted five Republican-held seats and was called <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/08/30/advocates-as-long-as-redistricting-is-in-the-legislatures-hands-partisan-squabbling-will-be-the-result/" target="_blank">“gerrymandering in response to gerrymandering” by Heretick.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;You went after members to get a political advantage,&#8221; Jones told Lindsey during the committee meeting. &#8220;I&#8217;m very satisfied with my map.&#8221;</p>
<p>Del. Mark Sickles, D-Alexandria, said he thought the Democrats&#8217; map did a better job of correcting the gerrymandering, but either way, he wanted to remove legislators from the redistricting process.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I don&#8217;t agree fundamentally that we are the ones that need to fix this,&#8221; Sickles said. &#8220;We need to get our own self interest out of this.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/08/30/advocates-as-long-as-redistricting-is-in-the-legislatures-hands-partisan-squabbling-will-be-the-result/" target="_blank">One Virginia 2021, a redistricting advocacy group, announced in August that it had created a citizen committee to draft the necessary constitutional amendment</a> to allow an independent commission to take over redistricting.</p>
<p>Jones oversaw the 2011 redistricting that landed the state in hot water with the court, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/08/30/explained-what-went-wrong-with-the-11-disputed-house-districts-including-a-republican-delegates-murky-recollection-in-court/" target="_blank">which gave &#8220;little weight&#8221; to his testimony in the case as he attempted to explain why Republicans split precincts precisely along racial lines</a>. And he said opposes the idea of letting a different body handle redistricting.</p>
<p>&#8220;I firmly believe that it should be our responsibility because we&#8217;re elected by the people to do that job,&#8221; he said.</p>

Powell Jr. federal courthouse in Richmond is home to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, which has been a key battleground over the Atlantic Coast and Mountain Valley pipelines. (Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p>The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission may have to soon figure out how to paper over another defect in the federal permitting process for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline.</p>
<p>Environmental groups asked FERC Tuesday for another stop-work order on the 600-mile, Dominion Energy-led project after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit in Richmond issued a stay of the U.S. Forest Service&#8217;s record of decision and a special use permit that would allow the pipeline to carve through national forests in West Virginia and Virginia.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://www.southernenvironment.org/uploads/words_docs/(102)_2018-09-24_Order_Granting_Stay_Pending_Appeal.pdf" target="_blank"> stay</a>, in place while the court considers an appeal of the permit, means the project no longer meets the conditions set forth in the federal certificate that allowed it to move forward, burrowing and blasting its way through farms, fields, streams and ridgetops. Construction has begun in West Virginia and North Carolina, but the pipeline still lacks some environmental approvals in Virginia, and work here has been limited to tree clearing.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the commission is aware, this is the third time in four months that the 4th Circuit has vacated or stayed federal authorizations for the ACP that represent mandatory conditions of the certificate order,&#8221; lawyers for the Southern Environmental Law Center wrote. The stay follows court orders vacating permit decisions by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service.</p>
<p>In response to those earlier decisions, FERC issued a stop-work order in August, though the agencies were already busy trying to figure out a way around the deficiencies in their approvals. They ultimately decided that they largely couldn&#8217;t and issued what opponents say are essentially the same permits the court had invalidated.</p>
<p>FERC<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/09/17/ferc-allows-construction-to-resume-on-atlantic-coast-pipeline/" target="_blank"> eagerly allowed work to resume earlier this month</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather than taking the time to address the major problems we have seen in federal agencies’ reviews of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, these agencies continue to rush through a rubberstamp process that ignores legal requirements – not to mention the public interest,&#8221; said DJ Gerken, an attorney with the SELC.</p>
<p>FERC&#8217;s decision to allow work to proceed again forces the opponents to go back to court to get judges to rule on whether the federal agencies have actually addressed the problems the court identified. In the meantime, Atlantic, (and their fellow travelers in seizing other people&#8217;s property for fun and profit, the Mountain Valley Pipeline, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/08/29/ferc-allows-work-to-resume-on-mountain-valley-pipeline-two-commissioners-voice-concerns-about-decision/" target="_blank">which suffers from many of the same permitting flaws</a>) will push to get as much pipeline in the ground as they can before the courts can catch up with them.</p>
<p>Dominion, predictably, doesn&#8217;t think the latest stay is a big deal.</p>
<p>“While we respectfully disagree with the court’s ruling, it will not have a significant impact on our construction schedule,” <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-dominion-pipeline/dominion-does-not-expect-u-s-court-order-to-hold-up-atlantic-coast-pipe-idUSKCN1M52B2" target="_blank">Dominion spokesman Aaron Ruby said in an email to Reuters</a>. “We will continue working in all other areas of West Virginia and North Carolina, where we are making significant progress.”</p>
<p>Ruby&#8217;s favorite three words to describe the pipeline regulatory process are &#8220;<a href="https://www.wvnews.com/theet/news/free/officials-pipeline-project-to-provide-big-boost-to-ncwv-mountain/article_0f013e27-9fb6-5e1e-a35a-6f0937c3e295.html" target="_blank">thorough and exhaustive,</a>&#8221; (Google &#8220;Aaron Ruby&#8221; and &#8220;thorough and exhaustive&#8221; if you don&#8217;t believe me). In fact, he thinks it&#8217;s been the most rigorous review of a <a href="https://www.alleghenymountainradio.org/update-acp-progress-aaron-ruby/" target="_blank">pipeline project ever at the state and federal leve</a>l.</p>
<p>Turns out though, the reviews don&#8217;t appear so fulsome once the courts start looking under the hood.</p>
<p>How much of a difference the courts will make when FERC and the agencies required to sign off on the pipelines seem free to sidestep their rulings remains to be seen.</p>
<p>But there is growing unease about how FERC approves pipeline projects amid evidence that the U.S. oil and gas industry <a href="https://www.publicintegrity.org/2017/07/17/20982/natural-gas-building-boom-fuels-climate-worries-enrages-landowners" target="_blank">is overbuilding capacity</a> because of the profit and risk incentives at work, <a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=398746" target="_blank">uniting some Republicans and Democrats in Congress</a>.  And the biggest case yet will also be heading to the 4th Circuit, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog/after-a-string-of-successful-legal-challenges-to-the-atlantic-coast-pipeline-new-suit-takes-aim-at-ferc-approval/" target="_blank">challenging FERC&#8217;s certificate for the ACP</a>, which underpins the entire project.</p>
<p>A ruling vacating that approval might be tough to get around.</p>

<p>Matt Waters, a former political consultant, is running for U.S. Senate; Joe Walton, a former chair of the Powhatan County Board of Supervisors, is running to represent the 7th district to the west and north of Richmond; Wells, a retail professional, is running in the 4th District, which stretches from the suburbs south and west of Richmond to Suffolk; and volunteer firefighter and IT professional Stevan Porter is running to represent Northern Virginia’s 11th District.</p>
<p>Most of the candidates aren’t projecting a win — <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/09/20/a-page-from-brats-2014-playbook-is-being-used-against-him-in-7th-district-race/" target="_blank">Walton thinks he has a shot</a> — but they hope this is the year the Libertarian Party solidifies a spot in Virginia politics. They’re placing their bets on Waters.</p>
<p>“It would be the biggest game changer in Virginia politics to happen in 100 years,” said Bo Brown, chair of the Virginia Libertarian Party.</p>
<p>Corey Stewart, Republican candidate for Senate, is divisive even within his own party. If Waters can get <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title24.2/chapter1/section24.2-101/" target="_blank">10 percent of the vote, the Libertarian Party would be closer to being recognized as a party</a>.</p>
<p>“It’s Corey Stewart that has to worry about the Libertarians,” said Quentin Kidd, director of the Judy Ford Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University. “It would be Republicans who come to vote because they want to vote in a district race, and they just don’t want to leave the Senate vote blank.”</p>
<p>Historically though, it&#8217;s been a tough slog for Libertarian candidates in statewide races.</p>
<p>Clifford Hyra, the party&#8217;s candidate for governor last year, took just 1.1 percent of the vote. Libertarian Robert Sarvis got 6.5 percent of the vote in the 2013 gubernatorial race that saw Terry McAuliffe eek out a win over from Ken Cuccinelli.</p>
<p>Even so, one analyst told The Daily Beast that Sarvis&#8217; performance was <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/libertarian-robert-sarvis-drew-record-high-votes-in-virginia" target="_blank">the best by a third-party in the South in more than 40 years.</a></p>
<p>When Sarvis ran the next year in the Senate race contested by Mark Warner and Ed Gillespie, however, <a href="http://historical.elections.virginia.gov/candidates/view/Mark-Robert-Warner" target="_blank">he took just 2.4 percent of the vote.  </a></p>
<h3>&#8216;Party of the People&#8217;</h3>
<p>The Libertarian Party of Virginia formed in 1971 and calls itself the “Party of the People.”</p>
<p>Gary Johnson, a formerly Republican governor from New Mexico, may be Libertarianism&#8217;s most recognizable face as a result of his 2012 and 2016 presidential runs. <a href="https://www.lcsun-news.com/story/news/politics/2018/08/14/gary-johnson-official-enters-new-mexico-senate-race/992429002/" target="_blank">Johnson is now running for a U.S. senate seat in New Mexico</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike Democrats and Republicans, the Libertarian Party doesn’t have official platforms for most social issues. It focuses instead on a small government and deregulation, <a href="https://lpvirginia.org/war-on-drugs/" target="_blank">including ending the war on drugs</a>. And <a href="https://lpvirginia.org/environment/" target="_blank">it sees enhancement of private property rights and the repealing of laws that limit corporate liability</a> as the best way to protect the environment.</p>
<p>“We’re trying to do what’s best for individuals,” Brown said. “That’s our focus. It’s not on politics, it’s not on some power construct.”</p>
<p>In 2008, the Libertarian Party of Virginia planned to run a candidate in every congressional district, but three failed to make the ballot. Candidates must collect 1,000 signatures to be on ballots, an easy feat for candidates in major parties. That year was a banner year for the party, and they haven’t run that many candidates in state races since, Brown said.</p>
<p>Virginia’s Libertarians running for office this year agree on some issues: The national debt needs to be reduced, all four said, the immigration system needs to give people a legal route into the country and criminal justice systems need an array of adjustments, including sentencing reform.</p>
<p>They all also believe Congress has to be a better check on executive powers in the federal government.</p>
<p>Wells, a Navy veteran, is running against Democratic incumbent U.S. Rep. Donald McEachin and Republican Ryan Adams. He thinks the executive branch often oversteps when dealing with defense issues.</p>
<p>“We have very few checks against use of military force,” Wells said. “That means we have thousands of Virginians serving overseas right now in places that we’re not even talking about anymore.”</p>
<p>Walton, a former Powhatan County Board of Supervisors chairman, thinks checking the executive branch is more important than ever.</p>
<p>“The fact that the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2018/08/08/devin-nunes-audio-protecting-trump-rosenstein-impeachment-timing/943636002/" target="_blank">House is looking for ways to protect the president</a> is stunning,” he said. “I don’t know how and why a member of Congress would cede such authority to them.”</p>
<p>Libertarian candidates don’t necessarily share views on social issues. All of Virginia’s Libertarian candidates this year support Second Amendment rights, but they&#8217;re split on abortion: Porter, who once attended seminary to become a priest, is pro-life, and so is Waters.</p>
<p>But the party’s focus isn’t on social issues — Porter said libertarians are often “fiscally conservative and socially inclusive.&#8221;  They prefer to talk about economic policies to reduce the national debt and keep money in the hands of the voters.</p>
<p>Money means freedom, said Waters, a self-identified former Republican. He has some of the most extreme economic ideas of the four Libertarian candidates running this year.</p>
<p>Waters said he wants to eliminate the federal income tax and get rid of the Internal Revenue Service. On his website, Waters also suggests<a href="https://mattwaters.com/issue/civil-liberties/" target="_blank"> getting rid of the Drug Enforcement Administration</a> and <a href="https://mattwaters.com/issue/foreign-policy/" target="_blank">reducing the size of the military.</a></p>
<p>“It’s a stretch, I know, but I want to stretch,” he said. If elected, he wants to get on the Senate Finance Committee and then the IRS subcommittee to get started on some of his ideas.</p>
<p>“I believe in maximizing your liberty,” Waters said. “You can do whatever you want to do as long as you don’t hurt me or someone else. You have radical freedom but you also have radical responsibility.”</p>

																						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-size:12px;"></p><p>The fraught debate over medical aid in dying —or what some opponents refer to as physician-assisted suicide — has landed in Virginia.</p>
<p>The state&#8217;s Joint Commission on Health Care just completed a <a href="http://jchc.virginia.gov/5.%20Staff%20Report.%20Medical%20Aid%20in%20Dying%20for%20JCHC%209.18.18%20mtg-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> on the issue, at the request of Del. Kaye Kory, D-Fairfax, which is currently up for public comment until Oct. 15.</p>
<p>And depending on how the commission votes, Kory said she may file a bill to authorize the practice in Virginia for this upcoming General Assembly session.</p>
<p>Aid in dying refers to a patient with terminal illness and less than six months to live obtaining lethal drugs through a physician to end his or her life. The patient must be over 18 and have a sound state of mind when making the decision. It is authorized in Washington, D.C. and seven states: Oregon, Washington, Montana, Vermont, California, Colorado and Hawaii.</p>
<p>For those in favor of the practice, such as the national advocacy group <a href="https://www.compassionandchoices.org/" target="_blank">Compassion &amp; Choices</a>, it simply boils down to giving patients with a fatal disease an option for a more peaceful death on their own terms.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a decision that every person should be able to make,&#8221; said Maria Spencer, regional campaign and outreach manager with Compassion &amp; Choices. &#8220;We support adults having the ability to make those end-of-life decisions for themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kory said she believes having the ability to choose how you are going to die makes a difference, especially for terminal patients with less than six months to live, who must otherwise wait to die.</p>
<p>For opponents, though, such as the Virginia Catholic Conference, aid in dying simply boils down to suicide, which executive director Jeffrey Caruso said the government should not promote.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the state were to legalize assisted suicide, that would be doing a number of things that would be very harmful,&#8221; Caruso said. &#8220;It would be breaking our trust in doctors — their role is to heal, not to kill.&#8221;</p>
<p>He argued that the state should be considering ways to improve access to hospice and palliative care and developing better ways to treat pain.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the answer,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is not to end the lives of patients.&#8221;</p>
<p>Advocates for the practice, though, argue that terminal patients are already dying of an irreversible and untreatable disease. They must be rational and able to make their own decisions in order to be prescribed the drugs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hospice is definitely a good support system, but it doesn&#8217;t allow you to choose anything about dying, except if you don&#8217;t want to take your medication anymore,&#8221; Kory said. &#8220;And that might be as physically and mentally painful as living with whatever it is that is causing you to die.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a lukewarm reception for the practice among lawmakers when the report was presented to the Joint Commission on Health Care on Tuesday. Some raised the possibility that physicians might be wrong, for example, in giving a patient six months to live.</p>
<p>Del. Riley Ingram, R-Chesterfield, said his brother-in-law was given just months to live seven years ago, but is still alive and doing well.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I had to vote right now, I&#8217;d vote to not do anything,&#8221; he said, referencing one of the policy options before the commission: making no changes to Virginia laws.</p>
<p>Spencer said that in states where medical aid in dying has been authorized, patients must have a confirmed diagnosis from two doctors.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not an overnight process,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There are steps that go into making the request and all of this is written in statute, so it&#8217;s a lengthy process that people have to go through to make sure they get this medication, and then they make the decision about when and if they choose to use the medication.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kory said she has not decided yet if she will file aid-in-dying legislation this year. She said it will depend on a number of factors, including whether or not the Joint Commission on Health Care decides to vote to recommend legislation during its November meeting.</p>
<p>But even if she doesn&#8217;t file a bill this year, she said she sees the Joint Commission&#8217;s report as the beginning of important dialogue on a subject that doesn&#8217;t get much attention.</p>
<p>Spencer said her group sees this as part of an ongoing conversation, and even if legislation isn&#8217;t passed this General Assembly session or even filed in the first place, Compassion &amp; Choices members in Virginia will continue the push. Some states, she added, take years to pass the legislation.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a marathon, not a sprint,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And staff at the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission think it’s time for the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Authority and Virginia Lottery to be the subjects of audits to gauge their efficiency and evaluate management. Staff suggested it to the JLARC topic selection subcommittee for consideration this past week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They’re big agencies and they produce a fair amount of revenue the state relies on,” Senior Associate Director Justin Brown said. “I think it would be timely to look at them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JLARC could begin studying ABC and the Lottery in 2020, Brown said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The JLARC lawmakers will decide if the two agencies are added to the study queue. The <a href="http://jlarc.virginia.gov/about.asp" target="_blank">commission</a> is made up of nine members of the House of Delegates, five from the House Appropriations Committee, and five members of the Senate, including two from the Senate Finance Committee. Delegates are appointed by the speaker of the House, and senators by the Senate Rules Committee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The commission already has assignments for next year which includes studies of the Office of the State Inspector General, Virginia Employment Commission, Office of the Attorney General and Department of Game and Inland Fisheries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JLARC is a nonpartisan research commission that was created in 1973 and finished its first report in 1975. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many legislators come up with study topics from constituent concerns or ongoing policy discussions, Brown said. This year, JLARC was tasked to complete audits on the<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/09/10/study-finds-department-of-elections-fails-to-help-local-registrars-subject-to-political-influence/" target="_blank"> Department of Elections</a>, inmate health care costs, the foster care program and the Department of Professional and Occupational Regulation.</span></p>
<p>They also have some standing responsibilities, like a <a href="http://jlarc.virginia.gov/econ-development.asp" target="_blank">regular look at economic development incentive programs.</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JLARC staff can also recommend study topics, particularly those that haven’t been examined before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s how staff landed on ABC and the Lottery, Brown said. Staff also suggested other departments and agencies that haven&#8217;t been studied in years or at all: The Virginia Housing Development Authority, <a href="http://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt251.pdf" target="_blank">which was last studied in 2000</a>, the court system and the Department of Juvenile Justice.</span></p>
<p>The commission and staff would work together to figure out the scope of new studies, but staff had a comprehensive study in mind when it suggested ABC and the Lottery, Brown said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ABC includes a retail operation that sells alcohol through state-owned stores and online, as well as an enforcement division that oversees licensing and alcohol sales and investigates and prosecute a range of criminal offenses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agency makes money through taxes on beer, wine and liquor, violation penalties and license fees. </span></p>
<p>ABC&#8217;s gross sales increased to $940.1 million, up $42.5 million over the previous year, while profits rose to $171 million, a jump of $6 million,<a href="https://www.abc.virginia.gov/library/about/pdfs/2017ar.pdf?la=en" target="_blank"> according the agency&#8217;s annual report</a>. Combined with state and general sales taxes, as well as wine and beer taxes, ABC sent what it called &#8220;an all-time high&#8221; of $449 million to Virginia’s general fund.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lottery sold its first ticket in 1988 and has grown to contributes more than half a billion dollars to public education every year.</span></p>
<p>Last year, the Lottery contributed $606 million to education funding, which is dispersed to school systems through the Department of Education, said Lottery spokesperson John Hagerty.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State auditors check the agency’s finances every year, Hagerty said. JLARC studied pieces of the Lottery’s operations in at least one study in the 1990s, Hagerty said, but didn’t know when or the scope of the study.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JLARC’s studies look for ways to improve operations in state department, which often translates into saving money, Brown said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its inception, JLARC staff estimates they’ve saved the state more than a billion dollars, Brown said. The commission did extensive work on the retirement system in the 1990s, which prompted some changes, and</span><a href="http://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt127.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Virginia’s Rainy Day Fund was an idea that originated in a JLARC study.</span></a></p>

(Image via Buckingham County Board of Supervisors) </p><p>BUCKINGHAM — Scores of people came out Tuesday night against a proposed compressor station in rural Buckingham County for Dominion Energy&#8217;s Atlantic Coast Pipeline.</p>
<p>The public hearing, held by the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, was intended to solicit input on a draft air quality permit to construct and operate a 54,000-horsepower natural gas compressor station in Buckingham but often strayed into a referendum on the entire controversial project.</p>
<p>“Please remember that natural gas is a very clean and safe energy product that can provide a secure energy future for all of Virginia,” Prince Edward County resident John Arsenault told the DEQ panel. Freeda Cathcart, an activist from Roanoke, countered that &#8220;there is no market need for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline.”</p>
<p>One of only three compressor stations along the pipeline’s 600-mile route, the proposed Buckingham station has drawn special criticism because of its location in the historically African-American community of Union Hill. According to the Southern Environmental Law Center, which has fought the project, 83 percent of the 199 residents within a one-mile radius of the station’s 65-acre site are people of color.</p>
<p>“Beyond the overarching concerns with the pipeline itself, we’re really concerned about the environmental justice issues,” said David Neal, an attorney with SELC.</p>
<p>Essential components of any natural gas pipeline, compressor stations increase the pressure needed to transport natural gas over long distances. In doing so, however, they emit pollutants such as nitrogen oxide, carbon and methane, particularly during “blowdowns,” when all gas in the station is vented, and can produce major noise.</p>

<p>“This thing is opposed in our community because of the disruption and what it means to our community,” said the Rev. Paul Wilson, pastor of Union Hill Baptist Church and an outspoken opponent of the compressor station. “There have been too many things that the industry has done that has not been truly representative and fair to communities such as ours.”</p>
<p>Ruby Laury, a member of the Friends of Buckingham group that has mobilized in response to the pipeline project, put it more bluntly: “You people have looked over us as if we don’t exist.”</p>
<p>The environmental justice concerns raised Tuesday night were not isolated calls.</p>
<p>Last month, the Virginia Advisory Council on Environmental Justice, a board established by former Gov. Terry McAuliffe last year, recommended that the Atlantic Coast Pipeline’s Clean Water Act certification be rescinded and that all further permits for the project be delayed “to ensure that predominantly poor, indigenous, brown and/or black communities do not bear an unequal burden of environmental pollutants and life-altering disruptions.”</p>
<p>Democratic congressional candidate Leslie Cockburn, who is running to represent the 5th District, which includes all of Buckingham County, called the compressor station &#8220;immoral&#8221; and said &#8220;Dominion has no business putting a massive compressor station in this community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her opponent, GOP candidate Denver Riggleman, <a href="http://www.timesvirginian.com/news/article_d73525c4-95d9-11e8-a09d-43848961da4e.html" target="_blank">has also opposed the pipeline, primarily because of eminent domain concerns.</a></p>
<p>Many of the more than 80 people who spoke Tuesday, however, disputed the idea that the area surrounding the proposed site would be negatively affected by a compressor station. Dominion has said the compressor station must be sited near the existing Transco pipeline, which the Atlantic Coast Pipeline would connect to in Buckingham.</p>
<p>David Johnson, former chief deputy director of Virginia DEQ and former director of the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation, told the hearing panel that he was “astonished at how stringent the requirements were.”</p>
<p>“This is a minor permit, but it has all the makings of a major permit,” he said. “The DEQ has really gone above and beyond, or, as some would say, really got blood out of the turnip on this one.”</p>
<p>Despite a heavy police presence that included three members of the Buckingham County Sheriff’s Department and about a dozen Virginia State Police troopers, the gathering proved peaceful and largely uneventful.</p>
<p>Besides a few early outbreaks of applause and hissing, the hearing panel’s prohibition of vocal reactions from the audience was heeded by attendees, who signaled their approval of speakers’ testimony by raising both hands in the air and silently waving them back and forth.</p>
<p>Virginia State Police Sgt. C. W. Owen said that the turnout of troopers was at the request of local law enforcement and was intended “to make certain that this is a peaceful night and to make certain everyone has the opportunity to be heard.”</p>
<p>DEQ will continue to accept public comments on the proposed compressed station permit, which ultimately has to be approved by the State Air Pollution Control Board, until Sept. 21.</p>
<p>“The State Air Pollution Control Board has the power to deny this permit and send Dominion back to the drawing board,” Billy Davies, pipelines community outreach coordinator at the Sierra Club Virginia Chapter, said in a statement Wednesday. “The overwhelming opposition from last night’s hearing shows the need to take a hard look at the devastating impacts this fracked gas compressor station will have on human health and the environment.”</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury - Sept. 11, 2018)</p><p>House Republicans said in a court filing Wednesday that they&#8217;re in the &#8220;advanced stages&#8221; of preparing a redistricting plan, rebuffing Democratic leaders who have said lawmakers had reached an impasse and called for the courts to take over the process.</p>
<p>In the filing, they write that their goal in any redistricting plan is to avoid pairing any Republican or Democratic incumbents and to avoid substantially altering the partisan makeup of any competitive districts.</p>
<p>The filing offers the first public glimpse of how Republicans, currently holding onto their majority by a single seat, hope to address a court order requiring the General Assembly to redraw <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/court-strikes-down-virginia-house-districts-as-racial-gerrymandering/2018/06/26/4e953752-7993-11e8-80be-6d32e182a3bc_story.html?utm_term=.06c303a371f1" target="_blank">11 districts that federal judges have ruled are racially gerrymandered</a>.</p>
<p>Republicans, who are also appealing the case to the U.S. Supreme Court, heaped criticism last month on a Democratic proposal they said would have made five Republican-held seats safe for Democrats and drawn two GOP delegates out of their districts.</p>
<p>Democrats responded that because black voters had been illegally packed into districts, it stood to reason that packing them back out would negatively impact adjacent Republican districts.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is impossible to reverse unconstitutional racial gerrymandering – designed in 2011 to protect the Republican majority – without making the districts more competitive,&#8221; said House Democratic Caucus Executive Director Trevor Southerland in a statement Wednesday. &#8220;Not only is that simple logic, but it is fair, constitutional, and democratic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Likewise, redistricting experts questioned how Republicans expected to comply with the court order without impacting competitive districts.</p>
<p>&#8220;This text reads, to me, like the General Assembly is trying to replace a racial gerrymander with a partisan gerrymander,&#8221; said Ben Williams, a legal analyst at the Princeton Gerrymandering Project, which advocates for nonpartisan redistricting.</p>
<p>He said if Republicans go that route, their only option would be to move black voters into adjacent districts that have either strong Democratic margins or strong Republican margins. And in the case of the strong Democratic districts, only those districts not protected by the Voting Rights Act.</p>
<p>&#8220;Personally, I have no idea if drawing a map which complies with the court order without improving Dems&#8217; prospects in this part of the state is even possible, but I would bet a lot of money that Speaker Cox, his caucus, and their consultants are doing everything they can right now to figure out how,&#8221; Williams said.</p>
<p>Gov. Ralph Northam and Democratic House Majority Leader David Toscano released a statement Friday urging House Majority Leader Kirk Cox to let the court take over, arguing that the debate had stalled and calling it critical to have new districts in place by next year&#8217;s elections.</p>
<p>Attorney General Mark Herring took things a step farther Monday, filing a motion alleging that Republicans had made clear they were unwilling to participate in a good faith redistricting effort and asking the court to forgo an Oct. 30 deadline for action and begin drawing the lines themselves.</p>
<p>As evidence, Herring cited two letters that Toscano sent sent to Cox asking him to convene a special session, which Democrats said received no response. Herring also cited the lack of action at the special session Northam convened at the end of last month.</p>
<p>The judges hearing the case responded to Herring&#8217;s motion with a court order Tuesday requiring them to provide a detailed account of their redistricting efforts to date.</p>
<p>Enter the Republican&#8217;s filing today, in which they pushed back hard at the notion they&#8217;ve been unwilling to come to the table and speculation that they&#8217;re attempting to run out the clock in an effort to avoid having to put new lines in place by next year&#8217;s elections, which would be the last House elections before the legislature redraws the districts following the 2020 Census.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p>In a sharp letter to Democratic leaders that Republicans attached to their motion, Cox wrote off Democrats&#8217; written overtures as political posturing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nearly 30 years in Virginia politics has taught me that when you want to get something done you pick up the phone and ask for a meeting, but when you want to play politics you send a letter and give it to the press,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;The fact that we’ve all done this, myself and my party included, makes it all the more true.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the past 45 days, I have received four letters — three from Delegate Toscano and now one from the governor. All were released to the press moments after I received them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cox said arguments that Republicans never responded ignored private meetings and conversations that followed, which Republicans listed in their response to the court. Cox wrote that the meetings went nowhere:</p>
<p>&#8220;Our private efforts have been rebuffed numerous times, yet you continue to state publicly that we are not interested in pursuing a remedial plan. That’s just not true. If you are serious about working on a remedial plan, then let’s work on a remedial plan. I am willing to reconvene the House to continue deliberations on House Bill 7001 and begin working on a genuinely fair remedial map.&#8221;</p>
<p>Democrats scoffed, saying Cox hadn&#8217;t reached out until after Herring filed his motion asking the court to take over Monday.</p>
<p>“Apparently, the Republicans believe that listing the various dates when they might have had short discussions with Democrats about redistricting constitutes ‘collaborating,’” said Southerland. “In fact, the Republicans have never offered anything concrete about their plan or revisions to the Democratic plan.”</p>
<p>Republicans, meanwhile, said the discussions never went anywhere because Democrats weren&#8217;t willing to engage.</p>
<p>Cox said in a statement and in the court filing that the House elections committee will meet Sept. 27 to formally resume redistricting discussions between lawmakers.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shafts of sunlight filtering through the foliage illuminate the final resting places of the thousands of black men and women interred there since it opened in 1897. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For years, East End — and its larger counterpart, Evergreen Cemetery — were neglected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was only through efforts of determined community volunteers and families of the deceased that the privately-owned cemeteries and the ugly Virginia history they bore witness to — when segregation by race separated Virginians from the cradle to the grave — weren&#8217;t left completely to weeds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+sum+HB1547" target="_blank">A bill that passed in 2017</a> dedicated state dollars to help maintain black cemeteries in the care of qualified charitable organizations, including the pair of Richmond cemeteries. And <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+ful+CHAP0818" target="_blank">a second piece of legislation</a> that passed this year broadened eligibility for the funding to anyone who owned one of the cemeteries, of which there are potentially hundreds of others across the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both were spearheaded by Del. Delores McQuinn, D-Richmond. Supporters say the laws mark a big shift in how the state, long keen on providing money to maintain graves of Confederate soldiers, supports the preservation of African-American history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As Evergreen and East End cemeteries — and their present condition — show, African-American history has been dismissed for years in this state,” she said.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;TRULY IMMORAL AND UNCONSCIONABLE&#8217;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2017 bill, which sailed through both the House and Senate with unanimous support and was signed by former Gov. Terry McAuliffe, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">set strict qualifying guidelines for burial grounds to receive the funds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cemeteries must have been established before 1900, and had to be owned and operated by a government entity or 501c3 nonprofit organization.</span></p>
<p>There are more than 150 historic black cemeteries in central Virginia alone, according to researcher and author Lynne Rainville, an anthropological archaeologist and an associate dean at Sweet Briar College. Rainville detailed her years of studying black graveyards in her 2014 book “Hidden History: African-American Cemeteries in Central Virginia.”</p>
<p>“Most gravestones compress a life story into a name and date of birth and death, but … an individual’s passage [is] part of a larger story – a story of families and neighborhoods, successes and failures,&#8221; <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Hidden_History.html?id=mHpHAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank">Rainville writes.</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eligible cemeteries can get $5 per grave, monument or marker to interred individuals who &#8220;lived at any time between 1800 and 1900,&#8221; the law reads</span><b>.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia still subsidizes the care of Confederate graves, markers, monuments and memorials <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title10.1/chapter22/section10.1-2211/" target="_blank">per state law</a>. In 2017, McAuliffe said it was &#8220;truly immoral and unconscionable that we would spend money to honor the Confederate dead without making an equal investment to preserve our historic black cemeteries.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And in 2017, displays of intolerance and racism, including the deadly Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">underscored the importance of expanding and preserving Virginia’s historical narratives, including providing state funds for the upkeep of black burial grounds and remembrance spaces, McQuinn said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think Virginia lawmakers looked at that, and believed we are obligated to do what&#8217;s right, under these circumstances,&#8221; said McQuinn, who has led volunteer groups in clearing brush and debris from Evergreen Cemetery since the 1990s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Trying to address the vegetation issue … was a monumental undertaking, and it was overwhelming. It sort of leaves you walking away feeling like, ‘How can we overcome this?’” she said.</span></p>
<p><strong>&#8216;I&#8217;D NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS&#8217;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That challenge is one John Shuck has done his best to meet for the past five years. A longtime volunteer and retired IT analyst, Shuck coordinates groups of volunteers to work inside East End Cemetery and in past years volunteered at Evergreen Cemetery. Every weekend and several weekdays, Shuck leads teams of students, church groups and other volunteers in pulling weeds, clearing kudzu vines and hauling away branches from the grave sites. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m from the Midwest, and all the cemeteries I’d seen were pretty well-maintained,” says Shuck, who moved to Richmond in 2001. Gesturing to the overgrown, shady back sections of the graveyard, he says, “I’d never seen anything like this.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shuck’s group, </span><a href="https://friendsofeastend.com/" target="_blank"><b>Friends of East End Cemetery</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, uploads information they uncover on the tombstones to FindAGrave.com.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “It’s an effort to tell these stories and find out who these people were before they are completely lost,” Shuck said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">African-American veterans, doctors and businessmen lie in East End Cemetery, among thousands of men and women who contributed to the fabric of late 19</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">-century Richmond. In neighboring Evergreen, Maggie Lena Walker, civil rights activist, businesswoman and the first black woman to charter a bank in America, is buried. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, too, is John Mitchell, Jr., the venerable journalist, anti-lynching activist and editor of The Richmond Planet newspaper. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitchell’s nephew and namesake, John Mitchell, says at least four of his family members rest in Evergreen. The state funds for the cemeteries&#8217; care come “better late than never,” he says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My father and uncle paid for someone to take care of the cemetery back in the 1960s, so I think a lot of us feel that it’s about time the state decided these spaces were worthy of sustained support.”</span></p>
<p><strong>&#8216;WE NEED TO HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE&#8217;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since HB 1547 was enacted last year, other historic black cemeteries across the state have become eligible for funding as well, including the Mount Calvary Cemetery Complex in Portsmouth and the African-American Burial Ground for the Enslaved at Belmont in Loudoun County. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like the cemeteries in Richmond, these graveyards qualified for funding because they are owned by nonprofit organizations, as mandated in the original bill, though <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+oth+HB284FER122+PDF" target="_blank">the changes enacted this year</a> open up funding to any individual or locality to the list of organizations that can receive the maintenance money.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://enrichmond.org/evergreen-cemetery/background/" target="_blank"><b>Enrichmond</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a nonprofit that supports the City of Richmond’s Department of Parks, Recreation, and Community Facilities, acquired Evergreen Cemetery in 2017 and is also poised to gain ownership of East End. </span></p>
<p>Evergreen was previously owned by UK Corp, a private business headed by <a href="http://richmondfreepress.com/news/2016/sep/02/woodland-evergreen-cemeteries-sale/" target="_blank">Isaiah Entzminger</a>. The same company owns Woodland Cemetery, where tennis legend Arthur Ashe is buried.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enrichmond in 2016 </span><a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/local/city-of-richmond/foundation-approves-grant-for-historically-african-american-cemeteries/article_95beec0d-bf67-5ad5-aa21-94294fce783c.html" target="_blank"><b>received a $400,000 grant</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Virginia Outdoors Foundation and together, the organizations are working to place Evergreen and East End under a conservation easement, to protect them from future development.<strong> </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brian Palmer, a multimedia journalist and filmmaker, has worked to clean and clear at least five acres of East End Cemetery alongside his wife, Erin, since 2014. Palmer remains concerned about the role nonprofits like Enrichmond play in not only reclaiming the burial grounds from nature, but also reclaiming the history there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If all of this state funding is being directed or given to a private entity, there should be both transparency and accountability,” Palmer said. “The volunteers, the descendants of those interred, we need to have a seat at the table, and to be able to continue the work we’ve been doing for years to restore dignity to these cemeteries.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitchell agrees, and says the main goal of the nonprofits or agencies that own historic African-American cemeteries across Virginia should be to “work directly [toward] the collective vision of the descendants of the people who have been buried there, and their communities.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new state money will assist Enrichmond in returning Evergreen, and eventually East End, to places of quiet reflection and respect, befitting the people buried in both cemeteries, says John Sydnor, Enrichmond’s executive director. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We worked for over six years to acquire Evergreen, because we feel it is vital to understand the history of these places. They tell the story of the city, and a part of the story that has been left out for generations,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added the nonprofit&#8217;s work has &#8220;relied on community guidance and input on how … the restoration process should happen.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “We continue to value these voices, and we are showing that,&#8221; Sydnor said.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To that end, Enrichmond has formed a 25-member </span><a href="https://enrichmond.org/2018/07/descendant-family-community-guiding-restoration-of-historic-evergreen-cemetery/" target="_blank"><b>advisory team</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of longtime cemetery volunteers, descendants and community leaders to crystallize and implement that vision at Evergreen and East End. The group meets monthly at Virginia Union University.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Formed in October 2017, Mitchell and Shuck are part of the team, which includes descendants like Johnny Mickens III, the great-grandson of Maggie Walker. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to Shuck, Veronica Davis, author and former director of black cemetery restoration volunteer group Virginia Roots, contributes to the team, as well as representatives from the Black History Museum &amp; Cultural Center of Virginia, the Maggie L. Walker National Park Service site, and other organizations central to Richmond’s black community. Ted Maris-Wolf, who became caretaker of Evergreen Cemetery in 2017, leads the team. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Enrichmond may be the legal owner of Evergreen, and may become the legal owner of East End, but these are sacred sites that belong to communities in Richmond, and to the historical memories of those communities,” says Maris-Wolf, who formerly oversaw research and historical interpretation at Colonial Williamsburg. “The volunteers — including John Shuck, Friends of East End, [longtime Evergreen Cemetery volunteer] Marvin Harris — and the family members have taught us so much. We could not do this work without them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Janine Bell founded Elegba Folklore Society 28 years ago to elevate African and African-American culture in Richmond. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bell says she joined Enrichmond’s advisory team to ensure Evergreen and East End Cemeteries would be restored with “sensitivity and respect” for the wishes of the descendant community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the state’s new funding stream for historic black burial grounds is “encouraging,” Bell says that the effort to newly illuminate these histories will not be complete unless the organizations entrusted with state money to oversee the cemeteries, collaborate with existing volunteers and those descended from the dead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The reality is, and we see this with Enrichmond, these nonprofits and entities may have the monetary resources but not necessarily the cultural resources to complete this mission,&#8221; Bell said. &#8220;We have to work together. It is imperative that any organization getting these [state] funds understands that the descendant community knows what’s best for the places their ancestors rest.” </span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Shaun Brown, an independent running to represent the 2nd Congressional District in the eastern part of the state, will be removed from the ballot, a judge in Richmond Circuit Court ruled Wednesday.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawyers for the Virginia Democratic Party asked the court to take remove her because the petitions she submitted to run as an independent included scores of forged signatures and other mistakes, <a href="https://pilotonline.com/news/government/politics/virginia/article_5d65ccbe-aaef-11e8-a268-eb3341d186e1.html" target="_blank">like Brown listing a place that doesn&#8217;t exist as her address.</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The case highlighted the limitations of the Department of Elections in guarding against fraud on the petitions candidates file to get on the ballot. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State staff did what they could, said lawyer Jeffrey Breit, who argued the case for the Democratic Party. But if fake signatures hadn’t been revealed by voters, it’s likely the state wouldn’t have caught it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do we need some fix of the Virginia election laws that would allow them to investigate once they think a fraud has happened? Possibly, but that’s for the legislature to decide,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hundreds of the forged signatures were submitted by five current and former staffers or volunteers for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown&#8217;s Republican opponent, U.S. Rep. Scott Taylor, in an effort to siphon votes from Elaine Luria, the Democratic nominee. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_1120" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:240px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-1120 size-medium" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Taylor-official-photo-240x300.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="300" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Taylor-official-photo-240x300.jpg 240w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Taylor-official-photo-768x960.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Taylor-official-photo-696x870.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Taylor-official-photo-336x420.jpg 336w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Taylor-official-photo.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  U.S. Rep. Scott Taylor, a Republican from Virginia Beach. Photo via the U.S. House of Representatives.</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown challenged Taylor in 2016 as a Democrat and lost.</span></p>
<p>Taylor was subpoenaed, but didn&#8217;t appear in court. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond Circuit Court Judge Gregory Rupe allowed the order to be quashed because Congress is in session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taylor&#8217;s staffers all submitted affidavits instead of testifying on Wednesday, invoking their Fifth Amendment right to avoid answering questions about whether they knew the signatures were forged and if Taylor directed them to do it.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/08/07/prosecutor-requests-investigation-into-signatures-gathered-by-u-s-rep-scott-taylors-staff/" target="_blank">A separate criminal investigation</a> into the petitions is also under way.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rupe issued an order after a four-hour hearing to take Brown off the ballot. Voters would still have the option of writing her in as a candidate and Brown said she plans to appeal the decision to the Virginia Supreme Court.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rupe didn’t say how many signatures he thought were fraudulent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s no doubt in my mind that there are instances of forgery, perjury and out-and-out fraud,” he said. He also called Brown’s untraceable addresses “sophomoric mistakes.”</span></p>

Scott Taylor who collected signatures on behalf of Shaun Brown, enters the John Marshall Courthouse in Richmond on Wednesday. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury &#8211; Sept. 5, 2018)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, </span><a href="https://whro.org/radio/1778-taylor-campaign-workers-helped-put-shaun-brown-on-the-ballot-as-an-independent-candidate" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WHRO reported Taylor&#8217;s paid staffers worked to get Shaun Brown on the 2nd District ballot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Days later, the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7WRBqU8TB8&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wife of one of the men who supposedly signed the petition said her husband died before the petition was circulated</span></a>.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> State Del. Glenn Davis, R-Virginia Beach, appeared twice on the petitions — once with an incorrect address.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the weeks since then, dozens of other signatures were revealed as invalid, </span><a href="https://pilotonline.com/news/government/politics/local/article_4c6ddd6a-a582-11e8-86da-7fb21d4fb93f.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">belonging to dead people </span></a>or people who moved out of the state years ago.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In total, lawyers for the state Democratic Party estimated 493 signatures shouldn’t be counted for Brown’s inclusion on the ballot, according to a Sept. 3 court filing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This case involves one of the most brazen and far-reaching efforts to manipulate an election by fraud in the commonwealth’s history,” lawyers wrote in a Sept. 3 court filing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an affidavit filed before Wednesday’s hearing, Department of Elections Director David Nichols said the state stopped confirming signatures once they counted 1,030 that appeared acceptable. Brown needed to get 1,000 signatures to be on the ballot. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later, Nichols examined 255 more signatures that seemed to pass muster, bringing Brown’s total to 1,193. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Nichols and his department don&#8217;t have the means to check for fraud or fix it, lawyers pointed out.</span></p>
<p>If the department noticed something that looked like fraud, it would be referred to a local commonwealth&#8217;s attorney, said Chris Piper, commissioner of the Department of Elections.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/admincode/title1/agency20/chapter50/" target="_blank">Virginia&#8217;s administrative code</a>, there is no explicit mention of fraud when it comes to qualifying candidates — and that&#8217;s the problem Breit said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There’s nothing in our code, so we had to go to court,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They wanted the court to say fraud had been committed so they could correct it. They didn’t feel like under the laws they could correct it themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The law is pretty clear. There can be no investigation from the Department of Elections once they certify it. They don’t have the staff, they don’t have the means and they don’t have the budget to go out and check signatures.”</span></p>

Delegates voted Monday to pass legislation that will provide protections for residents evicted from assisted living facilities in Virginia. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury - Aug. 30, 2018)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They came, they argued, they called each other names and didn’t agree on a new map.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats put forward a map to to fix unconstitutionally-drawn voting districts, though lawmakers on both sides called it a political power grab and a hypocritical response to Republican gerrymandering, among other critiques lodged against the proposal during the first day of a special session to fix the districts.</span></p>
<p>It highlighted the conflict that can arise when politicians are in charge of drawing their own voting maps.<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/08/30/explained-what-went-wrong-with-the-11-disputed-house-districts-including-a-republican-delegates-murky-recollection-in-court/" target="_blank"> Virginia has until Oct. 30 to fix 11 House of Delegates districts the U.S. District Court said were racially gerrymandered,</a> packing too many black voters into the areas to dilute their vote.</p>
<p>The map is currently in the House Privileges and Elections committee, where Republicans and Democrats could hash out details of a mutually favorable plan, though the committee adjourned Thursday without scheduling another meeting.</p>
<p>Even before the committee met, House Majority Leader Del. Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, said the Democrats put forth a map that gave any discussion an &#8220;inauspicious start.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans called Democrats&#8217; map hypocritical because it would <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog/house-democrats-proposed-redistricting-plan-targets-five-vulnerable-republicans/" target="_blank">turn five current Republican seats more Democratic and strengthen four current Democratic districts</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are dealing with the hand that we’ve been dealt,” Democratic Party Caucus Chair Charniele Herring said. “So yes, we took it upon ourselves to start moving because something needed to be done. Before you cast a stone over here, check yourself, please.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Steve Heretick, a Portsmouth Democrat, called it &#8220;gerrymandering in response to gerrymandering&#8221; and said he strongly supports an independent, nonpartisan redistricting process.</span></p>
<div>
<div>
<p>Advocates for nonpartisan redistricting came away from the first day of the session frustrated, though.</p>
<p>“It is clear to me and to us that the process currently that we’re working under is not working,&#8221; Sue Lewis, president of the League of Women Voters of Virginia, told the Privileges and Elections Committee.</p>
<p>“One side is waiting for relief from the courts, the other side came up with a very hastily drawn map without sharing it until today, pretty much. That doesn’t seem to be an optimum way to do this kind of work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lewis said it seemed obvious that the General Assembly would miss the deadline set by the court to draw new district lines.</p>
<p>“I’m really sorry that you weren’t able to come together and do something a little more meaningful today,&#8221; she said.</p>
</div>
<h3><strong>Citizen group steps in</strong></h3>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Redistricting advocates and experts said until Virginia takes the power of redrawing voting maps away from the legislature, legal and political battle will be inevitable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One Virginia 2021, a redistricting advocacy group that has pushed to change the way Virginia handles redistricting, announced on Thursday a citizen committee that will work on drafting a constitutional amendment to take the power of redrawing voting maps out of the hands of lawmakers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s clear that Virginia’s current process isn’t working,” said Executive Director Brian Cannon. “Virginia has to do better.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wyatt Durrette, a Richmond attorney and former state delegate from Fairfax County, is chairing the committee. He made it clear the group will not be making maps, and he’s not even sure as of now of what kind of process the committee will propose with their amendment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group includes college professors, retired lawmakers — including former Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli — and attorneys. They held their first</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> meeting at the same time the General Assembly convened for a special session on redistricting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Durrette, who ran for attorney general twice in the 1970s and governor in the 1980s, said he’s always been aware of gerrymandering, but it’s become a political weapon in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s only recently (gerrymandering) has been put on steroids with computer software,” he said. “You can do wonderful, great things with it, but it can also be subversive.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swapping which party is in charge of redistricting only gets you a different kind of gerrymandering, said Michael Li, senior counsel at the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/" target="_blank">Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Both parties, frankly, have used race in a convenient way to maximize their gain,” Li said. “Democrats have been perfectly willing to spread out African-Americans. They have incentive to unpack their voters.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Li pointed to Maryland and Illinois as examples of Democratic gerrymandering. In Maryland, Democratic leaders </span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/06/how-deep-blue-maryland-shows-redistricting-is-broken/531492/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">worked closely with consultants to edge out Republican seats and ensure a blue majority, according to court documents</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In Illinois, </span><a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Opinion/2011/0608/Democrats-revenge-in-2012-a-radical-Illinois-gerrymander" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats redrew maps in 2012 that packed Republican lawmakers into the same district or into left-leaning areas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neither of those examples are racial gerrymandering, which is what the court said Virginia did.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Racial gerrymandering has happened more in the South in the last decade than anywhere else, Li said. In addition to Virginia, there have been racial gerrymandering cases in </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/25/us/politics/supreme-court-texas-gerrymandering.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article217504240.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">North Carolina</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/three-southern-states-sued-over-racial-gerrymandering/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alabama, Georgia and Louisiana</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There have been numerous bills and resolutions in Virginia proposed by Democrats and Republicans- to </span><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=181&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sj25" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">craft a constitutional amendment to establish an independent redistricting commission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, define </span><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+sum+HJ5" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">clear standards for redrawing maps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and even some to </span><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+sum+SB534" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">allow voters to choose how to handle redistricting.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a <a href="https://wilder.vcu.edu/media/wilder/documents/R1_Sum2018_Wilder_public_policy_poll_electionFINAL.pdf" target="_blank">Virginia Commonwealth University Wilder school poll</a>, only 16 percent of Virginians wanted the General Assembly in charge of redistricting.  </span></p>

<p>But the long version is a bit more nuanced and involves two important protections for minority voters. The court ruled that Republicans ran afoul of one while trying to meet the intent of another.</p>
<p>And in the process, the judges said in their ruling that they didn’t believe the testimony offered by Republicans&#8217; star witness, Del. Chris Jones. Though Jones oversaw the 2011 House redistricting effort, the larger, concurrent process of redrawing legislative boundaries was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/politics/va-redistricting-deal-protects-incumbents-and-punishes-challengers-critics-say/2011/03/31/AFYE4pQC_story.html?utm_term=.69686dd630a7" target="_blank">widely supported by both parties as an incumbent protection plan</a>.</p>
<h4><strong>The <a href="https://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=false&amp;doc=100" target="_blank">Voting Rights Act</a> required Republicans to protect 12 majority-minority districts in the House of Delegates. </strong></h4>
<p>Under the act, the Republican-controlled House could not redistrict in a way that would dilute black voters’ ability to elect their preferred candidates in those 12 districts, all of which are in the Richmond-Petersburg area, Hampton Roads and Southside.</p>
<p>But they also couldn’t redraw lines based on the race of voters alone. That would be racial gerrymandering, and it’s a violation of the Equal Protection Clause, part of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p>In its ruling, the court wrote that: &#8220;By assigning voters to districts based on race, a state &#8216;engages in the offensive and demeaning assumption that voters of a particular race, because of their race, think alike, share the same political interests, and will prefer the same candidates at the polls.'&#8221;</p>
<p>The court ruled that&#8217;s exactly what the House did, setting a strict threshold of 55 percent for black voters in each of the districts.</p>
<p>And by going too far, the maps actually diluted black voters&#8217; voices by drawing them into the same districts from nearby contested districts.</p>
<h4><strong>How do you meet the goals of the Voting Rights Act without considering race?</strong></h4>
<p>Lawmakers can consider race. They just can’t set what the court called a “mechanical quota” that then takes precedent over traditional redistricting concerns such as uniting communities with shared interests, compactness, political affiliation and protecting voters.</p>
<p>And in fact, the court upheld one of the 12 challenged districts: the 75th in Southside represented by Del. Roslyn Tyler, D-Sussex.</p>
<p>In the case of that district, they ruled that Republican lawmakers had engaged in a district-specific analysis that led them to the conclusion that a 55-percent threshold was necessary to meet the goals of the Voting Rights Act.</p>
<p>Where lawmakers got into trouble is when they then took that 55-percent threshold and applied it to the 11 other protected districts.</p>
<p>The judges cited Democratic Del. Jennifer McClellan’s district in Richmond as an example of why a threshold shouldn’t have been uniformly enforced. With a district comprised of just 46-percent black voters, she was still reliably winning elections, suggesting the lower threshold didn’t threaten black voters&#8217; ability to elect representatives.</p>
<p>But the Republican plan nonetheless carved up her district to remove majority white precincts and include more majority black precincts to meet the 55 percent threshold.</p>
<h4><strong>Republicans insisted that race wasn’t the primary factor they used to draw the districts, but the court didn’t believe them. </strong></h4>
<p>In his testimony, Jones, the Republican who spearheaded the redistricting effort, and John Morgan, a consultant hired to help, offered a variety of district-by-district explanations in their defense.</p>
<p>In some cases, they testified that drawing lines that split precincts precisely between white and black neighborhoods were either coincidental or aimed at garnering political advantage.</p>
<p>The justices didn’t buy it: “We find that this explanation was not credible.”</p>
<p>In another instance, Jones testified that he spoke to incumbent delegates about what percentage of black voters was needed to avoid “retrogression” under the Voting Rights Act in an effort to show that they had conducted district-specific analysis necessary to set a racial threshold.</p>
<p>Again, the justices didn’t believe him: “Contrary to this contention, however, every member of the black caucus who testified stated that they never told Jones that a 55 percent (threshold) was required in their districts. McClellan further testified that she did not believe that a 55 percent (threshold) was necessary in (her district).”</p>
<p>And finally, the justices just didn’t like that Jones seemed to suddenly have a “murky recollection” of important topics he had previously testified about in detail.</p>
<p>“In light of Jones’ very poor memory at the second trial, as well as his inability to account for material inconsistencies in his testimony, we give little weight to Jones’ testimony regarding the reasons underlying the many changes made to district boundary lines,” they wrote.</p>
<h4><strong>Of course, as Republicans like to point out, a majority of Democrats supported the plan when it was put up for <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/politics/virginia-assembly-approves-new-legislative-maps/2011/04/07/AFRjhrxC_story.html?utm_term=.cddf573e838e" target="_blank">a vote in 2011</a>.</strong></h4>
<p>Among those who supported the plan: many of the majority-minority delegates.</p>
<p>Asked about that fact on Tuesday, House Minority Leader David Toscano, D-Charlottesville, said the constitutionality of the maps hadn’t been raised at the time.</p>
<p>“We didn’t have an issue,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This map has been declared unconstitutional. We as responsible legislators have there responsibility of fixing that problem.&#8221;</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury - July 26, 2018)</p><p>The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has allowed work to resume on nearly the entire length of the 300-mile Mountain Valley Pipeline, a decision that prompted <a href="https://www.ferc.gov/media/statements-speeches/lafleur/2018/08-29-18-lafleur.asp#.W4b9fehKhPY" target="_blank">two sitting FERC commissioners</a> to voice &#8220;significant concerns&#8221; about allowing construction &#8220;while required right-of-way and temporary use permits remain outstanding.&#8221;</p>
<p>The natural gas pipeline was being built between Wetzel County, W.Va.,  and Pittsylvania County before a<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/07/27/federal-appeals-court-vacates-mountain-valley-pipeline-approvals/" target="_blank"> federal court invalidated key approvals for the project</a> and FERC <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/08/03/mountain-valley-pipeline-construction-halted/" target="_blank">ordered a halt to construction</a>.</p>
<p>The project still does not have those approvals, but FERC has determined that &#8220;the protection of the environment along the project’s right-of-way is best served&#8221; by allow work to resume. The decision was preceded by an analysis sent last by the Bureau of Land Management to FERC of other pipeline route alternatives &#8220;that offer collocation opportunities across federal lands.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since the bureau determined &#8220;that the route previously approved by all federal agencies provides the greatest level of<br />
collocation for an alternative crossing that is also practical, the specific route of the project no longer seems in question,&#8221; FERC wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maintaining the status quo across non-federal lands while the Department of Agriculture’s Forest Service, the Army Corps of Engineers, and the (Bureau of Land Management) address the court’s instructions regarding federal lands would likely pose threats to plant and wildlife habitat and adjacent waterbodies as long-term employment of temporary erosion control measures would subject significant portions of the route to erosion and soil movement,&#8221; wrote Terry Turpin, director of FERC&#8217;s Office of Energy Projects. &#8220;Requiring immediate restoration of the entire right-of-way to pre-construction conditions would require significant additional construction activity, also causing further environmental impacts.&#8221;</p>
<p>A Mountain Valley Pipeline spokeswoman told the <a href="https://www.roanoke.com/news/local/work-on-mountain-valley-pipeline-allowed-to-resume/article_db970614-c261-59b3-8c7b-42ad0dcdcf58.html" target="_blank">Roanoke Times</a> that the move &#8220;confirms that MVP&#8217;s existing route minimizes impacts to sensitive species and environmental, cultural, and historic resources&#8221; in the national forest.</p>
<p>Pipeline opponents blasted the decision.</p>
<p>&#8220;FERC&#8217;s authorization does nothing to protect the environment as directed by the Fourth Circuit in its decision to vacate and remand the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management permits,&#8221; said Roberta Bondurant, co-chair of the Protect Our Water Heritage Rights Coalition and a landowner on Bent Mountain on the MVP route.  &#8220;It inflicts yet more environmental and economic harms on our communities. It&#8217;s a glaring example of the doublespeak that has been substituted for real environmental protection through a factually and legally unsupportable response to the Fourth Circuit ruling.&#8221;</p>
<p>A Sierra Club representative said it was akin to &#8220;letting a contractor build a house after their foundation has crumbled.&#8221;</p>
<p>But perhaps the most striking response to the decision came from the FERC commissioners, Cheryl LaFleur and Richard Glick. Both have said that neither the MVP nor the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, Dominion Energy&#8217;s larger project planned to carve through West Virginia, Virginia and North Carolina and also currently halted by FERC, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog/after-a-string-of-successful-legal-challenges-to-the-atlantic-coast-pipeline-new-suit-takes-aim-at-ferc-approval/" target="_blank">are in the public interest</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the future, when a court remands or vacates a required federal authorization following the issuance of a notice to proceed, we believe the decision regarding whether and how to proceed with the pipeline should be made by the commission rather than its staff,&#8221; wrote LaFleur and Glick. &#8220;Ultimately, it is the commission’s responsibility to ensure the project is in the public interest.&#8221;</p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p>It takes two years to train a social worker at one of Virginia’s local social services departments so they can confidently help families, handle an interview with a recently traumatized child or recognize red flags that could suggest abuse or neglect.</p>
<p>But Virginia&#8217;s child welfare workers — those whose duties range from meeting with foster children to investigating claims of child abuse — are leaving after an average of 18 to 24 months on the job, according to Carl Ayers, director of family services with the state Department of Social Services.</p>
<p>The repercussions for children and families can be far-reaching. A child might just begin to develop trust and a rapport with a social worker before he or she leaves. A complicated case might be assigned to someone fresh out of college with no on-the-job experience.</p>
<p>“When you talk to families, you’ll hear: &#8216;I had three different social workers over the life of the case and the third social worker had no idea about the needs of my child,'&#8221; said Valerie L’Herrou, staff attorney with the Center for Family Advocacy, which is part of the Virginia Poverty Law Center. “I think it’s affecting the quality of foster care services and reunification services.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1563" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/VirginiaDSS.jpg" alt="" width="256" height="137" /></p>
<p>For years, Virginia’s Department of Social Services has grappled with recruiting and retaining the staff needed to serve some of the state’s most vulnerable residents.</p>
<p>It’s been a challenge that has persisted, Ayers estimates, for nearly 20 years.</p>
<p>During a recent Board of Social Services meeting, Ayers said that the turnover rate for a newly hired family service specialist is 60 percent in the first year. As long as that is not addressed, he told the board, there will be cases when a child or family is not visited when they should be or work is not documented appropriately.</p>
<p>Of the 1,146 family-services specialist positions in the state, which provide child and adult protective services to clients, 230 are currently vacant, according to the Virginia League of Social Services Executives.</p>
<p>And of those who local departments of social services in Virginia can hire, few last long. Two-thirds of separating family services specialists — who primarily do child welfare work — leave within five years.</p>
<p>“Whenever you can’t keep staff and you can’t get staff in to fill those positions, it’s really challenging to meet the needs of families, and we’ve identified that as a key area that we need to address as a system in order to improve our overall services to children and families,” Ayers said.</p>
<p>The state has made some efforts to rectify the problem, such as installing new technology to make transcribing notes easier so social workers can spend less time in front of a computer and creating incentives to help cover student debt to entice graduating students to work for the state.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t get to what state workers and advocates agree is the root of the problem: that an already highly stressful job, in which staff must work with traumatized children every day, is made more difficult by poor compensation.</p>
<p>The minimum starting salary required by the state for a family services specialist is just $29,930 a year. That makes finding qualified workers difficult and keeping them even more so. Often, new graduates will start with a local social services agency, stay for a few years to gain some experience, and then transfer to another job — sometimes with a private agency or maybe a competing local department in another part of the state.</p>
<p>Though the state sets the salary guidelines, the local Departments of Social Services can pay higher if their locality decides to, which typically improves recruitment and retention.</p>
<p>“I’ve got 120 local departments representing 133 jurisdictions, so each of these jurisdictions have a different ability to pay and for some of them the idea of increasing starting salary by $5,000 is just a really challenging fiscal decision,” Ayers said.</p>
<p>The Department of Social Services requested a 10 percent increase to the minimum salary ranges last year but the proposal never made it to the governor’s desk.</p>
<p>During a recent Board of Social Services meeting, Commissioner Duke Storen said the department is working on a compensation study to determine how much workers should be paid, and a workload measure study to figure out how many workers a local department needs.</p>
<p>“Those are two data points you need to appropriately advocate for more resources from the General Assembly,” he said.</p>
<p>The problem feeds on itself, explained Andrew Crawford, president of the Virginia League of Social Services Executives. If the department isn’t fully staffed, more work falls on the shoulders of the employees who are there, making an already stressful job even more difficult.</p>
<p>Crawford is also the director of the Bedford County Department of Social Services, and he said his staff struggles to take their compensatory time after they’ve already worked more than 40 hours in a week. They have to work when families can see them, he said, so a social worker might work until 10 p.m. on one night and still have to be up at 8:30 the next morning for a court hearing.</p>
<p>There are also requirements related responding to new cases within 24 hours, so if a call comes in on Saturday morning, that client needs to be seen by Sunday.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the struggles we have had is, how do we structure staff days so they can meet the timeline and be successful and not burn out?&#8221; he said. &#8220;The amount of work they have, the magnitude of the problems they see — you need at least two years of training to be at base, and you often can’t even make it that two years.&#8221;</p>
<p>And losing staff before they’ve even hit the two-year mark is especially alarming because of the nature of the job, he said.</p>
<p>“When you&#8217;re dealing with people, whatever issues, as you go from one house to the next, they’re not the same,” he said. “When the complexities of the human condition are so diverse and so complicated, you really need to have a pretty wide skill level, a broader skill level, to be able to really be effective.”</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>It&#8217;s really thick, intensely flavored and, at McCormack&#8217;s Whisky Bar in Richmond, it goes for $2,000 a glass.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s absolutely unique compared to other spirits,&#8221; says owner Mac McCormack, describing The Macallan M, one of the world&#8217;s most expensive whiskeys.</p>
<p>A bottle retails for as much as $6,500, so the mark up is reasonable in the scheme of things. What&#8217;s unreasonable, McCormack says, is the fact that he can&#8217;t sell it and the other high-end liquors his bar is known for without running afoul of state laws aimed at banning bars.</p>
<p>Enter the ratio — a long-debated but never defeated scheme to limit liquor sales to bona fide restaurants. At least 45 percent of a restaurant&#8217;s sales must come from food and non-alcoholic beverages under the law. Beer and wine don&#8217;t count, but liquor and mixed drinks do.</p>
<p>For most restaurants, meeting the requirement doesn&#8217;t present a challenge, say ABC officials.</p>
<p>But at McCormack&#8217;s, with it&#8217;s $2,000 top shelf, the ratio is a constant worry.</p>
<p>For the record, he only sells about one glass of The Macallan M a year. More common but still ludicrously expensive sales come in at around $200 to $300. For instance McCormack&#8217;s might sell a $260 glass of 20-year-old Pappy Van Winkle&#8217;s every other day. And he has plenty of whiskeys priced in the $8 to $40 range.</p>
<p>It all evens out to an average liquor sale of $22, which sounds reasonable but remains troublesome when you consider his average entree price is just $18. And while he promises the mac and cheese he sells is &#8220;some of the best you&#8217;ve ever had,&#8221; even the hungriest customer is only likely to eat one dish worth while they could easily have three drinks.</p>
<p>Restaurants specializing in craft cocktails, which can go for as much as $20 a drink, are running into similar problems.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1512" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="max-width:100%;width:4694px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" id="longdesc-return-1512" class="wp-image-1512 size-full" tabindex="-1" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/whiskey-grill-2.jpg" alt="A glass of 20-year-old Pappy sells for $260 a glass at McCormack's Whisky Grill." width="4694" height="3129" longdesc="https://www.virginiamercury.com?longdesc=1512&amp;referrer=1477" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/whiskey-grill-2.jpg 4694w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/whiskey-grill-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/whiskey-grill-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/whiskey-grill-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/whiskey-grill-2-696x464.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/whiskey-grill-2-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/whiskey-grill-2-630x420.jpg 630w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/whiskey-grill-2-1920x1280.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 4694px) 100vw, 4694px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A glass of 20-year-old Pappy sells for $260 a glass at McCormack&#8217;s Whisky Grill. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p>After he got hit with his second ratio violation, McCormack took to the courts in the hopes of getting it overturned. It didn&#8217;t work. He lost his case in Richmond Circuit Court. Last year, the state Court of Appeals ruled against him and the state Supreme Court refused to take up his case, saying it&#8217;s a matter for the General Assembly.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, McCormack sold the bar to avoid losing his liquor license. The new owner got a new license and, with it, a fresh start on ratio violations. McCormack remains general manager.</p>
<p>The General Assembly has debated changing the ratio for years but has thus far failed to reach an agreement. While <a href="https://richmondbizsense.com/2017/01/24/bar-owners-take-another-shot-at-state-liquor-law/" target="_blank">past efforts</a> have focused on simply lowering the ratio to either 25 or 35 percent to make it easier to meet, this summer lawmakers have been considering what a total overhaul might look like.</p>
<p>The Senate subcommittee on alcoholic beverage control heard Tuesday from Travis Hill, the CEO of the state&#8217;s department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, who proposed potential solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>One would set a fixed threshold for monthly food sales that, if exceeded, would exclude a restaurant from meeting the ratio. Hill said that if it was set at $10,000, 92 percent of licensed restaurants would qualify. At $20,000, 81 percent would qualify and at $25,000, 76 percent.</li>
<li>The second would set a threshold based on the number of seats in a restaurant.</li>
<li>A system based on the liquid volume of alcohol sold has been ruled out already as impractical.</li>
</ul>
<p>The senators on the panel haven&#8217;t given a clear indication of how they feel about the proposals.</p>
<p>Sen. Lionell Spruill Sr., D-Chesapeake, wondered whether buying food shouldn&#8217;t just become a prerequisite for drinking. &#8220;Why can&#8217;t it be if you drank three beers, you have to buy a hamburger or something,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>ABC officials said Utah takes an approach similar to that but that it&#8217;s hard to enforce. &#8220;They don&#8217;t make you eat it,&#8221;Hill said.</p>
<div>
<p>The restaurant industry is still uncertain about the proposal as well. &#8220;I&#8217;d love to be able to tell you we have a definite consensus but we&#8217;re still a work in progress,&#8221; said Eric Terry, president of the Virginia Restaurant, Lodging and Travel Association.</p>
<p>The committee plans to continue discussing and gathering feedback with the aim of introducing legislation this year that might finally be able to pass.</p>
<p>For his part, McCormack thinks the threshold approach would solve his problems. But he&#8217;d love it if the state just gave in and just started allowing bars.</p>
<p>&#8220;The law is so antiquated,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There’s bars in every other state. There are bars in Virginia. They just pretend to be restaurants.&#8221;</p>

(Mechelle Hankerson/ The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following four hours of review Tuesday, the State Water Control Board decided not to take action on state-issued water quality certifications for the Mountain Valley and Atlantic Coast pipeline projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead the board voted to “aggressively” enforce compliance standards, pass some information on to the national agency that issued water permits for the pipelines’ construction and require more erosion-control measures borrowed from the stricter rulebook of the Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re really past the point now where process is going to solve the problem,” said board member Tim Hayes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seven-person citizen board made its decision after being briefed on 13,000 comments from the public on whether the Nationwide Permit 12 from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was enough to protect Virginia&#8217;s waterways from pipeline construction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Atlantic Coast Pipeline is a 600-mile underground natural gas pipeline proposed by a group of partners led by Dominion Energy. It would run from West Virginia through Virginia and into North Carolina, with a spur to Chesapeake. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.mountainvalleypipeline.info/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mountain Valley Pipeline</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is 303 miles, running through West Virginia and into Pittsylvania County. The project is being led by EQT Midstream Partners, based in Pittsburgh. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both have been lightning rods because of the potential effects on climate change, the damage to largely undeveloped mountainous areas construction poses, the use of eminent domain to seize property from unwilling landowners and arguments that the projects are more about profit for energy company shareholders than public need for more natural gas. </span></p>
<p>Both have also been halted by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission after opponents successfully challenged key federal permits issued for the projects.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality received 13,000 comments about whether the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permit was adequate. Just over 10,000 of those were about the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and about 2,500 were about the Mountain Valley pipeline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 2,000 of the 10,000 comments about Dominion’s Atlantic Coast pipeline were in favor of requiring a more strict state permitting process. According to the state’s analysis, 8,000 comments said the Army Corps’ permit was suitable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DEQ staff said Tuesday that the state’s permitting and erosion control approval processes are almost identical to the national permitting process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But pipeline opponents said that’s not true.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Corps of Engineers’ permitting decision is not based on water quality standards,” said David Sligh, conservation director for preservation group Wild Virginia and a former DEQ engineer. “They’ve said that’s not their job.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opponents also took issue with the state’s monitoring of erosion and sediment control with pipeline construction that has already taken place. Mountain Valley has already started construction in Virginia and Atlantic Coast has started in adjacent states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charmayne Staloff, an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, described scenes of landslides and streams “choked with sediment” along the Mountain Valley pipeline construction corridor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These pipelines endanger the environment in Virginia,” she told the Water Control Board. She pushed for the state to require a stream-by-stream analysis, which would evaluate water quality at every point the pipelines cross a body of water.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state claims it is taking every precaution to ensure the safety of the pipeline projects, according to a letter Secretary of Natural Resources Matthew Strickler sent Monday to Sen. Creigh Deeds, who represents part of the area the pipelines will cross.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strickler said DEQ has been following additional procedures to monitor the projects as closely as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This process meets the standard the governor set during his campaign for a stream-by-stream permitting process for pipelines,” Strickler wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Southern Environmental Law Center disagreed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have seen firsthand that pipeline construction in Virginia cannot be done without causing serious and permanent sedimentation problems to rivers and streams,” SELC senior attorney Greg Buppert said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The people of the commonwealth deserve better than blanket assurances that everything will be OK when the facts on the ground show that they are not.”</span></p>
<p>The Virginia Sierra Club also condemned the board&#8217;s nonaction as a failure to protect Virginia waters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nationwide Permit 12 requires far fewer protections for Virginia waterways than state water quality standards could under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act,&#8221; the group said. &#8220;Under the Clean Water Act, Virginia has the authority to require compliance with state water quality standards to study and mitigate the impacts of these two massive, dirty and dangerous pipeline projects to ensure Virginia’s water is protected.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Name: </strong>Board for Barbers and Cosmetology.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose: </strong>To regulate the practice of cosmetology and related professions in the state of Virginia.</p>
<p><strong>Meeting location:</strong> An office park in Henrico County.</p>
<p>Stephen Kirschner has some bad news for the Board for Barbers and Cosmetology: The pass rate for people taking the state’s barbering theory test is down to 39 percent – noticeably lower than in years past and “substantially lower than other states.”</p>
<p>Kirchner, a state regulatory administrator, offers a few theories at last week’s meeting. One of them: would-be barbers may be getting stumped by questions about wigs.</p>
<p>It’s not part of the state’s curriculum, he said, but the board voted in 2016 to start using a generic test used by other states, which include the question.</p>
<p>“It could play a role,” he said. “But I understand it’s only a few questions so it wouldn’t explain the difference.”</p>
<p>Another possibility, barbering schools in Virginia aren’t doing as good a job preparing students.</p>
<p>He suggests the board’s 10 members keep an eye on the issue.</p>
<p>The board meets every two months. The bulk of their work concerns issuing and revoking licenses to work as barbers, cosmetologists, tattoo artists and other professions.</p>
<p>It might sound like a weird thing for the state to have its hands in, but Board Chair Lonnie Quesenberry, a retired cosmetology teacher from Tazewell County, says the complexity of the chemicals and processes the work involves makes accountability and rules critical.</p>
<p>In addition to requiring extensive training and testing to enter the professions, the regulations address safety and sanitation, requiring things like that little strip of paper that goes between a patron’s neck and the salon cape.</p>
<p>At this particular meeting, the half-full room smells good in a way public meetings usually do not – basically like hair product, but not at all overpowering.</p>
<p>The board signs off on a couple dozen new licenses, almost entirely going to current or former prison inmates. Quesenberry says felons are the only ones the board actually has to vote on — the rest are processed administratively — and many prisons offer training programs so inmates can get licensed while they serve their sentences.</p>
<p>The board votes to revoke another couple dozen licenses. Quesenberry says almost all were obtained fraudulently – cases of someone paying someone else to take the state exam for them.</p>
<p>But the most discussion – it literally prompted gasps from the audience – came when Kirschner updated the board on new legislation that went into effect in July.</p>
<p>The biggie: <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+sum+HB790" target="_blank">A bill</a> that passed the General Assembly earlier this year deregulating blow-dry bars – a relatively new service where one can get hair washed, styled and dried before a big event so it looks great. No cutting or trimming is involved.</p>
<p>Formerly, the salon employees doing the work had to be fully licensed cosmetologists. But no more.</p>
<p>“That’s the craziest thing I’ve ever heard,” one attendee mutters.</p>
<p>Jay Deboer, the director of the Department of Professional and Occupational Regulation, tells the board that the Koch Brothers and their push for deregulation in statehouses around the country is at least partially to blame.  He says a group they fund advocated for the legislation during session this year and notes that other legislation proposed would have eliminated the board, its regulations and its licenses entirely.</p>
<p>“I don’t need to tell you that there’s a deregulatory fervor sweeping the General Assembly,” he says. “They say our rules and regulations are barriers to the profession, and there’s truth to that: they are barriers to enforce safety and professionalism.”</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury - Aug. 14, 2018)</p><p>Since before he took office in January, opponents of the Mountain Valley and Atlantic Coast pipelines, including <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/07/27/state-lawmakers-again-urge-northam-to-act-on-pipelines/" target="_blank">a list of lawmakers and officials from his own party</a>, have begged and cajoled Gov. Ralph Northam to get tougher on the contentious natural gas projects.</p>
<p>Work on both pipelines is now at least temporarily stalled amid<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/08/11/federal-agency-halts-atlantic-coast-pipeline-construction/" target="_blank"> court rulings</a> that have vacated key approvals from federal agencies, which appear to have left those permits vulnerable to legal challenge by rushing their way through the review process.</p>
<p>And with the State Water Control Board meeting next week to consider whether it should require additional scrutiny for the spots where the pipelines will blast, trench or drill across and under Virginia waterways, it could be an opportune time, probably the last chance, for Northam to finally insist on the rigorous environmental review <a href="http://friendsofnelson.com/in-may-2017-northam-pledged-stream-by-stream-review/" target="_blank">he promised on the campaign trail</a>.</p>
<p>Atlantic has yet to begin construction in Virginia, but the Mountain Valley project has already <a href="https://www.roanoke.com/business/construction-halted-at-mountain-valley-pipeline-work-site-following-severe/article_2eeebd3a-5007-56b0-9469-3e381b09b668.html" target="_blank">proven itself incapable of handling</a> the sediment laden runoff from construction that opponents warned the Department of Environmental Quality and the board about during the <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/environmental-groups-say-virginia-state-water-control-board-must-deny/article_6303b6b4-be61-550c-bc2f-3c8a8cf6b3c4.html" target="_blank">water quality review last year.</a></p>
<p>The exposure of the slipshod nature of how federal agencies handled the permitting process combined with the on-the-ground performance, or lack thereof, of <a href="https://www.roanoke.com/news/local/roanoke_county/mountain-valley-pipeline-suspends-construction-in-virginia/article_5d86c707-585e-5489-a8b5-fccee554282c.html" target="_blank">measures intended to keep mud from running off the MVP work areas,</a> have knocked big holes in the narrative that the pipeline developers have been spinning, which is that regulators have left no stone unturned in reviewing the projects.</p>
<p>If past is prologue though, don&#8217;t expect Northam to seize the moment.</p>
<p>The best evidence that the governor still intends to stay out of this hasn&#8217;t been his endless repetition of <a href="http://www.bdtonline.com/news/local_news/virginia-governor-supports-pipeline-regulatory-process/article_46db94b2-78b2-503a-8eb6-32df371413f6.html" target="_blank">campaign talking points about protecting property rights or numbing platitudes expressing confidence in the regulatory process,</a> even as federal judges and photos of mud running into streams keep pointing out regulators&#8217; shortcomings.</p>
<p>Rather, it&#8217;s something he hasn&#8217;t done.</p>
<p>At the end of June, two seats on the Water Control Board came up for reappointment: Robert Dunn, a retired DuPont manager, and Roberta Kellam, a former energy and environmental attorney. Dunn and Kellam were on opposite sides of the split decision last year by the board to award, with conditions, state water quality certifications to the Atlantic Coast and Mountain Valley pipelines. In general, Dunn is seen as a reliable vote for what the DEQ wants the board to do.</p>
<p>The DEQ itself is seen as too accommodating of industry and has faced widespread criticism for how it handled the pipelines. It did however, claim a modest measure of vindication when the same federal appeals court that has struck down federal pipeline approvals left and right <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog/federal-court-upholds-virginias-water-quality-review-for-mountain-valley-pipeline/" target="_blank">upheld the agency&#8217;s water quality review for the Mountain Valley Pipeline</a>.</p>
<p>Kellam, on the other hand, voted against issuing certifications for both pipeline projects and, at the last water board meeting in May, <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/regulatory-board-cracks-open-door-for-more-review-of-pipeline/article_e7d42cb8-2a11-5c72-8fd7-971faea029a8.html" target="_blank">supported revoking them</a>.</p>
<p>A governor interested in getting the water board to weigh in forcefully on the violations that have already happened during Mountain Valley Pipeline construction and similar risks posed by the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, which has an even bigger Virginia footprint, might have decided it was time for Dunn, the chairman, to step away from the hassle of managing those increasingly contentious water board meetings.</p>
<p>But Northam has opted to keep both Kellam and Dunn in their seats, though he has not formally reappointed either of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;The current members serve at the pleasure of the governor until he makes such a determination,&#8221; said Ofirah Yheskel, a spokeswoman for Northam.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what this is all about: Sure, pipeline opponents are looking to derail the projects, because of the threat that decades more of fossil fuel usage— even if it&#8217;s cleaner-burning natural gas— poses to the climate, as well as the trampling of private property rights for <a href="https://www.ferc.gov/media/statements-speeches/lafleur/2017/10-13-17-lafleur.asp#.W3TxUehKhPY" target="_blank">dubious public benefit</a>, the environmental risks posed by construction and the possibility that the things could explode, <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/powersource/companies/2018/07/11/Landslide-caused-pipeline-explosion-Columbia-Gas-reported/stories/201807100176" target="_blank">like a brand new gas pipeline just did in West Virginia</a>.</p>
<p>But they are also taking aim at a state review process that seems engineered by the DEQ to avoid taking a serious look at whether the projects can be built and still meet state standards.</p>
<p>Both pipeline projects — Atlantic is led by Dominion Energy, MVP by EQT Midstream Partners — involve clearing a wide right of way for the digging, blasting and other heavy construction to lay the pipe across steep mountain slopes and through hundreds of Virginia waterways.</p>
<p>At the heart of the issue is whether a federal permit, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Nationwide Permit 12, is adequate to protect the rivers and streams the pipelines will cross.</p>
<p>DEQ gave up its authority to review the crossings to the corps, perhaps because while the corps permit allows degradation of existing uses, like sediment choking a pristine trout stream, state water quality standards do not.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any lowering of water quality will violate this provision in high quality waters, unless DEQ shows a change is justified by economic or social necessity in the area affected by the waterbody impacted,&#8221; the conservation group Wild Virginia <a href="http://wildvirginia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Summary-of-Public-Comments-NWP-12-Sufficiency.pdf?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=2747b50d-f913-48d0-a0d9-a53d57216fd6" target="_blank">wrote in its summary of the thousands of comments DEQ has received on the issue</a>.  &#8220;No such showing can be made here, because even the benefits the companies claim will not accrue in the local communities directly affected by the water pollution that will occur. Failure to fully support all existing uses is an absolute requirement, for which there are to be no exceptions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The corps analysis also left out dozens of crossings and affected waterbodies, Wild Virginia says. At least another two dozen were reviewed by &#8220;desktop.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;People have given Ralph Northam a huge amount of time,&#8221; said David Sligh, a former DEQ engineer, an environmental lawyer and conservation director for Wild Virginia. &#8220;You have to question how in the world the corps did a thorough analysis when they didn’t even put them on the list. &#8230; The time is now.&#8221;</p>

(Via Shenandoah Valley Juvenile Center website)</p><p>A watchdog group with federal investigative authority says it is continuing to probe allegations of abuse made by immigrant teens held in a juvenile jail outside of Staunton. A report released Monday by state officials failed to substantiate the claims.</p>
<p>“Based on what we know so far, we believe further investigation may be needed,” said Colleen Miller, the director of the Henrico-based disAbility Law Center of Virginia, which has access to the facility under federal law aimed at protecting and advocating for the disabled.</p>
<p>The organization has visited the Shenandoah Valley Juvenile Center three times since late June, when the Associated Press reported that a group of teenagers detained by the federal government had sued the facility, alleging they were beaten by guards, locked alone in cells for hours and strapped to chairs. The <a href="http://www.washlaw.org/news/639-wiley-rein-and-washington-lawyers-committee-file-fifth-amendment-complaint-on-behalf-of-immigrants-detained-in-shenandoah-valley-juvenile-center" target="_blank">lawsuit was filed</a> in 2017 by the Washington, D.C., law firm Wiley Rein and the Washington Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs.</p>
<p>Miller said the disAbility Law Center has been granted greater access to the facility than state investigators, who wrote that they found no “life, health, or safety concerns” nor evidence of abuse <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2018/august/headline-828551-en.html" target="_blank">in a report released this week</a>.</p>
<p>“One significant difference between the visits by (the Department of Juvenile Justice) is that we had unaccompanied access to the residents,” she said.</p>
<p>Advocates for the immigrant teens <a href="http://www.washlaw.org/news/757-virginia-department-of-juvenile-justice-investigation-deeply-flawed" target="_blank">criticized the state’s review</a>, which was limited to the facility’s current conditions and did not investigate past allegations of abuse, as flawed and superficial.</p>
<p>“Can you imagine being a child and being asked about how you’re being treated and having the people responsible for that treatment sitting there with you?” said Hannah Lieberman, the legal director of the Washington Lawyers’ Committee.</p>
<p>“I think that’s a serious, serious impediment toward any meaningful information gathering.”</p>
<p>Gov. Ralph Northam ordered the review the day the abuse allegations were first reported by the Associated Press, and according to the report, state investigators visited the facility later that same day and again four days later.</p>
<p>But their access to the youth and records about their treatment and care was limited. According to the report, that’s because the immigrant teens are being held in the facility through a contract between the local facility and the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement.</p>
<p>The state investigators were only allowed to speak to the detainees in the presence of a jail staff member. They were also denied access to copies of case files and weren’t allowed to keep written notes.</p>
<p>Three of 18 residents interviewed did report that they experienced abusive behavior, according to the report. Child Protective Services investigated two of them, the report says, but found they “did not meet the legal definition of abuse and neglect.”</p>
<p>State investigators did not interview any of the immigrant teens who made the initial complaint. When asked why, the Department of Juvenile Justice said it’s because they were no longer in the facility and seeking them out would have been outside the scope of the review.</p>
<p>The agency also failed to contact lawyers involved in the class action suit, nor did it consider the evidence the case produced, the Washington Lawyers Committee said in a statement.</p>
<p>The review did confirm that the jail uses restraints, including a chair that children are strapped to and hoods that can be placed over their heads to protect guards against spitting and biting.</p>
<p>None of the residents interviewed said they had “knowledge of the use of the restraint chair,” but “in two instances reviewed, staff were disciplined for using an unapproved physical restraint technique.”</p>
<p>While the review didn’t touch on the validity of past allegations, the facility’s leaders treated it as a vindication of sorts, saying in a statement that it “confirms our long-standing dedication to being a well-run facility that treats our residents with respect and dignity.”</p>
<p>The review made a number of recommendations for the facility, including that they train staff to work with children who have suffered trauma, re-train staff in the use of physical restraints, and “increase the staff’s understanding of and sensitivity toward the unique cultural backgrounds of the youth in the federal program, expand the culturally relevant programming for these youth and increase the number of bilingual staff.”</p>
<p>They also made two recommendations for the state Board of Juvenile Justice — one to guarantee state access to federal detainees and another to consider changes in the use of physical restraints.</p>
<p>Jennifer Woolard, the chair of the board, said they will take up both at their meeting next month.</p>
<p>Lieberman, the lawyer representing the teens, called the recommendations more telling than the report itself.</p>
<p>“It speaks to a lack of something that is core to the responsibilities of a facility like this,” she said.</p>
<p>The lawsuit that sparked the review is set for trial in early December. She said the state’s review doesn’t reflect the likely outcome of the trial because they considered two completely different legal standards. The state, she said, didn’t find any evidence of abuse or neglect as defined under Virginia law. The lawsuit, meanwhile, challenges the constitutionality of the conditions of confinement the youths faced as civil detainees.</p>
<p>“In lay terms, the standard is whether the treatment falls below the established standard of professional judgement,” she said.</p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p>The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ordered a halt Friday night to Dominion Energy&#8217;s 600-mile Atlantic Coast Pipeline.</p>
<p>The order came four days after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit in Richmond <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/08/06/fourth-circuit-strikes-again-atlantic-coast-pipeline-permit-vacated/" target="_blank">vacated the pipeline&#8217;s authorization</a> to drill under the Blue Ridge Parkway and gave a detailed explanation for its <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/federal-appeals-court-nullifies-key-permit-for-atlantic-coast-pipeline/article_c3da09e8-df8d-56d5-a9dd-3499737b1a14.html" target="_blank">decision in May to strip</a> a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service assessment of the project&#8217;s effect on threatened and endangered species.</p>
<p>The court found that the National Park Service failed to explain its decision to allow the pipeline to cross the parkway and how the project was not &#8220;inconsistent with and in derogation of the purposes of the parkway and the park system.”</p>
<p>The panel of judges ruled earlier that the &#8220;incidental take statement&#8221; that allowed the pipeline to kill or harm threatened and endangered species was too vague to be enforceable.</p>
<p>FERC issued a similar order on a Friday night a week ago after the Mountain Valley Pipeline, which will run from West Virginia into Pittsylvania County, lost authorization to cross U.S. Forest Service land, also at the hands of the 4th Circuit.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no reason to believe that the NPS, as the land managing agency, will not be able to comply with the court’s instructions and to ultimately issue a new right-of-way grant that satisfies the court’s requirements, or that FWS will not be able to issue an incidental take statement that does likewise,&#8221; the FERC order says.  &#8220;However, commission staff cannot predict when NPS or FWS may act or whether NPS will ultimately approve the same route. Should NPS authorize an alternative crossing location, Atlantic may need to revise substantial portions of the ACP route across non-federal or federal lands, possibly requiring further authorizations and environmental review. Accordingly, allowing continued construction poses the risk of expending substantial resources and substantially disturbing the environment by constructing facilities that ultimately might have to be relocated or abandoned.&#8221;</p>
<p>Environmental groups who have fought the project tooth and nail, arguing that it&#8217;s really about the 14 percent rate of return FERC guarantees for Dominion and its partners in the more than $6 billion project than a genuine public need for new sources of natural gas, cheered the decision.</p>
<p>“FERC made the right decision to stop construction of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and protect public lands, rivers and streams, and private property from unnecessary harm,” said Southern Environmental Law Center attorney Greg Buppert. “With so many unknowns remaining about this project, now is the right time for the commission to grant rehearing and get to the bottom of Dominion’s over-blown and unsupported claims of public benefit.”</p>
<p>The environmental law group successfully argued two challenges to permits for the pipeline, which triggered the stop work order from FERC.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since this risky project was proposed in 2014, studies have revealed that natural gas demands in our region are nowhere near those claimed by Dominion and Duke and submitted to FERC as justification for the project,&#8221; the SELC said in a statement.</p>
<p>Dominion had argued in a letter to FERC that the National Park Service would &#8220;promptly reissue the permit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Company spokesman Aaron Ruby told the <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/u-s-agency-temporarily-halts-construction-of-atlantic-coast-pipeline/article_7a6e55d0-63c1-5bbf-bf55-47739bf358b5.html" target="_blank">Richmond Times-Dispatch</a> Friday that the company is &#8220;already working with the key agencies to resolve the issues in FERC’s order so we can resume construction as soon as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>“We are confident these issues can be resolved quickly without causing unnecessary delay to the project,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The project has begun work already in West Virginia and North Carolina. It has cut trees along the proposed route in Virginia but has not received final authorization yet to begin construction here.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Dominion, from the outset, has pursued this project arrogantly assuming it would get everything it wanted,&#8221; Buppert said in an interview this past week. &#8220;I think it put a lot of political pressure on these agencies to get these permits issued. &#8230; Dominion chose to put the ACP through one of the most undeveloped and rugged parts of Virginia and West Virginia, through two national forests and through a national park. And rushing those permits has had consequences and we’re seeing those consequences now come to light. We’re discovering now, that, not surprisingly, corners have been cut on these permits and they don&#8217;t meet the requirements at all.&#8221;</p>

(Anthony Crider/Creative Commons via Wikimedia)</p><p>The crowd hissed as a man with a full white beard and red MAGA hat approached the lectern to address Charlottesville City Council this week.</p>
<p>He said he condemned the hateful views expressed last year, but urged tolerance of opposing viewpoints, which he said people should be able to share without fear of violence or being shouted down.</p>
<p>His short speech was punctuated by heckling, but he was cut off entirely when he said he’d like to end his remarks with a quote from Thomas Jefferson.</p>
<p>The room erupted with loud groaning.</p>
<p>Mayor Nikuyah Walker tried to quiet the audience.</p>
<p>“Can we let him finish?”</p>
<p>More groans.</p>
<p>“Yes, we have to,” Walker said. “We’ve just been having this conversation. Did you understand what we’ve been talking about for over a year about the First Amendment?”</p>
<p>Someone yelled back: “Yeah, I don’t care.”</p>
<p>The short exchange was tame by Charlottesville City Council standards – meetings over the past year have been marked by raucous outburst and bickering. But it’s characteristic of a larger debate that’s been playing out in the city since violent white supremacists marched here last year, leaving dozens injured and a young counter protester, Heather Heyer, dead.</p>
<h3><strong>Debating the First Amendment and ‘civility’</strong></h3>
<p>Anti-racist activists in Charlottesville say they’re fed up with calls for civility as groups peddling violent hate speech cloak their rallies in the constitutional rhetoric of free speech, often framing their gatherings literally as “free speech rallies” rather than letting the speech itself — support for the KKK for instance — serve as the headliner.</p>
<p>And a year later, Charlottesville residents remain outraged that the city granted white supremacist groups a permit to hold their infamous Aug. 12 rally in the city.</p>
<p>“Activists had warned the city and the judge that these people were going to be violent, but again, free speech was used to protect their ability to be here,” said Ben Doherty, a law librarian at the University of Virginia, during a panel this week organized by anti-racist activists to discuss how “platitudes about free speech are used to undermine anti-racist work.”</p>
<p>The city did fight the permit, but only insomuch as it sought to change the location from a small downtown park to a much larger space where authorities believed it would be easier to manage crowds, noted another member of the panel, Kim Rolla, a lawyer at the Legal Aid Justice Center and member of the National Lawyers Guild.</p>
<p>They lost. A federal judge ruled the city wanted to make the move based on the content of the speech expected at the rally, not just concerns about the crowd size. The rally was allowed to proceed downtown and chaos ensued.</p>
<p>What the city didn’t do was make the argument that they shouldn’t allow the permit because the groups were threatening actual violence or their speech aimed to incite attendees to immediate violence.</p>
<p>Those are the grounds cited by activists, who note early and ample online evidence that the groups planned violence.</p>

<h3><strong>Courts may still decide whether rally was constitutionally protected</strong></h3>
<p>It’s probable that a judge or jury will still rule on whether that speech met the test to override constitutional protections — albeit well after the fact.</p>
<p>Rodney Smolla, a First Amendment expert and dean of Widener University Delaware Law School, said the question will likely be central in the handful of post-rally lawsuits victims have filed against rally organizers.</p>
<p>“Part of what’s going on in those cases is the plaintiffs are trying to demonstrate that text messages and postings on internet sites and other statements made in advance of the rally demonstrated an intention to harm people and therefore crossed the line,” Smolla said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>“What they would say is &#8216;We just came to express our views and we know our views are contrary to what a lot of people think, but we never intended to threaten harm or violence.&#8217;”</p>
<p>He says it’s “quite possible” that the plaintiffs will be victorious.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen the posts and I’ve seen the language and we’ve also seen the violence that’s ensued at rallies like this around the country,” he said.</p>
<p>But whether that means the city could have been victorious in its legal efforts ahead of the rally is another question, he said. It all depends what evidence they had at the time.</p>
<p>“I think what they knew is it was intended to promote anger,” he said. “So that’s not the same thing as intending to promote harm.”</p>
<p>To Smolla, the most relevant legal precedent comes from a 2002 <a href="https://mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/706/planned-parenthood-of-the-columbia-williamette-inc-v-american-coalition-of-life-activists-9th-cir" target="_blank">case</a> filed by Planned Parenthood against an activist organization that listed addresses for abortion providers alongside wanted-style posters. Three of the doctors listed were killed.</p>
<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled the speech constituted a “true threat” and was not protected. The ruling found that although “advocating violence is protected, threatening a person with violence is not.”</p>
<p>To activists, the violent intent in Unite the Right was obvious. To them, the only question is whether city officials ignored warnings from residents or just failed to take them seriously enough.</p>
<p>“If I was able to get access to information this summer that violence was coming, it’s hard to imagine they didn’t have it,” Anne Coughlin, a UVA law professor who also spoke on the panel. “The evidence was clear.”</p>

(Katie O'Connor/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>The drugs helped Stephanie Hague stay numb to the pain.</p>
<p>If she left her brain alone for too long without any substances to distract it, she’d start to remember the abuse and trauma in her past. All she wanted to do was forget.</p>
<p>“I just did not want to feel,” she said.</p>
<p>Hague’s story is common among those swept away in the opioid epidemic gripping the country. A Richmond resident, her addiction began when she was 19 through a prescription painkiller her doctor gave her after a car accident. Then she turned to cheaper heroin.</p>
<p>She wanted to stop using heroin but dreaded the painful withdrawal symptoms. So she did what others battling addiction have increasingly started to do: She turned to methamphetamine.</p>
<p>Virginia has seen a sharp increase in fatal methamphetamine overdoses over the past five years. In 2013, there were only 10 fatalities, but that jumped to 52 in 2016 and 88 in 2017, <a href="http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/content/uploads/sites/18/2018/07/Quarterly-Drug-Death-Report-FINAL-Q1-2018.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner</a>.</p>
<p>As of July, there have already been 92 meth-related fatal overdoses this year.</p>
<p>“We started seeing an uptick in the last couple of years, and it’s something that’s been seen nationally, as well,” said Rosie Hobron, statewide forensic epidemiologist with the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1177" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" id="longdesc-return-1177" class="wp-image-1177 size-medium" tabindex="-1" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/meth-10-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" longdesc="https://www.virginiamercury.com?longdesc=1177&amp;referrer=1171" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Methamphetamine. Image via U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.</p></figure>
<p>Other communities across the country <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/06/20/619929939/a-new-wave-of-meth-overloads-communities-struggling-with-opioids" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are seeing similar trends</a>.</p>
<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the percentage of drug overdose deaths involving psychostimulants like meth <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db273.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increased from 5 percent in 2010 to 11 percent in 2015</a>, the most recent year for which the data is available. However, in that year, Virginia&#8217;s fatal drug overdose rate was lower than the national rate, the CDC found.</p>
<p>Hobron noted that, in the past, meth was frequently made in homemade batches. But increasingly, federal reports show that drug traffickers are bringing it in from Mexico. <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection website</a>, officials have seized 60,000 pounds of methamphetamine so far this year, a big surge from the 14,131 pounds intercepted in 2012.</p>
<p>The opioid epidemic continues to dwarf any rise in the use of methamphetamines. All opioids – including both the illicit forms of heroin and fentanyl along with prescription opioids – killed 1,229 people last year in Virginia. As of July, 1,167 people died this year.</p>
<p>Meth is a stimulant, often referred to as an &#8220;upper.&#8221; Hague said she would feel especially focused when she took the drug. By contrast, opioids are depressants, or &#8220;downers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rise in meth speaks to the overarching disease of addiction, which will drive people to find any kind of high, regardless of the drug, said Marjorie Yates, manager of recovery supports and training with SAARA of Virginia, or the Substance Abuse and Addiction Recovery Alliance.</p>
<p>That’s what happened to Hague, who is now 31. She wasn’t looking for meth, she was seeking a way to avoid the heroin withdrawal so she could continue functioning and get through her days. And meth was cheap and easy to find.</p>
<p>But for the past four months, she’s been in regular treatment, not using. She said she hasn’t had any cravings, either, though she does find herself stressed out sometimes, particularly because she struggles with depression as well. She now volunteers with SAARA in Richmond.</p>
<p>Yates said Hague’s story is all too common, especially as treatment remains far too expensive for many.</p>
<p>Virginia’s Medicaid program launched the Addiction and Recovery Treatment Services benefit last year to cover substance use treatment, but <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/07/23/four-years-of-political-battling-over-medicaid-expansion-has-ended-what-comes-next/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">until the state expands its Medicaid program in January</a>, treatment will remain out of reach for many. Childless adults aren’t currently eligible for Medicaid at all in the state, and parents of children cannot make more than $6,900 a year to qualify.</p>
<p>“It’s not a coincidence that people want to take a drug that takes away their pain,” Yates said. “People are in emotional and spiritual pain.”</p>
<p>Hague experienced a near-fatal overdose in 2015. She thought she was using heroin, but it turned out to be the far more potent fentanyl.</p>
<p>But that didn’t stop her from using drugs. Even after several days in a coma, she went on using.</p>
<p>“You have no regard for your own life,” she said.</p>
<p>Then, she said, one day she finally stopped and realized that the next time she used, it might be her last. And she didn’t want to do that to herself or her parents.</p>
<p>“I thought, &#8216;I know that I can do better,&#8217;” she said. “I know that I deserve better.”</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Annie Washington is 60 years old, has diabetes and no insurance. If she needs to see a doctor, she winds up in the emergency room.</p>
<p>But while hospitals can’t turn indigent patients away, they can still bill them. And when patients can’t afford those bills, collection lawsuits often follow.</p>
<p>&#8220;I work at McDonald&#8217;s,&#8221; the Henrico County resident said after a recent hearing over an $860 lawsuit filed by the doctors group that staffs VCU Medical Center. &#8220;There&#8217;s no insurance there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia medical providers filed more than 400,000 lawsuits over the past five years, netting more than $587 million in legal judgments against their patients, an analysis of state court records by the Virginia Mercury has found. The review relied on data collected by <a href="http://virginiacourtdata.org" target="_blank">virginiacourtdata.org</a>, which aggregates online state court records.</p>
<p>Of those, no medical provider filed more lawsuits or won more judgments than MCV Physicians, the VCU doctors group that sued Washington. The practice filed 43,330 suits between 2013 and 2017, winning more than $62 million in judgments.</p>
<p>“Legal proceedings are the absolute last resort for our organization and are not used unless patients do not contact us regarding their bill for over a year,” a spokesperson for MCV Physicians said in a statement.</p>
<p>VCU Medical Center is among the state&#8217;s largest hospitals going by patient beds and discharges, but that does not come close to accounting for the gap between MCV Physicians&#8217; numbers and its nearest peers. For example, MCV filed 4,372 more lawsuits than Inova Healthcare, which has more patient beds at its Fairfax flagship hospital. MCV won about $20 million more in judgements than Inova.</p>
<p>When asked why the medical group filed more lawsuits than any other hospital or physician group in the state in the last five years, MCV Physicians pointed to the fact that it draws a “large and diverse patient population from all over the state.”</p>
<p>Because MCV Physicians is affiliated with VCU Medical Center in downtown Richmond, it offers financial assistance to its patients, too. According to the medical group, 86 percent of the account balances that were approved for financial assistance in 2017 were forgiven, meaning they were adjusted to $0.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.vhi.org/" target="_blank">Virginia Health Information</a>, in 2016, VCU Health provided $340 million in charity care to its patients.</p>
[table id=1 /]
<p><strong>Some hospitals don’t sue at all, others try to avoid it</strong></p>
<p>Hospitals say they have no choice but to try to collect, noting they’ve also been shouldering the burden of rising medical costs. According to the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare System, the state’s hospitals absorbed $543 million worth of bad debt in 2016, up from $419 million in 2008. Bad debt is essentially the difference between what hospitals billed their patients and what they were actually paid.</p>
<p>But in recent years, some Virginia hospitals have said they’ve taken deliberate measures to reduce the number of lawsuits they file, and the Mercury’s review has shown a modest decrease in both lawsuits filed and judgments won since 2015, dropping from $119 million to to $107 million.</p>
<p>Many health systems, such as Mary Washington Hospital and Sentara Healthcare, will forgive debt if a patient&#8217;s income is less than 200 percent of the federal poverty level, or $24,280 a year for an individual, and have sliding scales that they use after that to give additional discounts based on income.</p>
<p>Bon Secours, which operates hospitals in the Richmond and Hampton Roads areas, has similar financial assistance programs. It stopped pursuing patient debt lawsuits altogether around 2007, “because our mission is to provide compassionate, quality health care services to those in need, regardless of their ability to pay,” Emma Swann, a spokeswoman for the health system, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Sentara uses what executives call “predictive data analytics” like credit scores to tell if a patient can actually pay the bill. It’s allowed the system’s hospitals to reduce the number of lawsuits they file, stops them from wasting legal fees on lawsuits that won’t actually result in any dollars for the system and saves patients from dealing with the court system if they simply can’t afford the bill, explained Andy Weddle, Sentara’s vice president for revenue cycle.</p>
<p>The medical practices that merge with the system will eventually adopt similar billing practices, Weddle said, though it may take several years. That would explain why Sentara has filed the third-highest number of lawsuits in the past five years, he said, as those figures include both hospitals and physicians&#8217; practices.</p>
<p>Officials with Sentara and Mary Washington said the ultimate goal of taking patients to court is to make sure the hospital has enough revenue to continue operating. That’s why they try to determine which patients aren’t paying because they can’t afford to and which just don’t want to pay.</p>
<p><strong>Will Medicaid expansion help?</strong></p>
<p>According to the Virginia Health Care Foundation, there were 718,000 people living without insurance in Virginia in 2016, the most recent year the data was available. They’re often in situations just like Washington’s — waiting to seek care for a chronic illness until they wind up with a pricey emergency room visit. Once they do, they have no way to pay for it.</p>
<p>Virginia is due to <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/07/23/four-years-of-political-battling-over-medicaid-expansion-has-ended-what-comes-next/" target="_blank">expand its Medicaid program</a> in January to an estimated 400,000 people, and that will hopefully help some who are battling medical debt, said Carolyn Engelhard, associate professor of public health sciences and public policy at the University of Virginia.</p>
<p>But not everyone facing mounting doctors’ bills are uninsured. Medical debt is also a symptom of an increasingly expensive health care system, Engelhard pointed out, and <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/07/19/what-recourse-do-you-have-other-than-to-write-the-check-lawmakers-scrutinize-balance-billing/" target="_blank">even patients with insurance find themselves shouldering more of the cost</a>.</p>
<p>“Even under the Affordable Care Act, people are carrying much higher deductibles and also there are the problems with going to specialists or physicians who are in network versus out of network, and all of those things can mean that people will have higher medical costs, which may lead to indebtedness,” Engelhard said.</p>
<p>Nearly 40 percent of adults were enrolled in high-deductible health plans in 2016, compared to 26 percent in 2011, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>While these plans have cheaper monthly premiums, they require patients pay a certain amount out-of-pocket before the insurer will start covering part of the bills. Figuring out how to come up with the money has become <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/06/upshot/lost-jobs-houses-savings-even-insured-often-face-crushing-medical-debt.html" target="_blank">increasingly difficult for many Americans</a>.</p>
<p>“It’s impossible to anticipate every charge,” Engelhard said. “More and more we’re seeing, in order to control costs, insurers are offering narrower and narrower networks.”</p>
<p>There is conflicting economic data as to how often medical debt causes bankruptcy, Engelhard said. Some studies use only debt from inpatient hospital stays, while others include all medically-related financial hardships, like cases when a person must quit a job to care for a loved one due to an illness. If you included those factors, she said, likely about 20 to 30 percent of bankruptcies are caused by medical debt.</p>
<p>But even if the debt doesn’t lead to bankruptcy, there are a slew of repercussions for patients when they face a massive bill. Even 12 months after a major medical event, Engelhard said, patients tend to carry more credit card debt and have fewer liquid assets — like a car or house.</p>
<p>And if the debt reaches the court, the hospital or medical provider can garnish a patient’s wages.</p>
<p>Washington said she wouldn’t have been able to afford it if her case had gotten to that point. She was able to work out a payment plan with MCV Physicians before they began garnishing her pay check. But if that hadn’t happened, and they took more than $40 out of her $800 monthly income, she said she probably would have had to leave Richmond altogether.</p>
<p><strong>A lifetime of payment</strong></p>
<p>Washington will qualify for Medicaid next year under the expansion rules. But that’s not going to help her right now.</p>
<p>In a statement, MCV said it had tried to reach out to Washington in the past to get her enrolled in its financial assistance program. Washington denies that, and says she never heard back the first time she applied for Virginia Coordinated Care, VCU Health’s financial assistance program.</p>
<p>In either case, she re-applied a few months ago, though, and was enrolled on July 13. Her coverage will last until May 24, 2019, according to MCV Physicians, and she will be responsible for a 20 percent copay.</p>
<p>For many, $40 a month might be an annoying payment to make, at worst. But for Washington, it’s huge.</p>
<p>It’s $40 that can’t go toward buying a new car, after hers was wrecked when a drunken driver hit her in early June, she says. It’s $40 that she can’t use to pay for her diabetes medication, which she hasn’t been able to afford for almost a year.</p>
<p>She had been living in her car before the crash, and now she&#8217;s staying with family while she searches for a place to live.</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand why some people become homeless,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You don&#8217;t know what that person&#8217;s going through or what&#8217;s happened to them. You can&#8217;t judge them.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taylor, a Republican from Virginia Beach representing the 2nd District, came under fire this week after </span><a href="http://www.dailypress.com/news/politics/dp-nws-taylor-brown-20180801-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">it was revealed his paid staff members circulated a last-minute petition to get Shaun Brown, who is running as an independent, on the ballot.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the names his staff collected was Richard Cake, who died in April, </span><a href="https://youtu.be/b7WRBqU8TB8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">his wife said in a radio interview this week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and two versions of Virginia Beach Republican Del. Glenn Davis’ signature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colin Stolle, Virginia Beach’s Commonwealth’s Attorney, appointed Donald Caldwell of Roanoke to take over the case. According to Brown’s candidacy paperwork, Colin Stolle’s brother and Virginia Beach Sheriff Ken Stolle, was one of the people Taylor’s staff got to sign Brown’s petition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ken Stolle doesn’t dispute his signature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To run as an independent, Brown needed 1,000 signatures from eligible voters. About 1,900 signatures were turned in to the state on Brown’s behalf. Taylor’s staff collected about 700 of those.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not clear which of the signatures submitted on Brown’s behalf went toward the final count to get her on the ballot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also not clear how many or which signatures are part of the investigation.</span></p>
<p>Getting Brown on the ballot gives Taylor two opponents and a possible advantage on Election Day. Democrat Elaine Luria, a Norfolk businesswoman and veteran, got the party nomination. Brown threatens to split Democratic voters, making it more likely Taylor comes out with a majority of votes.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Davis&#8217; signature appears on the petition twice, each with the same date, according to the petitions filed with the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Davis said he only signed once. One of the signatures isn’t his handwriting, he said, and the address is wrong. His first name is also misspelled, and is signed next to his wife’s name, which is also attached to the wrong address.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That signature — the one the delegate says isn’t his — is on a petition circulated by Daniel Bohner, who </span><a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/disbursements/?two_year_transaction_period=2018&amp;data_type=processed&amp;committee_id=C00608703&amp;min_date=01%2F01%2F2017&amp;max_date=08%2F07%2F2018" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taylor has paid for consulting services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but doesn’t appear to be a full-time campaign staffer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Davis said he signs every petition brought to him and used to sign his opponents’ petitions during his tenure on the Virginia Beach City Council.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anybody can gather signatures to get an independent candidate on a ballot, according to Virginia law. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those signatures don’t have to belong to a certain party and it’s not a pledge to vote for the candidate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If any one in my campaign did anything that was wrong or illegal … I would fire them in a second,” Taylor said in a </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/scotttaylorvirginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook Live video Monday afternoon.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taylor has said he knew his staff collected signatures for Brown. He said Brown and other Democrats in Hampton Roads were shut out of the party’s primary process when the Democratic National Committee “hand-picked” Luria.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t agree with Shaun Brown on probably a lot of things but I definitely agree with her ability to have her voice heard,” Taylor said in his Facebook video. “I definitely agree with her ability to run in a primary that doesn’t have Washington Democrats coming here and controlling this process for our local people. I’d say the same thing if it was the Washington Republican Party.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a Democrat, Brown won 38 percent of the vote when she challenged Taylor in 2016. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She <a href="https://pilotonline.com/news/local/article_b2873340-9695-11e8-94aa-632edded8309.html" target="_blank">was recently in federal court on fraud charges.</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her trial was rescheduled to early October because the jury couldn’t come to a unanimous verdict.</span></p>

Powell Jr. federal courthouse in Richmond is home to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, which has been a key battleground over the Atlantic Coast and Mountain Valley pipelines. (Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p>In the latest in a string of decisions that have struck down key approvals for the Mountain Valley and Atlantic Coast pipelines, the Richmond-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit has thrown out Atlantic&#8217;s permit to cross the Blue Ridge Parkway.</p>
<p>The court ruled that the National Park Service&#8217;s decision to allow the pipeline under the parkway was &#8220;arbitrary and capricious.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, the agency decision is not accompanied by any explanation, let alone a satisfactory one,&#8221; the panel of judges wrote. &#8220;We find this lack of explanation particularly troubling given the evidence in the record indicating that the presence of the pipeline is inconsistent with and in derogation of the purposes of the parkway and the park system.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ruling comes more than two months after the same court invalidated a key approval from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and a little more than a week after it vacated a permit allowing the Mountain Valley Pipeline to cross U.S. Forest Service land. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ordered a halt to MVP construction Friday.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Dominion Energy-led Atlantic Coast Pipeline did not respond to a request for comment Monday. However, the 4th Circuit judges made it clear that proceeding with construction now would place the project in violation of its FERC approval.</p>
<p>&#8220;As noted previously, FERC&#8217;s authorization for ACP to begin construction is conditioned on the existence of valid authorizations from both FWS and NPS,&#8221; the judges wrote. &#8220;Absent such authorizations, ACP, should it continue to proceed with construction, would violate FERC’s certificate of public convenience and necessity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mountain Valley Pipeline, planned to be built from West Virginia into Pittsylvania County is led by EQT Midstream Partners of Pittsburgh, has already been <a href="https://www.roanoke.com/news/local/environmental-regulators-cite-mountain-valley-pipeline-again/article_f9fec22c-b5fc-5c15-bf75-1aaf5fbdd86e.html" target="_blank">flagged for a series of environmental violations</a> in both states. The longer Atlantic Coast Pipeline is planned to run 600 miles from West Virginia into North Carolina and will carve through the center of Virginia.</p>
<p>“This is an example of what happens when dangerous projects are pushed through based on politics rather than science,” said Southern Environmental Law Center attorney DJ Gerken in a statement. “This pipeline project was flawed from the start and Dominion and Duke’s pressure tactics to avoid laws that protect our public lands, water and wildlife are now coming to light.”</p>
<p>The decision is sure to focus more attention on the <a href="http://townhall.virginia.gov/L/GetFile.cfm?File=meeting\103\27897\Agenda_DEQ_27897_v1.pdf" target="_blank">meeting later this month</a> of the Virginia State Water Control Board, which is weighing whether a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permit <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/regulatory-board-cracks-open-door-for-more-review-of-pipeline/article_e7d42cb8-2a11-5c72-8fd7-971faea029a8.html" target="_blank">is adequate to protect</a> the hundreds of water crossings the pipelines will make in Virginia from blasting, trenching, drilling and other construction methods.</p>
<p>The meeting will come after widely shared photos of Mountain Valley Pipeline&#8217;s <a href="https://www.roanoke.com/business/news/giles_county/giles-county-couple-blames-mountain-valley-pipeline-for-runoff-mess/article_604f779a-ce98-5577-ab79-b84ef6512b38.html" target="_blank">failures to control sediment</a>, which have fouled nearby waterways.</p>

He brings you the plans for the first floor and proposes to start work right away. “These look okay,” you say, “but I need to see the plans for the whole house.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you worry about that,” says the builder. “I have it all figured out. I’ll show you the second floor when the first is done, and the third floor after that.”</p>
<p>You argue with the builder, pointing out that as it is your money, you have the right to assure yourself the result will be what you want. If you haven’t even seen the blueprint for the whole house, how can you approve the ground floor? Heck, you can’t even judge if all the stuff he wants to put in is actually needed. (It looks awfully expensive.)</p>
<p>“Please,” says the builder, now deeply offended. “I’m an expert. You should trust me.”</p>
<p>If this scenario sounds far-fetched, that’s because you don’t live in the world of Virginia utility regulation.</p>
<p>In that world, Dominion Energy Virginia, the state’s largest utility, <a href="https://www.dominionenergy.com/library/domcom/media/about-us/electric-projects/grid-transformation/gtsa-072418.pdf?la=en" target="_blank">has just filed a plan</a> with the State Corporation Commission (SCC) to spend almost $1 billion of its customers’ money for the first phase of what it says will be three phases of grid modernization, amounting to $3.5 billion. The company maintains that all the things it plans to do now are necessary to the overall strategy, but it isn’t saying what that strategy is.</p>
<p>“During Phase 1 of the Plan,” writes Dominion Energy Senior Vice President Edward Baine, “the company will focus on installing the foundational infrastructure that will enable all other components of the Grid Transformation Plan.” That sounds like it ought to lead into a discussion of what the grid of the future will look like, but sadly, the other “components” turn out to be just more spending.</p>
<p>That might in fact be the whole plan: spend money, lots of it. Baine explains the “drivers” of the plan, like recognizing threats to the grid, and he describes how it will “enable” things like new rate structures and integrating renewable energy. But new rate structures and renewable energy integration aren’t actually part of the plan Dominion wants the SCC to approve.</p>
<p>This will make it very hard for the SCC to judge whether the investments are “reasonable and prudent,” as Virginia law requires.</p>
<p>Knowing this, Baine argues the SCC shouldn’t impose a cost-benefit test on its plans. Already that position has drawn s<a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/dominion-s-grid-plan-says-scc-should-not-require-cost/article_46f1aa20-3b77-5b35-8896-b2af343c629e.html" target="_blank">harp criticism even from supporters of the legislation</a> that authorized the spending.</p>
<p>Take smart meters, also known as “advanced metering infrastructure” (AMI). Smart meters don’t just measure electricity use, but do so on an hourly or more frequent basis, and they provide two-way communication instead of just one-way reporting to the utility.</p>
<p>Properly designed and deployed, smart meters are central to the grid of the future. Dominion proposes to spend over $500 million to provide all its customers with this advanced technology during Phase 1. Unfortunately, that doesn’t include making full use of their potential.</p>
<p>Where ordinary electric meters mostly just tell the utility how much electricity a customer has used, smart meters provide detailed information that can be used to help pinpoint power outages and spikes in demand. That’s helpful for the utility, but just using them that way, as Dominion proposes, leaves most of the benefits of smart meters untapped.</p>
<p>Justifying the expense of smart meters requires using them to allow customers to control how and when they use electricity, as well as to make the most efficient rate designs and determine how to get the most benefit from solar panels, batteries and electric vehicle charging. That only happens where a utility offers <a href="http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/General.aspx?id=12194" target="_blank">time-of-use rates</a> and other incentives to change behavior and prompt investments by consumers.</p>
<p>Using smart meters this way would result in lower energy use, more customer-investments in solar and batteries, and savings for everyone. But time-of-use rates and similar incentives aren’t in Phase 1, and they don’t look to be part of Phases 2 or 3 either.</p>
<p>Dominion seems to think it can get approval to spend money on smart meters based on how they could be used, rather than on how the company actually plans to use them. Baine notes that smart meters can tell customers how much electricity they’re using in any 30-minute period. “Customers will be able to choose their preferred mode of communication,” writes Baine, “and then receive high usage alerts when their energy usage exceeds a certain level.”</p>
<p>Yes, and then what? Baine doesn’t say.</p>
<p>It’s not just a matter of wanting to take it slow. Since 2009, 400,000 of its customers have received smart meters, Dominion tells us, giving it ample time to try out all these features. It hasn’t.</p>
<p>Merely installing another 1.4 million smart meters isn’t going to lead to grid nirvana.</p>
<p>Grid “hardening” is another example.</p>
<p>Physical upgrades in the name of security and resilience make up more than $1.5 billion of Dominion’s proposed spending. This is not grid transformation, it’s the opposite: beefing up the old grid. Most of the proposed investments are the same kind of capital investments Dominion makes routinely, with nothing modernized about it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately,<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/2018/02/28/14773b9e-1730-11e8-8b08-027a6ccb38eb_story.html?utm_term=.596bd94e7851" target="_blank"> Dominion wrote the law</a> to give itself permission to use customer money for grid hardening, so all the SCC can do is ask whether the specific spending proposals are reasonable and prudent.</p>
<p>Again, since Dominion isn’t telling us what kind of grid it is building for us, there is no way to know whether any given project will contribute to it, or even be necessary at all.</p>
<p>If the grid of the future will be based on distributed energy, microgrids, and consumer control, we might not need the substation Dominion wants to make into an impregnable fortress. Modern solutions like solar-plus-storage, demand response, and energy efficiency could provide greater resiliency and security at a lower cost.</p>
<p>Of course, we have every reason to suspect Dominion is not interested in building a grid that empowers consumers, lowers energy use and spurs private investment in solar and storage. Its business model depends on keeping control over the grid and getting people to use more energy rather than less. If it can’t do that, it figures, the next best thing is to find ways to spend our money.</p>
<p>The amount of customer money at stake makes the SCC’s oversight role very important. It can insist Dominion lay out its full vision for the grid, demonstrate how each spending item fits that vision, and prove it meets a consumer cost-benefit test. With a little dose of courage, it could even go further and insist on seeing a plan that makes full use of smart meters, including time-of-use rates and other incentives for efficiency, solar and storage.</p>
<p>The General Assembly, too, has a role to play, by filling a vacancy on the SCC this summer. If legislators are unhappy with Dominion’s cavalier approach to spending, they have one last chance to appoint a commissioner who will side with consumers, and send Dominion back to the drawing board.</p>

<p>But the battle still rages on quietly behind the scenes as the state works to create the regulations that would govern the newly independent nurse practitioners.</p>
<p>Autonomous practice authority has been a goal of nurse practitioners for years. They shouldn’t have to work under a physician’s supervision, they argue, if they’re doing what they’ve been trained to do and have enough experience.</p>
<p>Doctors disagree. As <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+sum+HB793" target="_blank">House Bill 793</a> made its way precariously through the General Assembly earlier this year, physicians argued in packed committee rooms that nurse practitioners just don’t have enough training or education.</p>
<p>Lawmakers ultimately sided with nurse practitioners, though, requiring them to have five years of clinical experience before practicing independently.</p>
<p>But now the state boards of medicine and nursing have been tasked with developing the regulations governing autonomous nurse practitioners, revealing continued friction among some medical groups over what nurse practitioners should be able to do and what five years really means.</p>
<p>It’s been a cumbersome process since the law was passed earlier this year because the boards must reach a joint consensus.</p>
<p>So far in joint board meetings, one of the biggest areas of contention has been how many hours nurse practitioners should be required to work in those five years. Doctors argue fiercely that 40 hours a week and 2,000 hours a year should be the minimum requirement.</p>
<p>But nurse practitioners have pointed out that some hospital jobs are considered full-time with 32- or 36-hour work weeks, and so 1,600 hours per year, equaling 8,000 hours in five years, is more reasonable, they contend.</p>
<p>In public comments, the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association supported 1,600 hours, while the Medical Society of Virginia, the Virginia Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Virginia College of Emergency Physicians expressed support for 2,000 hours a year, or 10,000 over the five years.</p>
<p>Several doctors on the Board of Medicine’s executive committee expressed similar concerns during Friday’s meeting, and ultimately agreed on a compromise of 9,000 hours within those five years.</p>
<p>But the Board of Nursing must sign off on that decision before it becomes final.</p>
<p>The debate over autonomous practice has revealed the rifts in the state’s medical landscape, where different providers have conflicting ideas of how to ensure patient safety.</p>
<p>Nurse practitioners say they should be able to practice to the full extent of their training, particularly in light of the <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/tapping-nurse-practitioners-to-meet-rising-demand-for-primary-care/" target="_blank">nationwide provider shortage</a> that is most keenly felt in rural areas. Many argue that, even when they have a collaborating physician to work with, they often make decisions about patient care on their own.</p>
<p>Doctors claim that nurse practitioners don’t have the same training and education, and that working without a collaborating physician could erode patient safety.</p>
<p>Nurse practitioners are typically required to complete master’s programs that can take one to three years, while doctors must complete four years of medical school, then residency programs that can last three to five years.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why nurse practitioners need closer to 10,000 hours of practice before they can be autonomous, said Ralston King, assistant vice president of government affairs with the Medical Society of Virginia. Medical residents would likely have at least that many hours under the belt before they are allowed to practice autonomously as doctors.</p>
<p>But Cindy Fagan, the government relations chair with the Virginia Council of Nurse Practitioners, pointed out that nurse practitioners are qualified, licensed nurses before they pursue their higher education.</p>
<p>&#8220;We practice for a number of years as registered nurses before we go on to attain additional education,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>And autonomous nurse practitioners aren&#8217;t trying to provide the services licensed doctors do, she added. They are trying to operate within the scope of their practice, which is not as broad as a doctor&#8217;s.</p>
<p>She said most other states that allow autonomous practice require around 3,000 hours. If Virginia&#8217;s regulations ultimately require 9,000 hours, she said, the state would be a significant outlier.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s absolutely no evidence to support that this number of hours yields higher quality care or more competent practitioners,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Winifred Y. Carson-Smith, a lawyer representing the Virginia Council of Nurse Practitioners, said she suspects doctors don’t want nurse practitioners to practice autonomously because they fear they’ll lose money.</p>
<p>She said some physicians see nurse practitioners as &#8220;taking away from their practices and the money that they will make.”</p>
<p>King denied that was a motive, adding that doctors are first and foremost concerned with their patients’ well-being.</p>
<p>“The entire purpose of becoming a physician is to take care of patients and to maintain patient safety,” he said.</p>

It leaves a wide range of interpretation for the state Board of Elections to apply the law. From the Board of Elections agenda.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Election Day in 2017, <a href="https://www.albemarle.org/department.asp?department=bos&amp;relpage=22356" target="_blank">Ned Gallaway</a> realized 50 of his campaign signs were missing something: A sentence about who paid for them.</span></p>

The state fined him $400 for the missing sentence under the Stand By Your Ad law. From the Board of Elections meeting agenda.</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gallaway, running unopposed for the Albemarle County Board of Supervisors, found each sign and added the phrase &#8220;Paid for and authorized by Ned Gallaway for Supervisor,” by hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was embarrassing,&#8221; he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Failing to add the disclosure statement was also a violation of <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title24.2/chapter9.5/" target="_blank">Virginia’s Stand By Your Ad law.</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gallaway didn’t know what to do when he noticed his error on Election Day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And there’s no clarity on how a candidate should pay fines. Should they pay out of pocket or from campaign committees, which are funded by supporters’ donations?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campaign ad laws are campaign finance laws at their core, said Alex Keena, a Virginia Commonwealth University political science professor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So Virginia’s law, which closely mirrors the federal version, doesn’t address content and isn’t very strong, Keena said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There isn’t a lot of teeth,” he said. “It limits the tools for states to monitor their own elections.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gallaway reported himself as breaking the law, and in May the Virginia Board of Elections charged him a $400 fine for the missing disclosure statements on his signs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same meeting, though, the board struggled with what to do when candidates report themselves, which political entities are subject to the law and when it’s appropriate to charge more or less for a violation.</span></p>
<p>Under Virginia&#8217;s law, determining violations and setting fines are up to the board.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It makes it hard for board members to know if they’re making fair decisions and difficult for candidates to understand the process, including how to pay the fine once it&#8217;s decided.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Department of Elections is working on more specific policies to give more clarity on when the board should hear a complaint and how much to fine charge offending candidates and organizations. </span></p>
<p>One thing the Department of Elections doesn&#8217;t appear to tackling though is whether candidates should be allowed to pay from campaign committees. Right now, t<span style="font-weight: 400;">he law doesn’t say how violations should be paid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the <a href="http://cfreports.sbe.virginia.gov/" target="_blank">most recently filed campaign finance reports</a>, Gallaway, Del. Cheryl Turpin, D-Virginia Beach, and 2017 GOP gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie paid their fines from campaign money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gallaway said he use campaign funds because he felt like it was the most transparent way to pay. Otherwise, his constituents may never know he made a mistake.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To me it keeps everything clean and above board,” he said. He may reimburse his campaign fund with personal money for the fine, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gillespie and Turpin didn’t respond to requests for comment on why they opted to pay from their campaign committees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turpin was penalized for an incomplete disclosure statement on a last-minute flyer in the 85th House District that <a href="https://pilotonline.com/news/government/virginia/article_5cad4186-5d2d-11e8-8bee-d31e0806a75d.html" target="_blank">called her Republican opponent Rocky Holcomb “racist.”</a> He reported the ad to the Department of Elections for its content, which he said was baseless. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When election officials reviewed the complaint, they discovered the disclosure statement was incomplete. They never waded into whether Turpin&#8217;s allegations were out-of-bounds. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_945" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-945" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Holcombad-300x201.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="201" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Holcombad-300x201.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Holcombad-768x515.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Holcombad-696x466.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Holcombad-627x420.jpg 627w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Holcombad.jpg 815w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Del. Cheryl Turpin, D-Virginia Beach, was fined $200 for an incomplete disclosure statement on a campaign flyer. Her opponent Rocky Holcomb reported it for its content. From the Board of Elections meeting agenda.</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are certain things that are off-limits, in my opinion,” Holcomb said. “We don’t want to restrict folks from speaking their mind, but there’s a responsibility that comes with that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some ways, the loose guidance on how to enforce Stand By Your Ad laws leaves room for it to be a proxy to punish candidates and organizations for overly negative messages, Keena said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year’s Republican candidate for governor, Ed Gillespie, was fined $2,000 for two television ads. It was the biggest fine handed down to the candidates and groups the board considered at its May meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gillespie was reported for running text on the screen at the same time as his disclosure statement. According to the law, disclosure statements have to appear alone onscreen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three of Gillespie&#8217;s ads were reported: One called out opponent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8P6x_KcGGI&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">Ralph Northam for skipping meetings of the state economic development agency</a>, one claimed Northam voted to allow sanctuary cities and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0UiqMDbpAw&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">“let dangerous illegal immigrants back on the street, increasing the threat of MS-13,”</a>; and another featured <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgRYsBrUbdQ&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">Danny Diggs,  the sheriff of York County and Poquoson, endorsing Gillespie.</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northam was also reported for issues with a disclosure statement on an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1pehIpRvo8&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">ad in which he called Gillespie “Enron Ed”</a> and linked him to lobbying work that led to education budget cuts and outsourcing jobs. State staff didn’t find issues with Northam’s ad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike flyers and yard signs, the board had no previous rulings on television ads, policy analyst Arielle Schneider said in May, and the rules are “nuanced,” according to <a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/Files/Media/Agendas/2018/20180521Minutes.pdf" target="_blank">minutes of the meeting.</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clara Belle Wheeler, vice-chair of the board, said lawmakers needed to be more careful drafting laws. It seems the law’s intent is to ensure clear disclosure, which Gillespie’s ads did, she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wheeler, who </span><a href="http://www.winchesterstar.com/news/winchester/state-board-of-elections-official-talks-voter-fraud-with-gop/article_1fb81735-247f-507f-a237-e843a1c93785.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stumped for the Republican Party during the 2017 election,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> abstained from voting on Gillespie’s fine.</span></p>
<p>Virginia&#8217;s law means well, Keena said. It&#8217;s important for voters to know who sponsors the negative messages that often end up in campaign ads.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If you don’t, then you have a breakdown of trust,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But being able to pay out of campaign committee bank accounts isn’t much of a punishment for candidates running in expensive races, Keena said. Last year’s gubernatorial contest, for example, </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/record-shattering-virginia-fundraising-leaves-candidates-neck-and-neck-in-money-race/2017/10/31/6455d518-be38-11e7-959c-fe2b598d8c00_story.html?utm_term=.7c2278310d2e" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">was a $20 million race.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In smaller races, any fine is a big deal because it could make voters think candidates are diving into the gutter, Gallaway said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It could hurt a campaign more than any ad,” he said.</span></p>

( 2018 file photo by Robert Zullo / Virginia Mercury).  </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BUCKINGHAM — The sermon came from Ezekiel 33:7. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me,” the verse reads. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, from the pulpit at Union Hill Baptist Church during a Sunday service last month, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pastor Paul Wilson was fully embracing the role, telling his congregation of about two dozen that morning about his growing notoriety for speaking out about one of Virginia’s most contested infrastructure projects, Dominion Energy&#8217;s <a href="https://atlanticcoastpipeline.com/" target="_blank">Atlantic Coast Pipeline</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Everybody in Southside Virginia knows who this preacher is,” Wilson said, his cadence swinging between mellow and wrathful. “It was simply because I’m doing what watchmen are supposed to be doing: crying out, just being a voice in the wilderness.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wilson’s modest brick church in the verdant Buckingam countryside, near where a nearly 54,000-horsepower compressor station for the pipeline is planned, has become a main hub of heated opposition to the project, <a href="https://news.duke-energy.com/releases/duke-energy-piedmont-natural-gas-select-dominion-to-build-550-mile-atlantic-coast-pipeline-to-transport-natural-gas-from-west-virginia-to-eastern-north-carolina" target="_blank">proposed four years ago</a> by a group of energy companies lead by Dominion to serve utilities in Virginia and North Carolina and advancing steadily toward full construction in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They want to shut us up,” Wilson told the congregation. “This church is too loud. It’s too vocal. It&#8217;s getting to be a problem for Dominion.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Earlier this year, though, the formidable energy company, the biggest corporate donor to Virginia political campaigns and possessed of <a href="https://www.richmond.com/business/local/dominion-wields-influence-with-political-contributions-charitable-donations/article_f86c5bce-7e0c-5bd9-97eb-3892cffe03ed.html" target="_blank">other levers of power</a> to get its way, brought in a new &#8220;community liaison&#8221; to work in Union Hill.</p>
<p>He was a familiar face: former Virginia Secretary of Agriculture and Forestry Basil Gooden, whose family has deep roots in the community and who is a member of Wilson&#8217;s congregation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dominion picked the right one because he’s trustworthy. He articulates Dominion’s position better than Dominion,&#8221; Wilson said in an interview. &#8220;They’ve always tried to dismiss us as being nonexistent, that we really weren&#8217;t there. Dominion miscalculated plain and simple and they realize it. If there&#8217;s any entity that can stop the whole process, it would be the church and Dominion has started to realize it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gooden says he was brought on as a paid consultant by the company in the spring, but doesn&#8217;t see it as his job to sell people on the project.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don’t know if Dominion did everything right from the outset. I don’t know if they&#8217;re saying &#8216;Now we have a problem, let’s bring Basil in and he’ll smooth it over,'&#8221; Gooden said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not my role to smooth over anything Dominion is doing.”</p>
<p>Instead, he said his mission is to ensure &#8220;the community&#8217;s voices are heard, and not just the loudest voice in the room&#8221; and also to put the &#8220;community&#8217;s economic interests&#8221; first.</p>
<p>“I know it’s heartfelt opposition,&#8221; Gooden said.  &#8220;But again, my community as been in decline for many years. And I didn’t see many people taking interest in my community until something came to the forefront that they opposed.&#8221;</p>
<p>On one thing, he and Wilson agree: If the community has to live with the compressor station, and the noise and emissions that come with it, they need to be compensated. Wilson said millions have already been offered through back channels.</p>
<p>&#8220;It hasn&#8217;t been officially offered. It was presented to me through the back door,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The worst outcome, Gooden said, would be for the &#8220;community to have a compressor station there and nothing to show for it.”</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;NO ONE&#8217;S SAID A WORD&#8217;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 600-mile, 42-inch diameter natural gas pipeline, planned to run from West Virginia through Virginia and into the eastern third of North Carolina, with a spur to Hampton Roads, will cut through farms, forest, fields, rivers and streams from Highland County to Chesapeake.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only one Virginia county, however, is being asked to host a compressor station for the project, the grouping of massive gas-powered turbines that push the product through the pipeline. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion plans to place the compressor station on a 65-acre site about a mile away from the Union Hill Baptist church but much closer to some of Wilson’s congregation and other members of the largely black community. Many trace their roots to the freedmen who lived in the area after the Civil War and before it the slaves who labored on the former plantation that <a href="https://www.southernenvironment.org/inthepath/" target="_blank">comprises part of the compressor station site. </a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ella Rose, 74, who retired to the Union Hill area about six years ago and cherishes the turkey, deer and other wildlife she sees from her home, says she&#8217;ll be about 150 feet from the station’s property line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They’re practically up in my house and no one’s said a word,” she said.  “They can at least offer me some compensation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the pipeline has cleared a series of regulatory hurdles—  despite an </span><a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/pipeline-projects-hit-legal-snags-in-federal-court-work-suspended/article_c9638d08-a416-5da3-8fce-669db3af50d4.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">all-out legal onslaught</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a variety of court venues to delay or derail the project — attention has shifted increasingly to the environmental justice ramifications of the project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal agencies like the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which approved the ACP last year, are required to consider whether effects on human health or the environment &#8220;would be disproportionately high and adverse for minority and low-income populations and appreciably exceed impacts on the general population or other comparison group.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relying on census tracts around the proposed station, FERC said &#8220;no.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But many would beg to differ, including members of the<a href="https://www.naturalresources.virginia.gov/initiatives/advisory-council-on-environmental-justice/" target="_blank"> Governor’s Advisory Council on Environmental Justice</a>, which met in Buckingham in May.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So too a group of 14 Democratic lawmakers who sent a letter to Northam late last month urging him to give the same attention to the Buckingham facility as the concerns he expressed about a proposed Dominion compressor station in Maryland <a href="https://wtop.com/virginia/2018/07/dominion-to-reconsider-facility-site-near-mount-vernon/" target="_blank">that might be visible from Mount Vernon.</a></span></p>
<figure id="attachment_967" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:696px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-967" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_1234-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="696" height="522" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_1234-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_1234-300x225.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_1234-768x576.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_1234-80x60.jpg 80w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_1234-265x198.jpg 265w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_1234-696x522.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_1234-1068x801.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_1234-560x420.jpg 560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_1234.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A sign at the edge of property along South James River Road in Buckingham County that Dominion Energy has purchased for a proposed compressor station.

<p>&#8220;What about the impact of such pipeline compressors on the people whose ancestors suffered as slaves in Virginia before the Civil War emancipated them? Should they have to breathe the toxic methane gas combustions that will result from the operations of a gigantic compressor forced upon their historic African-American freedmen property in Union Hill?&#8221; the lawmakers wrote. &#8220;We hope you will share your deep concerns about the impacts of a compressor station on this historic property in Virginia as you did about a similar compressor in Maryland.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ofirah Yheskel, the governor&#8217;s spokeswoman, said the governor&#8217;s office has met with &#8220;members of the community on multiple occasions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The governor is concerned about environmental justice issues and has asked DEQ to follow all laws and regulations with a sensitivity toward the environmental justice concerns of the community,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the Department of Environmental Quality published <a href="https://www.deq.virginia.gov/Portals/0/DEQ/Air/BuckinghamCompressorStation/21599_BCS_DRAFT_Permit.pdf" target="_blank">a draft air permit</a> for the compressor station, which contains a range of proposed emissions limits for the pollutants from the facility.</p>
<p>And though Mike Dowd, the DEQ&#8217;s air division director, has said the compressor station will be &#8220;among the most, if not the most stringently controlled compressor station in the country,&#8221; the words &#8220;environmental justice&#8221; do not appear in the draft permit. That&#8217;s because Virginia has no laws requiring the DEQ to take environmental justice issues into account when issuing permits for facilities.</p>
<p>“There are no laws in Virginia,&#8221; said Ann Regn, a DEQ spokeswoman. &#8220;We rely on the federal analysis of environmental justice.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>‘THAT’S THE WAY THE INDUSTRY DOES’</strong> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wilson and others say it’s no accident Dominion picked their community. For one, the ACP must intersect with the existing Transco pipeline that runs through the area and the compressor station must be near that junction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Also, they need to have a major road,” Wilson said. “And because this is a predominantly black community where you have less clout and less voice. … That&#8217;s the way the industry does.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion spokesman Aaron Ruby, in an interview last month, said the location was chosen solely based on the proximity to the Transco system. Of two properties the company purchased in the area, the final site on South James River Road was the more suitable, he said.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_966" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:696px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" id="longdesc-return-966" class="wp-image-966 size-large" tabindex="-1" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_1233-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="696" height="522" longdesc="https://www.virginiamercury.com?longdesc=966&amp;referrer=936" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_1233-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_1233-300x225.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_1233-768x576.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_1233-80x60.jpg 80w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_1233-265x198.jpg 265w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_1233-696x522.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_1233-1068x801.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_1233-560x420.jpg 560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_1233.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A sign on State Route 663 in Buckingham County registers opposition to Dominion&#8217;s Atlantic Coast Pipeline and a proposed compressor station the company plans to site nearby.</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s Environmental Impact Statement says the other location “would require additional pipeline and would increase the construction footprint of ACP.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agency’s analysis concluded that “operation of the compressor stations would not cause or contribute to a violation of the federal air quality standards; therefore, we do not believe health would be adversely affected or that the alternative site would be necessary for reasons of air quality or public health.”</span></p>
<p>Northam&#8217;s Advisory Council on Environmental Justice is meeting Thursday to finalize their recommendations on the pipeline and the compressor station. If past is prologue, they will include calls to move the compressor station and possibly a recommendation to declare a moratorium on new natural gas infrastructure, which were consensus draft recommendations at the last meeting.</p>
<p>A moratorium on new gas infrastructure, of course, is beyond any governor&#8217;s power.</p>
<p>But how forcefully the council pushes the issue could put Northam, who rode the fence on the pipelines during his campaign last year and has faced mounting pressure to do something about them since he took office, in an awkward spot.</p>
<p>Northam got <a href="https://www.vpap.org/candidates/67038/donors_per_industry/165?start_year=all&amp;end_year=all&amp;contrib_type=all" target="_blank">lots of money</a> from environmental groups during his campaign and styles himself a steward of the environment, at least when it comes to the <a href="https://www.delmarvanow.com/story/news/2018/06/04/northam-help-clean-bay-his-backyard/668644002/" target="_blank">Chesapeake Bay</a>.</p>
<p>But the <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/environmental-groups-say-virginia-state-water-control-board-must-deny/article_6303b6b4-be61-550c-bc2f-3c8a8cf6b3c4.html" target="_blank">criticism of how the DEQ has handled</a> the water permitting process for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the separate Mountain Valley Pipeline under construction now, the <a href="https://www.roanoke.com/news/local/franklin_county/virginia-regulators-accuse-mountain-valley-pipeline-of-erosion-violations/article_d314b3a2-166b-5a86-8c40-29696127865c.html" target="_blank">erosion and sediment control failures</a> that happened immediately with MVP construction and <a href="https://www.dailyprogress.com/newsvirginian/news/politics/deq-cites-atlantic-coast-pipeline-for-tree-felling-violations/article_291550ee-2983-11e8-b231-33b95a0051e6.html" target="_blank">tree-felling violations</a> with the Atlantic Coast Pipeline have not moved him to action yet.</p>
<p>Wilson thinks there&#8217;s still time.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a done deal and I think that we&#8217;re being heard and we&#8217;re being heard by some of the right people who have some pull,&#8221; Wilson said. &#8220;A lot of the politicians are flipping. Gov. Northam is on the fence. &#8230; He&#8217;s actually waiting until the last minute as to whether he&#8217;s going to flip or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s getting close to the last minute, though, and lots of people have been waiting, so far in vain, for Northam to take a forceful stand on the projects.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>In a significant victory for environmental groups and other opponents of the Mountain Valley Pipeline, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit in Richmond has vacated approvals that allowed the 300-mile natural gas pipeline, which is currently under construction, to cross the Jefferson National Forest near the Virginia-West Virginia border.</p>
<p>In response to a case brought by a group of organizations opposed to the project, a panel of judges ruled that the U.S. Forest Service and the federal Bureau of Land Management&#8217;s decisions ran afoul of the National Environmental Policy Act, the National Forest Management Act and the Mineral Leasing Act.</p>
<p>&#8220;MVP’s proposed project would be the largest pipeline of its kind to cross the Jefferson National Forest,&#8221; the opinion says. &#8220;American citizens understandably place their trust in the Forest Service to protect and preserve this country’s forests, and they deserve more than silent acquiescence to a pipeline company’s justification for upending large swaths of national forestlands.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nathan Matthews, an attorney with the Sierra Club, one of the groups that brought the case, called the decision &#8220;great news&#8221; for &#8220;everyone who cares about clean water and pristine forests.&#8221; The decision comes as MVP, which is planned to run from Wetzel County, W.V., to Pittsylvania County in southwest Virginia, <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/environmental-regulators-again-cite-the-mountain-valley-pipeline/article_8d2fab00-bd8a-5184-b463-a0e919000117.html" target="_blank">has racked up a string of violations</a> from environmental regulators in Virginia and West Virginia.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have said all along that we can’t trust Mountain Valley Pipeline to protect Virginia’s water, so it’s refreshing to see the court refuse to take them at their word,&#8221; Matthews said. &#8220;We aren’t buying the gas industry’s claims about their water protection methods and now the courts aren’t either. MVP should immediately halt all work in the publicly-owned Jefferson National Forest.&#8221;</p>
<p>A spokesman for the pipeline&#8217;s developers, led by EQT Midstream Partners of Pittsburgh, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>In the case of the Forest Service, the court ruled that agency failed to make an independent review of the risk of increased sedimentation in the Jefferson National Forest as a result of pipeline construction. It also failed to get answers to concerns the agency itself had raised on early drafts of MVP&#8217;s plans before signing off on the <a href="https://www.ferc.gov/industries/gas/enviro/eis/2017/06-23-17-FEIS.asp" target="_blank">Federal Energy Regulatory Commission&#8217;s Environmental Impact Statement</a> for the project.</p>
<p>&#8220;We discern no evidence that the Forest Service undertook the required independent review of the EIS’s sedimentation analysis. Nor can we ascertain how the Forest Service concluded that its comments had been satisfied, especially after having<br />
expressed such grave concerns about the sedimentation,&#8221; Judge Stephanie Thacker wrote.</p>
<p>David Sligh, a former Virginia DEQ engineer and conservation director for Wild Virginia, said Trump administration officials &#8220;betrayed our trust and ignored the good work of Forest Service experts, placing corporate profits above the rights of citizens who use and value these precious natural treasures.”</p>
<p>The decision, he added, &#8220;upholds the principle that agencies responsible for protecting the public’s lands and resources must conduct thorough and honest reviews and reject proposals that would harm our interests.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pipeline opponents said the decision has ramifications beyond the imminent halt of work along the 3.5 mile section of the pipeline route through the forest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since the same panel of judges is also reviewing the coalition’s same arguments against Virginia’s certification of MVP pursuant to section 401 of the Clean Water Act, it could mean trouble for the MVP’s route in the entirety of Virginia,&#8221; the Sierra Club said in a statement.  A similar challenge of Virginia&#8217;s certification of the <a href="https://atlanticcoastpipeline.com/?gclid=CjwKCAjwhevaBRApEiwA7aT534vup1QiecaSd3GgHQrryzCv4laDvKHfuR3H2vYS5J9JLGzaSLtOVxoCfJ8QAvD_BwE" target="_blank">Dominion Energy-led Atlantic Coast Pipeline</a>, which will cut through more than a dozen counties, is scheduled for a hearing Sept. 28.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>With a crucial meeting of the State Water Control Board looming next month on water-quality reviews for a pair of contentious natural gas pipelines, Democratic state lawmakers again urged Gov. Ralph Northam Thursday to halt the projects and insist on a stream-by-stream review of the hundreds of spots where they will cross Virginia waterways.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that your clear and bold leadership on pipelines at this critical time can restore the faith that many of our constituents have lost in their governments’ ability to fight for the public’s interest, at a time when that faith is so desperately needed,&#8221; the 14 lawmakers wrote.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/general-assembly/anger-over-pipelines-spills-into-general-assembly/article_60a21d92-9d4f-5804-9e99-22c706c4cb5b.html" target="_blank">several junctures</a> since he was elected last year, opponents of the Mountain Valley and Atlantic Coast pipelines have asked Northam, a Democrat who campaigned on holding the pipeline projects to the highest environmental standards, to live up to that promise, thus far unsuccessfully.</p>
<p>Northam and his Department of Environmental Quality have maintained they have subjected the pipelines to the most rigorous review ever performed in Virginia, though the DEQ has acknowledged it has never before handled a project the size and scope of either pipeline.</p>
<p>But a slew of sediment-laden runoff from Mountain Valley Pipeline work, which prompted<a href="https://www.roanoke.com/news/local/environmental-regulators-cite-mountain-valley-pipeline-again/article_f9fec22c-b5fc-5c15-bf75-1aaf5fbdd86e.html" target="_blank">  violation notices from regulators</a> and a temporary stop work order, have raised new questions about the adequacy of the DEQ&#8217;s review. In a separate letter last week, Sen. John Edwards, D-Roanoke, also urged Northam to put a stop to the MVP construction.</p>
<div class="subscriber-only">
<p class="">“It is not an overstatement to say that science dictates that this pipeline cannot be safely built in this area,” <a href="https://bluevirginia.us/2018/07/virginia-state-sen-john-edwards-to-gov-ralph-northam-it-is-not-an-overstatement-to-say-that-science-dictates-that-the-mountain-valley-pipeline-cannot-be-safely-built-in-this-area" target="_blank">Edwards wrote</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/west-virginia/articles/2018-06-07/none-hurt-in-natural-gas-pipeline-explosion-in-west-virginia" target="_blank">explosion of a brand new gas pipeline</a> in West Virginia has also stirred fears.</p>
<p class="">A spokeswoman for Northam did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.</p>
</div>
<p>Among those signing the letter were members of a cadre of first-time Democratic delegates <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/thirteen-candidates-who-refused-dominion-money-win-seats-in-general/article_4b0821c1-8a19-5e35-bdc8-919fcae45a0b.html" target="_blank">who refused </a> campaign contributions last year from Dominion Energy, the state&#8217;s largest utility and the lead partner on the 600-mile Atlantic Coast Pipeline, which will carve through a dozen Virginia counties.</p>
<p>However, more veteran lawmakers, including Del. Ken Plum of Fairfax County, who has been in the House since 1982 and counts <a href="https://www.vpap.org/candidates/37/top_donors/" target="_blank">Dominion as his top donor</a>, and Del. Mark Keam, who conspicuously &#8220;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/all-opinions-are-local/wp/2018/03/15/why-im-breaking-up-with-dominion-energy/?utm_term=.582eccde08a3" target="_blank">broke up</a>&#8221; with Dominion earlier this year, also signed the letter.</p>
<p>The lawmakers referenced the massive compressor station Dominion wants to site in a predominately black rural community in Buckingham County and the inadequacy of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permit the state is relying on for the hundreds of spots the pipelines will cross Virginia waters. As many have before and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PH3UIcuR7d4" target="_blank">as Northam himself</a> called for on the campaign trail, they urged for DEQ to conduct its own review of crossings.</p>
<p>&#8220;We also ask you to direct the DEQ to stop work on all construction activities for these two projects until those analyses are complete,&#8221; they wrote. &#8220;Stream-by-stream analysis is a commonsense solution that environmental experts agree is the appropriate process for these circumstances.  You agreed with this standard and forcefully advocated for such analysis in early 2017. We hope you will agree that it is time for DEQ to do this robust study now.&#8221;</p>

																						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="250" height="201" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/REC_TEC_centered_4color-thmb.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="" style="margin-bottom: 10px;" decoding="async" loading="lazy" /><p style="font-size:12px;"></p><p>Members of Rappahannock Electric Cooperative, Virginia&#8217;s largest co-op, have filed a petition with the State Corporation Commission in an effort to force a vote on more transparency at the organization, which provides electricity to more than 160,000 member owners in parts of 22 Virginia counties.</p>
<p>Behind the petition —which seeks an injunction from regulators at the commission that would force the cooperative&#8217;s board to put a series of proposed by-law changes to the membership for a vote — are founding members of the Repower REC group, which describes itself as a &#8220;grassroots coalition of concerned REC members&#8221; working with <a href="https://www.solarunitedneighbors.org/virginia/" target="_blank">Solar United Neighbors of Virginia</a>, a nonprofit that pushes for more solar options.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many cooperative members don’t know they are owners of their electric company or that they have a say in its governance,&#8221; Solar United Neighbors of Virginia says on its website. &#8220;As a result, many rural electric cooperatives are still controlled by insiders who favor the status quo. Too many rural electric cooperatives still heavily rely on coal-fired power and see renewable energy as a threat to their customer base, rather than an opportunity for their members.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Repower REC campaign says it wants &#8220;a more transparent and democratic&#8221; cooperative, to help REC members &#8220;reclaim their roles as owners of a democratically-controlled enterprise and to advocate for the fair and equitable treatment of distributed energy resources such as rooftop solar.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://repowerrec.com/resources/repower-rec-solutions/" target="_blank">by-law changes</a> the group wants a vote on:</p>
<ul>
<li>allowing co-op members to attend or observe board of directors meetings and requiring the board to post videos of meetings.</li>
<li>requiring REC to disclose the total compensation paid annually to each board member.</li>
<li>new rules around proxy ballots for voting on board members. The board encourages co-op members to cast blank proxy ballots, ceding power to the board to control election outcomes, the group contends.</li>
</ul>
<p>The group argues that the lack of transparency around board meetings makes it &#8220;nearly impossible to determine whether REC board members are informed and engaged&#8221;  and &#8220;impossible for members to cast informed votes for board candidates.&#8221;</p>
<p>The petitioners are longtime REC members John Levasseur, a retired U.S. Army brigadier general and former member of the REC board of directors, retired educator Michael Murphy and retired lawyer Seth Heald. The non-profit public interest law firm Appalachian Mountain Advocates filed the petition on their behalf.</p>
<figure id="attachment_778" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:320px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-778 size-full" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/REC-territory-map-2012_000.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="278" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/REC-territory-map-2012_000.jpg 320w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/REC-territory-map-2012_000-300x261.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A group of Rappahannock Electric Cooperative members are pushing for more transparency from the board of the co-op, Virginia&#8217;s biggest.</p></figure>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;All we’re asking is that REC’s board members live up to the cooperative principles they claim to follow,” Murphy said in a statement. “We attempted to discuss our proposed reforms with the full board, but were told that the board did not want to engage in a ‘dialogue’ with us. We’re hoping our SCC filing will lead eventually to a constructive dialogue with board members and significant reforms at REC.”</p>
<p>There are 13 electric cooperatives in Virginia. Together, they serve roughly 18 percent of Virginia electric consumers, according to the SCC.</p>
<p>“We’re proposing modest, reasonable reforms,” Heald said. “Virginia law grants electric co-op members the right to propose bylaw amendments for a membership vote. REC’s board exceeded its authority in barring us from exercising that basic right.”</p>
<p>In a statement, Matt Faulconer, a spokesman for the cooperative, said the board of directors &#8220;fully respects our members and the democratic process of governing their cooperative,&#8221; adding that it was &#8220;unfortunate&#8221; the issue was brought to the SCC.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are especially concerned about the increasing costs of addressing this unnecessary challenge and the burden it will ultimately create for the rest of our nearly 150,000 members,&#8221; Faulconer said. &#8220;The claims expressed by these three are about processes and personal preferences, not substance. The focus of REC’s Board, management and employees is the best interest of our membership as a whole and in accomplishing our mission of providing safe, reliable, and affordable electric service. We always have and will continue to explore opportunities and processes that aid in accomplishing that mission.&#8221;</p>
<p>Faulconer said the petition will be &#8220;addressed within the applicable legal forums.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Threats and actual litigation by special interest groups at the detriment of our membership must be defended,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Rappahannock Electric Cooperative could not be reached Thursday. However, the co-op says that the nine members of the board of directors, who are elected by REC members, <a href="http://www.myrec.coop/aboutus/Board-of-directors.cfm" target="_blank">are not salaried employees</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are provided a retainer fee of $2,000 per month and $500 per diem when attending official meetings and duties on behalf of REC,&#8221; the co-op says on its website.  &#8220;In addition to attending monthly meetings for vooperative business, the directors continuously educate themselves about the complex electricity industry so that they make the best decisions for the cooperative and the members.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to REC&#8217;s 2016 tax return, provided by Heald, the board members&#8217; compensation ranged from a low of $13,500 to a high of $48,950 each for their part-time service, which was anywhere from five to 20 hours per week, depending on the member.</p>
<p>Heald&#8217;s compilation of tax filings shows REC has paid its board members more than $4.1 million over the past 11 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our bylaw amendment on this would just make it easier for all co-op members to see, including the many members who likely have no idea that the board of their nonprofit co-op is paid at all,&#8221; Heald said.</p>
<p><em>UPDATE: This story has been edited to add a response from Rappahannock Electric Cooperative.</em></p>

<p>“You can imagine what a nasty, monotonous, crab-smelling job this looks like to a high school kid,” he says.</p>
<p>And so for years, he’s relied on foreign, seasonal laborers from Mexico, which he hires legally through the federal H2B visa program.</p>
<p>But growing demand for seasonal workers as the economy has improved, combined with a decision by Congress last year to tighten the H2B program, left thousands of employers around the country competing for a maximum of 66,000 guest workers. That turned what had been a reliable source of labor into an annual lottery where the winners get the employees and the losers, well, don’t.</p>
<p>Graham said he was lucky this year and got visas for the 50 workers he needed this season. Others weren’t. Maryland crab houses were particularly hard hit, <a href="https://www.delmarvanow.com/story/money/2018/05/04/shortage-maryland-blue-crab-pickers-causes-seafood-shops-shutdown-h-2-b-visa-lottery/577930002/" target="_blank">and some shut down</a>. Graham says he can’t operate a $10 million-a-year business with that kind of uncertainty hanging over his head.</p>
<p>“One year I don’t get my people, I’m going to go out of business,” he said. “There’s just no alternative.”</p>
<p>Virginia businesses applied for permission to bring in over 4,000 foreign workers to fill seasonal jobs under the H2B program last year. Most — about half — were hired by landscaping companies. The seafood industry hired another 600. The rest went to companies seeking carnival attendants, housekeepers, ice cream truck drivers, lifeguards and other low-skill seasonal jobs that employers have said they can no longer find U.S. workers to fill.

<p>Exact statistics about demand this year aren’t yet available, but Gray Delany, the head of the Seasonal Employment Alliance, an industry group advocating on behalf of the program, estimated demand for workers outstripped supply by three to one.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time the program has run up against its cap — the last time was in 2008 just before the Great Recession. As the economy has improved since, demand for seasonal workers has steadily increased, he said. At the same time, the domestic supply has shrunk amid the improving job market.</p>
<p>Employers said the situation got worse last year, when Congress declined to renew a measure that had <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/homesec/R44306.pdf" target="_blank">exempted</a> workers who had previously received visas under the program from the cap. The decision came amid growing debate and polarization over immigration.</p>
<p>“The president supports the program but Congress has been unwilling to tackle this,” he said. “It’s slowly gotten worse, then we got thrown into the immigration debate even though it’s a nonimmigrant program.”</p>
<p>Indeed, several of President Donald Trump’s businesses rely on the program, including the resort known as the &#8220;Winter White House,&#8221; <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2018/07/06/mar-lago-foreign-worker-visas/764053002/" target="_blank">Mar-a-Lago</a>.</p>
<p>Delany argues the program shouldn’t get dragged into the immigration debate. The way it&#8217;s set up, employers must first advertise jobs locally and prove they couldn’t be filled. All the applications are vetted by the U.S. Department of Labor before they are filled. The guest workers who are hired stay in the U.S. for a maximum of eight to nine months before returning home.</p>
<p>He said if anything, the shortage of visas is increasing demand for undocumented workers.</p>
<p>“It’s so upside down,” he said.</p>
<p>It’s not just businesses that like the program. The seasonal workers say the ability to come work part of the year in the United States has changed their lives. And the wages they&#8217;re paid while they&#8217;re here are generally well above minimum wage: an average of about $15 an hour in Virginia last year, according to labor department data.</p>
<p>José Chicas has been driving an ice cream truck in the Richmond area since 2011. He says he makes about $3,000 a month, compared to about $200 a month he made working in a garment factory near his home in El Salvador.</p>
<p>“We are out of debt and we just have more opportunity for a better life,” he said.</p>
<p>So far, a political fix has been elusive.</p>
<p>U.S. Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine were among 18 lawmakers who wrote a letter to Senate leaders encouraging them to include language lifting the cap in the March omnibus spending bill. (The campaign for Corey Stewart, Kaine’s opponent in the coming election, did not respond to a question about his position on the issue Wednesday.)</p>
<p>The requested language was included and in May, the Department of Homeland Security announced it would release 15,000 more visas for the second year in a row and threw the issue back to Congress.</p>
<p>Kaine said in a statement he was disappointed the Trump administration didn&#8217;t go further and promised to continue to work on the issue. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has blamed the problem on Congress.</p>
<p>“We are once again in a situation where Congress has passed the buck and turned a decision over to DHS that would be better situated with Congress, who knows the needs of the program,” wrote Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen M. Nielsen in a <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/news/news-releases/dhs-announces-additional-visas-foreign-workers-assist-american-businesses-risk-failing" target="_blank">May statement</a>. &#8220;As Secretary, I remain committed to protecting U.S. workers and strengthening the integrity of our lawful immigration system and look forward to working with Congress to do so.”</p>
<p>Advocates for the program are now focused on lobbying Congress for a permanent fix, describing the 15,000 additional workers made available by DHS as “too little too late.”</p>

(State Library and Archives of Florida)</p><p>In May, Illinois became the <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-met-equal-rights-amendment-illinois-20180530-story.html" target="_blank">37th state</a> to sign off on the federal <a href="http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/" target="_blank">Equal Rights Amendment</a>, leaving the decades-long effort to guarantee men and women equal stature in the U.S. Constitution just one state shy of ratification.</p>
<p>Now advocates are looking to Virginia as the most likely candidate to tip the effort over the edge.</p>
<p>“It just seems like we’re poised to push it through this next session,” said Kati Hornung, a leader of VAratifyERA, a group that plans to roll out a renewed state-wide ratification campaign next month. She cited increased momentum following Illinois’ vote, a Republican chief patron for the legislation in the Virginia state Senate and efforts to address objections raised by opponents in years past.</p>
<p>The amendment was first proposed 95 years ago. Advocates say it remains important even as women have gained other important legal protections because women are still vulnerable in the federal judicial system, where, for instance, allegations of sexual discrimination are held to a lesser standard than allegations of racial discrimination.</p>
<p>But the measure has not fared well historically in the General Assembly, where Republican leaders have said they support equal rights for women but cited technical concerns that the Congressional deadline for ratification expired in 1982. The amendment’s supporters argue that Congress has the power to extend or eliminate the deadline and that it should not be a barrier to the measure’s consideration.</p>
<p>The chair of the Senate Rules Committee, Sen. Ryan T. McDougle, R-Hanover, told a packed hearing room during this year’s session that an official at the National Archives and Records Administration has informed him that the “the ERA is a ‘failed amendment’ and therefore improper for the General Assembly to vote on it,” according to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/virginias-hopes-of-era-ratification-go-down-in-flames-this-year/2018/02/09/7acfbf80-0dab-11e8-8890-372e2047c935_story.html?utm_term=.47c5fa573f7f" target="_blank">The Washington Post</a>.</p>
<p>The measure died in the committee on a 9-5 vote.</p>
<p>Since then, supporters have confirmed that the National Archives and Records Administration has not taken such a position.</p>
<p>“The Archivist of the United States has not taken such a stance and has never issued an opinion on this matter either officially or unofficially,” said the agency’s director of communications, James Pritchett, in a statement.</p>
<p>McDougle did not respond to a phone call seeking comment.</p>
<p>This year, advocates are also encouraging Republican supporters to play a more prominent role in the debate.</p>
<p>Among them is Sen. Glen Sturtevant, R-Richmond, who has agreed to shepherd the legislation through the Senate during the next session as its lead patron. He’s also hosting a screening of <a href="http://iron-jawed-angels.com/" target="_blank">“Iron Jawed Angels,”</a> a film following Alice Paul and other suffragists as they pushed for the right to vote.</p>
<p>“I’m hopeful that it will have a broader base of bipartisan support,” Sturtevant said. “It is truly one of the most common sense good things that we can and should do and that should be enshrined in the U.S. Constitution. It’s in the Virginia Constitution. It’s in the Code of Virginia. But it’s something that is not truly fully protected unless it’s in the U.S. Constitution.”</p>
<p>In past years, Sen. Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, has carried the Senate version of the bill. Like Sturtevant, he says he’s hopeful for passage in the coming session.</p>
<p>“I think there’s going to be tremendous pressure,” he said. “There’s going to be national interest. I’ve already had people from around the country calling me asking what needs to happen to get Virginia over the line.</p>
<p>“I think the issue is going to become a lot bigger than which committee it should be heard by or whether it should technically be ratified. If nobody&#8217;s noticed, women are pretty pissed off right now.”</p>

Image via the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.</p><p>The 600-mile Atlantic Coast Pipeline, the more than $6 billion natural gas project led by Dominion Energy, won approval to begin full construction in North Carolina today.</p>
<p>The decision by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission comes amid a federal court challenge that seeks to halt construction of the hotly contested pipeline following a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit in Richmond in May.</p>
<p>The court invalidated a key environmental review — finding it too vague to be enforced — that dealt with risks to sensitive species, a decision opponents of the project <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/did-court-ruling-stop-atlantic-coast-pipeline-construction-depends-on/article_c4d15837-2149-51aa-a9d3-a837c7528619.html" target="_blank">argued should have stopped it in its tracks</a>.</p>
<p>However, FERC has allowed the pipeline, which will run <a href="https://atlanticcoastpipeline.com/recent-updates/default.aspx#map" target="_blank">from West Virginia through much of central Virginia and the eastern third of North Carolina</a> to plow ahead in certain areas where it already has state approvals.</p>
<p>At issue in the federal court decision was the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service&#8217;s &#8220;incidental take statement,&#8221; which sets limits for harming or killing certain sensitive species along the pipeline route, including bats, fish, mussels and a nearly extinct bumblebee, among others.</p>
<p>The 4th Circuit has yet to release its full opinion, but Dominion and its partners, which includes North Carolina utility heavyweight Duke Energy, have argued the decision only affects limited portions of the route.</p>
<p>In a letter to FERC last month, the Fish and Wildlife Service said the take statement was only relevant to habitat and species in Virginia and West Virginia.</p>
<p>This afternoon, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission granted a notice to proceed to full construction for portions of the route in North Carolina.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have also reviewed the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s June 28, 2018, letter and have confirmed that no additional consultation under the Endangered Species Act is required for the areas subject to this notice to proceed,&#8221; wrote David Swearingen, a chief in the agency&#8217;s gas division.</p>
<p>But Patrick Hunter, a North Carolina attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, which handled the 4th Circuit case on behalf of environmental groups, said the consultation required by the Endangered Species Act isn&#8217;t a piecemeal approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an all or nothing sort of deal,&#8221; Hunter said. He noted that several months after the Fish and Wildlife Service issued its biological opinion last year, the yellow lance mussel, which could be affected by pipeline work in Virginia and North Carolina, was officially listed as a threatened species.</p>
<p>&#8220;These piecemeal authorizations of a project that doesn’t have all the approvals it needs just doesn&#8217;t make  sense,&#8221; Hunter said. A request that the 4th Circuit halt construction in pending before the court, he added.</p>
<p>Aaron Ruby, a Dominion spokesman, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Ruby told a<a href="https://www.wvnews.com/news/wvnews/ferc-issues-notice-to-proceed-for-atlantic-coast-pipeline-in/article_97578175-8d3a-5418-a896-94a819170fb9.html" target="_blank"> West Virginia news outlet</a> the FERC decision was &#8220;another major step forward for the project,&#8221; and &#8220;great news for the millions of consumers and businesses in our region who will soon have access to cleaner, lower-cost energy.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, in addition to objections over the use of eminent domain to seize land from property owners, <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/local/region/2018/06/07/Pipeline-explosion-moundsville-west-virginia/stories/201806070129" target="_blank">risk of explosion</a>, construction damage and opposition to new fossil-fuel infrastructure, major questions have arisen about the need for the pipeline, which has its origins in a 2014 joint request for proposals by Duke Energy and Piedmont Natural Gas and is intended mainly to serve utilities.</p>
<p>Cheryl LaFleur, a FERC commissioner, <a href="https://www.ferc.gov/media/statements-speeches/lafleur/2017/10-13-17-lafleur.asp#.W1eg8tJKhPY" target="_blank">concluded</a> that neither the ACP, nor the Mountain Valley Pipeline, which will run into southwest Virginia and potentially also into North Carolina, was in the public interest. <a href="http://augustacountyalliance.org/the-acp-in-a-nutshell/" target="_blank">Opponents have pointed</a> to the ACP&#8217;s use of captive utility ratepayers to pay for the project and the 14 percent rate of return FERC has approved.</p>
<p>The project still lacks an effective water quality certification and approvals related to erosion, sediment and stormwater controls from Virginia. Later this summer, the state Water Control Board is expected to revisit whether a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permit is adequate to protect Virginia waters from blasting, trenching and other construction methods that could dislodge sediment into streams, increase erosion and damage sensitive karst systems, porous formations that often link to springs and seeps.</p>

The two work at Goochland Cares' clothes closet and will qualify for Medicaid once Virginia expands its program on Jan. 1. (Katie O'Connor/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In May, when Virginia’s General Assembly passed a budget that includes expanding the state’s Medicaid program, Lisa Coles’ daughter came running into her bedroom, ecstatic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She said, ‘Mom, we’re going to get health insurance! It’s coming through!’” Coles, 49, recalled. “I said, ‘Yeah, girl, Jan. 1, we’re going to get it!’ I was so happy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coles and her husband know what it means to live in the Medicaid gap. Their income of about $1,300 per month is too high to qualify for the program, but too low for subsidies to afford an individual market plan.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It meant skipping trips to the emergency room when she hurt her ankle earlier this year or when he was having chest pains because they feared the bill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also meant leaving the hospital early after she had complications related to a miscarriage when she was in her 20s and needed surgery. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I had to just get myself together and just get up and go because I couldn’t afford to stay in there,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coles had followed the debate around expansion that has been raging in Virginia for years, as Republicans long resisted the efforts of former Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe to expand Medicaid. She said she was disappointed when the first General Assembly session ended this year without expansion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It’s awful, I’ve been feeling like I was lost,” she said. “You have a choice. If you get this health insurance, that means I won’t be able to work, I have to stay at home, and I wouldn’t be able to pay my electric bills, car insurance, I wouldn’t be able to take care of my kids.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But now, after Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam, a pediatric neurologist, and Republicans in the General Assembly hammered out a deal, she and her family will gain coverage next year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now we pass it around to everybody: ‘Don’t forget, we have to apply for health insurance,’” Coles said.</span></p>
<p><strong>SIX MONTHS AND COUNTING</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The decision to make Virginia <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/virginia-senate-approves-medicaid-expansion-to-400000-low-income-residents/2018/05/30/5df5e304-640d-11e8-a768-ed043e33f1dc_story.html?utm_term=.9fcda19fe1aa" target="_blank">the 33rd expansion state</a> immediately launched t<a href="http://www.dmas.virginia.gov/#/index" target="_blank">he Department of Medical Assistance Services</a>, which manages Medicaid in Virginia, onto a six-month trajectory to add an estimated 400,000 people to its roster by the beginning of 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And as the agency works toward Jan. 1, it must also eye other federal and local forces that could influence how expansion plays out and permanently alter how Medicaid operates in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To make expansion palatable to some Republicans, the General Assembly included a work requirement for able-bodied adults, but a similar provision was<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/29/health/kentucky-medicaid-work-rules.html" target="_blank"> just knocked down by a judge in Kentucky</a>, a decision that could directly affect Virginia’s program. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And before DMAS, as the state agency is known, lies the monumental task of contacting all 400,000 of those living in the Medicaid gap, some who might have no current connection to a government program and others who may be reluctant to apply again if they were rejected in the past.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s an aggressive timeline for us to be ready to go live with coverage on Jan. 1, 2019, but we are working hard and we’re confident we can make it,” said Dr. Jennifer Lee, DMAS’ director.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agency is pursuing two simultaneous tracks, she said. The first is the one that expands coverage and changes the eligibility criteria so new, low-income adults can enter the program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second is setting up the work requirements and cost-sharing provisions that were outlined in the state budget. Like other states, Virginia must submit a waiver application to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to implement the new requirements, essentially requesting to break federal rules on how Medicaid dollars can be spent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While coverage will certainly start on Jan. 1, the other elements of expansion, including the work requirement, could take much longer to implement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a Board of Medical Assistance Services meeting in late June, DMAS Chief Deputy Karen Kimsey said the agency is working to submit a “concept paper” to the federal government in the late summer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actually putting the work requirements into practice, though, could take much longer. Lee called it a complicated process that will require close work with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, so they might not be implemented until later on in 2019, or even 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until the federal government approves Virginia’s waiver, many questions will go unanswered, like what happens if a beneficiary does not pay premiums, or how work requirements will be fulfilled if a Medicaid member is in the process of applying for disability benefits, which can sometimes take up to three years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our first goal right now is to just get expansion happening: get 400,000 people enrolled and their health care started,” Kimsey told the board. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now, DMAS is telling potential new beneficiaries that changes involving workforce training and education are ahead, without going into specifics until all the uncertainties are finalized. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It’s a little premature to let people know at this point because some of it may change in negotiations with CMS, and also we’ve been told it might scare people from applying,” Kimsey said. “We really want people to get health coverage first and we’re working on that.” </span></p>
<p><b>&#8216;OUTREACH IS REALLY CRITICAL&#8217;</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 1.2 million adults in Virginia are currently covered under Medicaid, so adding the 400,000 in the expansion population will represent about a 33 percent increase for the state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has historically had one of the least generous Medicaid programs in the country. Under the state’s old rules, no childless adults are eligible at all, and a disabled adult cannot make more than $9,700 a year, or 80 percent of the federal poverty level. A family of three could not make more than $6,900 a year, about 33 percent of the federal poverty level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expansion represents a massive change in those eligibility rules, as those populations — people with disabilities, families and childless adults — will be able to make up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level after Jan. 1. The <a href="http://coverva.org/expansion/" target="_blank">new thresholds</a> are $16,754 for an individual and $28,677 for a family of three. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some, enrolling will be simple. There are roughly 120,000 people already enrolled in some government programs, such as the Governor’s Access Plan, or GAP, for those with serious mental illness, and those who have a partial benefit through the state’s family planning waiver. The state should be able to simply shift them into full Medicaid coverage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And DMAS can fairly easily contact those enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, said Jill Hanken, health care attorney with the Virginia Poverty Law Center. SNAP helps families to afford food, and was formerly called food stamps. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Identifying those populations and figuring out administratively how they can be most easily transferred to new eligibility makes sense for the individual because they will get more comprehensive and affordable health insurance, or health insurance for the first time, and it also makes sense for Virginia because the enhanced federal funding only starts to flow once people are enrolled in the program,” Hanken said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Good messaging and advertising and outreach is really critical to this.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kimsey, the agency’s chief deputy, said DMAS has convened focus groups on the newly eligible population and found that, while most express a desire to enroll in Medicaid, many are unaware that Virginia is due to expand the program. And fear of getting rejected a second time might keep some from applying at all. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So it’s going to be really important how we reach out to them, and how we message them,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some examples, she added, include bus signage or advertising in stores like Walmart. The <a href="http://coverva.org/" target="_blank">coverva.org</a> website will allow people to sign up for regular updates on when they can apply. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 100,000 people enrolled in individual health insurance marketplace plans who will now be eligible for Medicaid will also require outreach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nov. 1 to Dec. 15 is marketplace enrollment, and the marketplace will know that Virginia now has different Medicaid eligibility rules and will decline folks who reapply,” Hanken said. “But there are lots of intricacies about people who are already in a marketplace plan who will just renew, and we don’t want people to get multiple letters from multiple sources and get confused.” </span></p>
<p><b>WHAT ABOUT THAT WORK REQUIREMENT?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the state budget, the work requirement is called the “Training, Education, Employment and Opportunity Program,” meant &#8220;for every able-bodied, working-age adult enrolled in the Medicaid program to enable enrollees to increase their health and well-being through community engagement leading to self-sufficiency.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medicaid beneficiaries can satisfy the requirement in multiple ways other than working, such as through job-skills training or enrolling in an education program. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most current Medicaid recipients will likely be exempt from the requirements because they are children, pregnant women, elderly or disabled, according to a February Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission report. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“JLARC estimates that approximately 32 percent of the Medicaid expansion population would be subject to the requirements and 7 percent would be deterred from enrolling or leaving the Medicaid program due to the requirements,” the report states. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The budget language also includes new premiums and cost-sharing provisions for people between 100 and 138 percent of the federal poverty level. According to the budget, the monthly premium will be set per enrollee on a sliding scale, not to exceed 2 percent of monthly income. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have had concerns all along about any of these provisions that are a condition of eligibility, meaning that people have to comply or they can lose their health coverage,” said Hanken, the health care attorney with the Virginia Poverty Law Center. “Most Medicaid enrollees who can work are already working, so the state’s going to stand up a brand new program for a small slice of the population and we are concerned about new red tape and bureaucracy that may interfere with people’s access to the health care that they need.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the </span><a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/understanding-the-intersection-of-medicaid-and-work/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaiser Family Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 60 percent of non-disabled adults enrolled in Medicaid are working, and 80 percent are in families with at least one worker, suggesting some may not work due to full-time caregiving responsibilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the expansion language, enrollees will be ineligible for Medicaid benefits if they fail to meet the requirements for any three months of the year after their enrollment and won’t be permitted to re-enroll until the end of that year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though there will be a grace period, if they fail to pay their premiums they will similarly have to wait until the end of the year to re-enroll. The budget does not specify how long such a grace period will last. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are questions about the actual exemptions and how we will apply this and when,” said Lee, the DMAS director. “At this point in time we really are focused on getting those people covered who are uninsured and getting people health care, so that’s our priority and our focus.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing the waiver will require close work with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Lee said, adding that the agency is talking with officials in Kentucky to learn from their experiences. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal agency <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/trump-administration-to-give-kentucky-medicaid-work-requirement-a-second-chance/2018/07/18/95c866e6-8ac6-11e8-a345-a1bf7847b375_story.html?utm_term=.3e04e0acb038" target="_blank">confirmed last week it would reconsider</a> Kentucky&#8217;s waiver application.  Other states, like Indiana and New Hampshire, are still setting up their own work requirements, while Arkansas has already implemented its program. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Virginia’s work requirement could also be challenged, DMAS will be working closely with the federal government as it designs its waiver, potentially allowing it to adjust its program to withstand similar legal challenges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Division of Legislative Services created a report that outlines the Kentucky ruling and notes how it might affect Virginia, concluding that Virginia’s program may still be approved if U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar determines that its main objective is ensuring eligible recipients have access to health care. </span></p>
<p><b>&#8216;IF YOU BUILD IT, THEY WILL COME&#8217;</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the debate over whether or not Virginia should expand the program, some lawmakers expressed concerns about access to care and whether there are a sufficient number of providers for the expanded Medicaid population.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staff at DMAS are working with the six managed-care organizations, or MCOs, to ensure there are enough providers. MCOs are health plans like Anthem and Aetna that create the network of doctors and other providers that serve Medicaid patients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There continues to be a provider shortage across the country, particularly in rural areas. Virginia has 110 &#8220;<a href="http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/health-equity/shortage-designations-and-maps/" target="_blank">health professional shortage areas</a>,&#8221; which are designations that identify areas with a shortage of primary, mental health and dental providers. To have such a designation, an area must have population-to-provider ratio of at least 3,500 to 1. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kimsey, the DMAS chief deputy, noted that during the most recent General Assembly session, Virginia allowed nurse practitioners to practice independently without a supervising physician, which might help with the shortage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state’s six managed care organizations, or MCOs, already have networks up and running across the state, said Doug Gray, executive director of the Virginia Association of Health Plans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having paying customers to replace the previously uninsured populations will make the biggest difference in ensuring an adequate provider network, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There may be a little period of adjustment, which is normal when you’re adding a significant population, particularly in areas where they aren’t used to having that many people who are insured,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He noted that last year the state started its Addiction and Recovery Treatment Services benefit for those dealing with addiction. Prior to its launch, there was a major shortage of substance-use disorder providers because there weren’t enough funds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now, they have an enhanced benefit that includes more of the services they need, so it can be comprehensive and we’ve seen a big growth in the provider network,” Gray said. “The same applies here. It’s the, ‘If you build it, they will come,’ idea.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lee said that in the coming years, the state will also be looking at reimbursement rates for doctors. Most physicians will only accept a certain number of Medicaid patients and won&#8217;t depend on it for all of their revenue, Gray said, as private payers usually have higher reimbursement rates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know Gov. Northam supports us looking at reimbursement rates to make sure they are fair and that providers are incentivized to see Medicaid patients,” Lee said. “It’s definitely something we’ll be looking at.” </span></p>
<p><b>FINDING INDEPENDENCE</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Coles and her coworker Pam Atkinson, 61, will qualify for Medicaid next year under the new eligibility rules. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They are both able to get health care now through their jobs at the clothes closet at Goochland Cares, a free clinic and family services organization in Goochland County.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goochland Cares offers insurance to its employees, but Atkinson is technically an employee for Senior Connections, a nonprofit organization that helps older adults throughout the Richmond region, so she doesn’t qualify. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Coles said she can’t afford to pay a monthly premium, even one as low as $50 per month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Atkinson relies on Goochland Cares to get her medications so she can keep her diabetes, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder under control. She wouldn’t be able to afford it without the clinic — one diabetes prescription costs around $70, she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Coles, the clinic has helped her get her health on track. She takes medication to keep her blood pressure under control and tries to exercise regularly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But she’s still eager to get her own insurance and said she can’t wait to sign up. Beyond giving her some choice in what doctor she goes to, it means she won’t have to worry about an emergency medical bill derailing her life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m not going to have to worry about fighting the hospital bills,” she said. “It just makes you feel like you’re independent.” </span></p>

<p>As health care costs rise, patients are being asked to shoulder more of the burden. Some of that comes from a practice known as balance billing, when an out-of-network provider bills the patient for whatever their insurance company won’t pay.</p>
<p>Often, however, patients don’t know providers aren&#8217;t covered. They could triple check that their surgeon is in network, but forget about the anesthesiologist. Or maybe they didn’t have time to ask their doctor if they were covered when they were rushed to the emergency room. Even if they had checked, chances are the doctor wouldn’t know.</p>
<p>But inevitably, a few weeks later, a bill will arrive in the mail.</p>
<p>“The problem I have with the balance bill is, who determines what those costs are, over and above what the insurance company would reimburse that doctor?” asked Sen. Frank Wagner, R-Virginia Beach, during a Virginia Health Insurance Reform Commission meeting Monday. “It’s up to the people who are sending you that bill to determine how much they charge you, and what recourse do you have other than to write the check?”</p>
<p>Virginia’s Bureau of Insurance has received 34 balance billing complaints since October, according to data presented during the commission’s meeting. Some of those cases come from emergency-room visits when the doctor was out of network, even though the hospital itself was in network, while others were from ancillary services such as labs or imaging tests.</p>
<p>But lawmakers noted that that number would probably be much higher if more people knew that they could turn to the Bureau of Insurance for help with a high bill.</p>
<p>“The collection agency doesn’t send you the Bureau of Insurance’s phone number,” said Del. Kathy Byron, R-Bedford. “Because the people I’ve heard from don’t know to call anybody else.”</p>
<p>Charges from out-of-network providers contribute to about a third of medical debt cases that non-elderly adults are struggling with, <a href="https://www.kff.org/health-costs/report/the-burden-of-medical-debt-results-from-the-kaiser-family-foundationnew-york-times-medical-bills-survey/" target="_blank">according to a survey</a> conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the New York Times.</p>
<p>Some states have laws protecting patients from balance billing, such as California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland and New York, while other states have laws in place that address a piece of the problem. Those range from prohibiting health systems from balance billing to requiring insurers to hold their members harmless, which means the patient isn’t liable for the charges.</p>
<p>No such laws exist in Virginia. In 2017 a bill that would have only allowed providers to balance bill when it is expressly agreed to by the insurer and the patient was stricken by its patron, Sen. Jill Vogel, R-Fauquier. And during this year’s session, a bill Byron introduced to address balance billing for ancillary services was continued to next year.</p>
<p>The Health Insurance Reform Commission heard from representatives from Virginia’s hospitals and health plans about balance billing in a roundtable discussion, during which each pointed fingers at the other.</p>
<p>Byron and Sen. Rosalyn Dance, D-Petersburg, grilled R. Brent Rawlings, vice president and general counsel with the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association, on what goes on in a hospital: How are patients supposed to know if their doctor is out-of-network even though they go to an in-network hospital and if physicians are careful to only order lab tests and other services from in-network providers?</p>
<p>Rawlings said that there is “a lot of back-and-forth” between the patient, physician and the health plan to stop the patient from falling out of network. But Dr. Trisha Anest, an emergency room physician with Bon Secours Mary Immaculate Hospital, said that she doesn&#8217;t know her patient’s insurance status because it is irrelevant.</p>
<p>“I will take care of every member of my community that comes through those doors to the best of my ability regardless of their insurance status,” she said. “Insurance companies are aware that this is how emergency physicians operate. It takes all negotiating leverage out from under us.”</p>
<p>Doug Gray, executive director of the Virginia Association of Health Plans, argued that, in many parts of the state, hospitals have a monopoly on the services they offer, and if the insurance company cannot get the hospital to contract with them, the patients will be exposed to balance billing.</p>
<p>“Part of the challenge we have here is that providers aren’t taking responsibility for what happens inside their doors,” Gray said. “Is it willful to not be in network? Sure it is. It’s a willful act to try to increase your reimbursement.”</p>
<p>The discussion devolved into arguing, with people talking over each other. Julie McGarrh, a program director with Anthem, pointed out that even she is subject to balance billing, showing the lawmakers a bill she received for a single urinalysis that cost $3,687 — for a test she could have gotten from a drugstore for $50.</p>
<p>“This is once a month, and I’m still dealing with that, even as an executive at Anthem,” she said.</p>
<p>Wagner said that McGarrh’s example essentially added up to fraud.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;d be interested to know how many of those have been flipped over to collections agencies … and the next thing you know your credit&#8217;s destroyed,” he said. “Because somebody committed fraud against you, your credit&#8217;s destroyed.”</p>
<p>The roundtable discussion didn’t result in any substantial solutions that the state could take to fix the problem — but the lawmakers said they would address the situation one way or another.</p>
<p>“We have quite a serious problem on our hands that the consumers are having to deal with and it affects their lives, along with all the other changes that are going on in health care,” Byron said. “We’re looking for a solution. It may not be the one you want, so if you want to be at the table to be part of that solution, we’re asking you, now, to get engaged.”</p>
<p>Jill Hanken, a health care attorney with the Virginia Poverty Law Center, among other recommendations, suggested not letting an insurer change networks mid-year, thus catching the patient off guard, which <span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Eileen Filler-Corn, D-Fairfax, said could be a starting point.</span></p>
<p>Byron asked the Bureau of Insurance to work with stakeholders and develop some solutions to the problem by the commission’s next meeting in September.</p>
<p>Sen. Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover, said he’d like to see a menu of options to choose from during that next meeting and urged the industry to cooperate.</p>
<p>“I’d say the clock is ticking, and that clock has about a four-month expiration, and you’re going to see this group of legislators – Republicans and Democrats, House and Senate members – come up with a plan,” he said. “And once we’ve done that, I guarantee you, y’all will not like what we come up with.”</p>

</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s a number that is only likely to rise this year as construction of the Mountain Valley Pipeline progresses and work on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline begins, raising questions among some local officials about just who should pay for all that policing.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least two counties have discussed seeking reimbursements from the Mountain Valley Pipeline’s lead developer, EQT Midstream Partners.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other governments and agencies, including the Virginia State Police, said they’re planning to shoulder the cost themselves.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We knew the pipelines are coming so we’re obviously going to make sure we have the funding available and the personnel available to respond to requests for our assistance,” said agency spokeswoman Corrinne Geller.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The State Police reported spending $33,944 on overtime responding to the </span><a href="https://www.roanoke.com/news/local/roanoke_county/protesters-leaving-tree-stands-on-bent-mountain-after-being-found/article_3a742e02-b7d3-50c6-8c1e-1c7698b294f0.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tree sits on Bent Mountain</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the longest of which lasted 34 days. Geller said that the department’s planning aims to minimize costs, for instance, by calling on local troopers to respond and adjust schedules to limit overtime. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That spending joins nearly <a href="https://wtop.com/virginia/2018/03/records-state-police-spent-nearly-50k-on-pipeline-hearings/" target="_blank">$50,000 the State Police spent to</a> monitor meetings of the State Water Control Board last year as it considered water-quality certifications for the projects, according to records obtained by the Associated Press.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokeswoman for Roanoke County police said it cost the department $91,955 to respond to the Bent Mountain sits, mostly for overtime for officers, who monitored the protesters around the clock.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike the state, officials there are evaluating whether they will seek reimbursement, </span><a href="https://www.roanoke.com/news/franklin-county-wants-pipeline-company-to-reimburse-it-for-public/article_7c5953c9-f932-5aa6-af86-01f4dc5041f0.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to The Roanoke Times.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Theresa “Red” Terry and her daughter Theresa Minor Terry camped out in trees for weeks on their Bent Mountain land to block the Mountain Valley Pipeline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The issues that took place there at the Terrys’ were out of the ordinary and they tied up a lot of people for a significant period of time,” Assistant County Administrator Richard Caywood told the paper. “We could kind of directly capture and point at that.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roanoke County would be following the lead of officials in Franklin County, where members of the Board of Supervisors have said they’ve formally requested reimbursement from Mountain Valley Pipeline because they had been assured the pipeline construction would not cost the locality any money.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokeswoman for EQT Midstream Partners did not explicitly rule out the potential for reimbursement but said in an email “no formal arrangements made for reimbursing any locality along the MVP route for public safety-related expenses associated with construction of the project.”</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-464 size-medium" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/satterwhite_HI_RES-1-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aaron Ruby, a spokesman for Dominion, the lead partner in the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, which has cleared trees along the route but not begun full construction in Virginia pending additional state approvals, said the company had not made any cost-sharing agreements with law enforcement.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Roanoke and Franklin county have relatively well-resourced police departments. In the event of prolonged protests in some of the state’s smaller localities, though, the issue could be a budget buster. Bath County’s sheriff’s department, for instance, operates on an annual budget of less than $1 million a year.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For what it’s worth, the chairman of the Bath Board of Supervisors, Richard Byrd, said he doesn’t think construction in his county will prompt the same level of protest that Roanoke County has seen, but he said that depends on whether groups he described as outside agitators stay away.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In either case, it’s not clear that local officials actually have an obligation to respond to the protests in the first place. Some pipeline construction is on federal land, such as the domain of the U.S. Forest Service, which has its own law enforcement arm.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On private land, taken through federal eminent domain proceedings, enforcement on those federal rights of way would technically be up to the U.S. Marshals Service.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal judge who effectively ended the Bent Mountain tree sit spearheaded by </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/federal-judge-rules-against-tree-sitters-protesting-gas-pipeline/2018/05/05/000b14b8-5016-11e8-af46-b1d6dc0d9bfe_story.html?utm_term=.23e6be9b64a7" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by threatening to levy big fines also authorized marshals to take over the situation and, if necessary, bring the protesters down by force.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal-local enforcement debate has played out recently in the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/immigration/they-are-our-neighbors-activists-decry-recent-ice-arrests-in-northwest-dc/2018/07/16/a995155c-88fa-11e8-8aea-86e88ae760d8_story.html?utm_term=.0cf96b4049cf" target="_blank">context of immigration enforcement</a>, with some localities saying they will not enforce federal immigration law and others entering into partnership agreements with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said Steve Benjamin, a Richmond defense attorney.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But he said while the federal government has no power to require local agencies to enforce federal law, grant funding is often used as leverage.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In practice, local, state and federal authorities work together on law enforcement all the time through a variety of task forces and mutual-aid agreements, said Tod W. Burke, a former police officer and recently retired professor of criminal justice at Radford University.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You don’t tell the public, we’re not going to get involved because we can’t afford it, you make it work,” he said, and letting politics guide the decision would be a “mistake.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the case of the state police, Geller noted the agency’s mission is to support law enforcement agencies around the state.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And even in counties where county leaders publicly oppose the project, so far no one is suggesting law enforcement stop responding to protests, regardless of politics or costs.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Montgomery County, where a </span><a href="https://wset.com/news/local/virginian-tech-professor-arrested-after-locking-herself-to-mvp-construction-equipment" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Tech professor chained herself to an excavator</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> earlier this month, Supervisor Sara Bohn said the sheriff’s office assured her board that it has all the funding and manpower it needs to address issues as they arrive.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The sheriff is there to do his job and it’s the same thing for me,” she said. “I’m going to do everything I can to support my constituents, and I learned a long time ago to do it within legal means.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those inclined to consider it a cherished asset of the Old Dominion, the term conjures a tradition of restrained, courtly statesmanship and of high-minded legislating that puts principle over party and personality. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At its best, they would argue, that approach to governing and lawmaking can produce breakthroughs like the budget deal Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam brokered with House and Senate Republicans this year that </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/how-a-reshaped-virginia-legislature-learned-to-love-medicaid-expansion/2018/06/04/aeac0f50-65b9-11e8-99d2-0d678ec08c2f_story.html?utm_term=.2d9a8d2748ca" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">will finally expand Medicaid </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to hundreds of thousands of low-income Virginians desperate for affordable health care. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northam, delivering what his Democratic predecessor, Terry McAuliffe, could not after four years of battling the GOP-controlled legislature, </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2018/may/headline-825960-en.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">even name-checked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the political talisman in his statement on the budget and Medicaid expansion, calling it “the best reflection of what we can accomplish when we do things the Virginia Way.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, as anyone who has spent time in the chambers, halls and cramped committee rooms of the General Assembly during session knows, there is another side to that coin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attendant is at least nominal fealty to the increasingly threadbare notion that the motives of politicians in a state with </span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/Files/CandidatesAndPACs/LawsAndPolicies/CandidatesSummary.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">no campaign contribution limits </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">should be presumed pure and the common conviction that what’s good for business is good for everybody.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That creates an atmosphere in which Sen. Dick Saslaw, D-Fairfax, one of the biggest recipients of campaign cash from Dominion Energy, apparently expected to be taken seriously when he loudly insisted that the sweeping utility overhaul he helped push through </span><a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/powerful-senate-committee-kills-rate-freeze-repeal-awaits-saslaw-s/article_575b2d58-9ff0-5db6-8f9d-2065a89fdd70.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">last session wasn&#8217;t  “Dominion’s bill,”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which, of course, everyone knew it was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few days later, one of Saslaw’s colleagues from what cynics might call the “utility caucus,” Del. Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, got up on the House floor to take offense at the assertion by Del. Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke, that the 2015 bill that froze utility base rates and the ability of state regulators to order customer refunds, was “corrupt.” That law, by the way, passed amid dubious fears that federal carbon regulation might push electric rates up, allowed Dominion and, to a lesser extent, Appalachian Power, </span><a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/after-two-years-of-defending-rate-freeze-dominion-says-it/article_f92bfb61-0ed0-5675-b103-8a95181c9e5b.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to rack up hundreds of millions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of dollars in excess profits at the expense of their ratepayers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion, the state’s largest corporate donor, gets a lot of attention, but the energy giant is far from the only powerful interest that generally gets its way with state lawmakers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, Kilgore also helped</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+sum+HB1258" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pass a bill</span></a> p<span style="font-weight: 400;">ushed by Verizon, another big donor, that makes it easier for companies to sidestep local land-use restrictions in their siting of wireless towers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For his enthusiastic support of the “big boys,” other delegates in the House jokingly branded the amiable Kilgore a “reverse Robin Hood” and gifted him with </span><a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/governor-must-act-on-utility-bill-friday-reverse-robin-hood/article_abf19d86-df04-5028-a822-eddfaa9de97a.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a trophy stuffed with fake cash</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and festooned with corporate logos in a surreal scene that might have managed to capture everything wrong with how business is done at the Capitol.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s all in good fun,” Kilgore said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sit through enough legislative committee meetings and you’ll see a steady stream of common-sense bills that could benefit regular people swatted down like flies day in and day out during the session. Generally, their fatal flaw is that they might make a business, insurance company, landlord or other entity with a powerful paid lobbying organization do something it doesn&#8217;t want to. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A tearful plea from a survivor of the Las Vegas massacre failed to convince a GOP-controlled House panel to pass a ban on bump stocks, the device that enabled the horrific rate of fire that </span><a href="https://lasvegassun.com/news/2018/jul/11/aerial-footage-shows-aftermath-of-las-vegas-shooti/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">helped the shooter kill 58 people and injure </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">hundreds.  Minimum-wage workers seeking an increase sat through hours of committee meetings for a few minutes to try to make their case, only to get admonished to keep it short, since any legislation that might do that, opposed by a phalanx of pro-business lobbyists, was clearly doomed again. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Likewise </span><a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/general-assembly/after-bills-die-in-subcommittees-proton-beam-radiation-advocates-call/article_c4bfb927-a9e1-5a3d-bd39-cbbb7645c89e.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would have forced insurance companies to cover proton beam radiation cancer therapy. The list goes on and on. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What we aim to do is spotlight not just what passes the General Assembly, but what dies and who killed it. We want to highlight policy shortcomings and how they might be fixed. We will take special interest in the Virginia Freedom of Information Act and the myriad exemptions that allow public business to be conducted out of the public eye. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mercury is made up of a team of veteran newspaper journalists and we commit to fair, tough reporting in the public interest. From criminal justice and immigration to health care, the environment, energy and politics, we especially want to take on stories that have major consequences for real people but have fallen through the cracks of an increasingly fractured, shrinking local and state media landscape.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To some extent, we will be finding our niche and our voice as we go and will work to earn your trust as we do. We welcome your story suggestions and feedback and hope you’ll follow along as we take a new look at Virginia’s policy, politics and people.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

The tenants had already departed and the deputies, after checking the unit to make sure it's empty, watch as the owner changes the unit's locks.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to addressing high eviction rates in Virginia, early talks indicate there’s limited common ground between tenant advocates and the apartment industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A proposal to give tenants 14 days instead of five to pay rent before their landlord can sue to evict them?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Firmly opposed, said Patrick McCloud, executive director of the Virginia Apartment Management Association.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Everyone knows when they sign their lease what day the rent is due,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give tenants more chances to make an eviction lawsuit go away by paying rent before the court date?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most landlords already do that informally, McCloud said, positing that writing it into law might actually result in worse outcomes for tenants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To the advocates who proposed the changes to state code, the benefits are obvious. Giving tenants more time and more chances to pay rent before they can be evicted would logically lead to fewer evictions, representatives of the Virginia Poverty Law Center and the Virginia Legal Aid Society told their fellow members of the State Housing Commission’s eviction workgroup last month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The commission formed the subgroup after </span><a href="https://evictionlab.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Princeton University’s Eviction Lab </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">released its study of evictions in the U.S. earlier this year, which found six of the top-10-evicting large cities in the country are in Virginia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The industry, however, has historically held a tight grip on housing law in Virginia, finding strong support among both Democrats and Republicans in the General Assembly, which last year unanimously passed </span><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+sum+HB0856" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">streamlining the eviction process for landlords. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it remains to be seen whether eviction data that shows landlords in Virginia evict tenants at far higher rates than in other states will change that, legislative efforts to make it more difficult for landlords to evict their tenants might face steep odds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are, however, some early areas of agreement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leaders and advocates in Richmond are in early discussions to develop an eviction diversion program they hope will become a model for the rest of the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond became the poster child for high eviction rates when the </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/04/07/upshot/millions-of-eviction-records-a-sweeping-new-look-at-housing-in-america.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">profiled the city earlier this year in its reporting on the Eviction Lab’s research, which found the state capital had the second highest eviction rate of any large city in the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the aftermath of the report, Martin Wegbreit, the director of litigation at the Central Virginia Legal Aid Society, said he received two promising phone calls: One from Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney’s office and one from the chief judge of Richmond’s General District Court, where nearly 19,000 eviction lawsuits were filed last year.</span></p>
<p>One of Stoney’s policy advisors, Osita Iroegbu, said the mayor is still in the process of “assessing what eviction diversion programs and similar initiatives look like in different localities and examining the opportunities we may have to partner with others to strengthen current local efforts and create new ones to effectively tackle this issue.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Planning is still in its early stages, Wegbreit said, but it would likely be modeled on similar efforts in other states, like Michigan, where Kalamazoo County established a program in 2007 as part of an initiative to reduce homelessness. In the Richmond area, more than 30 percent of homeless residents surveyed last year said they had been served with an eviction lawsuit, according to a recent survey by </span><a href="http://homewardva.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homeward,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a nonprofit that coordinates services for homeless people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program in Kalamazoo assisted 412 households last year, providing a total of $138,426 in rental assistance – an average of $300 to $350 per family, according to a spokesman for the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. The program drew on existing state funding aimed at reducing homelessness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Residents facing eviction are notified of the program at the same time they’re served with court papers via a notice stapled to the top of the documents. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The one-time program is geared toward low-income families and individuals who can afford their rent but fell behind after an unexpected financial emergency such as a car crash or medical problem. To qualify, they must demonstrate that they are no more than three months behind in rent and show that they will be able to afford their rent once the assistance ends. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A case worker is in court on days when eviction hearings are being held and is empowered to write a check on the spot. Representatives of the state’s legal aid groups</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">are also on hand to represent and provide advice to tenants who would otherwise not be able to afford a lawyer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The result is often a settlement that results in the landlord getting paid and spares a negative judgement from appearing on the tenant’s court records, which in many cases makes finding apartments in the future more difficult. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ceata Bell, a state caseworker who oversees the program, said it quickly overcame initial skepticism among landlords. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think initially they were thinking the program was just a way to delay the process and not really help in the long run,” Bell said. “Eventually they came on board and realized it’s a win-win for both parties: Landlords get their rent money and tenants don’t become homeless.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Variations of the Kalamazoo program have since been adopted around Michigan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, lawyers and judges in Lansing tested the degree to which providing tenants free legal representation would result in fewer evictions. It did. The study found the number of cases that ended with an eviction dropped from 35 percent to 22 percent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you go in there without a lawyer, it’s not a good idea,” said Brian Gilmore, who directs Michigan State University’s housing law clinic, which provided free legal representation to tenants who participated in the program. “I can tell you it makes a difference.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The apartment industry in Virginia has expressed openness to an eviction-diversion program that focuses on providing financial help to tenants behind on rent – a perhaps unsurprising stance, given it proposes dedicating funding to making sure landlords get paid rent on time while asking little in the way of concessions on their part.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the idea of giving tenants facing eviction free lawyers? Not so much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is not a legal defense to not paying your rent,” McCloud said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McCloud is correct – if a tenant did not pay rent prior to arriving for their court date, there is virtually no way they will win their case. Their only course is to negotiate. He argued money would be better spent on rental assistance funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gilmore agreed that Virginia’s landlord-tenant laws leave tenants with few legal options in an eviction. For instance, in Michigan, tenants can argue they didn’t pay their rent because of a breach of the lease by the landlord if, for instance, major maintenance issues went unaddressed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, tenants only have the right to raise those issues with the court if they are already current on their rent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia is still in the past,” Gilmore said. “They go by the old Colonial rules, basically. Until that changes, the state is going to have a tough go.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that’s why advocates in Virginia say that, while they’re happy to find common ground with landlords where they can, they will continue fighting for legal reforms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The one point about which everyone may be able to agree is that doing nothing is not an option,” Wegbreit, with the Legal Aid Society, said. “To have five of the top ten highest eviction rates among large U.S. cities and three of the top five highest eviction rates among mid-size U.S. cities, and take no corrective action, is not a message Virginia should be sending.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> And this summer, there’s been a run of sightings around Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most recent came last week, when an incoming Virginia Tech freshman who was doing landscaping work in Spotsylvania County </span><a href="https://www.fredericksburg.com/recent-spotsylvania-high-grad-suffers-severe-burns-after-exposure-to/article_d49594fd-c70c-54ef-802a-b1878707da04.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">was hospitalized</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with third-degree burns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alarming, yes. But state officials say it’s unlikely that the plant is suddenly spreading around Virginia, as some news coverage has suggested. Instead, they say it was here all along — biding its time from when the plant was sold commercially as an ornamental in landscaping and gardens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It likes cool weather, and we think that’s why it has suddenly popped up,” said Elaine Lidholm, a spokeswoman for the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. “The people who thought they had eradicated it have to wait 15 years to find out for sure because the seed life is that long.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And with the long, wet spring, it’s like, ‘Finally, our happy place,’ and it’s popping up in places where people didn’t know they had it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scientists at Virginia Tech had a similar take. Michael Flessner, an assistant professor and extension weed-science specialist, noted that the weeds were planted intentionally decades ago and, in years since, have not spread.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plant is native to the western Caucasus Mountains and was introduced to the United States in the 19th century.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It doesn’t appear to be spreading on its own. It’s just growing where we planted it,” Flessner said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He theorized that news coverage in early June of the first confirmed case since the state began regulating the plant as a Tier One noxious weed — which means it can’t be legally sold or transported — prompted more people to take notice of hogweed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services has confirmed three sightings this summer, one each in Clarke, Fauquier and Rockingham counties. Two more likely sightings were reported in the city of Alexandria and Spotsylvania County.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State officials ask that anyone who believes they have found giant hogweed contact either the </span><a href="http://www.vdacs.virginia.gov/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or the </span><a href="https://ext.vt.edu/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Cooperative Extension.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To confirm cases, the VDAC sends an inspector who will provide advice regarding the plant’s removal.</span></p>
