    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Pulled fire alarm at Arlington, Va. precinct didn’t disrupt voting, Beals says</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following issues with some ballots in Richmond and Chesterfield earlier in the day, in a 9 p.m. update Tuesday evening Virginia’s top election officials reported just one other hiccup: a pulled fire alarm that prompted the evacuation of an Arlington County polling location, but didn’t prevent anyone from voting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 6 p.m. hour, the alarm was pulled at  Arlington Precinct 150, the Crystal Plaza polling place,  Virginia Elections Commissioner Susan Beals told reporters in the third and final press briefing of the day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They evacuated the building and they continued voting outside,” Beals said. “Their voters continued voting through 7 o’clock, and then they closed the polls.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some colleges and universities, Beals said, faced longer lines, but “we have checked with all of those registrars, and they have indicated to us that all of those students have been served. There currently are no lines, (or) anyone else waiting to be served in those areas.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia did not receive any bomb threats, Beals said, following a news </span><a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/fbi-statement-on-bomb-threats-to-polling-locations" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">release</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Federal Bureau of Investigation stating several states had received them. The origins of those threats were traced back to Russian email domains, the release said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As results continued to trickle in Tuesday evening, Beals also laid out the next steps in the counting process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wednesday morning, officials will double check the results from machines and begin reviewing provisional ballots from </span><a href="../va-college-voting-bloc-utilizes-same-day-registration-shares-top-policy-issues/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">same day registrations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which were counted at 15,000 to 17,000, as of Tuesday morning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After provisional ballots are cast, identification of the voters must be validated by 10 a.m. on Friday. Local electoral boards will be meeting next week to finalize whether all their provisional ballots will be counted or not, Beals said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Localities have until Friday, Nov. 15 to report their results to the state Board of Election, which will then determine on Monday, Nov. 18 which congressional race will receive an audit, a procedure to make sure votes were counted accurately. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re going to have two post election auditions during the week of Nov. 18,” said Beals. “One, the U.S. Senate race will receive a risk-limiting audit that every locality across the state is going to participate in. And then two, one congressional district is going to be chosen at random to also have a risk-limiting audit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dec. 17 is when Virginia will convene its electoral college, when electors will meet and vote for the president and vice president, Beals continued. Their certificates will be sent to Congress and  counted on Jan. 6, and the president will be inaugurated on Jan. 20, Beals said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals also expressed gratitude to poll workers statewide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would like to reiterate my thanks to the hundreds of poll workers across Virginia who helped their fellow Virginians vote today,” Beals said. “We could not have done it without you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the backdrop of a contentious presidential election, voting appeared to go smoothly in Virginia on Tuesday as people cast their ballots in federal and local elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though early voting </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/early-voting-in-virginia-dips-below-2020-levels-as-parties-push-for-final-turnout-surge/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dropped</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this year from the last presidential cycle — which also happened at a height of the COVID-19 pandemic where people were avoiding large crowds — some jurisdictions have shared that they’ve experienced </span><a href="index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">long lines and high turnout </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">or substantial use of </span><a href="../va-college-voting-bloc-utilizes-same-day-registration-shares-top-policy-issues/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">same-day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> voter registration this year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A couple of snags were detected in Richmond and Chesterfield early in the day, though both were resolved quickly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Richmond, 11 people at an East End precinct had been given ballots that only included federal elections rather than both federal and local contests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unfortunately,” Richmond registrar Keith Balmer said, those voters won’t be able to weigh in on local contests. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Balmer said the city’s electoral board held an emergency meeting to vote to remove the precinct chief. A member of his staff oversaw voting for the rest of the day and no other issues have been reported. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal-only ballots were intended for military and overseas voters who can vote in federal elections, but can’t vote in local jurisdictions because they don’t live there and aren’t part of the local tax base, Balmer explained. These ballots are typically used for absentee voting, but Balmer said that a small number are still on hand at local polling places because that voter demographic does sometimes show up to vote in person. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was those ballots that were mistakenly handed to people when Precinct 310 opened at 6 a.m. Balmer said that because those people have already voted, there’s nothing that can be done to change that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Once we put their ballot in the machine — even though it’s clear as day that they were given the wrong ballot — there’s no do-overs unfortunately,” Balmer said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Chesterfield County briefly experienced jammed ballot scanners at “a handful of precincts,” registrar Missy Vera said in a release. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scanners are used to accept printed ballots and she attributed the issue to “ink levels </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">of a specific batch of ballots that were printed by a state-affiliated vendor.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To resolve the matter, poll workers were instructed to not use the specific batch of blank ballots that had been identified as the source of the issue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She added that the jamming issues “are not slowing the voting process” and that the unused ballots that had been the source of the jamming issue wouldn’t  be used going forward.</span></p>
<p><b>5:25 p.m.:</b></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Richmond precinct chief dismissed after handing out the wrong ballots</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A precinct chief in Richmond’s Precinct 310 was dismissed and replaced on Tuesday after an error resulted in 11 voters receiving the wrong ballots, according to Virginia Elections Commissioner Susan Beals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals informed reporters during a second Election Day briefing Tuesday afternoon that Richmond’s City Electoral Board met and chose to replace the precinct chief responsible. The error meant that the affected voters were unable to cast ballots for local races, as they were given special ballots meant exclusively for federal races.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My understanding is that they cast only federal ballots which included only the office of President of the United States,” Beals explained, adding that these specific ballots are usually reserved for voters who are about to move. “Those ballots, to my understanding, did not include the local races,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The error highlights the challenges election officials face in ensuring each voter receives the correct ballot, especially during high-turnout elections. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Number of provisional ballots cast unclear, but same-day registrations are up</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals also said at the briefing Tuesday that the number of provisional ballots cast throughout Election Day remained unclear by 4 p.m. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right now we don’t have anything statewide other than what we knew of this morning, which is we had between 15,000 and 17,000 statewide,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals added that several localities with universities and colleges reported an </span><a href="../va-college-voting-bloc-utilizes-same-day-registration-shares-top-policy-issues/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">uptick in same-day voter registrations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have heard that there are long lines in some localities that have universities and colleges, as a lot of those students have been encouraged to same-day register today,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Department of Elections officials have remained in touch with these localities and, when needed, deployed more officers of elections and supplies to those universities and the precincts on their campuses, Beals said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we encourage everyone to do is to please make sure you stay in line, even if the 7 p.m. hour passes. They will process you and they do want you to vote, so please do not get out of line.”</span></p>
<p><strong>5:10 p.m.:</strong></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">At the polls, Northern Virginia voters weigh views on abortion, cost of living</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, campaign signs were spread across Northern Virginia at intersections, street corners, and even posted on a bridge over Interstate 66, urging Virginians to support local, state and presidential candidates in this year’s general election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In areas such as Arlington, Falls Church, and Fairfax City, some voters have already cast their ballots early, leaving little foot traffic at precincts on Election Day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to David Bjerke, general registrar for the City of Falls Church, the city recorded a voter turnout of 80.1% by 5 p.m. In Fairfax County, one of the larger jurisdictions in the commonwealth, election officials said total turnout was at 67.9% as of 3:30 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While 2,305,439 Virginians had already cast their ballots through early voting as of Tuesday morning, the number of early voting ballots cast has dipped by about 525,000 compared to the last 2020 presidential election, according to data collected by the Virginia Public Access Project (VPAP).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some Election Day voters in close proximity to the federal government offices in Washington D.C., said they preferred to keep their names and who they voted for private due to their jobs, others were not shy to share their views.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think we need a change in this country,” said Elizabeth Green, a city of Fairfax voter who is concerned about the cost of living and voted early for former President Donald Trump. Green said she thinks Trump is the best presidential candidate to tackle the rising costs of food and housing she’s seen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other residents in Northern Virginia said they voted in person for convenience and to experience the voting atmosphere firsthand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mealod Khashei, in the city of Falls Church, said he voted on Election Day because doing so gives him more confidence his vote will be counted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s our civic duty, right,” Khashei said. “We [have] a few responsibilities that we’ve got to do, and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing.”</span></p>
<p><strong>4:07 p.m.:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re getting slammed with provisional ballots,” city of Richmond registrar Keith Balmer said in a phone call around 3:30 p.m. It’s mostly same-day voter registration.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris Davis, an election poll worker at Main Street Station polling place, estimated Tuesday afternoon that about 10% of ballots cast by early afternoon were provisional ballots — in part, he surmised,</span><a href="../va-college-voting-bloc-utilizes-same-day-registration-shares-top-policy-issues/index.html"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">from populations of college students</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that live and study in the area. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Same-day registration and provisional ballots are used in instances where someone forgot to bring their ID card or another form of identification when they vote. They can register at the polling place, vote, and then follow up with their local election officials to provide identification. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also an</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/think-you-might-have-been-mistakenly-purged-from-virginias-voter-rolls-heres-what-to-do/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">option</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the roughly 1,600 people who were</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/30/u-s-supreme-court-grants-stay-in-challenge-to-youngkins-voter-purge-order-allowing-removal-of-thousands-from-rolls/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">purged from voter rolls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this year over questions of citizenship status on Department of Motor Vehicles paperwork. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike regular ballots, provisional ballots undergo more scrutiny before they are counted, Balmer said. Officials research voters to determine factors like their identity, citizenship status, or residency in the district they voted in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My staff is going to have to research the eligibility of all of these voters and make a determination if their ballot should count or if it should not,” he explained. “Then the electoral board will ultimately make the final decision.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Basically, all of next week, we&#8217;re going to be adjudicating hundreds, if not thousands, of provisional ballots,” Balmer said. </span></p>
<p><strong>3:48 p.m.:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside the Virginia Commonwealth University polling location on the second floor of the Student Commons, several students shared their same-day voter registration experiences and the top policy issues driving their choice between presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Reproductive rights, housing and economic policy were among the young voters’ chief concerns. <strong><a href="../va-college-voting-bloc-utilizes-same-day-registration-shares-top-policy-issues/index.html">Read more.</a></strong></span></p>
<p><strong>2:15 p.m.: </strong></p>
<p>Chris Davis, a poll worker at Main Street Station, said that about 10% of votes cast had been through same-day registration. He suspects that’s due to the amount of Virginia Commonwealth University and other university and college students that live in the area.</p>

    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virginia early voter turnout data and mail-in voting</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Elections Commissioner Susan Beals said at a media briefing on Election Day morning that as of Nov. 1, a record 6,374,437 Virginians had registered to vote. As of Tuesday morning, 2,305,439 Virginians had already cast their ballots through early voting, of which 1,861,938 were cast in person and 443,501 were returned by mail. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the mail ballots that are still outstanding, a total of 126,266 mail ballots have yet to be returned. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Those who are voting absentee by mail must have those ballots postmarked on or before today Nov. 5, and they must be received in the mail by noon Friday, Nov. 8, in order to be counted,” Beals said.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While same-day registrations data was not yet available for Tuesday around 10 a.m., Beals said that the state had filed a total of 16,557 same-day registrations leading up to Election day, “but we are obviously expecting more today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In September, Beals had </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/05/virginias-top-elections-official-warns-of-possible-delays-in-mail-in-voting-this-year/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expressed concerns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about potential delays with the U.S. Postal Service affecting timely processing of mail-in ballots ahead of the election. However, on Tuesday she reported that these issues have not materialized so far, and ballots are being processed on schedule.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think a lot of folks have chosen to do a drop off at a dropbox at their registrar’s office, we have seen an increase in that method of return,” Beals told reporters. ” We have not heard specific examples of people having delays in getting their mail back.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals added most voters are being very diligent about ensuring that their ballot has been received, which they can check online and see that it’s been received by their local registrar’s staff once they mail it back. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have seen an overall decrease in the number of people who have requested absentee by mail-in ballot this year as compared to 2020, but you can&#8217;t necessarily attribute that to just this issue, because 2020 was a very different time and a lot of people requested mail-in ballots because they just didn’t know what to expect on Election Day that year with the pandemic. So it’s hard to even make a case there.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Election integrity and and security concerns addressed early</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals reiterated that elections in Virginia are secure and reliable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Virginia, we have some of the most experienced election officials in the country. They have already conducted two statewide elections this year and have provided 138 days of early election day voting for Virginia voters as of today,” she said. Because Virginia has elections each year, Beals said, “our election officials have a great depth of experience in handling issues that come up for voters at the polls.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals added that election officials in the commonwealth have worked throughout the year to ensure that the elections are safe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In terms of security concerns, we have been meeting for many months with our state and federal law enforcement partners to plan for today,” she said. “We’ve had several meetings where we’ve run through various scenarios to make plans.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals couldn’t speak to the specifics of those plans but asserted again  “we’re very confident that we’re going to have a safe and secure election in Virginia day.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Department of Justice officials are </span><a href="../../../../briefs/u-s-justice-department-to-monitor-polling-places-in-27-states-including-six-virginia-localities/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">monitoring six localities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Virginia Tuesday to ensure compliance with federal voting laws, but Beals said that her department would have no information to share on that. </span></p>

    <h4>Pulled fire alarm at Arlington, Va. precinct didn’t disrupt voting, Beals says</h4>

	
<p>Following issues with some ballots in Richmond and Chesterfield earlier in the day, in a 9 p.m. update Tuesday evening Virginia’s top election officials reported just one other hiccup: a pulled fire alarm that prompted the evacuation of an Arlington County polling location, but didn’t prevent anyone from voting.</p>
<p>In the 6 p.m. hour, the alarm was pulled at  Arlington Precinct 150, the Crystal Plaza polling place,  Virginia Elections Commissioner Susan Beals told reporters in the third and final press briefing of the day.</p>
<p>“They evacuated the building and they continued voting outside,” Beals said. “Their voters continued voting through 7 o’clock, and then they closed the polls.”</p>
<p>Some colleges and universities, Beals said, faced longer lines, but “we have checked with all of those registrars, and they have indicated to us that all of those students have been served. There currently are no lines, (or) anyone else waiting to be served in those areas.”</p>
<p>Virginia did not receive any bomb threats, Beals said, following a news <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/fbi-statement-on-bomb-threats-to-polling-locations">release</a> from the Federal Bureau of Investigation stating several states had received them. The origins of those threats were traced back to Russian email domains, the release said.</p>
<p>As results continued to trickle in Tuesday evening, Beals also laid out the next steps in the counting process.</p>
<p>Wednesday morning, officials will double check the results from machines and begin reviewing provisional ballots from <a href="../va-college-voting-bloc-utilizes-same-day-registration-shares-top-policy-issues/index.html">same day registrations</a>, which were counted at 15,000 to 17,000, as of Tuesday morning. </p>
<p>After provisional ballots are cast, identification of the voters must be validated by 10 a.m. on Friday. Local electoral boards will be meeting next week to finalize whether all their provisional ballots will be counted or not, Beals said.</p>
<p>Localities have until Friday, Nov. 15 to report their results to the state Board of Election, which will then determine on Monday, Nov. 18 which congressional race will receive an audit, a procedure to make sure votes were counted accurately. </p>
<p>“We’re going to have two post election auditions during the week of Nov. 18,” said Beals. “One, the U.S. Senate race will receive a risk-limiting audit that every locality across the state is going to participate in. And then two, one congressional district is going to be chosen at random to also have a risk-limiting audit.”</p>
<p>Dec. 17 is when Virginia will convene its electoral college, when electors will meet and vote for the president and vice president, Beals continued. Their certificates will be sent to Congress and  counted on Jan. 6, and the president will be inaugurated on Jan. 20, Beals said.</p>
<p>Beals also expressed gratitude to poll workers statewide.</p>
<p>“I would like to reiterate my thanks to the hundreds of poll workers across Virginia who helped their fellow Virginians vote today,” Beals said. “We could not have done it without you.”</p>

<p><strong>7:04 p.m.:</strong></p>

<p><strong>6:25 p.m.:</strong></p>
<p>Amid the backdrop of a contentious presidential election, voting appeared to go smoothly in Virginia on Tuesday as people cast their ballots in federal and local elections.</p>
<p>Though early voting <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/early-voting-in-virginia-dips-below-2020-levels-as-parties-push-for-final-turnout-surge/">dropped</a> this year from the last presidential cycle — which also happened at a height of the COVID-19 pandemic where people were avoiding large crowds — some jurisdictions have shared that they’ve experienced <a href="index.html">long lines and high turnout </a>or substantial use of <a href="../va-college-voting-bloc-utilizes-same-day-registration-shares-top-policy-issues/index.html">same-day</a> voter registration this year.  </p>
<p>A couple of snags were detected in Richmond and Chesterfield early in the day, though both were resolved quickly. </p>
<p>In Richmond, 11 people at an East End precinct had been given ballots that only included federal elections rather than both federal and local contests.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately,” Richmond registrar Keith Balmer said, those voters won’t be able to weigh in on local contests. </p>
<p>Balmer said the city’s electoral board held an emergency meeting to vote to remove the precinct chief. A member of his staff oversaw voting for the rest of the day and no other issues have been reported. </p>
<p>The federal-only ballots were intended for military and overseas voters who can vote in federal elections, but can’t vote in local jurisdictions because they don’t live there and aren’t part of the local tax base, Balmer explained. These ballots are typically used for absentee voting, but Balmer said that a small number are still on hand at local polling places because that voter demographic does sometimes show up to vote in person. </p>
<p>It was those ballots that were mistakenly handed to people when Precinct 310 opened at 6 a.m. Balmer said that because those people have already voted, there’s nothing that can be done to change that. </p>
<p>“Once we put their ballot in the machine — even though it’s clear as day that they were given the wrong ballot — there’s no do-overs unfortunately,” Balmer said. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Chesterfield County briefly experienced jammed ballot scanners at “a handful of precincts,” registrar Missy Vera said in a release. </p>
<p>The scanners are used to accept printed ballots and she attributed the issue to “ink levels of a specific batch of ballots that were printed by a state-affiliated vendor.”</p>
<p>To resolve the matter, poll workers were instructed to not use the specific batch of blank ballots that had been identified as the source of the issue. </p>
<p>She added that the jamming issues “are not slowing the voting process” and that the unused ballots that had been the source of the jamming issue wouldn’t  be used going forward.</p>

    <h4>Richmond precinct chief dismissed after handing out the wrong ballots</h4>

	
<p>A precinct chief in Richmond’s Precinct 310 was dismissed and replaced on Tuesday after an error resulted in 11 voters receiving the wrong ballots, according to Virginia Elections Commissioner Susan Beals. </p>
<p>Beals informed reporters during a second Election Day briefing Tuesday afternoon that Richmond’s City Electoral Board met and chose to replace the precinct chief responsible. The error meant that the affected voters were unable to cast ballots for local races, as they were given special ballots meant exclusively for federal races.</p>
<p>“My understanding is that they cast only federal ballots which included only the office of President of the United States,” Beals explained, adding that these specific ballots are usually reserved for voters who are about to move. “Those ballots, to my understanding, did not include the local races,” she said.</p>
<p>The error highlights the challenges election officials face in ensuring each voter receives the correct ballot, especially during high-turnout elections. </p>
    <h4>Number of provisional ballots cast unclear, but same-day registrations are up</h4>

	
<p>Beals also said at the briefing Tuesday that the number of provisional ballots cast throughout Election Day remained unclear by 4 p.m. </p>
<p>“Right now we don’t have anything statewide other than what we knew of this morning, which is we had between 15,000 and 17,000 statewide,” she said.</p>
<p>Beals added that several localities with universities and colleges reported an <a href="../va-college-voting-bloc-utilizes-same-day-registration-shares-top-policy-issues/index.html">uptick in same-day voter registrations</a>.</p>
<p>“We have heard that there are long lines in some localities that have universities and colleges, as a lot of those students have been encouraged to same-day register today,” she said. </p>
<p>Department of Elections officials have remained in touch with these localities and, when needed, deployed more officers of elections and supplies to those universities and the precincts on their campuses, Beals said.</p>
<p>“What we encourage everyone to do is to please make sure you stay in line, even if the 7 p.m. hour passes. They will process you and they do want you to vote, so please do not get out of line.”</p>
<p><strong>5:10 p.m.:</strong></p>
    <h4>At the polls, Northern Virginia voters weigh views on abortion, cost of living</h4>

	
<p>On Tuesday, campaign signs were spread across Northern Virginia at intersections, street corners, and even posted on a bridge over Interstate 66, urging Virginians to support local, state and presidential candidates in this year’s general election.</p>
<p>In areas such as Arlington, Falls Church, and Fairfax City, some voters have already cast their ballots early, leaving little foot traffic at precincts on Election Day.</p>
<p>According to David Bjerke, general registrar for the City of Falls Church, the city recorded a voter turnout of 80.1% by 5 p.m. In Fairfax County, one of the larger jurisdictions in the commonwealth, election officials said total turnout was at 67.9% as of 3:30 p.m.</p>
<p>While 2,305,439 Virginians had already cast their ballots through early voting as of Tuesday morning, the number of early voting ballots cast has dipped by about 525,000 compared to the last 2020 presidential election, according to data collected by the Virginia Public Access Project (VPAP).</p>
<p>While some Election Day voters in close proximity to the federal government offices in Washington D.C., said they preferred to keep their names and who they voted for private due to their jobs, others were not shy to share their views.</p>
<p>“I think we need a change in this country,” said Elizabeth Green, a city of Fairfax voter who is concerned about the cost of living and voted early for former President Donald Trump. Green said she thinks Trump is the best presidential candidate to tackle the rising costs of food and housing she’s seen.</p>
<p>Other residents in Northern Virginia said they voted in person for convenience and to experience the voting atmosphere firsthand.</p>
<p>Mealod Khashei, in the city of Falls Church, said he voted on Election Day because doing so gives him more confidence his vote will be counted.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s our civic duty, right,” Khashei said. “We [have] a few responsibilities that we’ve got to do, and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing.”</p>
<p><strong>4:07 p.m.:</strong></p>
<p>“We&#8217;re getting slammed with provisional ballots,” city of Richmond registrar Keith Balmer said in a phone call around 3:30 p.m. It’s mostly same-day voter registration.” </p>
<p>Chris Davis, an election poll worker at Main Street Station polling place, estimated Tuesday afternoon that about 10% of ballots cast by early afternoon were provisional ballots — in part, he surmised,<a href="../va-college-voting-bloc-utilizes-same-day-registration-shares-top-policy-issues/index.html"> from populations of college students</a> that live and study in the area. </p>
<p>Same-day registration and provisional ballots are used in instances where someone forgot to bring their ID card or another form of identification when they vote. They can register at the polling place, vote, and then follow up with their local election officials to provide identification. </p>
<p>It’s also an<a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/think-you-might-have-been-mistakenly-purged-from-virginias-voter-rolls-heres-what-to-do/"> option</a> for the roughly 1,600 people who were<a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/30/u-s-supreme-court-grants-stay-in-challenge-to-youngkins-voter-purge-order-allowing-removal-of-thousands-from-rolls/"> purged from voter rolls</a> this year over questions of citizenship status on Department of Motor Vehicles paperwork. </p>
<p>Unlike regular ballots, provisional ballots undergo more scrutiny before they are counted, Balmer said. Officials research voters to determine factors like their identity, citizenship status, or residency in the district they voted in.</p>
<p>“My staff is going to have to research the eligibility of all of these voters and make a determination if their ballot should count or if it should not,” he explained. “Then the electoral board will ultimately make the final decision.”</p>
<p>“Basically, all of next week, we&#8217;re going to be adjudicating hundreds, if not thousands, of provisional ballots,” Balmer said. </p>
<p><strong>3:48 p.m.:</strong></p>
<p>Outside the Virginia Commonwealth University polling location on the second floor of the Student Commons, several students shared their same-day voter registration experiences and the top policy issues driving their choice between presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Reproductive rights, housing and economic policy were among the young voters’ chief concerns. <strong><a href="../va-college-voting-bloc-utilizes-same-day-registration-shares-top-policy-issues/index.html">Read more.</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>2:15 p.m.: </strong></p>
<p>Chris Davis, a poll worker at Main Street Station, said that about 10% of votes cast had been through same-day registration. He suspects that’s due to the amount of Virginia Commonwealth University and other university and college students that live in the area.</p>
<p><b>1 p.m.:</b></p>
    <h4>Virginia early voter turnout data and mail-in voting</h4>

	
<p>Virginia Elections Commissioner Susan Beals said at a media briefing on Election Day morning that as of Nov. 1, a record 6,374,437 Virginians had registered to vote. As of Tuesday morning, 2,305,439 Virginians had already cast their ballots through early voting, of which 1,861,938 were cast in person and 443,501 were returned by mail. </p>
<p>Of the mail ballots that are still outstanding, a total of 126,266 mail ballots have yet to be returned. </p>
<p>“Those who are voting absentee by mail must have those ballots postmarked on or before today Nov. 5, and they must be received in the mail by noon Friday, Nov. 8, in order to be counted,” Beals said.  </p>
<p>While same-day registrations data was not yet available for Tuesday around 10 a.m., Beals said that the state had filed a total of 16,557 same-day registrations leading up to Election day, “but we are obviously expecting more today.”</p>
<p>In September, Beals had <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/05/virginias-top-elections-official-warns-of-possible-delays-in-mail-in-voting-this-year/">expressed concerns</a> about potential delays with the U.S. Postal Service affecting timely processing of mail-in ballots ahead of the election. However, on Tuesday she reported that these issues have not materialized so far, and ballots are being processed on schedule.</p>
<p>“I think a lot of folks have chosen to do a drop off at a dropbox at their registrar’s office, we have seen an increase in that method of return,” Beals told reporters. ” We have not heard specific examples of people having delays in getting their mail back.” </p>
<p>Beals added most voters are being very diligent about ensuring that their ballot has been received, which they can check online and see that it’s been received by their local registrar’s staff once they mail it back. </p>
<p>“We have seen an overall decrease in the number of people who have requested absentee by mail-in ballot this year as compared to 2020, but you can&#8217;t necessarily attribute that to just this issue, because 2020 was a very different time and a lot of people requested mail-in ballots because they just didn’t know what to expect on Election Day that year with the pandemic. So it’s hard to even make a case there.”</p>
    <h4>Election integrity and and security concerns addressed early</h4>

	
<p>Beals reiterated that elections in Virginia are secure and reliable. </p>
<p>“In Virginia, we have some of the most experienced election officials in the country. They have already conducted two statewide elections this year and have provided 138 days of early election day voting for Virginia voters as of today,” she said. Because Virginia has elections each year, Beals said, “our election officials have a great depth of experience in handling issues that come up for voters at the polls.”</p>
<p>Beals added that election officials in the commonwealth have worked throughout the year to ensure that the elections are safe.</p>
<p>“In terms of security concerns, we have been meeting for many months with our state and federal law enforcement partners to plan for today,” she said. “We’ve had several meetings where we’ve run through various scenarios to make plans.”</p>
<p>Beals couldn’t speak to the specifics of those plans but asserted again  “we’re very confident that we’re going to have a safe and secure election in Virginia day.”</p>
<p>U.S. Department of Justice officials are <a href="../../../../briefs/u-s-justice-department-to-monitor-polling-places-in-27-states-including-six-virginia-localities/index.html">monitoring six localities</a> in Virginia Tuesday to ensure compliance with federal voting laws, but Beals said that her department would have no information to share on that. </p>
    <h4>Election Day snags</h4>

	
<p>Beals reported that the Department of Elections had been made aware of an incident at Precinct 310 in Richmond Tuesday morning, where election workers handed out federal-only ballots to at least 11 voters. </p>
<p>“That issue has still since been resolved. My understanding is that the officers of election gave out the incorrect ballot to the voters that had only a presidential race on the ballot,” she said. </p>
