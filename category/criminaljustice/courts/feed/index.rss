(Courtesy of Google) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares has joined the U.S. Department of Justice and a coalition of 38 state attorneys general in proposing sweeping remedies to dismantle Google’s unlawful monopoly over internet search engines and restore competition in the digital marketplace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The push follows </span><a href="https://www.oag.state.va.us/media-center/news-releases/2807-november-21-2024-virginia-justice-department-seek-limits-to-google-business-practices-to-end-search-engine-monopoly" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a landmark ruling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in August 2024 by a federal district court in Washington, D.C., which found that Google violated federal antitrust laws by maintaining a monopoly in online search and search advertising through anticompetitive practices. The court’s decision marked a significant win in the ongoing efforts to curb Big Tech dominance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The remedies proposed are reasonable, measured steps to restore competition and protect consumers,” Miyares said in a statement Thursday. “Virginia is proud to help produce a balanced resolution that benefits consumers and competitors alike.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_30211" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/ga-2022-4-3/"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-30211" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GA-2022-4-3-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GA-2022-4-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GA-2022-4-3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GA-2022-4-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GA-2022-4-3.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Attorney General Jason Miyares (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia initially joined the fight against Google in December 2020, alleging in a lawsuit that the tech giant used illegal contracts and other conduct to suppress competition and secure its monopoly power. That case complemented a similar federal antitrust lawsuit filed by the Justice Department in October of that year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A multi-day hearing to consider the proposed remedies is scheduled for April 22, 2025, and is expected to conclude by May 2, 2025, according to a news release by the attorney general’s oOffice.The outcome of this case will likely have far-reaching implications for competition in the tech industry and consumer choice in digital services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kent Walker, Google’s chief legal officer, sharply criticized the Justice Department’s latest move, accusing the agency of pushing “a radical interventionist agenda” that would harm Americans and America’s global technology leadership. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“DOJ’s wildly overbroad proposal goes miles beyond the court’s decision. It would break a range of Google products — even beyond Search — that people love and find helpful in their everyday lives,” Walker wrote </span><a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/doj-search-remedies-nov-2024/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in a blog post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Thursday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://oag.dc.gov/sites/default/files/2024-11/2024.11.20%20Google%20Plaintiffs%20Initial%20PFJ%20%281%29.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposed final judgment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or PFJ, filed with the courts seeks to dismantle Google’s dominance by prohibiting its lucrative search distribution contracts and revenue-sharing agreements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the legal challenge proves successful, Google would no longer be allowed to pay manufacturers, device makers, or browsers to make Google Search the default search engine. Additionally, the company would be required to share data and information obtained through its monopoly with competitors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The PFJ also calls for Google to divest Chrome, its popular browser that accounts for a substantial share of the portal’s search traffic and powers its targeted advertising to users. Furthermore, the judgment opens the door to additional divestitures, including Google’s Android operating system, if the company fails to comply with remedies or if the proposed measures prove ineffective.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The judgment further prohibits Google from leveraging its ownership of Android to stifle competition. The company specifically would be barred from mandating the use of Google Search or Google AI on Android devices, degrading the performance of rival services, or using its control over distributors to favor its products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a measure proposed solely by the states, Google would also be required to fund a public education campaign to inform consumers about the company’s anticompetitive practices, the resulting legal action, and the alternatives available to them for search engines and digital tools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The order establishes a five-member technical committee tasked with overseeing the implementation, monitoring and enforcement of these remedies over a ten-year period.</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce/For the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Five Waynesboro voters have filed a lawsuit to prevent the majority of the Waynesboro Board of Elections from following through on their controversial pledge to refuse certification of the November 2024 election results, a move they argue would violate Virginia state law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plaintiffs — Jennifer Lewis, Ann Criser-Shedd, Greg Fife, Chris Graham and Andrea Jackson — are seeking a court order to compel the election officials to certify the city’s votes.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://advancementproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024.10.21-Waynesboro-Complaint-File-Stamped.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, filed in Waynesboro Circuit Court on Oct. 21, comes after two GOP officials from Waynesboro  filed </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/15/waynesboro-gop-officials-sue-over-va-s-voting-system-threaten-to-block-election-certification/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">their own lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> challenging Virginia’s voting system ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election while threatening to not certify the results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In their complaint, Curtis Lilly, the chairman of the Waynesboro Electoral Board, and Scott Mares, the board’s vice chair, expressed their concerns over the reliability of electronic voting systems, which they argue are prone to inaccuracies. Instead, they demanded that all ballots be counted by hand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, state law does not currently require a mandatory hand-count unless irregularities are proven, and all paper ballots are required to be counted by optical scanning machines, which help speed up the counting process and reduce the risk of human error. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before each election, the scanners undergo rigorous testing using a predetermined sample of votes to ensure accurate tallying before any real votes are counted. Additionally, it is illegal to connect ballot scanning machines to the Internet at any point, further safeguarding the integrity of the voting process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of the scanners used in Virginia’s elections are certified to meet both state and federal standards and are handled under a strict chain of custody to ensure security and accuracy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In their counter-suit, the five Waynesboro voters ask the court to require the election officials to certify the election results unless they prevail in their own suit. The plaintiffs further argue that the election officials’ stance violates the Virginia Constitution, which mandates that election results be certified in accordance with established procedures, including the use of legally authorized voting equipment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The chairman and vice chairman should do their job; instead they are purposely misinterpreting what they are charged to do. I cast my vote and have every right to expect that it will be counted on Election Day,” said Lewis, one of the plaintiffs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackson, another plaintiff, said that voting in the 2024 election was “very important” to her. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am frustrated that the election officials are not doing what they take an oath to do, which is to make sure the election runs smoothly and every vote counts. Instead they are distracting us from our local elections by filing nonsensical court cases,” Jackson said. </span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce for the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two GOP officials from Waynesboro have filed a lawsuit challenging Virginia&#8217;s voting system ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election while threatening to not certify the results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In their complaint, Curtis Lilly, the chairman of the Waynesboro Electoral Board, and Scott Mares, the board’s vice chair, are raising concerns about the validity of future results while echoing unmerited claims that the 2020 election, in which Democrat Joe Biden defeated then-President Donald Trump with more than 7 million votes, was stolen.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Filed on Oct. 4 at the Waynesboro Circuit Court against Virginia Department of Elections Commissioner Susan Beals and State Board of Elections Chairman John O’Bannon, the suit alleges that the voting machines used in the state are unverifiable and could potentially be manipulated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plaintiffs further claim the machines may be connected to the internet, allowing for external tampering, though this is illegal under state law and no evidence has been provided to support this allegation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When reached by phone Tuesday, Lilly declined to be interviewed for this story. Mares did not respond to several calls seeking comment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lilly and Mares argue that under the current legal regime, local electoral board members are unable to personally review and verify that the voting machine program being used to count the ballots “is keeping and recording a true and accurate count,” and that the device’s record tape accurately represents the ballots cast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Consequently, the plaintiffs believe that the voting machine is counting the votes in secret, because neither the program counting the votes recorded on the ballots nor the ballots themselves can be examined,” the complaint says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lilly further stated in an affidavit attached to the complaint that he “cannot ensure that the machines do not connect to the internet, allowing for vote counting algorithm manipulation, nor can I ensure with any certainty that the electronic ballot scanners are presenting results which are consistent with the contents of the ballot box.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Henry Chambers, a professor for constitutional law at the University of Richmond School of Law, said in a phone interview Tuesday that the lawsuit appears to be based on long debunked conspiracy theories circulating after the 2020 presidential election that claimed vote counting machines had been programmed to get votes wrong and to flip votes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s not really a serious thing, but some people have bought into it and it sounds like these folks have bought into it, too,” Chambers said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Their notion is that vote counting that is done by a machine is done in secret, and therefore you have to hand-count the votes, presumably in public, in order to have a real tally of the actual vote count,” Chamber continued. “That would suggest that voting that is not done by hand and in public qualifies as counting in secret, which in theory would violate the state Constitution.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, voters cast paper ballots, which are then counted by optical scanning machines — as required </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title24.2/chapter6/section24.2-626/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">by state law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — to expedite the process and avoid human error. Ballot scanning machines are certified to meet both state and federal standards and are maintained under a controlled chain of custody.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before every election, the scanners are tested using a predetermined sample of votes to ensure they are tallied accurately before any actual votes are cast, and it is against the law to connect a ballot scanning machine to the Internet at any point. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals, who was appointed as Virginia’s top elections official in March 2022, did not respond to text messages seeking comment Tuesday, and a spokeswoman for the Department of the Elections said in an email that the department does not comment on pending litigation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/08/08/virginias-top-elections-official-says-shes-confident-about-the-accuracy-of-results/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in July, Beals said that hacking the scanning machines was impossible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Period. They cannot be,” she said, adding that after the testing of the devices ahead of the election and on Election Day, officials also conduct risk-eliminating audits, which she called the back-end check.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So we have three different checks throughout the system just to make sure that the machines are reporting accurately.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chambers, the UR professor, called the plaintiffs’ argument that the machine counting of ballots happened in secrecy “an odd thing,” because the machine itself is doing the counting in a public space, supervised by election officials. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The problem with counting being done in public is that one can’t necessarily explicitly see what’s going on. But the fact is, we have lots of things that count things and we just agree that it’s being counted correctly, like ATM machines,” Chambers said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No one would say that the ATM machine is spitting out money in secret, but it’s spitting out money in response to a request. Here, a voting machine is counting votes in response to a ballot being fed through a machine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By asking for ballots to be hand-counted instead of being tabulated by machines, the plaintiffs could really be asking for a slow-down of the count, Chambers added, which “can introduce additional problems with a valid count — and that is the whole point of feeding the ballots through during the day and having a continuous count is so that you can have results in a reasonable and fair time. Hand counting is used only when necessary when you&#8217;re talking about things like absentee ballots or ballots that can’t be read by the machine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also remains unclear why the GOP election officials who filed the suit would threaten to not certify the presidential election, in a county that leans Republican and where Trump won with 51-46% in 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rich Anderson, the chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia, underscored that the lawsuit was a lone effort by a small group of GOP officials from one locality. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As far as I know it’s only happening in this one jurisdiction out of 133, but it’s all going to get settled in the courts anyway,” Anderson said in a phone interview. “What they’re asking is the court to render its opinion, which it will do, and the opinion will likely be on the side of Virginia law, which says that ballots are counted through the optical scanners, not by hand.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, the Founding Freedoms Law Center, the legal division of the Family Foundation, announced it filed a lawsuit in Henrico County Circuit Court, claiming the state violated their clients&#8217; right to free speech and religious freedom. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The suit names the Virginia Board of Counseling, Virginia Department of Health Professions, and its director, Arne Owens, as the defendants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The American Medical Association has denounced conversion therapy, </span><a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/population-care/advocating-lgbtq-community" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">saying</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the practice is based on the idea that “homosexuality and gender nonconformity are mental disorders and that sexual orientation and gender identity can be changed,” assumptions that are not based on medical or scientific evidence.</span></p>
<p>Narissa Rahaman, executive director for Equality Virginia, said the Family Foundation&#8217;s latest action is another attempt to discriminate against LGBTQ+ people.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once again, anti-LGBTQ+ forces are just trying to find new ways to advance their failing cause,&#8221; Rahaman said in a statement. &#8220;To the LGBTQ+ youth in Virginia and around the country who have been subjected to this dangerous practice: We will not stop fighting for you. You are worthy of love, support and access to affirming therapy.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, Virginia </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title54.1/chapter24/section54.1-2409.5/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">banned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conversion therapy, which prohibits state-licensed healthcare providers and counselors from practicing it on anyone under 18. Sen. <a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+SB245" target="_blank">Scott Surovell</a>, D-Fairfax, and Del. <a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+HB386" target="_blank">Patrick Hope</a>, D-Arlington, carried the legislation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the suit, John and Janet Raymond, the plaintiffs and owners of the Associate Counseling Center in Front Royal, have lost “significant” business income due to the ban.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Raymonds wish to counsel children who are seeking help to align their sexual feelings, actions, and identity toward a biblical sexual ethic, in accordance with God‘s design for human beings, including those struggling with homosexuality and so-called &#8216;gender identity,’” the suit states.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40202" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1024px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-40202" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_2721-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_2721-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_2721-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_2721-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_2721-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_2721.jpg 1620w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  John and Janet Raymond, owners of the Associate Counseling Center in Front Royal, are suing the state for prohibiting their right to practice conversion therapy. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia lawsuit was announced soon after Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear banned the practice through an executive order on Sept. 18. Republicans outraged by the decision said it violated parental rights and hindered their legal authority to make decisions about their child’s care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founding Freedoms Law Center attorney Josh Hetzler said their case is independent of Kentucky’s recent action, but makes the Virginia lawsuit “all the more timely” and could be a learning opportunity for the neighbor state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We think our case is going to help (and) hopefully when we win, Kentucky will see the writing on the wall and will do the right thing as well,” Hetzler said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a </span><a href="https://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/therapeutic-response.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the American Psychological Association, behavior therapists used treatment like inducing nausea, providing electric shocks, or having the individual snap an elastic band around their wrist when they became aroused by same-sex erotic images or thoughts. Virginia’s ban on the practice in 2020 came after</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2020/02/18/after-years-of-efforts-virginia-passes-law-to-ban-conversion-therapy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> several years of failed legislative efforts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to make it illegal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, minors’ sexuality and gender expression have been at the forefront of political discussions concerning education and athletics in Virginia schools. Both Democrats and Republicans have  fought over the protections and rights of minors as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most notable actions came when Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration overhauled the state&#8217;s </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/09/12/despite-law-few-virginia-school-districts-adopt-state-model-transgender-policies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> model school policies for transgender and nonbinary students designed under former Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam to protect the privacy and rights of such minors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, groups including the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia have filed lawsuits challenging the Virginia Department of Education on the policies that some schools have adopted. In February, the ACLU and Freshfields filed three related lawsuits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One case, involving at least one teacher refusing to address a transgender student by her preferred first name, was </span><a href="https://www.wtkr.com/news/in-the-community/historic-triangle/york-county-court-dismisses-lawsuit-challenging-virginias-transgender-student-policies" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dismissed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in July. The other two cases are still being litigated in the Eastern District of Virginia and the Hanover County Circuit Court.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the Mercury </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/07/12/changes-to-sex-listed-on-virginia-birth-certificates-more-than-doubled-after-2020-law/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the number of Virginians changing the sex listed on their birth certificate more than doubled between 2020 and 2022, after lawmakers passed </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+SB657" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> streamlining the process for individuals wanting to do so.</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce for The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal judges in the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond on Tuesday appeared sympathetic to the plaintiffs in a case challenging Virginia’s disenfranchisement of people with felony convictions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a federal district judge </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/18/judge-rules-suit-against-virginia-felon-disenfranchisement-rule-can-proceed/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">allowed the challenge to move forward</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> earlier this year, alleging that </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/youngkin-voting-rights-aclu-virginia/article_90a9275e-e565-11ee-8466-3ff35b49eb1c.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has been out of compliance with a Reconstruction-era federal law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the 4th Circuit had a hearing on the state’s attempt to toss the case. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deputy Solicitor General Kevin Gallagher, in defense of the state, said the “unique” and old federal statute “is not something that people are trying to enforce.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defendants include Gov. Glenn Youngkin, the Secretary of the Commonwealth — who was Kay Coles James when the suit was first filed — and several election officials. Tuesday’s hearing was part of their interlocutory appeal limited to whether Virginia is entitled to sovereign immunity — basically, whether or not the state and its agents can be found to have done wrong or not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An interlocutory appeal is a type of appeal that can be filed while a case is active and before a final judgment. Neither the interlocutory appeal nor the Readmission Act case have been ruled on yet. And though the appeal was the point of Tuesday’s meeting, discussion veered into the Readmission case. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latter is focused on the 1870 Virginia Readmission Act, a federal law that allowed Virginia, a former Confederate state, to rejoin the U.S. Congress. Similar laws were also employed as other formerly Confederate states rejoined, with the condition that states’ constitutions could not be used to deprive anyone of voting rights, “except as punishment for such crimes that are now felonies at common law.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Common law” felonies were defined as a limited set of crimes, whereas today people with any felony conviction in Virginia permanently lose the right to vote unless a governor restores it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our claim is that essentially, Virginia made a promise when it was brought back into the United States Congress. It’s now time to keep that promise and to abide by the Virginia Readmission Act,” said ACLU attorney Vishal Agraharkar in a call with The Mercury on Monday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the defendants’ filing argues that Congress lacks the power to prohibit states from disenfranchising people with felony convictions under the Fourteenth Amendment in the U.S. Constitution and that states could choose to permanently disenfranchise people with felonies of all types, not just those in common law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the Tuesday hearing, Judge Roger Gregory noted Congress’ intent when using the Readmission Acts following the Civil War. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“(Congress) knew what (formerly-Confederate states) were going to do to newly-freed persons — they didn’t trust them,” Gregory said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gallager argued that the act was more limited to that time as a “contract between Congress and Virginia” to reenter the Union. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ACLU is working on the case with the WilmerHale law firm and a voting rights group called Protect Democracy. Plaintiffs are Virginians with felony convictions who have tried to have their rights restored by Youngkin without success. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while it’s Virginia’s constitution which grants governors purview over restoration of rights that is at the core of the Readmission Act case, Youngkin has been at the center of legal challenges to restorations under his administration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A once automatic process, Youngkin’s administration adjusted it last year to a petition-based one. As </span><a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/local/virginia/virginians-whose-rights-have-been-restored-drops-in-second-year-of-youngkin-administration-reports-show/291-fbe59fc9-c488-4449-be3e-ad4c0ba1c374" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">restoration numbers have dropped</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> under his tenure as governor, </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/judge-finds-for-youngkin-administration-in-naacps-foia-case/article_210d11ec-9936-11ee-a87e-138606562546.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">various lawsuits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have sprung up </span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/virginia-news/judge-rejects-lawsuit-but-compares-youngkins-power-to-restore-voting-rights-to-a-kings/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seeking answers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about criteria for restorations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a case by a man who sought answers about his restoration rejection was dismissed, the judge presiding over that case opined that “much like a monarch, the governor receives petitions for relief, may or may not rule upon them, and, when he does rule, need not explain his reasons.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judge Gregory was curious about criteria Tuesday as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do we know what the governor’s role is, really?” he posited. “Do we have facts, depositions about how that works and ‘how does he filter them out?’” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then suggested that a deposition would be the “best way” to glean information “for the only person that can restore rights.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court made no decision on the merits of the interlocutory appeal. From there, the Readmission Act case could potentially continue to be discussed and advance closer to a ruling. </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A years-long legal battle has entered a new chapter as residents of Brown Grove, a </span><a href="https://www.dhr.virginia.gov/historic-registers/042-5802/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">historically</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Black neighborhood in Hanover County, and a neighboring subdivision, have filed their response as part of the appeal in their case against the county’s board of supervisors and Wegmans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the national grocery chain was granted approval by the county’s board four years ago to build a large distribution center, it’s been beset by legal challenges ever since. The residents’ initial lawsuit was dismissed by Hanover Circuit Court; it has now landed in the Court of Appeals of Virginia. This is because last year, the Supreme Court of Virginia reversed the circuit court’s decision and deemed the residents had the right to challenge the supervisors’ decision.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In their suit, a group of local residents ask the court to declare the permissions for the project void based on claims that county officials violated state and local laws when granting Wegmans a special permit and an exception to local zoning ordinances that allowed the development of a 1.1 million square foot distribution center to proceed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though advance notice was published in a local newspaper ahead of the planned vote, the residents’ indicate that there was no specification about a cap on public comment registrations and restrictions on how many people could have physical access to the board room to observe the proceedings. They also challenge that the Wegman’s project was not an “essential” government function — as outlined in a local ordinance established for continuity of governance during that early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, by the time the limited public hearing took place, new proffers related to the project  were put up for discussion, rather than the documents that some residents had been able to provide virtual commentary on beforehand, the suit states. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title15.2/chapter22/article7/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">State law outlines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> how zoning changes — which is what an earlier part of the project needed to continue —  must give adjoining property owners written notice of the request for modification, and an opportunity to respond to the request within 21 days of the date of the notice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It wasn’t ‘in the dark of night’ with it happening at around 2:00 p.m., but it was effectively in the dark of night,” said Rod Morgan, a plaintiff in the case. “When you combine proffers submitted illegally with lack of access for the public, that’s a real issue.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as Morgan and his neighbors have filed a brief, other groups have filed an amicus brief in response to the case as well. The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Chamber of Commerce, Virginia Economic Developers Association, Associated General Contractors of Virginia and others jointly filed a brief defending Wegman’s and Hanover’s board. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That brief said that Wegman’s proffer was submitted before the 21-day deadline, but that the company continued to work with local government on refinements that led to the new proffer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As is customary with these types of applications, Wegmans continued to work with the Board, County officials, and the public to address their comments and further revise </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the proffers,” the brief read. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also notes another part of state code regarding zoning changes that allow for amended proffers to be accepted once a public hearing has already begun should the amendments “not materially affect the overall proposal.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In defense of the county and Wegmans, the brief also said that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">if the court doesn’t side with Hanover County’s board, it “will create disastrous results for localities throughout the Commonwealth and significantly impede economic development in Virginia.”</span></p>
<p>Wegmans and the Hanover County Board of Supervisors did not respond to request for comment on this article.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">History and the present</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than a local land use dispute, the placement of the development and pushback it garnered recalls the industrial encroachment or diminishment of historically Black neighborhoods in previous years, when Black people were disenfranchised in society.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other examples exist in Virginia, such as how</span><a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/charlottesville-officially-apologizes-for-razing-vinegar-hill/article_83b8aed4-2f4a-5ee2-baaa-2e7c9d43c2b0.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Charlottesville’s city council voted to raze Vinegar Hill in the 1960s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or how </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-03-07/reconnect-jackson-ward-interstate-95-cap-grant" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I-95 cut through Richmond’s Jackson Ward</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — a “</span><a href="https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/jackson-ward-and-its-black-wall-street.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Wall Street</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” in the south. I-95 also halved Brown Grove around that time as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now the once-contiguous community is sprinkled with a municipal airport, an industrial park, a landfill, concrete plants, and an I-95 truck stop. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown Grove first took shape from formerly enslaved people following the Civil War — just miles away from Richmond, Virginia’s state capital and the former capital of the Confederacy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flash forward to present day, and Brown Grove native Renada Harris lives near several of her family members as land has passed from generation to generation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s what makes our community unique,” she said. “You don’t see a lot of communities (of color) like this still intact.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said that communities that have historically been oppressed “are seen as not as likely to fight.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She and others founded the Brown Grove Preservation Group a few years ago. Through learning more about local and state laws, she said, neighbors were more equipped to advocate for themselves. The group also had support from the NAACP, Virginia’s chapter of the Sierra Club, and the Virginia Poverty Law Center. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to organizing efforts, Harris said there had been a defeatist attitude among some of her neighbors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They said ‘Those white people in Hanover are going to do what they want to do anywhere,’” Harris said both her Black and white neighbors would communicate.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as the mostly-white neighbors in the subdivision nearby Brow Grove began to be frustrated with Hanover County’s handling of the Wegmans development, deeper neighborhood alliances were formed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Harris is not one of the plaintiffs, she said the lawsuit is important. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m glad it’s out of Hanover County’s hands at this point,” she said. “Because I don’t think it would get a fair trial.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brian Buniva, the residents’ attorney who somewhat came out of retirement for this case four years ago, didn’t think at 73 years old, he’d still be defending it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In all these years my clients have not been able to be heard in court on merits, it’s all been through demurrers and motions to dismiss and delays and so on,” he said. “Well, we’re not going away.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The case dealing with asset forfeiture laws centers on the legal hoops Virginians have to jump through in court to argue they should get their money back after law enforcement officials take it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State law allows authorities to seize money and other assets suspected of being connected to drug trafficking or other criminal activity, but gives people who had their assets taken a chance to argue those suspicions are unfounded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dispute over the ruling in Chesterfield was largely about a procedural technicality, but it highlights the hurdles people can face when trying to argue the government wrongfully took their money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of a drug operation in 2020, Chesterfield authorities seized money from an auto shop owned by Roger McMillian. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A small amount of drugs was found on the second floor of the business where McMillian lived, court records show, and he was ultimately convicted of a drug possession offense. Another man arrested in connection to the case at a different location pleaded guilty to a drug distribution charge, according to court documents. But McMillian argued the cash police took from the business was legitimate and had no connection to drug dealing, money laundering or other crimes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though state law gave McMillian the right to fight the asset seizure in court, a Chesterfield judge ruled that his six legal filings were insufficient and dismissed his effort to reclaim the money without holding a trial. The court’s order in February of 2023 allowed local officials to keep the cash and said Chesterfield police could use it for “law enforcement purposes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his filing arguing the money should be returned, McMilllian said about $31,000 came from the sales of several vintage vehicles, two carports, a shed and an above-ground pool. The rest of it, he contended, came from customers of the auto body shop who paid in cash.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, the Chesterfield commonwealth’s attorney’s office claimed all McMillian’s responses were faulty because they didn’t include concrete evidence of those transactions apart from McMillian’s sworn statements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chesterfield Circuit Court Judge Edward A. Robbins Jr. agreed, ruling last year that McMillian had failed to make a legally proper claim to the money. The court issued a default judgment allowing the government to keep the cash, but McMillian appealed that decision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The appellate court decided McMillian was right, ruling the Chesterfield judge had incorrectly sided with prosecutors who insisted state law didn’t allow McMillian to fight the asset seizure unless his initial court filing included harder evidence like a bank statement, bill of sale or check register.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The examples of evidence listed by the circuit court all constitute exhibits, but exhibits are only one type of evidence that a litigant may use to ultimately prove his case at trial,” Judge Randolph A. Beales wrote in the appellate opinion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McMillian’s sworn statement about the money’s origins, Beales wrote, should have been enough to prevent the lower court from ruling against him without a trial to examine the case further.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The appellate court sent the case back to the Chesterfield court “to hold a trial on the merits of the forfeiture of these assets if the Commonwealth wishes to so proceed to a trial.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final outcome of the case is unclear. The lack of a trial also meant Chesterfield authorities didn’t have to put forward all evidence they might have disputing McMillian’s explanation of where the money came from.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McMillian’s attorney, John Mann, said his client was “pleased with the ruling.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It tells the circuit courts what is required of a person who’s contesting the order,” Mann said. “You don’t have to attach documents and things like that. You can make a good faith statement.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chesterfield commonwealth’s attorney’s office, which pushed for the default judgment against McMillian, said it could not comment on the ruling Wednesday because the prosecutor who handled the case was tied up with other business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Juli M. Porto, an attorney with the Blankingship &amp; Keith law firm who follows appellate decisions, said the ruling could result in fewer asset forfeitures in cases where the accused has a “meritorious defense.” A clearer standard for what counts as a sufficient response to an asset forfeiture, she said, means more cases could be decided on the merits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A clear standard is good for all involved — defendants, the Commonwealth, and trial courts — because there is less room for confusion and disparate decisions on the same issue,” Porto said in an email. “Consistent rulings are in everyone’s best interests.”</span></p>

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)</p><p>A federal appellate court has upheld blocking central parts of new Title IX rules from the Biden administration and granted an expedited hearing in October.</p>
<p>A three-judge panel of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals <a href="https://www.ag.ky.gov/Press%20Release%20Attachments/DN%2041%20Order%20Denying%20Partial%20Stay.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agreed Wednesday </a>to block the rules from taking effect Aug. 1, shortly before most schools begin their academic year. The rules, created by the U.S. Department of Education, were aimed at protecting students from discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation.</p>
<p>Chief Judge Jeffrey Sutton wrote in the majority opinion that all judges on the panel agreed the central parts of the rules should not take effect on Aug. 1.</p>
<p>“It is hard to see how all of the schools covered by Title IX could comply with this wide swath of new obligations if the Rule’s definition of sex discrimination remains enjoined,” Sutton said. “Harder still, we question how the schools could properly train their teachers on compliance in this unusual setting with so little time before the start of the new school year.”</p>
<p>Judge Andre Mathis wrote in a dissenting opinion that he would grant a partial stay, as requested by the Department of Education. “I am cognizant of Plaintiffs’ argument that the benefits of enacting the Rule’s unchallenged provisions are outweighed by the expense or confusion of phased implementation,” Mathis wrote. “But most of the expense is attributable to provisions that Plaintiffs neither directly challenge nor cite as a source of harm.”</p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed by Republican attorneys general in six states — Kentucky, Virginia, Indiana, Ohio, Tennessee and West Virginia.</p>
<p>Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman said in a statement that Title IX, which was established more than 50 years ago, “created equal opportunities for women and young girls in the classroom and on the field.” The Sixth Circuit ruling, he added, made it the first appellate court “to stop President Biden’s blatant assault on these fundamental protections.”</p>
<p>“This ruling is a victory for common sense itself, and it’s a major relief for Kentucky families,” Coleman said. “As Attorney General and as a Dad, we’ll keep up the fight for my girls and for women across Kentucky so they can continue to fulfill their potential for the next 50 years and beyond.”</p>
<p>In June, <a href="https://kentuckylantern.com/2024/06/17/us-judge-in-kentucky-blocks-biden-title-ix-rules-says-sex-gender-identity-not-the-same-thing/" target="_blank">Chief Judge Danny Reeves</a> of the U.S. District Court in Eastern Kentucky sided with Coleman and the other five GOP attorneys general. The judge said the Department of Education “seeks to derail deeply rooted law” with its proposed Title IX rules.</p>
<p>“At bottom, the Department would turn Title IX on its head by redefining ‘sex’ to include ‘gender identity.’ But ‘sex’ and ‘gender identity’ do not mean the same thing,” Reeves wrote. “The Department’s interpretation conflicts with the plain language of Title IX and therefore exceeds its authority to promulgate regulations under that statute.”</p>
<p>Established in 1972, <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/tix_dis.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Title IX</a> was created to prevent “discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities that receive federal financial assistance,” according to the Department of Education.</p>
<p>The Biden administration introduced the rules to “build on the legacy of Title IX by clarifying that all our nation’s students can access schools that are safe, welcoming, and respect their rights,” U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona previously said in a statement. The rules also <a href="https://kentuckylantern.com/2024/04/19/biden-administration-to-roll-back-the-betsy-devos-title-ix-rules/" target="_blank">would have rolled back Trump administration changes</a> that narrowly defined sexual harassment and directed schools to conduct live hearings, allowing those who were accused of sexual harassment or assault to cross-examine their accusers.</p>
<p>The Lantern has sought comment from the U.S. Department of Education on the latest ruling.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a case involving a flea infestation of an Alexandria rental, the Virginia Court of Appeals ruled Tuesday that lease agreements can’t override state law requiring that landlords keep their properties “in a fit and habitable condition.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the Virginia Residential Landlord Tenant Act, tenants must “take an active role in keeping the dwelling unit free from pests by prompt notifying the landlord of any infestations,” wrote Judge Doris Henderson Causey in </span><a href="https://www.vacourts.gov/opinions/opncavwp/1687224.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a unanimous decision by a three-judge panel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, she concluded, the law makes it clear that “it is ultimately the landlord’s duty to keep the premises habitable.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuesday’s ruling stems from a conflict over a lease for a single-family home in Alexandria that Mikeya Vance rented from landlord Christopher Parrish in September 2021. According to court records, Vance moved into the property Oct. 15, 2021 and immediately observed fleas in her bed. She then left the property Oct. 25 and notified Parrish of the infestation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The account of events provided by the appeals court outlines a string of extermination attempts undertaken by both Vance and Parrish. Vance first asked to end her lease Nov. 17, but Parrish refused. On Jan. 5, 2022, she filed a complaint against her landlord in Fairfax County General District Court seeking to terminate her lease and recover the rent she had paid during the infestation. While the district court ruled against her, the county circuit court later ruled in her favor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In appealing that decision, Parrish argued that Vance was responsible for dealing with the infestation, since the lease the two had signed stated the tenant would have the responsibility of “controlling and eliminating household pests including but not limited to fleas, ticks, bed bugs, roaches, silverfish, ants, crickets, and rodents during occupancy” and would be on the hook for “costs of the elimination of all such pests and vermin.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vance in turn contended that Virginia’s Residential Landlord Tenant Act requires landlords to keep properties habitable and forbids that responsibility from being transferred to tenants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The appeals court agreed. “When a lease provision purports to waive [a] tenant’s rights or remedies required by law, the law controls and the lease provision is unenforceable,” Causey wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the duties of a landlord that can’t be waived are the duty to “keep the premises in a fit and habitable condition,” she concluded. The presence of fleas, she found, “certainly can render the premises uninhabitable” because of the diseases they can carry.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Here, the lease agreement between Parrish and Vance attempted to shift the burden to deal with insect infestations to Vance,” Causey wrote. “However, the lease could not do so because Vance did not waive the warranty of habitability by signing the lease agreement.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The appeals court also rejected another argument by Parrish that the circuit court hadn’t had sufficient evidence to determine the fleas had been there prior to Vance moving in. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a hearing on the case this past September, Vance’s attorney, Karen Leiser, argued that the circuit court hadn’t been unreasonable in its ruling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If the tenant had somehow brought the fleas with her or had caused an infestation in some way, it is possible that that burden would shift to her to remediate the problem, but that is not what the trial court found,” Leiser told the appeals court. “The trial court found that the fleas must have already been there, and therefore it was the landlord’s obligation under the statute to remedy that problem.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Causey concluded that even though Parrish “asserts that Vance caused the flea infestation, the circuit court was entitled to credit” other testimony “that the flea activity had been ongoing for months, even before Vance took possession of the property.”</span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An admissions policy adopted by the Fairfax County School Board in 2020 to promote greater diversity at the elite Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology will remain in place after the U.S. Supreme Court opted not to take up a case challenging it brought forward by a coalition of parents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court did not offer a reason for not hearing the appeal of a May 2023 ruling by the Richmond-based U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals. But the decision sparked a dissent from Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas, who </span><a href="https://pacificlegal.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/022024zor_7647-copy.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tuesday that the high court should “wipe” the appeals court ruling “off the books.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Fourth Circuit’s reasoning is a virus that may not spread if promptly eliminated,” said the justices, who accused other schools of using Thomas Jefferson’s admissions model as a “blueprint for evading” the Equal Protection Clause.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to December 2020, Thomas Jefferson’s admissions process relied on a student’s performance on standardized tests, grade point average, writing samples and teacher recommendations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, Asian American students made up an increasing proportion of the school’s student body, while percentages of Black and Hispanic students remained persistently low. In 2019, the 4th Circuit noted, 71.5% of Thomas Jefferson students were Asian American, and 19.5% white. In 2020, “data indicated that the number of Black students admitted to TJ’s incoming freshman class was ‘too small for reporting’ — a designation meaning that ‘10 or fewer’ Black students had been extended offers of admission.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As public anger over the killing of George Floyd grew in 2020, the Fairfax County School Board adopted a series of changes to the school’s admissions process intended to increase the numbers of underrepresented students, particularly Black and Hispanic students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new policy eliminated the previous use of standardized tests to cull the ranks of applicants. Instead, a certain number of slots were allocated to each of the 28 middle schools that feed into Thomas Jefferson. Applicants were then considered based on their grade point average, which had to be 3.5 at a minimum, a “portrait sheet” describing their skills, a problem-solving essay, and four experience factors — eligibility for free or reduced price meals, status as an English language learner, eligibility for special education services, and attendance at a historically underrepresented public middle school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the admissions policy was instituted, the 4th Circuit noted applications for the Class of 2025 rose by almost 1,000. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The mean grade point average among those applicants was higher than it had been in five years and, in terms of demographics, the class of 2025 included markedly more low-income students, English-language learners, and girls than had prior classes at TJ,” the appeals court noted. “Notably, for the first time in more than a decade, all 28 middle schools in Fairfax County sent students to TJ in 2021. By contrast, in 2020, eight of the County’s middle schools had received zero offers of admission to TJ.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the changes also produced steep declines in Asian American students, who received only 54% of admissions offers for the Class of 2025. White students received 22% of offers, Hispanic students 11% and Black students 8%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Coalition for TJ, an advocacy group of Fairfax County public school parents, has repeatedly challenged the admissions changes, arguing that the changes in admissions were unconstitutional because they discriminated against Asian American students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February 2022, the coalition won its case in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, which ruled the new policy unfairly impacted Asian American applicants. But the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned that decision </span><a href="https://pacificlegal.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-05-23-circuit-opinion-coalitition-for-tj-v-fairfax-county-school-board.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in May</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Coalition subsequently appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Since June 2020, we&#8217;ve poured our hearts and souls into this fight, and it&#8217;s profoundly disappointing to see the justices end our legal battle,” the coalition stated.</p>
<p>Alito and Thomas&#8217; dissent &#8220;serves as a rallying cry, reminding us of the importance of our cause and urging continued vigilance in combating proxy discrimination,” the coalition said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fairfax County School Board praised the decision. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have long believed that the new admissions process is both constitutional and in the best interest of all of our students. It guarantees that all qualified students from all neighborhoods in Fairfax County have a fair shot at attending this exceptional high school,” said board Chair Karl Frisch in a </span><a href="https://www.fcps.edu/news/fcps-statement-supreme-courts-decision-regarding-tjhsst" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statement</span></a></p>

																						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1024" height="683" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Getty_gavel.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="" style="margin-bottom: 10px;" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Getty_gavel.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Getty_gavel-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Getty_gavel-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p style="font-size:12px;">(Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a reversal of an earlier decision, the Virginia Court of Appeals ruled Tuesday that an officer’s stop of two Black men in a Waynesboro neighborhood on suspicion of involvement in a home invasion that had just occurred had not violated one man&#8217;s rights against unreasonable seizure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In <a href="https://www.vacourts.gov/opinions/opncavwp/0868213.pdf" target="_blank">a majority opinion</a>, Judge Lisa Lorish wrote that the officer “possessed a reasonable, articulable suspicion of criminal activity to briefly detain” one of the men until other officers arrived within several minutes to provide additional information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judges Dominique Callins and Vernida Chaney both dissented, with Chaney writing in a sharply worded opinion that “today, while purporting to ‘make no new law,’ the majority grants police license to seize a Black man at gunpoint for merely walking late at night within the wide general area of a recent crime and ‘matching’ the race and gender of the suspects.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The case stems from a home invasion and pistol-whipping in Waynesboro that was reported by the victims around 11 p.m on a night in February 2020. After police responded to the home, officers issued a “be on the lookout” dispatch for three armed Black men “wearing black sweatshirts.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dispatch was heard by Augusta County Sheriff’s Deputy C. Stroop, who went by the house, spoke to officers there and then began to drive around the neighborhood to look for the perpetrators. Within what the court later determined were six to 10 blocks from the crime scene, he saw two Black men, Arun Rashid Turay and Justice Ahmed Carr, walking and stopped them at gunpoint. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roughly one and a half to two minutes later, other Waynesboro officers arrived. One of the responding officers confirmed Turay’s clothing matched security video footage but said Carr’s did not. When the men were searched, officers found credit cards belonging to one of the victims in Carr’s pocket and a victim’s keys and bloody clothes and shoes in a bookbag on Turay. Both men were arrested and later pled guilty to armed burglary and other charges after the court decided that the evidence found as a result of Stroop’s stop could be considered in the case. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In different cases, Turay and Carr each appealed the Waynesboro judge’s decision not to suppress that evidence. Turay’s challenges have sparked a string of different rulings from the Virginia Court of Appeals, which has flip-flopped on whether the stop was constitutional, ruling first against Turay, then in his favor and, most recently, against him once more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turay had argued that the evidence from the searches shouldn’t be allowed to be used because Stroop’s stop was an unconstitutional seizure not supported by “reasonable suspicion” that he was involved in the robbery. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. and Virginia courts have dealt at length with the thorny question of what constitutes reasonable suspicion. In Virginia, the courts have assessed, among other tests, whether an officer’s reasonable suspicion is based on “specific and articulable facts” as well as “an assessment of the totality of the circumstances.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the case of a stop related to a specific crime, the appeals court on Tuesday wrote that an officer could consider factors such as a person’s distance from where a crime is committed, the amount of time that has elapsed between the crime and the stop, the degree to which a person matches a description of a suspect, the suspect’s behavior and how many other people matching a description might be present. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her opinion, Lorish conceded that the vague description of the suspects in the be-on-the-lookout dispatch “was too general to give rise to reasonable suspicion to detain any person.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Without more, this vague description could not allow police to reasonably detain any Black male wearing dark clothing as a suspect in the crime,” she wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, she continued, other circumstances were relevant: Turay and Carr were seen within 10 blocks of the crime scene and within roughly 30 minutes of the police report. They were on foot. And they were the only people walking in the neighborhood late on a cold February night. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These factors all increase the relevance of Turay matching what would otherwise be a vague or general description,” the court found. Ultimately, it determined, “we cannot say Deputy Stroop lacked reasonable suspicion under the totality of the circumstances.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dissenting judges, however, argued the ruling “disregards the well-established protections of the Fourth Amendment and, in effect, authorizes race-based seizures of persons who appear to be engaged in innocent, lawful activity.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chaney contended that “at the time of the seizure, there was no particularized, objective basis for suspecting Turay of criminal activity.” Instead of the black sweatshirt described in the be-on-the-lookout announcement, she noted, Turay was wearing “a long-sleeved black top with a wide red stripe down each sleeve and a wide blue panel on each side,” while Carr was wearing a “long-sleeved white top.” Neither appeared to be armed. Only two men were walking, rather than the three described in the dispatch. And, the judge maintained, the deputy only testified that “not a lot” of people were around rather than saying definitively he had seen no one else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The totality of the facts and circumstances known at the time of the seizure does not give rise to reasonable, articulable suspicion that Turay participated in the robbery even if no other people were observed out on the street when the deputy first observed Turay,” she wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, Callins said the majority ruling “would be akin to holding that, when a Black man commits a crime and flees, any Black man in the vicinity is inherently a suspect.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Racially motivated stops are a pervasive problem in our society, and we must examine whether a stop could be justified by any information available to the officer before determining that the stop was illegal,” she wrote. “But I cannot say, given the totality of the circumstances, that this stop justified as particularized.”</span></p>

Parker Michels-Boyce for The Virginia Mercury</p><p>The Supreme Court of Virginia on Thursday reversed a lower court’s decision by reinstating a lawsuit brought by a former West Point High School teacher after he was fired for refusing to refer to a transgender student by his requested pronouns.</p>
<p>Peter Vlaming, a former high school French teacher, refused to use male pronouns to refer to a student who had recently undergone a gender transition and legal name change. Vlaming said doing so went against his religious beliefs and violated his right to free speech, according to court records.</p>
<p>Vlaming filed a $1 million lawsuit after the school board fired him for violating the school division’s anti-discrimination and anti-harassment policies. However, the King William Circuit Court dismissed his case, finding that Vlaming did not provide valid reasons that the law could accept his suit.</p>
<p>In his opinion, Virginia Supreme Court Justice D. Arthur Kelsey wrote that Vlaming’s rights were violated by the board and that his claim should go forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Compelling an educator’s &#8216;speech or silence&#8217; on such a divisive issue would cast &#8216;a pall of orthodoxy over the classroom&#8217; on a topic that has &#8216;produced a passionate political and social debate,'&#8221; Kelsey wrote.</p>
<p>The opinion said the Virginia Constitution “seeks to protect diversity of thought, diversity of speech, diversity of religion, and diversity of opinions.”</p>
<p>The court’s decision was a blow to school leaders and advocates from parts of the commonwealth who urged the Supreme Court of Virginia to uphold the lower court’s dismissal in an amicus brief.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Equality Virginia and our allies are still analyzing the ruling, but one thing is abundantly clear: Virginia&#8217;s students should be treated with dignity, especially in the public school system,&#8221; said Narissa Rahaman, executive director of Equality Virginia, in an email to the Mercury. &#8220;LGBTQ+ youth deserve safety, respect and the opportunity to thrive. We will keep fighting for them until that goal is a reality for all students, regardless of where they live in the commonwealth.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal organization focused on protecting religious freedoms that represented Vlaming, said a court should hear the former teacher’s case.</p>
<p>“Peter wasn’t fired for something he said; he was fired for something he couldn’t say,” said ADF Senior Counsel Chris Schandevel, who argued before the court on behalf of Vlaming. “The Virginia Supreme Court rightly agreed that Peter’s case against the school board for violating his rights under the Virginia Constitution and state law should proceed. As a teacher, Peter was passionate about the subject he taught, was well-liked by his students, and did his best to accommodate their needs and requests. But he couldn’t in good conscience speak messages that he doesn’t believe to be true, and no school board or government official can punish someone for that reason.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Fluctuating state law</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In 2020, the Virginia General Assembly passed a law requiring local school divisions to adopt model policies on transgender students. The policies adopted by former Gov. Ralph Northam&#8217;s administration directed schools to use the names and pronouns identified by students as corresponding with their gender identity, among other requirements.</p>
<p>However, beginning in September 2022, Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/09/16/youngkin-administration-overhauls-virginia-transgender-student-policies/" target="_blank">overhauled the policies</a> to prioritize parents&#8217; &#8220;fundamental rights&#8221; in a sharp reversal from the stance the state took under Northam and a Democrat-dominated legislature.</p>
<p>As part of the changes, the new policies require parental approval for any changes to students’ “names, nicknames, and/or pronouns,” direct schools to keep parents “informed about their children’s well-being,” specify that student participation in activities and athletics shall be based on sex and state that “students shall use bathrooms that correspond to his or her sex, except to the extent that federal law otherwise requires.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.vacourts.gov/opinions/opnscvwp/1220596.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ruling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reverses an earlier decision by the Virginia Court of Appeals that found the state’s Department of Medical Assistance Services, the agency that administers Virginia’s Medicaid program, could not be reimbursed the more than $22,000 it paid to cover the victim’s medical costs because DMAS was itself not a victim of the crime. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That crime occurred in the fall of 2019 outside the home of Patrick County resident Justin Hawks. Larry Puckett, who court filings say had known Hawks for about 10 years, had been staying on the property as a guest but was asked to leave by Hawks after “he proved to be an unpleasant guest.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Puckett initially left Hawks’ property, he later returned several times, culminating in a physical altercation. Eventually, court filings report, as Hawks was returning home, Puckett ran up behind him and jumped on his back. Hawks told Puckett, “I’m not going to fight you,” and Puckett responded, “I’m not fighting you. I’m killing you, m&#8212;&#8211;f&#8212;&#8211;,” before stabbing Hawks multiple times. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Puckett, however, had not killed Hawks, who ran to the nearest house and was brought to the hospital. There, he was treated for multiple stab wounds to his chest and arm at a cost of almost $120,000. Because he was unable to pay for the costs of his medical care, Medicaid stepped in and paid a negotiated lesser amount of $22,691. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Puckett was convicted by Patrick Circuit Court of malicious wounding. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison, with eight years suspended, and ordered to complete five years of probation and pay DMAS the cost of the medical services as restitution. The restitution was to be paid in $50 increments each month following his release from prison. The appeals court later noted that Puckett’s attorney had called the requirement “an exercise in futility,” and that Puckett’s “last request for legal assistance showed no assets and listed his address as ‘homeless.’” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.vacourts.gov/opinions/opncavwp/1002213.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Court of Appeals concluded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Puckett couldn’t be ordered to pay DMAS restitution because “it was not established that these medical expenses were ‘incurred by the victim’ of Puckett’s malicious wounding.” The appeals court based its conclusion on a definition of “incurred” drawn from a state Medicaid regulation about what the program could cover.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Supreme Court of Virginia rejected that argument, saying it didn’t consider the Medicaid regulation relevant and noting that the state’s restitution law “does not say that the restitution must be paid </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">to</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the victim. It only requires that the expense be ‘incurred by the victim.’” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that Medicaid paid for the medical costs rather than Hawks himself doesn’t change the situation, Judge D. Arthur Kelsey wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“An incurred medical expense does not become unincurred simply because a medical provider waives its right to seek full payment from an indigent individual in hopes of recovering partial payment from a solvent entity, such as a private or public insurer” like Medicaid, Kelsey concluded. </span></p>

States and jurisdictions are making it easier to expunge and seal criminal records to help residents seeking employment, housing and education. (Rich Pedroncelli/Associated Press)</p><p>More states are making it easier for residents to clear or seal their criminal records.</p>
<p>The effort has drawn bipartisan support, as lawmakers across the political spectrum say it will help people find jobs and housing, in turn boosting local economies and reducing reliance on social services.</p>
<p>“Folks that get out of jail or prison with criminal records, it’s like getting out with the handcuffs still on,” Keith Wallington, the director of advocacy with the Justice Policy Institute, a nonprofit criminal justice research and advocacy group, told Stateline.</p>
<p>But the shift has created some new concerns. The surge in applications after lawmakers eased rules created a major backlog in several states. Some residents struggle to pay the required fees. And some prosecutors and legislators worry that people who commit additional crimes after their records are expunged may not be held fully accountable.</p>
<p>At least four states — Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota and New York — passed legislation this year that would make clearing or sealing one’s criminal record easier. Michigan and Ohio also had similar laws go into effect this year.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="HJuNMqTxVX"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2021/02/17/long-deadlocked-virginia-lawmakers-reach-compromise-to-seal-past-criminal-convictions/">Long deadlocked, Virginia lawmakers reach compromise to seal past criminal convictions</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Long deadlocked, Virginia lawmakers reach compromise to seal past criminal convictions&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2021/02/17/long-deadlocked-virginia-lawmakers-reach-compromise-to-seal-past-criminal-convictions/embed/#?secret=cw0YxzFDyL#?secret=HJuNMqTxVX" data-secret="HJuNMqTxVX" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>Expungement removes arrests and convictions from a criminal record as if they never existed, while record sealing hides records from the public but allows access by court officials and some law enforcement agencies. Almost every state has some form of expungement or record sealing policy. Though they can vary widely, most policies require individuals to be crime-free for a set amount of time, usually tied to how serious their conviction was.</p>
<p>Over the past five years, more states have moved to offer automatic expungement or sealing, which generally uses a computer system to wipe or shield people’s criminal records when they become eligible. At least 26 states and the District of Columbia have an automatic system already in place or in the works.</p>
<p>“More lawmakers recognize the barriers that come with having a criminal record,” said Lauren Krisai, deputy director of the Justice Action Network, a bipartisan criminal justice advocacy group. “They recognize that this is actually bad for employers. It’s bad for employment. It’s bad for the workforce and the economy.”</p>
<p>Some state Republicans have “abandoned this mentality of tough on crime,” according to Nino Marchese, the director of criminal justice and civil justice at the American Legislative Exchange Council, a conservative nonprofit membership organization that drafts model legislation. Marchese said state legislators in the group are increasingly inclined toward evidence-based policymaking, which typically involves analyzing research and data, to draft criminal justice policies.</p>
<p>But some residents haven’t been able to get their records expunged because of the fees and large backlogs.</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Backlogs and accessibility</h4>

	</h4>
<p>In 2021, Oregon <a href="https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2021R1/Downloads/MeasureDocument/SB397/Enrolled" target="_blank">passed a law</a> eliminating fees and expanding expungement eligibility to include non-conviction records, such as arrests, dismissals and acquittals. The law also removed filing fees and adjusted waiting periods for specific offenses. The surge in applications created a backlog of approximately 15,000 cases in Multnomah County, which includes Portland, and a 16-month waiting period for application reviews,<a href="https://www.wweek.com/news/2023/11/08/a-new-criminal-justice-reform-is-so-popular-its-clogged-the-system/" target="_blank"> the Willamette Week</a> reported.</p>
<p>In Utah, expungement application fees quadrupled in July after the legislature failed to pass a bill to extend its pilot program, which previously lowered fees to $65. The state also is facing a backlog of automatic expungements and of petition-based applications, which are expected to take several months, according to Nicole Borgeson, the assistant director of the Utah Bureau of Criminal Identification, the agency tasked with handling applications.</p>
<p>A staffing shortage and an influx of applications just before the pilot program shut down contributed to the state’s backlog, Borgeson said in an interview. The bureau hired new employees in August who are undergoing training and aims to review applications within 30 days, she said.</p>
<p>“It’s very important to us to make sure that we’re doing these in a timely manner — not only for us, but also for the applicants,” Borgeson said. “We know that this can be an impact on their lives and livelihoods. … We are concerned about that. We are trying to get caught up.”</p>
<p>Republican state Rep. Jim Dunnigan, who designed the pilot program, introduced legislation earlier this year to continue offering reduced fees, but withdrew his bill after receiving pushback from other lawmakers. Dunnigan said that some legislators who opposed the bill believe people seeking expungements should pay their own filing fees because they made the decision to commit a crime. Now, Dunnigan is negotiating with concerned colleagues before the state’s upcoming legislative session.</p>
<p>“We’re still working on it, and I don’t know where we’re going to end up. We’ve tried to come to a compromise — probably a little farther than some legislators want to go. It’s not as far as I want to go,” Dunnigan told Stateline. “I’m hopeful, I think we’ll see something that will pass.”</p>
<p>Many Utahns with records can’t afford the increase in fees, according to Noella Sudbury, founder and CEO of Rasa Legal Public Benefit Corporation, also known as Rasa, a company that aims to make expungement more accessible by offering low-cost legal services.</p>
<p>https://stateline.org/2021/05/25/more-states-consider-automatic-criminal-record-expungement/</p>
<p>“A just society is one in which access to justice is available to not just those who have money, but to all members of the society,” Sudbury wrote in an email to Stateline.</p>
<p>The New Jersey State Police, facing a backlog of approximately 46,000 expungement applications, has fallen up to two years behind in processing, according to a class-action<a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2023/10/23/new-jersey-state-polices-expungement-backlog-of-46k-cases-spurs-lawsuit/" target="_blank"> lawsuit filed by the New Jersey Office of the Public Defender</a> against the state police in October.</p>
<p>The lawsuit alleges that this delay has led to the illegal disclosure of sealed criminal histories to potential employers, landlords and others conducting background checks. Residents have suffered job losses, housing denials and missed professional opportunities because of the state police’s failure to adhere to judges’ orders, the lawsuit alleges.</p>
<p>“Every day that passes is a day that these people who are entitled to the relief and the benefit of their expungement order can’t actually benefit from the expungement statute that was passed to help them,” Michael Noveck, assistant deputy public defender with the New Jersey Office of the Public Defender, said in an interview.</p>
<p>Spokespeople from the state police and the New Jersey Office of the Attorney General, which oversees the state police, declined to comment on pending litigation. New Jersey’s expungement statute does not specify a time frame for the state police to process expungement orders.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>In 2019, the state police received $15 million to improve and modernize its expungement processing systems, but it is unclear whether it has made changes to handle the increase in expungement orders. The state police also declined to answer questions about the funding and any upgrades to its systems.</p>
<p>To address processing delays, the legislature should amend the statute to include a specific time frame, such as 60 or 90 days, during which the New Jersey State Police must process granted expungement orders, said Meredith Schalick, the director of the Expungement Law Project at Rutgers Law School, which has helped hundreds of people since 2018 get criminal expungements.</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Broadening eligibility</h4>

	</h4>
<p>Some critics argue that broadening eligibility for expungements or the sealing of criminal records will put the public at risk by cloaking violent crimes.</p>
<p>In Wisconsin, a bipartisan bill failed earlier this year because of objections from Republican senators. Despite being introduced multiple times over the past few years and successfully passing the Assembly, the bill has consistently faltered in the Senate.</p>
<p>During a public hearing on the bill in April, Republican state Sen. Andre Jacque suggested the bill’s proposed one-year waiting period was too short compared with neighboring states such as Illinois, Iowa, Michigan and Minnesota, whose waiting periods range from two to eight years. “It’s a pretty stark difference,” he said. Jacque also expressed concerns about overloading the court system and withholding criminal records from employers.</p>

<p>Wisconsin is the only state where past and closed cases are ineligible for expungement, according to the Wisconsin Policy Forum, a nonpartisan policy research organization.</p>
<p>Wisconsinites must apply for expungement at the time of their sentencing. Wisconsin also is among a few states that restrict expungement eligibility solely to young offenders, with the state’s age cap set at 25.</p>
<p>The bill would eliminate the age cap and shift the expungement application process to after the sentence has been served.</p>
<p>“I’m optimistic that this is the session that we finally get it across the goal line … and make some forward progress that’s hugely needed in Wisconsin,” state Rep. Evan Goyke, a Democrat and former public defender, told Stateline.</p>
<p>Prosecutors in Maryland worry that under the state’s new law, they may not be able to consider the past crimes of someone who commits another crime after having their record expunged, Baltimore County State’s Attorney Scott Shellenberger said. The <a href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Legislation/Details/sb0037?ys=2023RS" target="_blank">REDEEM Act</a>, which went into effect in October, halves the waiting period for filing a petition to expunge criminal records for certain offenses.</p>
<p>Someone who gets their record expunged can legally say they have no criminal record, which can complicate decision-making for prosecutors and court officials alike, said Shellenberger, a Democrat.</p>
<p>“We make our current decisions based upon what your background is,” Shellenberger said in an interview. “If we don’t know the truth about your background, then it’s hard to make a reasoned decision.”</p>
<p>In response to these concerns, the law’s lead author and sponsor, state Sen. Jeff Waldstreicher, a Democrat, said that if someone were to reoffend after having their record expunged, they still face criminal penalties.</p>
<p>“They will still be held accountable for their criminal offense and it’s important that we continue to hold them accountable,” Waldstreicher said in an interview.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a case involving a Chesapeake carport, the Virginia Court of Appeals ruled that zoning violation notices issued by a local government must clearly state that the property owner’s failure to contest the violation within 30 days means the decision is legally “final and unappealable.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Without the finality language, a property owner might logically conclude that the failure to appeal to the [board of zoning appeals] within 30 days would foreclose an appeal in that forum, but that they could later appeal to a court,” </span><a href="https://www.vacourts.gov/opinions/opncavwp/1692221.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judge Daniel E. Ortiz wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The case stems from a freestanding carport built without a permit on a residential property in Chesapeake almost two decades ago. In 2020, two years after new owner Donald Calway bought the property, a city code compliance inspector issued him a notice of violation and ordered him to fix it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the appeals court, fine print at the bottom of the original notice informed Calway he could contest the violation to the board of zoning appeals within 30 days “but did not mention that failure to appeal would make the decision final and unappealable.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Court of Appeals found the omission of that statement made the notice “defective” and therefore made a later penalty unenforceable because </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title15.2/chapter22/section15.2-2311/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requires that any notice of violation “include a statement informing the recipient … that the decision shall be final and unappealable if not appealed within 30 days.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the city of Chesapeake argued it had satisfied the requirements of the law by including a statement that additional information could be found on the city’s website, the judges rejected that argument. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The statute places the burden on the zoning administrator to clearly delineate the appeal rights of property owners,” Ortiz wrote, adding: “Each [notice of violation] must describe both (1) the right to appeal within 30 days </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(2) the finality of the decision after 30 days if not appealed.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The appeals court noted that its ruling is in line with a </span><a href="https://www.oag.state.va.us/files/Opinions/2008/08-025-Cole.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2008 advisory opinion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from then-Attorney General Bob McDonnell that a notice of violation “must include a statement informing the recipient … that the decision is final and unappealable if not so appealed in thirty days.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the court left the door open for Chesapeake to continue pursuing enforcement actions against Calway. Because a later letter from the city zoning administrator declaring the carport illegal included all of the statements required under the law, the judges noted it “is potentially shielded from further attack in this or any future litigation.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Koehler, the attorney representing Calway, said, “We’re holding our breath to see what the city does. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right now we’re hoping that the city will simply allow him to keep” the carport, Koehler said, noting that other homes in the neighborhood have similar structures and that Calway and the prior owner had paid property taxes that included the value of the carport for over 15 years. “It’s simply a matter of fairness, I think, given that the structure has been there since 2004.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked about whether the city intends to appeal the decision or pursue further enforcement actions, Chesapeake Director of Public Communications Heath E. Covey said in an email, “The city respectfully disagrees with this ruling and is currently evaluating next steps.”</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Court of Appeals is allowing a legal malpractice suit to go forward in a case brought by a Rockingham County man who served almost nine years in prison for his involvement in the 2012 theft of sandwiches and two cases of beer from a grocery store in Harrisonburg. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.vacourts.gov/opinions/opncavwp/1079223.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ruling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, handed down Tuesday, sends the case back to Rockingham Circuit Court for further arguments about whether Mark O’Hara Wright is entitled to damages from defense attorney Andrew Graves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, the Richmond-based U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals </span><a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca4/19-7447/19-7447-2021-06-21.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ordered Wright’s early release</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, concluding that “had Wright’s trial counsel been adequately informed, there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of his trial would have been different.” That decision overturned an earlier determination by the Supreme Court of Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the federal court’s account of the theft, Wright, his brother Robert Wright and Robert Wright’s 15-year-old stepson on March 25, 2012, took sandwiches and two cases of beer from Martin’s Grocery in Harrisonburg and left without paying. Security guard Garrett Atkins then followed them to their minivan and took one of the cases of beer from Robert Wright’s hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At that point, Robert’s stepson stepped out of the minivan — with Wright on the opposite side of the van, out of Atkins’s view — and ‘took a fighting stance,’ telling Atkins, ‘I’m going to f— you up,” the ruling continued. “Robert then grabbed the beer back from Atkins, and Wright, Robert, and Robert’s stepson left in the minivan, taking with them the sandwiches and beer.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Atkins testified at trial that he never spoke to Mark Wright on the day of the theft and that the “abnormal” events made him “uncomfortable.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wright was charged with petit larceny, contributing to the delinquency of a minor and, most significantly, robbery because his brother physically took the case of beer from Atkins in the parking lot. The robbery charge carried a sentence of five years to life in prison. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After evidence was presented during the trial, prosecutors instructed the jury that it could convict Wright on the robbery charge or the lesser offense of grand larceny from the person — a crime that carries a sentence of zero to 20 years’ imprisonment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State law allows a defendant to be convicted of a crime that they haven’t been charged with as long as the crime is a less serious offense than the original charge and there is evidence to support the lesser charge. Virginia courts have ruled that though robbery and grand larceny from the person are similar crimes that both involve stealing, they are not interchangeable. Robbery requires an element of violence or intimidation. Grand larceny from the person does not but requires prosecutors to prove the stolen goods were worth at least $5.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals later noted, the grand larceny charge “is not a lesser included offense of robbery under Virginia law. Nor was there any doubt on that point at the time of Wright’s trial.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The jury subsequently acquitted Wright of robbery but found him guilty of the grand larceny charge and recommended a 10-year sentence, which a judge accepted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Altogether, Wright was sentenced to more than 22 years in prison. (Half of that sentence was on charges related to the arrest of him and his brother, when bear deterrent was deployed against a sheriff’s deputy. </span><a href="https://www.vacourts.gov/opinions/opnscvwp/1150181.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Supreme Court of Virginia later found there was insufficient evidence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to show that Mark Wright had even been in the room at the time the bear deterrent was used, and a </span><a href="https://www.dnronline.com/news/crime/theft-case-under-review/article_d3574c92-c412-11e6-b150-176c2e748b01.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rockingham County judge ultimately dismissed the charges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, Wright petitioned the Supreme Court of Virginia to review his case, arguing his attorney, Graves, had failed to assist him effectively. The state high court turned down his petition. It concluded that because Graves had testified that he “would not have objected to the instruction whether he did or did not know” the relevant law since it gave the jury the option of convicting his client on a less serious offense, the attorney had been operating on “strategy coupled with a lack of knowledge.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 4th Circuit rejected that conclusion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Under the correct and clearly established standard, trial counsel’s performance fell below prevailing professional norms when he failed, without justification, to inform himself of state law critical to his client’s case,” the court wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, the three-judge panel ruled that Graves’ lack of objection to the jury instruction likely had a significant impact on the outcome of the trial. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It also is highly likely that a jury instructed only on robbery would have acquitted Wright of that charge: The actual jury did acquit Wright of robbery, finding that the Commonwealth had failed to prove the elements of that crime beyond a reasonable doubt,” the court wrote. “And had the jury been instructed on petit larceny, it might or might not have convicted Wright of that crime – </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">but either way, Wright would have served no more than one year for the offense, as opposed to his ten-year sentence on grand larceny from the person.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following his release, Wright sued Graves for legal malpractice, a case the Virginia Court of Appeals is now allowing to go forward. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of the appeals court’s ruling Tuesday centers on state law requiring individuals who bring criminal malpractice claims against their attorney to show they were actually innocent of the crime. Virginia, the opinion by Judge Stuart A. Raphael notes, “is among the majority of jurisdictions that impose an actual-innocence requirement.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this case, Wright has repeatedly “pleaded that he was factually innocent of the crime for which he was convicted: grand larceny from the person,” the appeals court wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a separate concurring opinion, Judge Lisa Lorish wrote that the case raises the question of “whether his case merits an exception to the general rule that a criminal-malpractice plaintiff must prove actual innocence.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Graves’ attorneys did not respond to a request for comment. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a decision that touched on the finer points of how policies become law, the court ruled that language in the state budget overrode conflicting directives in a 2020 law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is hard to imagine a more definitive statement of the General Assembly’s intention that the provisions of the budget enacted in 2022 should be given effect over any other conflicting law,” wrote Justice Wesley G. Russell in a unanimous opinion Thursday that upheld an earlier decision in Albemarle County Circuit Court. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The high court’s ruling is a legal defeat for an estimated 8,000 inmates who over time could have been released early under an “enhanced” form of the state’s earned sentence credit system Democrats passed in 2020. Opponents of the GOP-led 2022 budget change altering that system have been particularly critical of its impact on more than 500 inmates who the state had notified would be released shortly after July 2022 before backtracking just weeks before they expected to be let out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current case was brought by the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia on behalf of one of those inmates, Antoine Anderson, who is being held at Coffeewood Correctional Center in Culpeper County. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to 2020, Virginia inmates could have their sentences reduced by up to 4.5 days every 30 days for good behavior. That year, the Democratic-controlled General Assembly passed a law that retroactively increased the number of credits inmates could earn in a 30-day period to 15, moving up those individuals’ release dates. The law set a date of July 1, 2022 for the new system to go into effect. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the legislation prohibited the enhanced credits from being applied to sentences for certain violent crimes, it allowed inmates with “mixed” sentences — imposed for both violent and nonviolent crimes — to reduce the sentences they received for their nonviolent crimes more quickly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In preparation for the new system, the Virginia Department of Corrections </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/07/11/a-slap-in-the-face-prisoners-families-have-hopes-dashed-by-governors-amendment/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">notified hundreds of prisoners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including Anderson, that they would be released early, and families began preparing for their return. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In June 2022, however, Gov. Glenn Youngkin proposed an amendment to the budget that would prevent inmates with mixed sentences from being eligible for any enhanced credits. The change </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/06/17/general-assembly-hands-youngkin-some-wins-losses-on-budget-amendments/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">narrowly passed the legislature</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with three Democrats — Sens. John Bell of Loudoun, Lynwood Lewis of Accomack and Monty Mason of Williamsburg — joining Republicans in its support. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson, who had previously been notified he would be released in the first wave of inmates eligible for the enhanced credits, was subsequently told he would remain incarcerated until April 2024. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First arrested on federal drug charges in 2004, Anderson that August received a 13-year state sentence after he tried to break out of the Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail where he was being held. He received four sentences for that attempt: one year for attempted escape, five years for abduction, two years for assault on a law enforcement officer, and five years for a second assault on a law enforcement officer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the 2020 law, Anderson would have been eligible to earn enhanced credits to reduce his sentences for attempted escape and assault on a law enforcement officer but could not have decreased his sentence for abduction more quickly. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the lawsuit, the ACLU of Virginia argued that the budget change couldn’t be used to halt the early releases of inmates who had accrued credits under the 2020 system. The group contended that while the 2020 law had specified it applied “retroactively,” the budget amendment had not included that language. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, the Supreme Court of Virginia rejected that argument on the grounds that because the 2020 law wasn’t scheduled to go into effect until July 1, 2022, none of the inmates had actually earned any enhanced credits before the budget change was implemented. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2020 law “did not go into effect prior to July 1, 2022, and has never been in effect without the modification,” Russell wrote. “As a result, neither Anderson nor others similarly situated have ever been eligible to receive enhanced [earned sentence credits].”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ACLU of Virginia said it was “disappointed” in the ruling, but “the fight is far from over.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The legislature can and should keep its promise to people who have done the hard work to earn a second chance,” said attorney Geri Greenspan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this summer, the Supreme Court of Virginia </span><a href="https://www.acluva.org/sites/default/files/field_documents/opinion.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ruled in favor of another inmate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> represented by the ACLU of Virginia, Steven Prease, who had argued the state was unlawfully limiting his eligibility for the enhanced sentence credits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prease contended that he could earn the enhanced credits for attempted aggravated murder because it was not explicitly listed among the crimes state law declared ineligible for quicker release, while the Virginia Department of Corrections argued the General Assembly had intended to include it. The court rejected that argument, and Prease was released July 13.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ACLU of Virginia has since filed </span><a href="https://www.acluva.org/en/press-releases/aclu-virginia-files-two-new-cases-calling-vadoc-release-people-who-have-earned" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two more cases</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> arguing the corrections department is unlawfully interpreting the law to deny other inmates early release.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Today concludes a multi-year investigation and prosecution by my office,” said Attorney General Jason Miyares in a release announcing the sentencing of Bhagavan “Doc” Antle. “In Virginia, we uphold the rule of law without exception, whether dealing with violent repeat offenders, big pharma, fraudsters and scammers, or wildlife traffickers.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Antle, the owner of 50-acre tropical preserve Myrtle Beach Safari, came under scrutiny by Virginia officials because of his relationship with Keith Wilson, the owner of Wilson’s Wild Animal Park in Winchester. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After state agents raided the Winchester zoo and seized 119 wild animals, including lions and tigers, in 2019, </span><a href="https://www.insidenova.com/headlines/wilsons-wild-animal-park-owner-nephew-plead-in-animal-cruelty-case/article_d34bfb2e-ac76-11ec-82fd-23c0455c977e.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wilson was convicted of 27 counts of animal cruelty</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and forbidden to own, sell or work with any exotic species. (His nephew was also convicted on 19 counts of animal cruelty.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a separate case, a Frederick grand jury </span><a href="https://www.oag.state.va.us/files/2020/WilsonIndictments.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in October 2020 indicted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> both Wilson and Antle for conspiring with each other to traffick lions in violation of the federal Endangered Species Act, as well as engaging in animal cruelty. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This June, a Frederick jury convicted Antle of two felony counts of wildlife trafficking and two felony counts of conspiring to traffick wildlife. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiger-king-documentary-antle-trafficking-conviction-689456335b6be5cc51f87f48f7463539" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Associated Press</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the prosecution characterized Antle’s purchases of lion cubs from the Winchester zoo as a “cub pipeline” from Virginia to South Carolina that operated illegally after lions were designated endangered in 2015. Antle’s defense attorney, Erin Harrigan, argued the lion cubs Antle received were gifts from Wilson, and that Antle had separately donated thousands of dollars to Wilson’s zoo for an expanded tiger habitat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the terms of his sentence, Antle isn’t allowed to “work, own, possess, broker, buy, sell, trade, transfer, barter or donate any exotic animals for five years in the Commonwealth of Virginia.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If he violates the law or those terms during the next five years, he could be subject to two years of incarceration that are otherwise suspended.</span></p>
<p>Antle&#8217;s attorneys, Eric Breslin and Erin Harrigan, said they were &#8220;pleased and grateful that the judge rejected the government&#8217;s request for incarceration and saw Mr. Antle&#8217;s immense value in his work and family community.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Antle was convicted on four charges that amount to failing to obtain a permit for otherwise entirely lawful activity in the highly-regulated industry that is exhibiting endangered species,&#8221; they wrote. &#8220;These charges have never been brought in Virginia before, and the commonwealth’s case suffers from a variety of factual and legal defects. As we have maintained since his conviction at trial, we remain confident Mr. Antle will be fully vindicated by the courts in Virginia.&#8221;</p>

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Court of Appeals on Tuesday upheld a 2020 decision by the Virginia Employment Commission that Amazon’s logistics arm had misclassified delivery drivers who work under its Uber-like Flex system as independent contractors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ruling stems from a case that began in 2019 when former Flex driver Ronald Diggs filed an unemployment claim with the VEC. The commission subsequently found the work Diggs and other Flex drivers had performed for Amazon as independent contractors should be classified as employment, and ordered the company to pay unemployment insurance taxes for all other drivers who were “misclassified as independent contractors.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Sept. 26, a three-judge panel of the state appeals court found that “the evidence supports the Commission’s determination that Diggs was an Amazon employee” and that it was reasonable for the commission to extend that conclusion to all other Flex drivers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Amazon’s Flex driver program, independent drivers compete for available delivery routes through an app and then are responsible for collecting and dropping off all of the packages on that route. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s simple: You use your own vehicle to deliver packages for Amazon as a way of earning extra money to move you closer to your goals,” the company says on its Flex website. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon considers Flex drivers self-employed independent contractors. Among other arguments in an appeal of VEC’s decision in Richmond City Circuit Court, the company contended Flex drivers “are free to conduct the manner and means of the delivery services without instruction from Amazon” and “have no set hours of work, do not work full time, do not make any regular oral or written reports to Amazon, are free to choose their own routes to deliver packages, and are paid ‘by the job,’ not hourly, weekly, or monthly.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Employment Commission, however, disputed that classification. State law directs the commission to rely on 20 factors outlined by the Internal Revenue Service in determining whether a worker is an independent contractor or an employee for tax purposes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those 20 factors include the employer’s provision of training to the worker, a continuing relationship between the worker and employer, set hours of work, the requirement that a worker be full time or work on the employer’s premises, the employer’s furnishing of a worker with tools and materials, the employer’s ability to order that a worker do a job in a particular sequence, and the ability of a worker to work for more than one firm at a time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Generally the relationship of employer and employee exists when the person or persons for whom the services are performed have the right to control and direct the individual who performs the services, not only as to the result to be accomplished by the work but also as to the details and means by which that result is accomplished,” the commission quoted the IRS in support of its determination. “That is, an employee is subject to the will and control of the employer not only as to what shall be done but as to how it shall be done.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Employment Commission argued that many of the 20 factors showed that Amazon exerted a level of control over Diggs — and, by extension, other Flex drivers — that was more in line with a relationship between an employer and employee rather than an employer and an independent contractor. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, Flex drivers were given specific instructions “about when, where, and how they are to work,” including where they had to place packages, were required to undergo training in the form of mandatory video tutorials, were compelled to follow a particular sequence of services, were required to contact the company about any problems they encountered and were subject to regular reporting through the driver app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VEC also concluded that even though drivers were paid by delivery block, or route, “all delivery blocks reflected a $20.00 per hour rate,” meaning they received “in effect, an hourly rate of pay.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon appealed that conclusion in both Richmond Circuit Court and the Virginia Court of Appeals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whether, when, and how frequently to provide delivery services to Amazon customers are … entirely within delivery partners’ discretion,” the company wrote in filings with the Richmond Circuit Court. “When making deliveries, delivery partners control all aspects of the delivery service, including how to load packages, how to sequence deliveries, and how to complete deliveries.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon also pointed in its defense to the independent contractor agreement it enters with Flex drivers, which it said “confirms the independent-contractor relationship between each Delivery Partner and Amazon and expressly disclaims the existence of any employment relationship.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In later proceedings, Virginia’s appeals court rejected that argument. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Contrary to Amazon’s contentions, the commission’s determination that ‘Amazon required Flex drivers to comply with specific instructions on when, where and how delivery blocks were to be completed’ is supported by the record,” the judges wrote. “That the text of the agreement purports to give Flex drivers control over the ‘means and manner’ for providing services does not negate the commission’s determination.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorney General Jason Miyares, whose office represented the VEC, told the Mercury he was &#8220;pleased with today’s decision from the Court of Appeals and I am proud of my office’s efforts to ensure that these workers are treated fairly and given the benefits they rightly deserve. &#8220;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A request for comment from Amazon’s lead attorney in the appeal did not receive a response.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is my opinion that the model policies comply with the Equal Protection Clause, Title IX, and the [Virginia Human Rights Act], and that … local school boards are required to adopt policies that are consistent with them,” Miyares wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 10-page document mainly focuses on the potential conflict between federal and state anti-discrimination laws and the policies’ guidelines regarding athletics, student identification and bathroom use. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a press release announcing the opinion, Miyares said the policies are about parents’ rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Parents, not government, are in the best position to work with their children on important life decisions, and no parent signs up to co-parent with the government,” the statement said. “The Model Policies ensure that all students are treated with dignity and that parental involvement remains at the center. These policies are fully compliant with the law, and school boards across the Commonwealth should support and implement them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The opinion notes the inaugural set of model policies produced in 2021 under former Gov. Ralph Northam was withdrawn because the Department of Education under the Youngkin administration concluded they “promoted a specific viewpoint aimed at achieving cultural and social transformation in schools.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The revised model policies were designed to correct the failure of the prior policies to recognize that … ultimately, ‘the education of the youth of this [Commonwealth] is the responsibility of the parents of the students,’” Miyares wrote. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Education’s 2023 “Model Policies on Ensuring Privacy, Dignity, and Respect for All Students and Parents in Virginia’s Public Schools” were first drafted in 2022 and add steps students and parents must take when seeking gender-affirming changes to the student’s identity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The policies prohibit students from using school facilities or participating in sports activities that don’t align with the sex on their official school record. Changes to that designation require students and their parents to submit school divisions legal documentation like a new birth certificate or passport. A parent must provide written permission in order for a student to go by a different name or pronouns at school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Because the manner in which a child is addressed by school officials is inextricably tied to the educational upbringing of that child, parents’ fundamental rights necessarily encompass the prerogative to decide how their child will be addressed while at school,” the opinion said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Students who wish to be referred to by certain pronouns without the approval of their parents are not a protected class under any relevant federal or state law,” the opinion continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That conclusion drew swift criticism from the ACLU of Virginia, which issued a statement from Legal Director Eden Heilman calling the policies “part of a coordinated, national effort to erase transgender and nonbinary students from the classroom.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At best, they invite discrimination; at worst, they require it,” Heilman said. “Attorney General Jason Miyares’ opinion defending the policies is every bit as cruel and misguided as the policies themselves.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares, however, argued in his opinion that discrimination on the basis of sex is different from discrimination on the basis of gender identity and that the Fourth Amendment, Title IX and the Virginia Human Rights Act allow for the separation of sexes in certain contexts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Both sides of the classification — biological males and biological females — include transgender students and treat them identically to all similarly situated students of the same sex,” the opinion said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The opinion also stated the model policies do not conflict with the 2020 Grimm v. Gloucester County School Board decision. In that case, the Richmond-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit upheld a previous ruling that the local school board had violated Title IX by preventing transgender student Gavin Grimm from using a boys’ bathroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grimm</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> does not impose a blanket rule forbidding sex-separate facilities in all situations,” the opinion said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, Miyares wrote, the model policies “expressly address situations where federal law or a binding decision interpreting federal law may require a departure from the model policy’s default rule.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The model policy addressing bathrooms requires students to use ‘bathrooms that correspond to [their] sex, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">except to the extent federal law requires otherwise</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,’ and expressly cites </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grimm</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as an example of a federal law that may require otherwise,” the opinion continues. “A model policy that instructs school divisions to follow federal law, including </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grimm</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, cannot possibly conflict with federal law and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grimm</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because there is not a conflict with state or federal law, the opinion concluded, then school boards are required to adopt the model policies under Virginia code. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the opinion does not comment on what enforcement tools the state has to take action against school boards who do not comply. Several school divisions, including Fairfax, Arlington and Richmond, have </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/08/22/as-virginia-school-districts-split-on-updated-transgender-policies-state-enforcement-tools-appear-limited/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">openly stated they do not plan to adopt the model policies. </span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a press conference Wednesday, Gov. Youngkin responded to a question about steps the state could take besides telling school boards to follow the law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I just ask you to stand by,” Youngkin said. “Just like they initially pushed back when we issued an executive order empowering parents to make decisions for their children, while they are pushing back now, eventually we got to the right place. And I expect us fully to get to the right place.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ACLU of Virginia Thursday said that “like all attorney general opinions, today’s is only advisory, not binding.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia courts are not required to follow it,” the group said. “School boards continue to have an obligation to create safe, inclusive school environments for all students in compliance with state and federal law.”</span></p>

(Peter Dazeley/Getty Images)</p><p>A federal judge in Virginia will likely stay – or pause – a case regarding medical providers and mifepristone, a drug commonly used as part of chemical abortions, because of similar challenges in Texas and Washington.</p>
<p>Groups from Virginia, Montana and Kansas had filed the suit in the Charlottesville division of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia and asked Judge Robert S. Ballou to order the Food and Drug Administration to drop requirements of reporting adverse effects of the drug as well as limiting which providers can prescribe it. The plaintiffs, a group of women’s health providers and clinics, had said an April ruling by a federal judge in Texas would have curtailed their ability to prescribe the drug via telehealth.</p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Abortion providers sue FDA over abortion pill restrictions in Virginia, Montana, Kansas&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/05/08/abortion-providers-sue-fda-over-abortion-pill-restrictions-in-virginia-montana-kansas/embed/#?secret=535aNV6nWQ#?secret=yZyMnGB8yJ" data-secret="yZyMnGB8yJ" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>However, Ballou pointed out that the Texas case, as well as a different one in Washington state, focus on the FDA, mifepristone and what prescription guidelines should be in place. Those issues are winding their way through other federal courts and will likely land at the U.S. Supreme Court. Ballou said for those reasons, and because most of the legal actions surrounding medical providers’ ability to prescribe mifepristone have been temporarily paused because of the ongoing court action, it was in the best interest to wait or pause the Virginia case until the matter was decided, possibly by the nation’s highest court.</p>
<p>Originally, medical providers pointed to the remarkable track record of safety for the drug, noting that its risk of death was much smaller than some over-the-counter medications, including ibuprofen. However, the organizations bristled at more restrictions being implemented by the FDA without corresponding scientific data. They said that the additional measures were burdensome and limited healthcare for women who were considering an abortion.</p>
<p>“Plaintiffs have offered no evidence that FDA intends to take action to change any of mifepristone’s (tracking and prescribing requirements) or to restrict the access of the drug in Virginia, Kansas or Montana,” Ballou said in a memorandum opinion. “Indeed the FDA has been enjoined from changing (them) at this time in 17 states and the District of Columbia by the Washington court. “</p>
<p>Ballou did point out, though, that the issue may again become ready to litigate in court after a decision by the Supreme Court or an appeals court.</p>
<p>“I agree that the outcome of the (Texas) case could have an impact on plaintiffs, but it is neither necessary nor appropriate to issue a preliminary injunction in anticipation or because of a ruling from another court,” Ballou said.</p>
<p>He ordered all parties to set up a conference to make sure the record in the court case is complete before issuing any final order.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON —  A federal appeals court ruled Wednesday the abortion pill can stay on the market, but it agreed with a lower court that ultimately use should revert to prescribing and dosage instructions that were in place before 2016.</p>
<p>That appeals court <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca5.213145/gov.uscourts.ca5.213145.506860229.1.pdf" target="_blank">ruling</a> will immediately be put on hold until the U.S. Supreme Court decides whether to take the case, under <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-preserves-access-abortion-pill-lawsuit-continues" target="_blank">a decision the high court released</a> in April. The ruling from the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals is expected to quickly be appealed to the high court.</p>
<p>The ruling means mifepristone remains legal and on the market in states that haven’t banned it, and, due to the Supreme Court’s earlier order, can be used under modifications approved by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
<p>Mifepristone was originally approved in 2000 and is the first of two drugs used in medication abortion. It is approved for use up to 10 weeks gestation and is also frequently used to treat miscarriage.</p>
<p>The Kaiser Family Foundation <a href="https://www.kff.org/report-section/a-national-survey-of-obgyns-experiences-after-dobbs-report/" target="_blank">released a survey</a> in June showing that 62% of the nearly 600 OB-GYNs surveyed said they use mifepristone with a second drug called misoprostol to treat a miscarriage.</p>
<p>“Miscarriages are very common and an important aspect of many OBGYNs’ scope of practice, and sometimes involve the same procedures and medications that are used for abortions,” KFF wrote. “In early pregnancy, medical management for miscarriage with misoprostol and mifepristone allows a shorter time course than waiting for nonviable pregnancy tissue to pass on its own (expectant management) in patients without complications.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Many questions in oral arguments</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The three-judge panel from the New Orleans-based appeals court that issued the ruling Wednesday <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/three-judge-panel-us-appeals-court-hears-arguments-abortion-pill-case" target="_blank">heard oral arguments</a> in the case in May after the federal government appealed a district judge’s ruling.</p>
<p>The judges had dozens of questions for the federal government’s attorney, the lawyer representing a manufacturer and the attorney for Alliance Defending Freedom, the anti-abortion legal organization that originally filed the case.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s ruling comes from that same panel, made up of Jennifer Walker Elrod, who was nominated by former President George W. Bush, as well as James C. Ho and Cory T. Wilson, who were both nominated by former President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>The appeals court on Wednesday disagreed with the district court judge’s ruling that the 2000 approval of mifepristone should be overturned and that the generic version of the pharmaceutical should no longer be available.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="9Zyw4uEdhQ"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/04/19/56-of-virginia-abortions-were-performed-via-medication-in-2021/">56% of Virginia abortions were performed via medication in 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;56% of Virginia abortions were performed via medication in 2021&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/04/19/56-of-virginia-abortions-were-performed-via-medication-in-2021/embed/#?secret=InY3vJt5jz#?secret=9Zyw4uEdhQ" data-secret="9Zyw4uEdhQ" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>The appeals judges agreed with the lower court’s opinion that several changes the FDA made in 2016 and 2021 regarding dosing and use of the prescription should no longer be in effect.</p>
<p>“In loosening mifepristone’s safety restrictions, FDA failed to address several important concerns about whether the drug would be safe for the women who use it,” the appeals court’s ruling states.</p>
<p>“It failed to consider the cumulative effect of removing several important safeguards at the same time. It failed to consider whether those ‘major’ and ‘interrelated’ changes might alter the risk profile, such that the agency should continue to mandate reporting of non-fatal adverse events,” the appeals judges wrote. “And it failed to gather evidence that affirmatively showed that mifepristone could be used safely without being prescribed and dispensed in person.”</p>
<p>The appeals court acknowledged in its ruling that several medical organizations filed briefs expressing concern that eliminating access to mifepristone for miscarriage management “even temporarily, may pose health risks to certain women.”</p>
<p>“These concerns are not insignificant,” the appeals court wrote. “But they apply primarily (if not wholly) to the challenge to the 2000 Approval — a claim that we have concluded is not likely to succeed.”</p>
<p>Arguments about reducing access to mifepristone by reverting to the more limited use instructions in place before 2016 “are lessened by the fact that mifepristone would remain available … as would options for surgical abortion,” the appeals court wrote.</p>
<p>Ho wrote his own opinion, saying that unlike his colleagues on the appeals court, he believed the anti-abortion organizations that filed the lawsuit likely would succeed with their challenge to the 2000 approval of mifepristone.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the U.S. Justice Department said in a statement it “strongly disagrees with the Fifth Circuit’s decision in Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v. FDA and will be seeking Supreme Court review of that decision.”</p>
<p>“As the Attorney General has said before, the Justice Department is committed to defending the FDA’s scientific judgment and protecting Americans’ access to safe and effective reproductive care,” the spokesperson said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Limits prior to 2016</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Reverting to the pre-2016 instructions would lower when the medication can be prescribed from 10 weeks gestation to seven weeks and change dosage and timing.</p>
<p>It would mean only doctors, not qualified health care providers, could prescribe mifepristone. Patients would need to attend three in-person doctor’s office visits, eliminating the ability for the medication to be prescribed via telehealth and shipped through the mail.</p>
<p>The generic version of mifepristone could be at risk of no longer being approved, though the appeals court rejected that option in its Wednesday ruling.</p>
<p>The manufacturer of the brand name version, Mifeprex, would need to relabel the product to comply with the court’s ruling, if the Supreme Court ultimately agrees with the appeals court’s ruling. Lawyers for the company that manufactures the brand-name version have said this could take months.</p>
<p>The case began in mid-November when Alliance Defending Freedom filed the lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas.</p>
<p>ADF, on behalf of four anti-abortion medical organizations and four anti-abortion physicians, argued the U.S. Food and Drug Administration incorrectly approved mifepristone to terminate pregnancies in 2000.</p>
<p>The lawsuit asked the district court to overturn that approval, but in the event the judge didn’t agree to do that, ADF requested the court revert prescribing and use of the medication to instructions that were in place before 2016.</p>
<p>Judge Matthew Joseph Kacsmaryk ruled to end access to mifepristone in April when <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-administration-appeals-judges-ruling-ordering-abortion-pill-us-market" target="_blank">he issued a stay</a> of the FDA’s original 2000 approval.</p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court placed that ruling on hold while the case works through the appeals process. That decision, which has kept mifepristone legal, would lift after the nine justices issue a ruling, or refuse to hear the case.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Reactions to ruling</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>​​Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a written statement the “appeals court decision sets up a showdown at the Supreme Court over baseless attacks on medication abortion, which has been a lifeline since the high court reversed Roe last year.”</p>
<p>“This order, if allowed to take effect, could jeopardize the FDA’s entire scientific system of drug approvals and would leave patients panicked and confused about their health and safety,” Northup said.</p>
<p>Christopher M. Zahn, interim CEO of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said in a statement the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals decision “is another example of judicial activism that reflects ideology, not science.”</p>
<p>“Mifepristone is demonstrably safe and effective for its FDA-approved use up to 10 weeks of gestation, it is demonstrably safe and effective when used as directed by telemedicine, and it is demonstrably safe and effective when prescribed by qualified advanced practice clinicians,” Zahn said. “The FDA made these changes to mifepristone’s regulation for medication abortion and miscarriage management based on robust scientific data and with the support of the medical community, including ACOG.”</p>
<p>The medical organization, Zahn said, looks “forward to sharing with the Supreme Court the overwhelming evidence and consensus of the medical community in support of mifepristone for medication abortion and miscarriage management.”</p>
<p>​​Alliance Defending Freedom Senior Counsel Erin Hawley said in a written statement that the 5th Circuit’s ruling was a “significant victory for the doctors and medical associations we represent and, more importantly, the health and safety of women.”</p>
<p>“The 5th Circuit rightly required the FDA to do its job and restore crucial safeguards for women and girls, including ending illegal mail-order abortions,” Hawley added. “The FDA will finally be made to account for the damage it has caused to the health of countless women and girls and the rule of law by unlawfully removing every meaningful safeguard from the chemical abortion drug regimen.”</p>

(Richard Vogelsong for the Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Court of Appeals ruled Tuesday that wine shippers who buy wine from different wineries that then box and ship orders on to Virginia customers must get a state license for every location involved in the chain. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.vacourts.gov/opinions/opncavwp/0973222.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The decision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> overturns an earlier ruling by Richmond Circuit Court that found California-based company VinoShipper only needed a state license for its home office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VinoShipper engages in what’s known as drop-shipping — a practice where a company doesn’t keep inventory in its own warehouse but instead contracts with third parties to fulfill orders. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In VinoShipper’s case, when customers buy wine through the company’s website, it verifies they are 21 or older and that their order doesn’t violate any state laws governing how much wine can be shipped to them. (Virginia law only authorizes wine shippers to send a Virginian up to two cases of wine per month.) It then buys the selected wine from the winery, sends it a shipping label and a state-required notice that someone 21 or older must receive the delivery and directs UPS to pick up the shipment from the winery and deliver it to the customer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following “inquiries from other licensees” about VinoShipper’s business model, ABC has argued that because state law requires shippers to obtain a separate license for “each separate place” where business occurs, VinoShipper must get licenses for every place that selects, boxes and transfers packages to UPS on its behalf. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VinoShipper, however, contended shipping is a “process” rather than a single act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company “insists that the only legally significant step in that process is when VinoShipper tells UPS to pick up the shipment from the winery for delivery to the customer in Virginia,” the appeals court Judge Stuart A. Raphael wrote. “And because VinoShipper directs that activity (and all other activities) from its office in Windsor, California, it says that the ‘shipping’ takes place there and there alone.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court rejected that argument Tuesday, ruling the company was violating state law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Shipping,” Raphael wrote, includes “(1) receiving the customer’s order; (2) purchasing the wine from the wineries; (3) selecting and packing the wine in boxes for shipment; (4) affixing the shipping and over-21 labels; and (5) tendering the package to UPS for delivery to the customer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That VinoShipper delegates the third, fourth, and fifth steps to the wineries does not mean that VinoShipper does not perform those essential selling and shipping functions; it just does them through entities without their own Virginia license, using those entities’ employees,” he continued. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Raphael noted VinoShipper “may have developed an innovative and efficient wine-shipping model that is ideal for a ‘just-in-time digital economy,’” he concluded “that model does not currently comply with Virginia law.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The General Assembly has amended the ABC Act to account for technological innovations,” he said. “Whether the ABC Act should be amended again to accommodate VinoShipper’s business model is the General Assembly’s choice, not ours.”</span></p>

(Scott P. Yates for the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed two long-standing legal challenges against the Mountain Valley Pipeline Friday, citing its lack of authority to hear the cases following the passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act earlier this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dismissals mean the project, which was </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/07/27/u-s-supreme-court-lifts-stays-on-mountain-valley-pipeline/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">temporarily halted by the latest legal challenges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, can continue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Here, Congress has removed our jurisdiction to hear the merits of the present petitions,” the three-judge panel wrote in its </span><a href="https://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinions/231384.P.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dismissal order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Therefore, the motions to dismiss must be granted.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mountain Valley Pipeline, a 303-mile project intended to deliver natural gas from the Utica and Marcellus shale fields into Southwest Virginia, has been mired for years in legal challenges over the harms environmental groups say it poses to wildlife and water quality. As a result of those arguments, the 4th Circuit repeatedly overturned federal permits granted to the project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This June, however, Congress passed the Fiscal Responsibility Act with a provision granting all necessary approvals for completion of the project and stripping jurisdiction from the 4th Circuit. The law also transferred jurisdiction over any challenges to the constitutionality of the provision, known as Section 324, to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, the judges agreed Section 324 had stripped their jurisdiction over two pipeline cases the court had been hearing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is well settled that Congress has the power to ratify agency action,” wrote Judge James Wynn. Furthermore, he wrote, because the Fiscal Responsibility Act transferred constitutional challenges to the D.C. Circuit, the 4th Circuit no longer has authority to hear them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With Section 324, Congress removed our jurisdiction in a way that mandates dismissal of the underlying petitions, which challenge agency actions that grant necessary approvals for the completion of the Mountain Valley Pipeline,” Wynn said. “Indeed, ‘no court’ has jurisdiction to review these approvals … including the D.C. Circuit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In separate concurring opinions, Judges Roger L. Gregory and Stephanie D. Thacker issued pointed warnings about the potential impacts of Section 324 on the principle of separation of powers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There can be no mistake, however, that Section 324 is a blueprint for the construction of a natural gas pipeline by legislative fiat,” Gregory wrote. “If that provision is likewise constitutionally sanctioned, then Congress will have found the way to adjudicate by legislating for particular cases and for particular litigants, no different than the governmental excesses our Framers sought to avoid.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Can Congress, with particular pending litigation in mind, strip a particular court of jurisdiction to hear a certain type of cases when it disagrees politically with the view of the law that court has taken in the past?” Thacker similarly asked. “As it stands, we have no clear guidance from the Supreme Court on where the line between legislative and judicial power lies, especially when Congress acts for the purpose of influencing pending litigation or even going so far as to pick a winner in that pending litigation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mountain Valley Pipeline spokeswoman Natalie Cox said the company agreed with the court’s conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Congress and President Biden declared the timely completion of construction and operation of the Mountain Valley Pipeline as being in the national interest,” Cox said. “Mountain Valley is committed to finalizing work on this critical energy infrastructure project by the end of 2023 in compliance with all approved federal and state authorizations so it can enter service and help satisfy public demand for cleaner, affordable and reliable domestic energy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, environmental groups expressed dissatisfaction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jamie Williams, president of The Wilderness Society, said the group was “deeply saddened and concerned that Mountain Valley has been granted the ability to sidestep critical conservation protections and silence the voices of community members in harm’s way.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spencer Gall, an attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center, said he believes Congress violated the Constitution by guaranteeing a winner in pending court cases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Fourth Circuit did not bless this gambit today and simply held that the D.C. Circuit and the Supreme Court must be the ones to confront the constitutionality,” Gall said in a statement. “We are evaluating potential next steps.&#8221;</span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit over the contentious firing of former Nottoway County Registrar Angela Stewart and another election official who worked with her, ruling that city and county electoral boards function more as state bodies rather than local ones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stewart, who had served as Nottoway’s registrar for 28 years before being removed from her position in the fall of 2021, argued the move by the Nottoway Electoral Board violated her constitutional rights by being based on false allegations of malfeasance. She also claimed the board didn’t give her an adequate chance to defend her actions in office to try to keep her job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/08/17/special-prosecutor-trying-to-sort-out-elections-drama-in-nottoway-county/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nottoway case</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is largely a local dispute, the court ruling is an indicator that federal courts may not be a strong option for other ousted registrars looking to file legal challenges against the boards that oversee them. Those three-member boards are supposed to be nonpartisan, but decisions to fire registrars are often hotly disputed and frequently involve allegations of political motives. A similar federal lawsuit was filed last month by a </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/ousted-lynchburg-registrar-files-lawsuit-against-2-electoral-board-members/article_5146a328-1781-11ee-955a-cbd9cc89d6d8.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently dismissed registrar in Lynchburg</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a ruling issued last week, Richmond-based U.S. District Court Judge Henry Hudson dismissed the case on jurisdictional grounds, pointing to 11th Amendment immunity restricting the ability of private individuals to sue states in federal courts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Here, it is clear that local electoral boards are more like an arm of the state than they are like municipalities,” Hudson wrote in the July 28 opinion. “Local electoral boards derive all their power and responsibilities from Virginia statutory law. They are subject to the State Board’s supervision and authority, which includes the power to initiate removal proceedings against local electoral board members. Electoral board members are appointed by state circuit court judges. The party affiliation of board members depends upon the party affiliation of the governor, not the party in power locally.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though electoral board members are initially paid with local funds, Hudson noted, their compensation is set by the state and “reimbursed annually from the state treasury.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hudson dismissed all the claims Stewart brought under federal law on the basis of the immunity provision and said he had no jurisdiction over the remaining claims under state law, leaving nothing left to argue in the case. He reached the same conclusion in an accompanying case brought by Sharon Caldwell, a former assistant registrar and officer of election in Nottoway who was removed around the same time as Stewart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among several other complaints, Stewart alleged she was unfairly retaliated against after publicly telling electoral board members “that they did not understand their roles and were not carrying out their duties,” according to court records.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorneys representing the various Nottoway officials Stewart had sued denied her claims and argued the board had clear legal authority to remove her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Notably, the Code of Virginia provides members of the local electoral board with broad discretion to remove a general registrar from office for failing to discharge his or her duties according to law,” the legal team for the defendants wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lawyer for Stewart and Caldwell said the two former election officials plan to keep pursuing their case through the state courts. The two have been “silent” for almost two years, said attorney Melvin Williams, “because it is their goal to seek redress through the courts, and not in the media.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These matters are far from concluded, and both ladies look forward to the truth coming out in the proper venue, i.e., a courtroom,” Williams said in an emailed statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Williams called Stewart and Caldwell “good and valuable servants of Nottoway County and its citizenry” and noted that Stewart was partially cleared by the conclusion of a Virginia State Police investigation into the Nottoway election feud that resulted in “no finding of criminal culpability” on Stewart’s part.</span></p>

Police currently provide the vast majority of transports to psychiatric hospitals across Virginia. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Court of Appeals overruled a man’s misdemeanor conviction for fleeing from police after ruling the Lynchburg police officer who attempted to make the arrest didn’t get close enough to the suspect to have a realistic chance of grabbing him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://www.vacourts.gov/opinions/opncavwp/1218223.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an opinion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> revealing what the court described as a legal quirk unique to Virginia, the court found that an officer telling someone to stop from 20 yards away doesn’t satisfy a rule requiring officers to have the “immediate physical ability to place the person under arrest.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The opinion applies mainly to foot chases, not a separate eluding law that criminalizes fleeing police in a motor vehicle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ruling arose from a 2022 case in which Lynchburg police officer M.D. Iazzi attempted to arrest Jessi Ryan Hackett during a snowstorm. After arriving at a home in uniform to try to make the arrest, Iazzi found Hackett standing outside. When Hackett spotted the officer, court records say, he “took off running” into the woods. The officer then told Hackett to stop and said he was under arrest, to which Hackett, still running, replied: “I didn’t do anything wrong.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same officer found Hackett nearby about an hour later and, from about 50 yards away, again told him to stop. Hackett ran off a second time but was later arrested and charged with fleeing from law enforcement. He was subsequently convicted of the charge and sentenced to 90 days behind bars, with 60 days suspended.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the opinion overruling the conviction, Judge Stuart A. Raphael wrote that a distance of 20 yards was simply too great to meet the criteria for fleeing the General Assembly specified when writing the law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There was too much time and space separating them to conclude that Iazzi had the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">immediate </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">physical ability to arrest Hackett,” Raphael wrote. “Put another way, Hackett was not within Iazzi’s ‘immediate span of control’ when he fled.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The appellate court noted that the immediate proximity rule appeared to originate from the General Assembly’s attempts to broaden earlier versions of the law to allow authorities to charge someone with the offense of fleeing law enforcement even if they weren’t physically in the “custody” of police.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court’s opinion noted that many other states don’t criminalize fleeing from an impending arrest and those that do “typically focus on the defendant’s act of fleeing.” Virginia, the court said, “appears to be the only state in the country” that requires close physical proximity to an officer as an element of the crime.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Under the Fourth Amendment, probable cause of contraband is the standard to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">obtain </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">a warrant, not the standard to search a person without one,” wrote Judge Lisa M. Lorish in </span><a href="https://www.vacourts.gov/opinions/opncavwp/0744224.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an opinion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> issued Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, she continued, “The number of exceptions to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement make this an exceedingly difficult analysis, and we sympathize with the trial judge here.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The July 5 ruling reverses a Culpeper County Circuit Court decision that the drugs found in the search could be included in the trial of Renee Parady, one of three people stopped by Culpeper Sheriff’s Deputy Dustin Tharp in the early hours of Jan. 28, 2021. Parady had asked the court to block the use of the drugs as evidence on the grounds that they had been obtained through an unconstitutional warrantless search.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parady ultimately pleaded guilty to felony possession of a controlled substance but reserved the right to appeal the court’s denial of her request to suppress the drugs as evidence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia argued in support of including the drugs as evidence, saying Tharp had probable cause to believe Parady was concealing narcotics, the search was done as part of an arrest and the search was justified by “exigent circumstances” — in this case, the fear that Parady would destroy the drugs if Tharp had to wait to get the warrant. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Culpeper Circuit Court previously rejected the third argument, finding that because Parady was placed in the back of a police vehicle and three officers were at the scene, Tharp could have gotten a search warrant without risking the destruction of the drugs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Court of Appeals on Wednesday rejected the other two arguments. Tharp had not actually arrested Parady the night of the search, the judges noted, and she would not be arrested until nearly two months later. The court concluded her search could not be justified on that basis, quoting the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in United States v. Robinson that “it is the fact of the lawful arrest which establishes the authority to search.” (While Virginia argued the officer had not arrested Parady at the scene because she said she had tested positive for COVID-19, the court of appeals pointed out Tharp arrested the driver on a separate charge, even though he said he had been quarantining in a house of sick people, including Parady.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, the court ruled that the officer having probable cause to arrest Parady was not sufficient grounds to search her without a warrant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Commonwealth bears the burden of proving that a warrantless search fits under an exception to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment,” the court wrote. “While the exceptions are many, mere probable cause is not one of them.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The case will now return to Culpeper Circuit Court.</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce for the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin Thursday praised the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark decision striking down affirmative action at higher education institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Today, after the Supreme Court’s ruling, we are closer than ever before to ensuring that an individual’s future opportunities are unlocked based on the trajectory of their potential, their aspirations and the quality of their capabilities as opposed to simply on their race,” Youngkin said on Twitter shortly after the country’s highest court struck down race-conscious admissions in a case involving Harvard University and the University of North Carolina.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, who in 2021 became the first Black woman to hold statewide office in Virginia, also applauded the outcome, saying it will “ensure college admissions are based on a student&#8217;s merits, not the color of their skin.” Earle-Sears noted she had joined a legal brief supporting the plaintiffs who challenged affirmative action policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorney General Jason Miyares, who did not comment on the ruling, also signed onto </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20-1199/222849/20220509155246082_OkSFA%20Merits%20Amicus%20MAIN%20May%209%202022%20E%20File.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a brief supporting the plaintiffs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Democrats had sharply different reactions to the </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/20-1199_hgdj.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">6-3 decision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ruling that consideration of race violates the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, said the decision “undermines an important effort to address racial inequality caused by our nation’s history with racism,” adding, “The impact of 246 years of slavery and 100 years of Jim Crow on our communities and institutions did not go away with a magic wand.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., who began his career as a lawyer fighting housing discrimination in Richmond, said the “strength of Virginia’s—and America’s—higher education system lies in its diversity.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Today’s sad ruling means we have even more work to do to address our nation’s ugly history of racism and root out the system inequities that unfairly burden diverse communities, like Black and Latino Americans,” Kaine said. “Not only are those system inequities plain wrong; they hurt all of us and hold our economy back.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What the court ruled</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The majority opinion penned by Chief Justice John Roberts found Harvard and UNC “fail to operate their race-based admissions programs in a manner that is ‘sufficiently measurable to permit judicial [review],’” haven’t sufficiently proved a connection between those programs and goals like increasing diversity and training future leaders and haven’t identified an endpoint by which the programs would no longer be considered necessary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, the court ruled that the universities’ programs “fail to comply with Equal Protection Clause’s twin commands that race may never be used as a ‘negative’ and that it may not operate as a stereotype,” pointing to a lower court finding that Harvard’s process resulted in fewer admissions of Asian American students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “assertion that race is never a negative factor in their admissions programs cannot withstand scrutiny,” the majority wrote. “College admissions are zero-sum, and a benefit provided to some applicants but not to others necessarily advantages the former at the expense of the latter.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor argued that the ruling will result in “further entrenching racial inequality in education” and will end progress toward more inclusive schools begun in Brown v. Board of Education. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For 45 years, the Court extended Brown’s transformative legacy to the context of higher education, allowing colleges and universities to consider race in a limited way and for the limited purpose of promoting the important benefits of racial diversity,” she wrote. “This limited use of race has helped equalize educational opportunities for all students of every race and background and has improved racial diversity on college campuses.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thursday’s ruling, she concluded, “cements a superficial rule of colorblindness as a constitutional principle in an endemically segregated society where race has always mattered and continues to matter.” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Impact on Virginia schools</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia universities reacted cautiously Thursday to the ruling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Erin Jay, a spokesperson for William &amp; Mary, said “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the university will take time thoughtfully to review (the ruling) and understand if there are implications to William &amp; Mary’s comprehensive review process for admissions.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The university reported that 32% of its students “identify as people of color” and </span><a href="https://www.wm.edu/offices/compliance/discrimination_overview/affirmative_action/index.php" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on its website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has said it is “committed to affirmative action, equal opportunity/equity, and diversity.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, Virginia Commonwealth University President Michael Rao said the school “has been preparing for some time by evaluating admissions procedures and considering the impact of this ruling.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While he acknowledged that “we won’t know all of those answers right away,” he said that “many of VCU’s admissions procedures are unlikely to be affected.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rao noted that a third of VCU’s incoming freshman class are first-generation students, while a third of undergraduate students are eligible for Pell grants.</span></p>
<p>George Mason University said flatly the decision will have no impact on the school, because it doesn&#8217;t consider race in its admissions process and admits more than 90% of undergraduate applicants. In August, GMU said, the school will &#8220;once again welcome the largest and most diverse student body in the history of the Commonwealth of Virginia.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This diversity of origin, identity, circumstance, and thought is what drives our quality and defines our character,&#8221; <a href="https://www.gmu.edu/news/2023-06/george-mason-university-statement-supreme-court-rulings-regarding-college-admissions" target="_blank">GMU said</a>. &#8220;When walking across one of our campuses, the rich diversity everyone sees is not artificially curated by an admissions process primarily defined by keeping students out.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Tech said its administration is reviewing the ruling but will continue to live up to its motto “Ut Prosim (That I May Serve)” and its goal of providing a “practical education to all members of the commonwealth, nation, and beyond.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To accomplish this mission, we will continue to work hard to expand access to underserved and underrepresented populations,” Virginia Tech said in a statement from its communications office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Eric Claville, a political and legal analyst and professor of politics and law at Norfolk State University, characterized the Supreme Court&#8217;s Thursday ruling as both expected and regressive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Higher education leaders have known for a long time that this challenge [to affirmative action] would come,” he said. “We need these policies to advance diversity and equity on campuses, and the law is the incentive to make and enforce those changes. Without that, we will not have the same protections for promoting diverse, inclusive, equitable student bodies in Virginia and elsewhere.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claville said the high court&#8217;s decision “will have far-reaching implications beyond limiting race-based admissions in colleges.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe that here in Virginia, we will see ripple effects – perhaps in the way we hire for jobs, in the ways we support our communities, in the work across many sectors – that could basically roll back advancement opportunities for non-white people,&#8221; he said.</span></p>

On Friday the court issued a landmark decision overturning the right to an abortion.

<p>Republican legislators claimed the Elections Clause in the U.S. Constitution makes legislatures the sole state authorities on federal elections law,  including congressional redistricting. Critics said the high court’s endorsement of the independent state legislature theory would cause chaos with state elections, with states trying to enforce a set of rules for state elections and another set for federal elections.</p>
<p>In a 6-3 opinion, the nation’s high court rejected Republicans’ argument, known as the independent state legislature theory.</p>
<p>Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote a concurring opinion. Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch and Samuel Alito dissented. Thomas wrote that the case was moot because the North Carolina Supreme Court has already decided the question that brought Republican legislators to court in their favor.</p>
<p>“We are asked to decide whether the Elections Clause carves out an exception to this basic principle,” said the majority opinion by Chief Justice John Roberts.  “We hold that it does not. The Elections Clause does not insulate state legislatures from the ordinary exercise of state judicial review.”</p>
<p>The case drew national attention because of its potential to disrupt laws for federal elections across the country.</p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Virginia, a former state senator, said in a statement that the decision &#8220;protects the integrity of our electoral process and preserves a proper system of checks-and-balances on states&#8217; roles in regulating federal elections.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The right-wing ISL theory is a dangerous fringe perspective that would upend American elections. &#8230; Today, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of democracy and rejected this extreme constitutional perspective,&#8221; she wrote.</p>
<p>The leader of Common Cause North Carolina, which was a party in the case, said in a statement that the opinion is a victory for American democracy.</p>
<p>“Today, the U.S. Supreme Court made clear that state courts and state constitutions should serve as a critical check against abuses of power by legislators,&#8221; Bob Phillips, Common Cause North Carolina executive director, said.  “Now, we must ensure our state courts fulfill their duty to protect our freedoms against attacks by extremist politicians.”</p>
<p>The opinion affirms the February 2022 decision by the Democratic majority on the North Carolina Supreme Court that congressional districts the Republican majority created were extreme party gerrymanders that required revision.</p>
<p>Roberts wrote that courts “may not transgress the ordinary bounds of judicial review such that they arrogate to themselves the power vested in state legislatures to regulate federal elections.”</p>
<p>“We decline to address whether the North Carolina Supreme Court strayed beyond the limits derived from the Elections Clause. The legislative defendants did not meaningfully present the issue in their petition for certiorari or in their briefing, nor did they press the matter at oral argument.”</p>
<p>When pressed during December’s oral arguments whether the state’s Democratic justices has misinterpreted the state constitution, the Republicans’ lawyer “reiterated that such an argument was ‘not our position in this Court.’”</p>
<p>https://stateline.org/2022/03/18/contentious-fringe-legal-theory-could-reshape-state-election-laws/</p>
<p>Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder applauded the decision, but said in a statement that the question should not have made it to the high court in the first place. Holder is chairman of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee. Voters who challenged the congressional districts as partisan gerrymanders were supported by the National Redistricting Foundation.</p>
<p>“By rejecting the independent state legislature theory, the Supreme Court preserved the vital role state courts play in protecting free elections and fair maps for the American people,” Holder said in a statement. “This is a victory for our system of checks and balances, the cornerstone of American democracy.</p>
<p>“Make no mistake, this appeal and the truly fringe, truly ideological theory it espouses should never have been brought before our nation’s highest tribunal in the first place, and it demonstrates the lengths to which too many in the Republican Party are willing to go in order to bend — even break — our democracy in order to hold onto illegitimate power.”</p>
<p>Democrats from U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to Democratic leaders in the North Carolina legislature weighed in with statements supporting the decision.</p>
<p>Lawyers on both sides of the case tried to use the historical record dating back to the founding of the country to bolster their arguments.</p>
<p>Roberts’ opinion said that history supports judicial review.</p>
<p>“State cases, debates at the Convention, and writings defending the Constitution all advanced the concept of judicial review. And in the years immediately following ratification, courts grew assured of their power to void laws incompatible with constitutional provisions,” he wrote.</p>
<p>During oral arguments last year,  Thomas, Alito and Gorsuch indicated they supported the Republican legislators’ argument, while Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan challenged their logic and interpretation of history.</p>
<p>The state Supreme Court’s new Republican majority is unlikely to intervene in congressional redistricting this year.</p>
<p>Before the U.S. Supreme Court could rule, Republican legislators petitioned for and received a chance to reargue a redistricting decision the state Supreme Court issued in December that said the Senate districts used for the 2022 elections were unconstitutional.</p>
<p>The court majority in April overturned partisan gerrymandering opinions handed down last year by a Democratic court majority. The Republican-majority opinion said redistricting is the legislature’s job and the courts cannot not judge partisanship.</p>
<p>The NC League 0f Conservation Voters, one of the parties fighting partisan redistricting, said the U.S. Supreme Court did the right thing, but the state Supreme Court didn’t when the majority overturned last year’s decision on partisan gerrymandering.</p>
<p>“Today, in a case that NCLCV has been fighting since 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the independent state legislature theory and affirmed that, in a constitutional democracy, the courts do have a role in redistricting and protecting free and fair elections,” Dan Crawford, the organization’s lobbyist, said in a statement.</p>
<p>“This draws into sharp contrast the blatantly partisan decision by the North Carolina Supreme Court to concede total power to the legislature to select their own voters. Without the ability for every voter to choose their representatives, our environment and all North Carolinians will be at risk to deep-pocketed polluters and power-hungry politicians,” the statement said.</p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court twice asked case participants this year if the state Supreme Court rehearing the gerrymandering case and later, siding with Republican legislators made the federal case moot.</p>
<p>The lawyer representing Republican legislators said the Supreme Court should decide the federal case even though North Carolina’s highest court had given them a victory.</p>
<p>Republicans found agreement from Common Cause, which sued over the redistricting plans and opposed Republicans’ position on the independent state legislature theory. Common Cause wants the U.S. Supreme Court to decide the question because it will keep coming up, its May letter said.</p>
<p>Most of the parties who opposed state Republicans’ position, including the U.S. solicitor general, told the court the case was moot.</p>
<p>Attorneys for a group of voters who sued over the Republican redistricting plans said in a recent letter to the Court that since the state Supreme Court had ruled in Republicans’ favor, Republicans no longer had standing and there is nothing more that they could win. Likewise, a lawyer for the NC League of Conservation Voters wrote the case is moot.</p>

(Ariana Figueroa / D.C. Bureau, States Newsroom)</p><p><em><b>By Faith Alejandro &amp; Cullen Seltzer</b></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the coming days, the Supreme Court of the United States is poised to decide the fate of affirmative action in higher education. Employers in Virginia, however, should pay attention to the </span><a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2022/20-1199" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harvard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2022/21-707#:~:text=Facts%20of%20the%20case,as%20a%20factor%20in%20admissions." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">University of North C</span></a><a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2022/21-707#:~:text=Facts%20of%20the%20case,as%20a%20factor%20in%20admissions." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">arolina</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cases now pending, as the Students for Fair Admissions alleges that these universities unlawfully rejected white and Asian students on the basis of race. The ways that Virginia employers implement diversity, equity and inclusion programs could be drastically affected, if the high court agrees with the student group’s allegation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In both cases, the universities proved that they used holistic application processes that considered race as merely one factor in admissions decisions. That’s in line with 45-year old precedent allowing them to do so. The schools proved that they considered, but rejected, race-neutral alternatives that were shown to be ineffective in building a diverse student body. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beginning with the case of Regents of the University of California v. Bakke in 1978, and reaffirmed in Grutter v. Bollinger in 2003, higher education institutions have been able to legally justify affirmative action programs that consider race as a “plus” factor to increase diversity in their student bodies. The high court recognized then that diversity, in and of itself, was a “compelling state interest” because diversity makes a student body better equipped, productive, and successful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is no surprise, therefore, that the “business case” for diversity and the benefits it offers abounds as justification for voluntary affirmative action programs in the American workplace. Indeed, employers largely recognize the value of fostering diverse, equitable, and inclusive (“DEI”) workplaces, as research shows that DEI can improve client service with </span><a href="https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">smarter teams</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who </span><a href="https://hbr.org/2017/03/teams-solve-problems-faster-when-theyre-more-cognitively-diverse" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">solve problems faster</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and achieve </span><a href="https://blog.shrm.org/workforce/inclusive-workplaces-lead-to-engaged-employees" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">greater employee engagement and satisfaction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We anticipate, though, that the conservative majority of the Supreme Court will soon decide that the value of diversity is no longer enough to justify race-conscious affirmative action. During </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2022/20-1199_6537.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">oral arguments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, many of the justices questioned the efficacy of these policies. Several expressed concerns that these admissions policies may have harmed Asian-American students — notwithstanding the lower courts’ findings that these schools did not engage in such discrimination. (Notably, Harvard just accepted a </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/harvard-admits-record-number-asian-american-students-black-latino-admi-rcna77923" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">record number of Asian-American students this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If, in fact, the Supreme Court agrees in the coming days that diversity,as a goal, is no longer a compelling state interest, how should Virginia employers respond? Here are three potential replies:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We should change nothing about our DEI initiatives because the Harvard and UNC cases concern higher education, not employment.” </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While this may be true, it is not a giant logical leap that the rejection of diversity as a goal in higher education may result in a similar rejection in employment. After all, Title VI federal higher education law and Title VII federal employment law have developed in similar fashion over the years.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Affirmative Action is dead. Employers need to stop </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">all</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> DEI efforts immediately to avoid getting sued.”</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employers who react too quickly may view this as the prudent approach and miss the opportunity to fully unpack the Court’s ruling. For example, may DEI initiatives be permissible if they take into consideration applicants’ socio-economic disadvantages? May those policies be permissible even if employers hope to increase racial diversity but don’t explicitly consider race? Plus, abandoning all DEI efforts may result in policies and practices that disparately affect protected classes, which could expose employers to a discrimination claims. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We should evaluate the effectiveness of our DEI initiatives and make sure our historical and business justification for DEI is sound, documented and legally compliant.”</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This approach, we believe, would give Virginia employers the best chance of following through on their DEI objectives while taking the time to understand their risk in this evolving landscape. After all, unlike higher education law, employment law recognizes that employers </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">can</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> justify affirmative action plans if they can demonstrate a “manifest imbalance” in “traditionally segregated job categories.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employers in Virginia should take the time, now, to evaluate their corporate values and recommit to DEI initiatives that bring about authentic, meaningful change. Merely performative plans could otherwise be in future peril legally, or at best, ineffective.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minority-owned businesses, as well, should prepare given that their eligibility to participate in Virginia’s SWaM (Small, Woman and Minority Owned) business loan funds may be compromised. After all, those Virginia businesses’ access to SWaM loans hinges directly on proof of business ownership by women or ethnic or racial minorities. Virginia’s General Assembly may have to take steps to protect its public policy commitment to promote SWaM businesses if SCOTUS declares race-conscious policies to be unconstitutional.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to recognize that 45 years ago in the groundbreaking Bakke case,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the Supreme Court concluded that remedying the ills of past unlawful discrimination was not enough to justify affirmative action by entities if they were not, themselves, guilty of historic discrimination. That ruling gave rise to today’s alternative basis for affirmative action: the benefits of diversity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employers and others have relied on that precedent in thousands of contexts to develop policies intended to both comply with constitutional restrictions and redress long standing systemic biases. Nevertheless, the high court has recently shown itself willing to set aside precedent when it determines doing so is warranted by either changed circumstances or the court’s evolving understanding of the Constitution’s requirements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It remains to be seen whether modern employers – who recognize that the country’s past sins of discrimination enabled at least some of their own economic, social, and political advantages – may affirmatively act to remedy those sins.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Whether and how employers can try to remedy that legacy and promote equity is very much on the Supreme Court’s docket right now.</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Court of Appeals upheld a bribery conviction Tuesday for a Southside Virginia convenience store operator who offered the town of La Crosse a $500 monthly donation in exchange for officials’ support for gaming machines at his business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businessman Mamdoh Abouemara was appealing his 2021 guilty conviction in Mecklenburg County, arguing prosecutors hadn’t sufficiently proven he acted with corrupt intent, partly because he made the offer to the town openly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The appellate court rejected that argument in a </span><a href="https://www.vacourts.gov/opinions/opncavwp/0284222.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2-1 opinion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, ruling nothing in Virginia law requires quid pro quos to be offered “secretly or surreptitiously” in order to qualify as an illegal bribe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If that were true, the most unseemly, open and notorious bribes offered to public servants in plain view would be immunized from prosecution,” Judge Stuart A. Raphael wrote for the majority.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court opinion appears to center on so-called skill machines, the slots-like devices installed in convenience stores throughout Virginia despite </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/12/20/as-virginia-gears-up-for-gambling-debate-thousands-of-slot-like-games-have-already-slipped-in-the-back-door/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">questions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about their </span><a href="https://www.c-ville.com/city-ban-prosecutor-boots-queen-of-virginia-gaming-machines/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legality</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, the court opinion only refers to “gaming machines,” and local officials could not confirm Tuesday that the devices at issue were skill machines. The events in the bribery case occurred before the General Assembly voted to ban skill machines in 2021. That ban remains in limbo while the skill-game industry continues to </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/11/28/virginia-skill-game-lawsuit-pushed-back-again-over-disputed-budget-amendment/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fight the law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in court.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abouemara was sentenced to one year of probation, with a five-year term of incarceration fully suspended.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kevin Calhoun, one of Abouemera’s attorneys, said the legal battle would continue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are disappointed by the Court of Appeals’ ruling today, but we intend to appeal the case to the Supreme Court of Virginia and to vigorously fight for our client’s conviction to be overturned,” Calhoun said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The events that led to Abouemara’s legal trouble began when local law enforcement started investigating his store after noticing “many cars” in the parking lot late at night when the store was supposed to be closed, according to court records. In early October of 2019, Abouemara went to the La Crosse town manager’s office to discuss making donations to the town in exchange for a letter supporting the gaming machines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The town manager at the time, F.A. Hendrick, told Abouemara the town couldn’t take donations directly, but donations could be made to a nonprofit called “Friends of La Crosse” that focuses on civic improvement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hendrick said he would take Abouemara’s offer to the town council, and the matter was taken up at a Dec. 9 meeting. The council responded with a resounding no. According to the court opinion, a “garbled” recording of that meeting shows council members laughing after rejecting the proposal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abouemara also wrote the town a $200 check, which town officials did not accept. Hendrick had originally testified at trial that the check came after the December council meeting, but the check was dated Oct. 26 and Hendrick later acknowledged he might have received the check before the meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abouemara was charged with two felony counts of bribery, according to the appellate opinion, but the count related to the attempted $200 donation was dismissed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The appellate court rejected the defense’s claim that the attempted $200 donation after the town rejected his original proposal shows “the original offer was not a bribe.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For instance, his paying $200 once, rather than $500 every month, could well have signaled punishment for the council’s failure to accept the bribe,” Raphael wrote in the majority opinion. “Or the donation could have been a fallback effort to curry favor. Or an attempt to cover up the crime.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Dec. 15, 2019, according to court records, law enforcement executed a search warrant at Abouemara’s business and “seized several gaming machines.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appeals Court Judge Vernida R. Chaney disagreed with the opinion, writing in a dissent that the majority was taking an overly broad reading of the bribery law by treating the possibility of an informal letter as an official act by the public servants allegedly being improperly propositioned. Her dissent notes that both the donation offer and the request for a letter of support would have been legal on their own, and the mere fact they were linked together doesn’t prove the “requisite intent for bribery.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To construe the bribery statute as criminalizing any proposed quid pro quo would absurdly criminalize offers of monetary donations to benefit the community in return for a letter of thanks or a birthday greeting to the community’s oldest citizen,” Chaney wrote. “By construing the bribery statute to criminalize any proposal in which there is an exchange of benefits between the town and a private individual, the majority converts the lawful act of proposing a contract to the town council into a criminal act.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The majority, however, said the offer became a “completed crime once communicated to the town council.”</span></p>

Parker Michels-Boyce for The Virginia Mercury</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Supreme Court of Virginia turned down a request by Wegmans to reconsider a February decision that found neighbors had a right to challenge local approvals of the grocery giant’s plans to build a massive distribution center in Hanover County. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The denial, issued May 11, was terse and offered no explanation of the reasoning of the judges, whose earlier decision in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morgan v. Board of Supervisors of Hanover County</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was unanimously in favor of the neighbors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are gratified that once again the Court has unanimously declared that Wegmans is wrong,” Brian Buniva, the attorney for Roderick Morgan and four other Hanover residents, said in a text message. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What practical implications the ruling will have for the Hanover project are unclear. The distribution center is nearly complete and expected to begin operations this summer, even as the Supreme Court of Virginia decision sends the case back to a lower court for further review.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are no approvals from the County contingent upon resolution of this case at the Circuit Court,” said Hanover spokeswoman Kristin Smith Dunlop in an email. “As there are no court orders directing the County to withhold permits, inspections, or approvals — such as the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for this facility — the County will continue to process these requests as they would for any applicant or property owner.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wegmans did not respond to a request for comment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris French, a Hanover resident who has been involved with a separate lawsuit over the project, said Thursday’s decision “again affirmed citizens should have reasonable access to courts when challenging a zoning case.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Local governments throughout Virginia were overstepping when they sought to dismiss cases solely on legal standing when the required criteria was obviously met,” he said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wegmans distribution center in Hanover has been beset by legal challenges since the local Board of Supervisors approved it in May 2020. Expected to create 700 jobs, the project garnered tax credits and $2.35 million in state incentives under former Gov. Ralph Northam’s administration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, many neighbors, including the Brown Grove community founded by freedpeople after the Civil War, have staunchly opposed the development on the grounds that it will destroy wetlands and cause major traffic and noise and light pollution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Morgan case ended up at the state Supreme Court after Hanover Circuit Court found five residents whose property lay within 1,000 feet of the new facility had no standing to challenge the county’s approval of the project because they hadn’t demonstrated they would suffer “particularized harm” from it. The neighbors, who had argued the board violated multiple local ordinances and state laws in its approval, appealed that decision. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Supreme Court </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/02/supreme-court-of-va-rules-hanover-residents-can-sue-over-wegmans-warehouse/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ruled in favor of the property owners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this February and sent the case back to Hanover Circuit.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have no difficulty concluding that the allegations of particularized harm made by the homeowners are fairly traceable to the Board’s 2020 decision,” wrote Justice D. Arthur Kelsey. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/03/21/wegmans-business-groups-ask-virginia-supreme-court-to-overturn-hanover-ruling/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wegmans’ petition for the court to reconsider that ruling was supported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by 21 major real estate, housing, local government and business groups, who in an amicus brief had contended the court’s February ruling “will have disastrous consequences for all types of development in Virginia.”  </span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Court of Appeals is asking a lower court to consider whether state law setting a local residency requirement for people collecting and witnessing signatures in support of a referendum violates political speech rights under the First Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The case, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Williams v. Legere et al.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, concerns an attempt by Williamsburg resident Margaret Williams to put a referendum on the November 2022 ballot on the question of whether members of the joint Williamsburg-James City County School Board who represent Williamsburg should be directly elected. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The division is one of just 15 in Virginia where school boards are partially or fully appointed. While the five members of the seven-member Williamsburg-James City County board who represent the county are directly elected by residents, the two members who represent the city are appointed by city council. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/22.1-57.2/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">State law allows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> voters to petition a circuit court to hold a referendum on whether their local school board should be directly elected. Virginia code requires that the petition be signed by at least 10% of the locality’s registered voters 111 days before the general election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last June, Williams began collecting the 999 signatures needed for such a petition in Williamsburg. By the middle of July, she had submitted 1,587 signatures to the court, and City Registrar Tina Reitzel later determined 1,246 were qualified city voters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the registrar found only 64 of the signatures met statutory requirements for a referendum because the people who witnessed the remaining signatures — the people circulating the petition — were residents of either James City County or York County. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reitzel’s determination was based on a different </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title24.2/chapter6/section24.2-684.1/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">provision of state law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requiring that all signatures collected on a petition for a referendum “shall be witnessed by a person who is qualified to vote, or qualified to register to vote, in the referendum for which he is circulating the petition.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Williams then sued three members of the Williamsburg Electoral Board and the city registrar, arguing state law was severely limiting her First Amendment rights. The city of Williamsburg intervened, arguing that the requirement protected “the integrity of the referendum process … by requiring that those driving the change and circulating the petition are would-be voters of the referendum itself.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the joint Williamsburg-James City County Circuit Court ruled in favor of the city, Williams appealed the case to the Virginia Court of Appeals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On May 2, the higher court reversed that decision and asked the circuit court to analyze whether the residency requirement in state law “is necessary and narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling government interest.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.vacourts.gov/opinions/opncavwp/1225221.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">opinion by Judge Kimberley Slayton White</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> noted the U.S. Supreme Court has previously found “that the distribution of referendum petitions is a protected right to speech under the First Amendment and that any limitation on political expression is subject to ‘exacting scrutiny.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Williamsburg case, “the City wishes to enforce a requirement which would cut down the number of political message carriers, thus limiting the audience Williams may reach,” wrote White. “Such a requirement substantially restricts Williams’ ability to engage in ‘core political speech. Because this restriction on political speech is a clear deprivation of a right guaranteed in the First Amendment, courts must subject it to strict scrutiny.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">White also pointed to U.S. Supreme Court decisions striking down various requirements linked to the circulation of petitions, such as requirements that a person circulating a petition for a ballot initiative be a registered voter and wear an identification badge, as “impermissible restrictions on the fundamental free speech right of political expression as guaranteed by the First Amendment.” </span></p>
<p>Nicole Trifone, a spokesperson for the city of Williamsburg, said the city had no comment on the ruling.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stanlee Fazi, 41,</span> <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/virginia-man-pleads-guilty-trafficking-turtles" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pleaded guilty to trafficking turtles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a federal court in Alexandria after admitting he illegally collected the animals from the wild, bound them in socks and shipped them by FedEx to online buyers across the country on at least 27 occasions from 2017 to 2020. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The buyers, he said, would smuggle the turtles from the U.S. to Hong Kong and China as part of the illegal pet trade. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trafficking of the animals violated the federal Lacey Act, which prohibits the interstate transportation or sale of any wildlife captured or possessed illegally under state law and carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Virginia banned the catching of box turtles, as well as other common reptiles and amphibians, from the wild </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/07/01/ban-on-pet-box-turtles-takes-effect-in-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because of declining populations and mistreatment by pet owners. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service offices in Baltimore and Vero Beach, Florida, conducted the investigation as part of “Operation Middleman,” which focused on the trafficking of reptiles from the U.S. to China.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also referred to as eastern box turtles, the colorful reptiles reside in forested regions of the eastern U.S. and can grow up to 6 inches long and live more than 100 years. The box turtle’s namesake comes from the “box”-like appearance the animal assumes when it retreats into its yellow and orange-splotched shell. Those with more colorful markings are particularly prized in domestic and foreign pet trade markets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fazi’s sentencing is scheduled for July 26.</span></p>

(Federal Energy Regulatory Commission construction report)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a win for Mountain Valley Pipeline, a federal court on Wednesday struck down a challenge to a 2021 decision by Virginia’s State Water Control Board and Department of Environmental Quality to grant the project a critical stream-crossing permit, concluding state officials “did not simply ‘rubber stamp’” the request.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“DEQ did not simply grant MVP’s application without considering its merits,” wrote Judge Stephanie Thacker in </span><a href="https://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinions/212425.P.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an opinion for the Richmond-based U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that was also backed by Chief Judge Roger Gregory and Judge James Wynn. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Rather, the agency held multiple public meetings where it heard directly from the public, considered nearly 8,000 public comments, addressed several recurring issues raised by the commenters, and provided a Final Fact Sheet detailing its reasons for recommending that the Board grant MVP’s application,” she continued. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ruling was a departure from </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/02/03/federal-court-again-overturns-another-mountain-valley-pipeline-permit/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a string of decisions by the 4th Circuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> overturning permits for the 303-mile natural gas pipeline through West Virginia and Virginia that developers have been trying to build since 2014. Four judges on the court, including Thacker, Gregory, Wynn and former judge William Traxler, have repeatedly found federal agencies conducted inadequate or flawed reviews as the basis of issuing those permits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mountain Valley Pipeline in May 2022 </span><a href="https://www.abralliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/MVP-motiion-to-4th-Circuit-for-random-panel-assignment-5-16-22.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">petitioned the court</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to assign different judges to its cases, arguing that in 12 petitions challenging different authorizations for the Mountain Valley and now-canceled Atlantic Coast pipelines, the judges “vacated or stayed all but two.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MVP’s petition was denied. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The petition the court struck down Wednesday was filed by 10 environmental groups, led by the Sierra Club, Appalachian Voices, the Chesapeake Climate Action Network and Wild Virginia after Virginia’s water board voted 3-2 in December 2021 to approve a state water protection permit for the pipeline. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Sligh, conservation director for Wild Virginia, said in a statement that the groups “respect the court’s opinion but we are disappointed that the Board’s badly flawed decision will stand.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The December 2021 permit fulfills a requirement under the federal Clean Water Act that pipelines obtain state and federal permits guaranteeing they won’t significantly degrade water quality during construction or operation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DEQ officials at the time said they expect the Mountain Valley Pipeline to temporarily impact 315 stream crossings and four acres of wetlands during construction, as well as two stream crossings and two acres of wetlands on a permanent basis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mountain Valley Pipeline spokesperson Natalie Cox said in a statement that MVP was pleased with the decision, which she called “one additional step forward in completing this critical infrastructure project.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Since the onset of the Mountain Valley Pipeline (MVP) project, we have worked closely with state and federal environmental agencies to provide accurate, comprehensive information that would allow for a thorough environmental review of the project,” she wrote in an email. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the legal victory, the project is still seeking federal approvals from the U.S. Forest Service to cross a portion of the Jefferson National Forest and from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. After numerous legal challenges and the loss of several permits, the pipeline is years behind schedule and billions over its original budget. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cox said MVP expects for the project to begin operating in late 2023.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An attempt last fall by Democratic West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin III to force the issuance of Mountain Valley’s remaining permits </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/09/27/stopgap-spending-bill-advances-in-u-s-senate-after-manchin-pulls-his-energy-plan/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">through legislation failed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

Parker Michels-Boyce for The Virginia Mercury</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real estate, housing and business groups are backing a request by Wegmans for the Supreme Court of Virginia to reconsider a ruling that property owners near a massive distribution center under construction in Hanover have the right to challenge local approvals of the project in court. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If not reconsidered,” the groups wrote in an amicus brief filed with the court March 13, the decision “will have disastrous consequences for all types of development in Virginia.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The long-running case, Morgan v. Board of Supervisors of Hanover County, stems from the Hanover board’s 2020 decision to grant New York-based grocery chain Wegmans a special exception to build an up to 1.7 million square foot facility and approve revised conditions for the project to proceed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project garnered significant support from the state: Under former Gov. Ralph Northam’s administration, Virginia promised Wegmans $2.35 million as well as tax credits to locate the facility in Hanover. The company promised to invest $175 million in the project and said it would create 700 jobs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But many neighbors were outraged by the plans, and the local board’s approval of them sparked several lawsuits, including </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/12/17/hanover-naacp-asks-for-temporary-halt-to-wegmans-distribution-center-work/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one linked to environmental justice concerns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the siting of the facility next to the Brown Grove community founded by freedpeople after the Civil War. A second legal challenge by five adjacent landowners argued the board had violated multiple local ordinances and state laws in its May 2020 decision. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hanover Circuit Court in 2020 and 2021 found the landowners — led by Roderick Morgan, whose property lies within 1,000 feet of the Wegmans facility — had no standing to challenge the board’s vote because they couldn’t demonstrate they would suffer a “particularized harm” from the project different from what the general public might experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Supreme Court of Virginia on Feb. 2 </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/02/supreme-court-of-va-rules-hanover-residents-can-sue-over-wegmans-warehouse/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">overturned that finding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and sent the case back to the local court, with Justice D. Arthur Kelsey writing the justices had “no difficulty concluding that the allegations of particularized harm made by the homeowners are fairly traceable to the Board’s 2020 decision.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wegmans asked the court to reconsider its decision March 6, saying the ruling would “create confusion in this and future land-use litigation” by allowing any zoning amendment or special exception, “no matter how minor, to re-open decades of settled zoning decisions.” </span></p>

        </div>
        </a>
        
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has argued any harms the neighbors may suffer are actually the result of a 1995 rezoning of the site and should not be linked to changes made in 2020 that greenlit the Wegmans project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twenty-one groups are supporting Wegmans in its request, including the Better Housing Coalition, Virginia Economic Developers Association, Local Government Attorneys of Virginia, Virginia Municipal League, Virginia Association of Counties, Virginia Association of Realtors, Chesapeake Solar &amp; Storage Association and various chambers of commerce. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This change in Virginia standing law is likely to generate years of litigation in each land-use development project, curtail development by Virginia-based companies, and cause non-Virginia companies to look elsewhere,” the groups wrote. “If not reconsidered now, the rule of Morgan will put Virginia at a competitive disadvantage compared to her neighboring States.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brian Buniva, attorney for the five Hanover property owners, called those arguments “extraordinary and desperate” as well as “utter nonsense” in a court filing Monday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, he argued, Wegmans is seeking to delay review by the county court “in hope that it can complete facility construction, obtain a certificate of occupancy from the County, and commence operations prior to this case being tried on the merits.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hanover facility is expected to begin operations this summer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wegmans could have avoided the dilemma it caused by building on unlawfully zoned property,” Buniva wrote. “Wegmans, however, chose to proceed at its own risk while this litigation was pending. Wegmans made its bed, and now under the law, must lie in it.” </span></p>

<p>Over the past few years, Norfolk&#8217;s homicide and violent crime rates have jumped. Some have blamed so-called progressive prosecution policies for the rise, while others say similar upticks can be seen nationwide, regardless of whether local prosecutors embrace progressive philosophies. This two-part series looks at how this debate has played out in Norfolk, what could be causing the surge and what the city is doing to combat it.</p>
<p>Yesterday: <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/28/how-norfolks-progressive-prosecutor-ended-up-in-the-crosshairs-of-debate-over-rising-crime/" target="_blank">How Norfolk&#8217;s progressive prosecutor ended up in the crosshairs of debate over rising crime</a></p>
</div>
	</div>
	
<p>In March of 2021, a Norfolk prosecutor who had recently retired after 27 years wrote to City Council, the police chief and the city manager urging them to cast aside what he called a “malaise” and explore changes to combat the city’s longstanding violent crime problem.</p>
<p>“Violent crime has been a constant over the last few decades in the city of Norfolk whether the city is experiencing a positive economic boom or a more challenging economic period,” wrote Philip G. Evans II in an 18-page memorandum. “Sadly, although the trends over time with respect to upper end violent crime are disturbing, no one seems to want to address this issue.”</p>
<p>The city that year went on to record 61 homicides and then top that in 2022 with 63 murders, the most in nearly 30 years. It wasn’t until October 2022, following a series of shootings downtown, that the city issued a plan to address crime, 18 months after the Evans memo.</p>
<p>Even before that rise in killings, Evans had noted how high Norfolk’s homicide rate was. In the years leading up to his memo, it was two times the national average. In 2018, when Norfolk had 37 homicides, New York’s murder rate was just one-third of Norfolk’s, he wrote. The problem spanned generations: Evans prosecuted a father for multiple armed robberies only to later prosecute his son for murder.</p>
<p>“Why,” he wrote, “is no one screaming about Norfolk’s homicide rate?” And “when,” he asked officials, “did you last receive a comprehensive briefing regarding the subject of violent crime in Norfolk over time which included the chief of the Norfolk Police Department, the chief of the Old Dominion [University] Police Department, and the Commonwealth’s Attorney?”</p>
<p>“It has not occurred,” he added, answering the question.</p>
<p>Finally, Evans outlined a series of suggestions to tackle the problem, ranging from addressing the personnel drain in the police department to improving and increasing camera surveillance to creating a collaborative effort with schools to identify and divert youthful offenders who may become violent offenders.</p>
<p>According to a public records request, Evans received a reply from only one council member, Courtney Doyle, whose husband is now a judge but once was a fellow prosecutor. She wished him a happy retirement and thanked him for his observations.</p>
<p>City Manager Larry “Chip” Filer said he recalled the email as one of many policy proposals examined over the last year but added that “a lot of other people said similar stuff.” Like other cities facing rising violent crime in the wake of police shootings, police recruitment issues and the pandemic, Norfolk was searching for answers.</p>
<p>Complicating the problem was the fact that patterns of gun violence seemed to be changing in the city. Gun violence in the past, Filer said, was economic — drugs, burglary, robbery. Now, though, he said, “relational violence” seems to be the main driver. “Very rarely is our gun violence occurring between folks that don’t know each other,” he said.</p>
<p>“It took us quite a while to figure out what was happening, and particularly why it was happening,” Filer added. “One of the very first steps we took was to recognize that the violent crime, that particularly gun crime that we were seeing, was different than it had ever been in the city’s history. It was very personal. It was mostly between folks who knew each other, had a beef and were settling scores.”</p>
<p>To Evans, though, while the term “relational violence” is new, the problem is not.</p>
<p>“‘Relational violence’ has <em>always</em> been a substantial contributor to homicides in Norfolk,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">New approaches to crime reduction</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In October 2022, after high-profile shootings on Granby Street downtown, Filer released a paper outlining crime reduction strategies. Fourteen, including the deployment of hot spot policing with specialized units and the installation of portable security cameras, were intended to be put in place within three months. Twelve, including the establishment of a real-time crime center to monitor camera and data feeds, the use of automatic license plate readers and aggressive code enforcement, were scheduled to be implemented within a year. Nine, including the creation of a regional crime data center and integration of the city’s camera system, are long-term efforts expected to take more than a year.</p>
<p>The strategies reflect how cities awash in guns like Norfolk are reimagining fighting crime by turning to technology and softer social initiatives like <a href="https://bja.ojp.gov/program/community-violence-intervention/overview" target="_blank">violence interruption</a> and <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/community-based-violence-interruption-programs-can-reduce-gun-violence/" target="_blank">conflict resolution.</a></p>
<p>A number of the proposals in Filer’s paper had also appeared in the Evans memo, giving rise to the question of whether the city could have acted sooner.</p>
<p>But Filer said the pandemic and the closing of schools made it difficult for Norfolk to implement community outreach, particularly with youth.</p>
<p>“It’s unfair to suggest that we were just sitting on our hands idly, you know, pontificating whether or not crime would go down by itself,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Police staffing challenges</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Part of the reason behind Norfolk’s efforts to find new ways of fighting crime was the dramatic decrease in its police forces.</p>
<p>According to a police spokesman, the department had 727 officers at the start of 2013, 756 at the start of 2018 and 501 at the start of this year.</p>
<p>For years, Evans said it was clear staffing Norfolk’s department was going to be a problem as other local cities offered better pay and, more recently, officers became disenchanted with the policies of the commonwealth attorney’s office. He said the losses are reflected in other data: The city’s homicide clearance rate, which had once been above 80%, had been dropping. A Virginian-Pilot story reported it was 37% for 2022.</p>
<p>“More than half of the homicide squad is sitting in other police departments right now from three or four years ago,” he told the Mercury. “They went over to Chesapeake. They went out to Suffolk, or Isle of Wight, or Franklin, or they just retired.”</p>
<p>When Filer arrived in 2019, he said he was given an internal memo outlining a “retirement bubble.” Then the George Floyd murder and other police incidents intervened, creating morale and <a href="https://npdjobs.com/" target="_blank">recruitment issues</a>. A program to <a href="https://i.redd.it/s41ofcp7yop91.jpg" target="_blank">recruit police from larger cities</a>, called “Today Will Be Different,” has had some success. But the reality, he added, is police departments will be augmented by civilian analysts manning a real-time crime center so sworn officers can be dedicated to patrolling the streets.</p>
<p>“We have been a little slow to that pivot compared to other major cities,” he said. “The days of us having 700 sworn officers are over. It’s done. And part of that is due to the fact that we probably can’t get there in the new reality of policing. But also part of it is that that’s not necessarily how large cities are going to police anymore.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Violent crime hot spots</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The Evans memo called for developing a program to deploy cameras mounted on telephone and other poles in areas where violent crime can statistically be predicted to occur, to work with businesses to upgrade their surveillance systems and to use license plate reader systems more widely. He added that the cameras should be able to produce video useful in court. “As a prosecutor, my team encountered numerous cases in which a crime of violence within the coverage area of cameras associated with a governmental structure only to learn the quality of the resulting video is insufficient to identify the actors in the crime or non-operational,” he wrote.</p>
<p>But a year later, the city confirmed that cameras in eight of the 12 city-owned parking garages did not work. Funds to replace them have been approved. After a March shooting outside a restaurant downtown that killed three people and injured two others, the city added mobile cameras downtown.</p>
<p>While the downtown shootings spurred media coverage, statistics show that crime and particularly shootings and homicides are clustered in other neighborhoods.</p>

<p>The Evans paper identified the densest concentrations of homicides over the past 20 years in the city’s public housing areas. That fits with the city’s own 2012-21 map of homicide and aggravated assault hot spots, which shows four housing developments operated by the Norfolk Redevelopment and Housing Authority as the most dangerous places to live.</p>
<p>“For far too many of the residents of our economically challenged neighborhoods in Norfolk,” Evans wrote, “the fear of violent crime in their neighborhoods is their daily reality.”</p>
<p>In September, Karen Rose, the authority’s security program manager, sought increased security funding from the authority, noting that people with a grudge were shooting from streets at the edge of public housing communities so they could escape easily. During that meeting, Ronald Jackson, NRHA’s executive director, said he was frustrated that the city was not acting faster to install speed bumps and take other actions to reduce opportunities for crime.</p>
<p>“If something happens, we’re looked at as if we’re not doing everything that we can to get things done within the community,” he said. “These are not citizens of the Norfolk Redevelopment and Housing Authority. These are citizens of Norfolk.”</p>
<figure id="attachment_34563" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Young_terrace_morrison-scaled.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-34563" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Young_terrace_morrison-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1437" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Young_terrace_morrison-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Young_terrace_morrison-300x168.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Young_terrace_morrison-1024x575.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Young_terrace_morrison-768x431.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Young_terrace_morrison-1536x862.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Young_terrace_morrison-2048x1149.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  The Young Terrace public housing community in Norfolk. (Jim Morrison)</p></figure>
<p>“To me, if there’s a call there for police service as there would be in Ghent, they should get the same type of response,” he continued, referring to a more affluent area of the city. “And to me, I get the feeling as if they’re on a reservation and are treated differently.”</p>
<p>Filer disputed that.</p>
<p>“To say that they don’t get the same response in those communities as someone in Ghent is simply not true,” he said. “In fact, if you were to observe our patrols, we have far more police officers patrolling in those areas than we do in Ghent in large part, for good reason. We allocate resources based on those hot spot maps.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Diverting young people from crime</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Evans recommended creating a collaborative effort to divert youth who end up in juvenile court or face disciplinary actions at school before they escalate into becoming violent offenders.</p>
<p>Norfolk’s plan — hiring consultants who have worked in violence intervention — is a distant cousin of that suggestion. The city last summer announced a two-year, $180,000 contract with the<a href="https://www.newarkcommunitystreetteam.org/about-us/" target="_blank"> Newark Community Street Team</a>, a New Jersey-based nonprofit, to train members of Norfolk organizations on ways to resolve disputes before they escalate. The first place they targeted was Young Terrace, one of the public housing communities highlighted on the city’s homicide hot spot map.</p>
<p>The Newark program, which began in 2014 and focuses on at-risk youth and young adults from 14 to 30, is one of several community violence intervention efforts that have emerged recently in cities like Louisville, Baltimore, Chicago, Atlanta and Wichita. The programs are so new and sorting out why crime rates drop is so thorny that researchers say evaluating them is difficult.</p>
<p>The city is committed to three years with the program.</p>
<p>“We’re very hopeful this will help us get to the bottom of at least some of what we’re seeing in this gun violence space,” Filer said.</p>
<p>Researchers agree, though, that violent crime does not have a single cause. Nor is there a silver bullet solution. So the city is trying a range of strategies.</p>
<p>“We’re going to do everything we can do at the city level to deter and have the evidence to be able to effectively prosecute criminal activity,” Filer said. “We do need all hands on deck to try and limit the amount of criminal activity that’s happening in the city. We’re not happy with where we are right now. And so we’re going to take actions to try and move in a different direction.”</p>

	<div class="newsroomSidebar">
<p>Over the past few years, Norfolk&#8217;s homicide and violent crime rates have jumped. Some have blamed so-called progressive prosecution policies for the rise, while others say similar upticks can be seen nationwide, regardless of whether local prosecutors embrace progressive philosophies. This two-part series looks at how this debate has played out in Norfolk, what could be causing the surge and what the city is doing to combat it.</p>
<p>Tomorrow: <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/03/01/violent-crime-in-norfolk-is-up-the-jury-is-still-out-on-why-and-what-to-do-about-it/" target="_blank">Violent crime in Norfolk is up. The jury is still out on why — and what to do about it.</a></p>
</div>
	</div>
	
<p>When Norfolk officials held a September press conference following a night in which three people were killed and 11 others injured, Mayor Kenneth Alexander, City Manager Larry “Chip” Filer, Interim Police Chief Michael Goldsmith and Sheriff Joe Baron spoke. Conspicuously missing was Commonwealth’s Attorney Ramin Fatehi, who had not been invited.</p>
<p>Alexander did not mention Fatehi by name. But a portion of <a href="https://youtu.be/nUWNBYSVhps" target="_blank">his remarks</a> pointedly referred to the prosecutor’s office.</p>
<p>“Those committing crimes must be held accountable in our courts. A strong and effective prosecutorial team is critical to the safety of our city and for the voice of victims,” Alexander said. “Norfolk residents deserve a prosecutorial philosophy and practice that keeps offenders off the streets.”</p>
<p>Alexander’s comment referring to “prosecutorial philosophy” has its foundation in Fatehi’s self-identification as a “progressive prosecutor.” Fatehi, who won 60% of the vote in the Democratic primary, campaigned as an advocate of <a href="https://fatehinorfolk.com/" target="_blank">criminal justice reform</a><u>,</u> saying jail or prison should be a last resort when there are no alternatives or public safety is at risk.</p>
<p>But as Norfolk experienced a jump in violent crime — the city saw 63 murders in 2022, the highest number in nearly 30 years — there has been a quiet campaign against his policies that also questions the competency of his office.</p>
<p>Fatehi’s office has fed into those criticisms with a string of courtroom failures in high-profile murder cases and a spate of departures. Since he won the Democratic primary in June 2021, virtually assuring his election, at least 22 lawyers in the Norfolk Commonwealth’s Attorney’s Office have left, about two-thirds of them for prosecutors’ offices in Chesapeake, Suffolk and Virginia Beach.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A ‘progressive prosecutor’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Since he took office in January 2022, Fatehi has followed through on <a href="https://fatehinorfolk.com/" target="_blank">campaign promises</a> to reform Norfolk’s approach to prosecution. In an 11-page memorandum sent to his staff in March 2022, he outlined a series of policies intended to “combat explicit and implicit bias, mass incarceration, the school-to-prison pipeline, and the criminalization of poverty, homelessness, mental illness, and substance-use disorder.”</p>
<p>Writing that mandatory minimum sentences “present a significant possibility of over-punishment,” he required prosecutors to seek a supervisor’s approval of any sentence exceeding 30 days. (Prosecutors can use plea agreements to work around mandatory minimums, which Fatehi told the Mercury “<em>force</em> judges, whom the General Assembly elects because of their discernment, to impose sentences regardless of whether that outcome is appropriate.&#8221;)</p>
<figure id="attachment_34544" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:336px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Fatehi.png" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-34544" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Fatehi.png" alt="" width="336" height="459" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Fatehi.png 336w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Fatehi-220x300.png 220w" sizes="(max-width: 336px) 100vw, 336px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Norfolk Commonwealth&#8217;s Attorney Ramin Fatehi. (City of Norfolk)</p></figure>
<p>Where a fraud or larceny case involved a loss of $2,500 or less, he wrote that prosecutors should consider a plea reducing any felony to a misdemeanor. While magistrates set bail, he said the office would continue a policy of not seeking cash bail. And he told prosecutors to consider reducing simple felony drug possession cases to a misdemeanor unless the accused demonstrated a risk to others.</p>
<p>Similar policies have been pursued in cities like San Francisco, Philadelphia, Chicago, Boston and Houston. But as crime surged in the past two years, prosecutors in those cities have faced recalls and criticism from mayors and police chiefs, who blame the upticks in violence on progressive approaches.</p>
<p>Fatehi was no exception. Norfolk’s 2022 homicide total was the highest the city had seen since the mid-1990s. In 2021, there were 62 murders. From 2012 through 2019, the city suffered between 29 and 43 murders annually.</p>
<p>Philip G. Evans II, who served 27 years as a Norfolk prosecutor, in March 2021 noted the city’s violence problem in an 18-page memorandum to City Council shortly after his retirement.</p>
<p>“Violent crime has been a constant over the last few decades in the city,” he wrote. “Sadly, although the trends over time with respect to upper-end violent crime are disturbing, no one seems to want to address this issue.”</p>
<p>But while Evans acknowledges Norfolk’s ongoing problem with crime, he points to progressive prosecution philosophies like those of Fatehi’s office, which he says do not factor in victims or accountability, as a driver of the recent increases.</p>
<p>“If you look at the homicides (in 2022), you have a marked increase of people just killing each other in broad daylight in front of multiple witnesses,” he said in an interview.</p>
<p>That change, he added, boils down to people thinking they can get away with it.</p>
<p>“The community has to believe that if they report a crime, if they describe being a witness to a crime, that the person who committed the crime will be held accountable in court,” he said. “If they do not have that respect for the system, then the danger that they have of cooperating, namely retaliation, will tip the balance in favor of not coming to court and not cooperating.”</p>
<p>Fatehi, though, dismissed those criticisms, pointing to the root causes of crime as poverty, economic insecurity and the flood of guns, all exacerbated by the pandemic everywhere, not just in cities with progressive prosecutors.</p>
<p>“The increase in violence that we saw nationwide — red cities, blue cities, cities with reform prosecutors, cities with traditional prosecutors — coincided with COVID, with the shutting down of schools, the shutting down of work, the limiting of access to lifelines for potential victims,” he said. “This is not a Norfolk problem. And it’s not a Virginia problem. It’s an everywhere problem.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What fuels rising crime?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Numbers support Fatehi’s contention that the problem isn’t isolated to Norfolk. But divining the why of rising crime, as with any trend, is difficult.</p>
<p>Violent crime rates in 2020 were far below those between 1985 and 2009, according to FBI statistics. What did rise nationwide in the last two years is the murder rate. One <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/myths-and-realities-understanding-recent-trends-violent-crime" target="_blank">study by New York University Law School’s Brennan Center </a>reports homicides rose 30% in 2020. A mid-2022 r<a href="https://majorcitieschiefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/MCCA-Violent-Crime-Report-2022-and-2021-Midyear.pdf" target="_blank">eport from a police chiefs association </a>said homicides in major cities were down slightly nationwide between 2021 and 2022, but with mixed results depending on the city. Killings were up in Dallas, Indianapolis, Milwaukee, New Orleans, Phoenix, San Antonio and Tulsa, for example, and down in Austin, Boston, Columbus, Miami and Portland.</p>
<p>Researchers have pointed to various factors as reasons for rising crime, saying prosecutors are only one part of a mosaic affecting the crime rate. A <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/2022/04/21/mapping-gun-violence-a-closer-look-at-the-intersection-between-place-and-gun-homicides-in-four-cities/" target="_blank">Brookings Institute report </a>noted increases in gun homicides were largely concentrated in “disinvested and structurally disadvantaged neighborhoods that had high rates of gun violence to begin with,” a situation mirrored in Norfolk.</p>
<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation also cautions against making conclusions about crime in various cities, <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/nibrs/2012/resources/variables-affecting-crime" target="_blank">citing 13 variables</a> as affecting such patterns. Those include economic conditions, population density, citizens’ attitudes toward crime, youth concentration, the strength of local law enforcement agencies and the policies of the criminal justice system, including prosecutors, judges and corrections.</p>
<p>Fatehi too argues factors other than his policies are responsible for the jump in violent crimes.</p>
<p>“There are systems-level problems that have led to the increase in crime, from COVID to an unprecedented shortage of police in Norfolk,” he said. “Certain people in the political class are looking for cover and looking for someone to blame. And the fact that I am willing to say, ‘This system has caused harm, I will not perpetuate harm in the system, I will punish people as appropriate, I will divert people as appropriate, I will deal with racial disparities,’ feeds into the Republican crime narrative in a way that people will criticize me. If I said, ‘I will lock everybody up forever,’ I would not get criticized.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Staff departures</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Nevertheless, a string of staff departures and a series of high-profile courtroom losses have fueled suspicion of Fatehi and his approach.</p>
<p>At least 22 prosecutors left the office in the 18 months after he won the primary and was assured of victory in Democratic-dominated Norfolk. About two-thirds of them moved to prosecutors’ offices in Chesapeake, Suffolk, and Virginia Beach.</p>
<p>Critics like Evans say that the attorney turnover means a loss of experience, expertise and mentorship for new prosecutors.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of people who pass the bar exam. There are a lot of people who maybe have practiced for a while doing things, but there aren’t a lot of people that can handle prosecution in a high-volume violent crime area,” he said.</p>
<p>While Fatehi concedes some lawyers departed because they disagreed with his approach, he also said others left for better salaries with lower caseloads.</p>
<p>“I suffer from the same susceptibility to poaching that the Norfolk Police Department is suffering from. People don’t get paid enough,” he said. “They are asked to do extremely difficult work, very technically complex work. Any given case going on in any given week in the Norfolk circuit courts would be the case of the year in other places.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, he noted, two veteran prosecutors with extensive trial experience moved from Richmond to join his office during his tenure. Another former circuit court judge who had not been reappointed became a deputy commonwealth’s attorney.</p>
<p>Former prosecutors in Fatehi’s office contacted late last year declined to comment.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">High-profile losses</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>More difficult for Fatehi to explain are a series of legal missteps.</p>
<p>In early December, Shavyonne Vick was acquitted of killing a 21-year-old at a family party in May 2021. The jury deliberated for only 10 minutes before handing down its verdict.</p>
<p>Vick’s attorney, Eric Korslund, said several of Norfolk prosecutors’ moves in the case were unusual. The co-counsel who made the opening, closing and rebuttal arguments for the prosecution was a lawyer who had just passed the bar in July and had never worked a jury trial. Korslund said while the attorney did a good job, he could not remember another instance of a prosecutor working a murder trial as his first jury case.</p>
<p>And just before trial, Korslund said prosecutors asked for a continuance because they had found a lab report on the bullet lodged in the victim’s face.</p>
<figure id="attachment_34218" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:2136px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Getty_justice-scales.jpeg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-34218" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Getty_justice-scales.jpeg" alt="" width="2136" height="1404" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Getty_justice-scales.jpeg 2136w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Getty_justice-scales-300x197.jpeg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Getty_justice-scales-1024x673.jpeg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Getty_justice-scales-768x505.jpeg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Getty_justice-scales-1536x1010.jpeg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Getty_justice-scales-2048x1346.jpeg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2136px) 100vw, 2136px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  (Peter Dazeley / Getty Images)</p></figure>
<p>“I was outraged,” Korslund said. “It’s just gross negligence. It’s no respect for the deceased. It’s no respect for the deceased’s family. It’s no respect for this community. They need to do their job.”</p>
<p>The judge denied the continuance motion and excluded the report. Korslund said he didn’t think it affected the outcome because body cam footage from the scene cast doubt on the testimony of a key witness who identified Vick as the shooter.</p>
<p>It wasn’t the first time the office had missed deadlines or failed to file evidence. In an April case that had been pending for three years, Fatehi sought a continuance because he wasn’t ready for a jury trial even though jurors had been called for the case. His reasoning, he told a judge, was that he thought a plea agreement was going to be reached and some of his witnesses were not available.</p>
<p>In the end, the defendant, Remono Newby, agreed to a plea that reduced a second-degree murder charge with a maximum of 40 years in prison to voluntary manslaughter.</p>
<p>“Newby pleaded guilty to manslaughter, just as his two codefendants did. He faces sentencing in a range of 10 to 13 years,” Fatehi said. “There were risks of going to trial on both sides due to difficulties in the facts of the case for both parties.”</p>
<p>Prosecutors from Fatehi’s office also made fatal mistakes in a cold case, the killing of U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings’ nephew Christopher a decade ago. In that case, charges against the man police said was the shooter were dismissed after the judge banned the introduction of the evidence and most of the witnesses. The prosecutor said a box of police notes and documents, including forensic evidence, witness statements, transcripts of jailhouse calls and investigator’s notes, had not been provided to the defense until five days before the trial. The office had also failed to provide a complete witness list, as required by statute.</p>

<p>Another defendant in the case also had all charges against him dropped for similar reasons. A third was retried following a mistrial and then acquitted. A fourth, the only defendant to be convicted, was sentenced last week to 25 years in prison for conspiracy to commit murder and robbery.</p>
<p>“This office made mistakes,” Fatehi concedes. He said he had not been involved in the decision to bring charges in the cold case. But, he added, “They were my prosecutors, and therefore I am responsible for those mistakes as the captain of the ship.”</p>
<p>“We’re all human, we all make mistakes,” Korslund said. “But when they’re repeated, it’s a pattern. And it’s a choice. And these mistakes have been repeated and repeated and repeated. “</p>
<p>For Korslund, who represents numerous defendants in high-profile cases, those results mean he’s more likely to advise clients to ask for a jury in Norfolk.</p>
<p>“Out of all the cities, if I have clients charged with a crime and the facts are the same in Norfolk, I’d be most inclined to say I want a jury,” he added. “I think there’s a chance that they’re not going to file stuff on time. They’re not going to subpoena witnesses.”</p>
<p>Most cases, though, are concluded with plea agreements. There, too, Fatehi’s office has run into trouble. In years past, judges rarely refused agreements between prosecutors and defense attorneys. But, according to Fatehi’s records, judges rejected at least 29 plea agreements his office sought last year. Most of the rejections came in early 2022 and dealt with a range of crimes, ranging from malicious wounding and aggravated sexual assault to making a false statement and child endangerment.</p>
<p>“It’s significantly higher than we’ve seen historically,” Fatehi said.</p>
<p>Fatehi, though, remains firm in his belief that his way is the just way. Did the rise in crime during the first part of 2022 prod him to reconsider his policies?</p>
<p>“Absolutely not. These policies promote public safety,” he replied. “This is always a false charge against reform prosecutors — which is if you take your boot off of the necks of low-level offenders that you’re going to promote chaos. &#8230; People should be held accountable to the extent necessary, but no more than necessary.”</p>

Parker Michels-Boyce for The Virginia Mercury</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Supreme Court of Virginia overruled a lower court that decided homeowners whose property lies near a massive Wegmans distribution center under construction in Hanover County didn’t have legal standing to challenge local approvals of the project issued in 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Standing determines who may file a lawsuit — not who can win one,” Justice D. Arthur Kelsey wrote in the court’s </span><a href="https://www.vacourts.gov/opinions/opnscvwp/1211021.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feb. 2 opinion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In this case, he found, “the homeowners assert a direct cause-and-effect relationship between the Board’s 2020 decision and specific, detailed harm to the homeowners.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ruling returns the lawsuit, which sought to nullify the county&#8217;s approvals, to the Hanover Circuit Court. But with the Wegmans warehouse already partially built, it&#8217;s unclear exactly how the case might impact the project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roderick Morgan, the lead plaintiff in the case and a Hanover resident who owns property within 1,000 feet of the site where the 1.7 million square foot facility is being built, said he was pleased but not surprised by the ruling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“After listening to the questions that the Supreme Court asked of the county, I felt like this was the likely outcome, but I’m still gratified that they saw this our way,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, Hanover County Administrator John Budesky said while the county “disagree[s] with the court’s decision, the board respects the courts’ role in the process” and “remains confident that, as the courts continue their review of this matter, they will find that the board acted properly related to this case.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The case before the Supreme Court of Virginia concerned whether five residents whose properties are close to the site had the legal right to bring a lawsuit against the Hanover County Board of Supervisors. The residents allege the board committed multiple violations of local ordinances and state laws in voting to grant Wegmans a special exception and approve revised proffers for the project in May 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In November 2020 and August 2021, the Hanover Circuit Court ruled the homeowners lacked standing to pursue their case, saying they had failed to demonstrate that they would suffer special harms from the project different from those experienced by the general public. The residents then </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/05/31/supreme-court-of-virginia-agrees-to-hear-appeal-of-hanover-circuit-ruling-in-wegmans-case/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">appealed the ruling to the state Supreme Court</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="E1ayRPf39A"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/05/31/supreme-court-of-virginia-agrees-to-hear-appeal-of-hanover-circuit-ruling-in-wegmans-case/">Va.

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Va. Supreme Court will hear appeal in contentious Wegmans distribution center case&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/05/31/supreme-court-of-virginia-agrees-to-hear-appeal-of-hanover-circuit-ruling-in-wegmans-case/embed/#?secret=gY1QIlBJZz#?secret=E1ayRPf39A" data-secret="E1ayRPf39A" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of the debate before the court centered around a 2013 case known as Friends of the Rappahannock v. Caroline County Board of Supervisors in which the justices laid out two criteria that people or groups filing legal complaints over zoning decisions have to meet to claim standing. First, they must own or occupy property on or in close proximity to the property in question, and second, they must be able to show they will suffer a particular harm as a result of a decision different from the harm the general public might experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The board and Wegmans admitted Morgan and the other residents met the proximity criteria but said they wouldn’t suffer special harm as a result of the project. Partly, they said, that was because any harms they suffered would be the result of an original 1995 rezoning of the site and not local officials’ votes in 2020 to give the Wegmans distribution center a special exception and modify proffers attached to the site.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Rather than alleging harms arising from the Board’s limited acts in May 2020, Homeowners allege harms based on zoning decisions made in 1995,” Wegmans wrote in a brief to the court. “The Board’s 1995 rezoning of the site and adoption of the 1995 proffers are no longer subject to challenge.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an amicus brief, the Local Government Attorneys of Virginia, Virginia Municipal League and Virginia Association of Counties backed up Hanover and Wegmans’ stance, calling the homeowners’ claims “unprecedented in Virginia law governing both local land use decisions and standing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Plaintiffs propose that their standing status should be analyzed based on the alleged impact on them and their properties from zoning decisions made more than 25 years ago as opposed to the alleged impact on them from the 2020 decision they are actually challenging,” the groups wrote. That “would have grave consequences for local governments who make zoning decisions and for property owners who rely on those zoning decisions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Supreme Court rejected that argument. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have no difficulty concluding that the allegations of particularized harm made by the homeowners are fairly traceable to the Board’s 2020 decision,” Kelsey wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Had there been no Board decision at all in 2020, there would have been no governmental decision for the homeowners to complain about,” he concluded. “Wegmans asked for and received a favorable decision from the Board in 2020.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Supreme Court’s ruling does not resolve the case but instead sends it back to Hanover Circuit Court for the five residents to pursue their complaints against the board. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We haven’t really won anything. We’ve won the right to make the claim we wanted to make two years ago,” said Morgan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Construction has continued during the litigation. Wegmans has begun hiring for positions at the facility and </span><a href="https://jobs.wegmans.com/richmond-distribution" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lists an opening date of summer 2023</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on its website. At the time of the project’s announcement by former Gov. Ralph Northam in December 2019, Wegmans said the distribution center would create 700 jobs. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, almost all records of the state’s Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission (JIRC) are kept strictly confidential unless they involve a proven breach serious enough to rise to the Supreme Court of Virginia for a formal censure or removal from the bench. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each year, the seven-member commission files a report detailing how many complaints about judges it received. But those reports aren’t required to identify which judges were disciplined, what rules they broke or what their punishment was. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB2168" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">sponsored by Del. Wren Williams, R-Patrick, would instruct the commission to include that information in future reports.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Obviously, we appoint judges and keep tabs on how they&#8217;re doing,” Williams said as he presented his bill to a legislative committee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill was approved by a 67-31 vote, with most Democrats in the no column but more than a dozen voting yes. The opposition appeared to be more about Williams’ conduct the day before the vote rather than the substance of his bill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, Williams refused to yield the floor to take a question about the JIRC bill from Del. Mike Mullin, D-Newport News, bucking the tradition of engaging colleagues who may be seeking clarity, debate or technical fixes to a piece of legislation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I just thought that we should include retired judges in the bill,” Mullin said in an interview Friday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retired Virginia judges are frequently called in to hear cases from which active judges have recused themselves. It’s a common practice in politically sensitive cases involving sitting legislators, because the General Assembly has the power to hire, promote and fire active judges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When told why Democrats had opposed a bill that received unanimous support in committee, Williams insisted his bill already covered retired judges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It actually includes anybody who has ever taken the judge’s oath and is going to sit on the bench,” Williams said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whichever interpretation is correct, the bill can be amended when it passes over to the state Senate. In the other chamber, Sen. Mark Obenshain, R-Rockingham, has filed a similar JIRC transparency bill that has not yet been heard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Complaints against judges rarely lead to formal punishment. In 2022, the commission received a total of 415 complaints, and 402 were dismissed. The vast majority of complaints were dismissed for either failing to fall under the commission’s jurisdiction or failing to allege a specific violation of the </span><a href="https://www.vacourts.gov/courts/scv/canons_of_judicial_conduct.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canons of Judicial Conduct</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the state’s official rulebook for judges. The commission determined a breach occurred in five cases, but all five of those cases were also dismissed, according to the body’s </span><a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2022/RD753/PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">annual report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raymond F. Morrogh, commission counsel for JIRC, explained in an email last month that “some matters may not be of sufficient gravity to constitute the basis for a judge’s retirement, removal, or censure.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Where breaches of the Canons may be minor, it is conceivable that a matter may be resolved without resort to a formal hearing, or the filing of a complaint in the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Virginia,” Morrogh said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Canons of Judicial Conduct deal with a wide array of issues, including judges’ fairness and impartiality, diligence about avoiding conflicts of interest, gifts and other favors, and use of social media.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most complaints against judges come from the general public, but some originate with lawyers, court employees and other judges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Williams’ bill would only require disclosure when a breach is substantiated and results in discipline, which would prevent frivolous or unproven accusations from being made public.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a very small universe of people,” said Robert Tracci, a senior attorney in the office of Attorney General Jason Miyares, referring to the number of judges likely to be identified under the proposed law. “And it does promote transparency in government.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The attorney general’s office has called for more openness in the judicial discipline process, a proposal that seemed to take on new urgency because of its connection to Republican efforts to investigate the actions of a former chair of the Virginia Parole Board who’s now serving as a judge in Virginia Beach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bennett, whom</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/01/25/ag-says-former-va-parole-board-chair-broke-the-law-in-2020-release-frenzy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Miyares has accused</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of abusing her Parole Board powers and breaking the law in a rush to release inmates in early 2020, was suspended from her role as a judge in the Virginia Beach Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court in 2021. Media outlets’ efforts to figure out what she was disciplined for have been unsuccessful due to the secretive nature of the process.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/va-supreme-court-sealed-its-reason-for-closing-records-filed-by-former-parole-board-chair/article_97b37533-0990-52be-a912-a1e3897776ff.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Richmond Times-Dispatch filed a legal petition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> seeking to have the disciplinary records unsealed, but the Supreme Court of Virginia issued a </span><a href="https://www.vacourts.gov/opinions/opnscvwp/1210489.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">split opinion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year that kept most of the documents confidential.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“From the start, Judge Bennett made clear that she did not want anyone but us to see the reason why JIRC had suspended her,” Supreme Court Justices D. Arthur Kelsey and Teresa M. Chafin wrote in a dissenting opinion. “The majority holds that Judge Bennett has a statutory right to keep that information secret and that the public has no constitutional right to break the seal of secrecy.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, JIRC </span><a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2021/RD720/PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> receiving 395 complaints. Only one was ruled a breach of judicial conduct and not dismissed.</span></p>

(Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mixing politics, law enforcement and religion is a difficult high-wire act under the best of circumstances. Add in a sex sting operation and you’re toeing the wire over the Grand Canyon without a net or safety harness in the middle of a blizzard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chesterfield County’s commonwealth’s attorney, Stacey Davenport, should know that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lurid, real-life soap opera with all those elements, and more turns than a mountain backroad, is playing itself out in Chesterfield County and showing up in headlines from sea to shining sea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It began at the end of an online chat that allegedly occurred between a Virginia Beach megachurch pastor and a police detective posing as an underage prostitute who directed him to a Chesterfield motel room in October 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Rev. John Blanchard, pastor of Rock Church International, was arrested and booked on charges of solicitation of prostitution. He was one of 17 men snared in a two-day Chesterfield County Police Department sting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three months ago, in October 2022, Davenport </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Chesterfield’s Commonwealth’s Attorney </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announced she would</span><a href="https://legaldictionary.net/nolle-prosequi/" target="_blank"> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">nolle prosequi</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (not pursue) the case against Blanchard, giving no explanation beyond suggesting that the evidence was insufficient to win a felony conviction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The interaction between the detective and the defendant in each case was different,” Davenport </span><a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/crime/chesterfield-ca-responds-allegations-pastors-child-solicitation/291-d0ec8bdc-18ec-4787-96d1-80b6328e63ec" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said in a statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announcing the decision to not prosecute Blanchard’s case. “As a result, the evidence available for use in the prosecution of each case was different, and the outcome of each case was different. Some of the cases had sufficient evidence to support felony convictions, and some did not. As ministers of justice, prosecutors are required to individually evaluate the strength of the evidence provided by the police in each case.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blanchard vehemently asserted his innocence. He returned to the pulpit and called the charges against him “vicious and inhuman accusations” and said that statements made in support of the charges were “demonstrably false.” He also petitioned a court to expunge the charge from his record.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You dress up a lie. You can twist it. You can misrepresent it. But I’m sorry, a lie is still a lie,” he said according to </span><a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/local/mycity/virginia-beach/virginia-beach-pastor-dropped-charges-attempted-solicitation-minor-speaks-out/291-57ed0e5e-7d1a-490d-a8d1-47ed1489b21d" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a television report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps Davenport failed to anticipate the fires of condemnation ignited by her decision to not prosecute an influential pastor who allegedly drove nearly two hours for a “QV” (flesh trade shorthand for “quick visit”) in a suburban Richmond motel room with a person who purported to be a 17-year-0ld girl named Maddie. How such a public relations miscalculation is possible for a Republican elected to her job in 2019 with 54% of the vote </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and who seeks reelection this fall </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is bewildering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In November, Timothy Anderson, a lawyer and politically ambitious Republican who represents a Virginia Beach district in the House of Delegates, was among the first to raise hell. He used Virginia’s Freedom of Information Act to obtain police incident reports and posted the documents on his</span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=669733374806464&amp;set=pb.100053094233188.-2207520000." target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">law firm’s Facebook page.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The real game-changer, however, came in early January when Chesterfield County’s normally taciturn police chief, Jeffrey Katz, posted a blistering rebuke of Davenport’s decision on his</span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ColJSKatz/posts/pfbid0aor1kdNqPQeXFKot6aYNPPfzwJgJY7VrccnagXNgzqGibM5JKNYrLJUskvUkzNsXl" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">police department Facebook page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In it, he acknowledged granting a FOIA request to release his department’s records in Blanchard’s case and argued, point by point, why Blanchard’s case should be tried.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe a jury of Chesterfield County residents deserves to weigh in on the matter of criminal culpability,” Katz wrote. “The decision to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">nolle prosse</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> [sic] this case has made such a deliberation impossible … but I want to be clear; this is NOT due to a lack of evidence or a substandard investigation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cops and prosecutors work closely together and sometimes disagree. In nearly 40 years as a journalist and six as a PR guy, I’ve never seen such a sensational public imbroglio between the leaders of two essential parts of the criminal justice system, as every fan of the long-running “Law &amp; Order” TV series can</span><a href="https://youtu.be/lMalvNeJFLk" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">recite by heart</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Katz’s fusillade, Davenport fired back. Sort of.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a mid-January statement, she </span><a href="https://acrobat.adobe.com/link/track?uri=urn%3Aaaid%3Ascds%3AUS%3A7e80d859-7330-3fbc-8dd0-d68d5069b25e&amp;viewer%21megaVerb=group-discover" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">called out Anderson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, saying her office “takes great exception” to his efforts to politicize the case. She said assertions that Blanchard’s expungement petition was a bid to “silence any political opponent [of her office] from using published police records is unwarranted and without merit.” What the statement didn’t include was any elaboration that would help the public understand where and why the case against Blanchard, at that time, fell short.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The statement further said that “moral outrage is no substitute for evidence, and this office stands by its decision.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It did, too. For six more days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, Davenport announced that new evidence had persuaded her to recommend reinstating the case against Blanchard. She also said she would step aside and entrust the matter to a yet-unnamed special prosecutor. Because Davenport chose to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">nolle prosequi</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the case without prejudice, she had the option of resuming the prosecution without breaching Blanchard’s Fifth Amendment double jeopardy protections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As one might by now imagine, there was no information about the nature of the new evidence that put the prosecution back on track from Davenport’s brief remarks, all read from written text without taking any press questions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This column is not a commentary on the rightness or wrongness of whether Blanchard should stand trial. I have not seen all the evidence in this case, and even if I had, I am not a lawyer and am unqualified to determine whether it meets legal and ethical standards for proceeding to trial.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s about the persistent, airy refusals to provide better, more relevant answers and explanations that help ordinary people understand this sensational saga while respecting the legal protections and confidentialities of both the government and the accused.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are communications professionals out there who advise and shepherd attorneys and public officials through the media maze. I’ve done it myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Davenport was not without opportunities to provide a helpful, cogent explanation. For days, journalists invited her to do just that in on-the-record interviews, and I was one of them. (My offer still stands, by the way.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Davenport’s an accomplished prosecutor whose reserve and reticence in this volatile case does her a disservice. The lurching, on/off/on-again approach to a case involving alleged efforts to victimize a minor not only hasn’t quelled the tempest, but has aggravated it in the court of public opinion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She’s left a door open for Republicans who might challenge her for the nomination. Appearing unsteady in the handling of Blanchard’s case also gives oxygen to the malignant foolishness advanced by conspiracists who claim a cabal of pedophiles controls major public and private institutions of national power.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More broadly, it feeds the cynical notion that justice needn’t apply to favored people in powerful positions, only to the poor and powerless – a notion that’s poisonous to the rule of law and the free civil society it sustains.</span></p>

Parker Michels-Boyce for The Virginia Mercury</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A federal class-action suit has been filed against the Virginia Department of Education and Fairfax County School Board claiming they are violating the rights of disabled students under the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plaintiffs in the case — the parents of an anonymous Fairfax County student and their nonprofit, Hear Our Voices, an organization focused on supporting disabled and special needs students — argue that VDOE and the Fairfax school board “have actively cultivated an unfair and biased” hearing system to oversee challenges to local decisions about disabled students. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The parents claim that state hearing officers, who are responsible for holding impartial hearings to resolve disagreements over issues related to special education services, have ruled disproportionately against parents for two decades. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between 2010 and 2021, Virginia parents who initiated a due process hearing “received a favorable hearing” in only 13 of 847 cases, the lawsuit says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Moreover, during the last twenty years approximately two thirds of the hearing officers have never ruled in favor of parents, not even once,” the plaintiffs wrote. “Even worse, in Northern Virginia, 83% of hearing officers never once ruled in favor of parents over the eleven-plus years from 2010 to July 2021.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The low success rate for parental challenges in Virginia “is a glaring outlier compared to other states,” where studies have found rulings in favor of parents hovering around 30%, the lawsuit says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charles Pyle, a spokesperson with the Virginia Department of Education, said in an email that the department does not comment on pending litigation, but is “committed to ensuring that students with disabilities receive all services and supports that they are entitled to under federal and state law.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fairfax County Public Schools did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trevor Chaplick, the father of the Fairfax student, said the lawsuit was brought forward to reveal the “deeply troubling ruling record” of Virginia’s hearing officers against parents of disabled children.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The parents of disabled and special needs children deserve a better fate from the Virginia public school system,&#8221; said Chaplick in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chaplicks allege that the Department of Education developed a roster of “school-friendly” hearing officers, allowed local education agencies to communicate improperly with hearing officers, hired officers who were biased due to financial interests and declined to certify new officers for more than a decade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Civil Rights Clinic of Georgetown Law School, the law firm of Susman Godfrey, LLP, and Merritt Law, PLLC, are representing the family. The case is being heard in the Alexandria Division of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Children with disabilities and their families deserve &#8216;a life like yours,'&#8221; said Aderson Francois, director for the Georgetown Civil Rights Clinic, in a statement. &#8220;This lawsuit is the first step in making sure that the commonwealth of Virginia provides these children with an education that meets their needs.&#8221;</span></p>

(Kennedy Library)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, a court in Virginia Beach was asked to find two books depicting sexual activity obscene and ban their sale at a Barnes &amp; Noble store to people younger than age 18.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The</span> <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/08/30/judge-throws-out-obscenity-case-attempting-to-restrict-sales-of-books-in-virginia-beach/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">court declined</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, largely sidestepping the question of whether the content was legally obscene and instead deconstructing the anachronistic state obscenity law dating to 1950 under which the complaint was brought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be clear, this was litigation undertaken with an eye toward election year politics. It was filed by Del. Tim Anderson, a conservative lawyer, on behalf of fellow Republican Tommy Altman. At the time of the filing, Altman was running in the GOP 2nd Congressional District primary, attempting to run to the right of state Sen. Jennifer Kiggans, the eventual nominee.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The complaint sought to have the court declare “Gender Queer” and “A Court of Mist and Fury” obscene and ban their sale to minors unless they had the consent of their parents. Had the court ruled in Altman’s favor, any subsequent sale of either book or even the lending of them from one person to another anywhere in the commonwealth could have subjected the seller or lender to criminal penalties,</span> <a href="https://www.aclu.org/cases/virginia-obscenity-proceedings-against-two-books" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">contends the ACLU</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gender Queer” may ring a bell. Maia Kobabe’s graphic novel memoir was published in a format similar to a comic book with illustrations depicting sexual contact, masturbation, use of a sex toy and,</span> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/01/15/loudoun-schools-book-removed/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to the Washington Post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an erotic scene of a man and a boy on what appears to be a Grecian urn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The book became the most contested of 2021, based on an </span><a href="https://www.ala.org/advocacy/bbooks/frequentlychallengedbooks/top10" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Library Association survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that tracked 729 challenges to library, school and university materials and services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, it generated raucous debates at school board meetings, notably in Loudoun County but also in other localities, as outraged parents demanded the book’s removal from school libraries. Republican Glenn Youngkin’s successful gubernatorial campaign seized on the issue, and it gained traction, notably in Democratic-voting suburbs, as he championed the rights of students’ parents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a way, Anderson and Altman were piggybacking on Youngkin’s success a year ago with the litigation, claiming that their lawsuit was intended to give parents oversight of what their minor children may purchase. Parental prerogatives make for potent and resonant politics, as former Gov. Terry McAuliffe</span> <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4979586/user-clip-terry-mcauliffe-i-parents-telling-schools-teach" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">learned the hard way</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after a televised debate with Youngkin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But attempting to use a wobbly, antiquated law that trial Judge Pamela Baskervill noted would allow the government to exercise unconstitutional prior restraint against speech or expression is not the way to do it. The retired jurist, presiding for Virginia Beach judges who recused themselves because of the involvement of a lawmaker in a state where legislators appoint judges, also found the law unworkable because it could make criminals of people who sell or even lend books unaware that a judge in a locality hundreds of miles away had ruled the material obscene.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In comments to journalists after Tuesday’s hearing, Anderson and Altman pondered the prospect of appealing the ruling to the Virginia Court of Appeals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In support of the intent, the men note the existence of age-based restrictions such as those that apply to movie theater admission and assert that similar systems should apply to books. Anderson said he is considering legislation for next winter’s General Assembly session that would establish such a system in state law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Movie ratings, however, are not imposed by law. They are voluntary, a regimen put in place in 1968 by the Motion Picture Association of America that assesses the appropriateness of films for children and teens and designates them accordingly on a scale from G, for all audiences, to NC-17, forbidden to all under 17. Nobody risks arrest, a day in court or jail time if a 16-year-old watches an NC-17 flick.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But even arguing in 2022 over archaic constructs from the final third of the previous century is a fool’s errand – a doomed finger-in-the-dike approach to holding back oceans of digital content that children are far more adept at accessing than their parents. And much of what dwells online is more harmful than any book ever placed on the shelves of a library or bookstore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s also mystifying why efforts to restrain expression focus so obsessively on sexuality, especially LGBTQ issues, with far less regard for mind-warping, gratuitous violence including interactive, immersive bloodlust fantasies and how-to kits for building bombs and firearms. A creative kid with a credit card number can access a gambling portal and squander untold sums in seconds. All of those arguably carry more potential for ruin than words or illustrations that explore one’s sexual awakening.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure, there are safeguards intended to deter children from abusing online venues they have no business visiting, and some of them have real teeth, but any kid worth his username can easily defeat them if left to his or her own devices absent parental supervision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ah! There’s that word again that Anderson, Altman, Youngkin and other Republicans have leveraged politically with varying degrees of success: “parental.” And credit them: they’ve rightly underscored for the political world how essential and difficult parenting is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both of my sons are grown and have long since ventured out on their own. The eldest has a child, and I worry about the world in which he and my daughter-in-law must raise him. The job that they have is much tougher than it was when my sons were children, with many of today’s threats unfathomable then. But sexual content – some of it explicit, even obscene – isn’t among those threats; it was around even before my long-ago childhood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfair as it may seem, those heightened risks and the hard work of neutralizing or minimizing them resides first with parents. But it’s also incumbent on society and our communities to better aid and empower them. The most effective solutions are the least expensive and intrusive, and they needn’t involve government – three virtues that should gladden any conservative’s heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communities owe it to young families to police themselves for situations that compromise the safety of children and call out habitually bad actors. Neighborhoods – and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">neighbors</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – owe it to them by being connected, mindful and watchful for one another and all the children in their midst.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those concepts work, or at least they did in a simpler, less riven America. The term “it takes a village” was around for ages before Hillary Clinton appropriated it as the title for her 1996 book. The “village” approach accomplished far more than the heavy hand of government ever can.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t know if villages of that sort are possible in the collection of quarrelsome tribes that our culture has devolved into over the past decade or so. That’s a shame because it leaves only inflexible legislation, exorbitant appropriations and still more divisive litigation as a sorry substitute.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as poor an option as legislation and litigation are, those are easier for guys like Anderson to tout on 2023 re-election campaign materials than a genuine – even quixotic – appeal to the common good and the better angels of our nature.</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electricity rates for Appalachian Power Company customers are poised to go up after the Supreme Court of Virginia reversed part of a decision by state regulators that was key to keeping the utility’s rates unchanged. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Customers can expect a rate increase, but the amount and timing are undetermined at this time,” said Appalachian Power spokeswoman Teresa Hall in an email. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court found that the State Corporation Commission, the body that oversees Virginia’s electric utilities, didn’t have the authority last year to decide whether it was reasonable for Appalachian Power to include </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/08/17/appalachian-power-seeks-rate-bump-decried-by-the-attorney-generals-office-as-unconscionable/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">costs linked to the closure of several coal-fired plants in its accounting of expenses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between 2017 and 2019. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plants were retired in 2015. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its Thursday ruling, the court said that amendments to state law passed in 2013 and through the 2018 Grid Transformation and Security Act “took away any such regulatory discretion” by the State Corporation Commission.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those amendments “changed, not clarified, existing law by expressly limiting the commission’s broad scope of regulatory discretion,” Justice D. Arthur Kelsey wrote in the majority opinion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not all justices agreed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a dissent, Senior Justice William C. Mims and Justice Cleo E. Powell said the decision “takes away the commission’s ability to protect rate payers from potentially unreasonable accounting practices that will result in rate increases.” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The costs of coal plant retirements</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of the court’s ruling focuses on how Appalachian Power should have treated costs associated with eight coal-fired power plants in its accounting of expenses and revenues between 2017 and 2019. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, Appalachian Power and Dominion Energy are regulated according to a highly complex set of laws that are </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/09/24/as-regulators-consider-a-rate-hike-for-appalachian-power-years-of-legislative-intervention-has-complicated-the-task/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">regularly tweaked and overhauled by lawmakers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the current system of regulation, both undergo “<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/04/09/virginia-explained-whats-a-triennial-review-and-why-should-you-care/" target="_blank">triennial reviews</a>,” during which regulators assess what the utilities earned over the prior three years and determine whether rates should be adjusted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If earnings are below a lower threshold, regulators are required to authorize the company to increase its rates. If they are above an upper threshold, the utility must refund 70% of its excess earnings to customers. (Shareholders keep the rest.) And if the earnings fall within the band in between the lower and upper thresholds, rates continue unchanged. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certain large expenses incurred by the utility can also by law be used to offset excess earnings, reducing the likelihood the company will be forced to provide refunds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 2017-19 review, Appalachian Power asked to include in its expenses $88 million in costs associated with retiring eight coal-fired plants in 2015, two years prior to the review period. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company argued that under a change to state law made by the Grid Transformation and Security Act, it was allowed to recover “costs associated with asset impairments related to early retirement determinations made by the utility” for coal units if those costs were recorded by the utility on its books during the review period. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The impact of allowing the $88 million to count as expenses in the review is significant. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the costs aren’t included — as regulators initially ruled they should not be — the company’s earnings fell within the state-defined range, meaning customer rates would not increase. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But when they are included, the company’s earnings drop below the lower threshold, triggering a mandatory rate increase. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appalachian argued that according to “the plain and unambiguous language of the code,” it was allowed to count those costs as expenses to be recovered during the 2017-19 period. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SCC is “not entitled to second-guess the financial reporting” of the electric utility, company attorney Robert Rolfe told Supreme Court judges in a March hearing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The State Corporation Commission disagreed, arguing that a different part of state code gives them the authority to determine “the reasonableness and prudence of any cost incurred or projected to be incurred, by a utility in connection with the subject of the proceeding.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consequently, the SCC ruled that the costs couldn’t be wholly recovered in the 2017-19 period but should instead be spread out over 10 years. Appalachian Power then appealed the case to the Supreme Court of Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court sided with Appalachian Power. The later amendments to state code “have removed the commission’s discretion” to decide whether such costs could be recovered, the judges found. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Varied reactions</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appalachian spokeswoman Hall said the company “is pleased with the court’s careful consideration of the issues and application of the statutes.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will Cleveland, an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, said the court ruling “confirms the need for comprehensive reform of utility laws to ensure the SCC has the necessary authority to set fair and reasonable rates for customers.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Legislation that handcuffs the commission … almost universally benefits utilities’ profit margins to their customers’ detriment,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Victoria LaCivita, a spokesperson for Attorney General Jason Miyares, said Miyares was “disappointed that the court found the SCC lacked the legal tools needed to ensure that Appalachian Power’s customers pay only what is reasonable when a power plant is retired early.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average monthly bill for a residential customer of Appalachian Power has increased from $115 in 2017 to $132 today, she added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andy Farmer, a spokesperson for the State Corporation Commission, said the commission could not comment on the ruling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The SCC will comply with the Supreme Court’s directive and will issue an order in the near future reopening the proceeding,” he said. </span></p>

(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said Thursday that the U.S. Department of Justice has moved to release the search warrant a federal judge issued earlier this week that allowed federal agents to enter former President Donald Trump’s residence at Mar-a-Lago in Florida.</p>
<p>DOJ, Garland <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2w26ecbq-Q" target="_blank">said</a>, filed a motion in the Southern District of Florida to unseal a search warrant and property receipt, which details items taken. The motion says that Trump, who issued a public statement about the search, and his lawyers should have an opportunity to object to the DOJ proposal.</p>
<p>“The Department filed the motion to make public the warrant and receipt in light of the former president&#8217;s public confirmation of the search, the surrounding circumstances and the substantial public interest in this matter,” Garland said during a brief press conference, declining to take any questions.</p>
<p>Garland’s comments echoed the department’s motion itself, which cited the public interest in the matter and that Trump had already publicized the search. Further secrecy was therefore unneeded, the department said Thursday <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/64872441/18/united-states-v-sealed-search-warrant/" target="_blank">in a four-page brief.</a></p>
<p>Copies of the warrant and the FBI property receipt, Garland said, were given to Trump’s counsel, who was on site during the search.</p>
<p>U.S. Magistrate Judge Bruce E. Reinhart gave Trump’s attorneys until Friday at 3 p.m. eastern time to respond to the government’s motion.</p>
<p>The search of Trump’s property by the FBI has <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/republicans-congress-line-behind-trump-after-he-says-fbi-searched-mar-lago" target="_blank">infuriated many Republican lawmakers, </a>who have criticized federal law enforcement for confiscating the documents as well as Garland for not being more public about the investigation.</p>
<p>https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/youngkin-calls-raid-on-trump-club-a-stunning-move-by-feds/</p>
<p>“The country deserves a thorough and immediate explanation of what led to the events of Monday,” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said in a statement earlier this week. “Attorney General Garland and the Department of Justice should already have provided answers to the American people and must do so immediately.”</p>
<p>Garland said Thursday that he personally approved the decision to seek a search warrant in the matter, and that the Justice Department “does not take such decisions lightly.”</p>
<p>“Where possible it is standard practice to seek less intrusive means as an alternative to a search, and to narrowly scope any search that is undertaken,” he said.</p>
<p>Garland also rebuked the “recent unfounded attacks on the professionalism of the FBI and Justice Department agents and prosecutors.”</p>
<p>Garland declined to provide any additional information or to answer reporters’ questions after giving the four-minute statement, saying “federal law, long-standing department rules and our ethical obligations prevent me from providing further details as to the basis of the search at this time.”</p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Faced with court rulings that say a Trump administration directive doesn’t protect Tyson Foods from liability caused by workers’ deaths due to COVID-19, the food giant is now asking the U.S. Supreme Court to weigh in on the matter.</p>
<p>Arguing that recent court rulings against the company will have “drastic consequences for the next national emergency,” Tyson has told the nation’s high court that private companies “will not be so eager to willingly aid the federal government in a crisis” if those rulings are allowed to stand.</p>
<p>A recent decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which echoed a decision last year by the Eighth Circuit appeals court, found the Trump administration’s March 2020 efforts to keep meatpacking plants open during the pandemic don’t shield the company from lawsuits alleging negligence.</p>
<h4 class="editorialSubhed">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Tyson works to move workers’ lawsuits to federal court</h4>

	</h4>
<p>Those and other court decisions have paved the way for workers’ lawsuits against Tyson to be heard by state courts in Iowa, Texas and elsewhere, despite the company’s efforts to move the cases to federal court.</p>
<p>Court filings suggest that Tyson believes its argument that it was only doing business under the direction of the federal government will prove to be a more effective defense in federal court than in state court.</p>
<p>Trump’s March 2020 directive stated the Secretary of Agriculture had to “take all appropriate action” to ensure that the nation’s meat and poultry processors continued operations during the pandemic, but the companies had to operate in a manner that was consistent with guidance offered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The directive stopped short of ordering the plants to remain open.</p>
<p>Tyson has since been hit with what it calls “a wave of litigation from former employees or representatives of former employees alleging that they contracted COVID-19 because Tyson kept its plants operating in unsafe conditions.”</p>
<p>In Virginia, poultry plants on the Eastern Shore and in the Shenandoah Valley became <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/08/31/virginia-officials-backed-off-push-to-close-shore-poultry-plants-for-two-weeks-to-fight-pandemic/" target="_blank">hotspots for COVID-19 outbreaks</a> in the early months of the pandemic, giving rise to more than 1,200 cases and 10 deaths in largely minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged communities. Plantwide testing at Tyson&#8217;s Temperanceville facility in Accomack County in May 2020 detected COVID-19 in roughly one-fifth of almost 1,300 employees screened.</p>
<p>Despite the outbreaks and Tyson&#8217;s voluntary release of testing data that May, Virginia officials consistently refused to release case counts for individual meatpacking facilities throughout the pandemic, citing state code provisions aimed at protecting the anonymity of individual patients. In emails obtained by the Virginia Mercury through a Freedom of Information Act request, state officials discussed <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/08/31/virginia-officials-backed-off-push-to-close-shore-poultry-plants-for-two-weeks-to-fight-pandemic/" target="_blank">companies&#8217; insistence &#8220;that plants not be identified publicly</a> as having outbreak(s)&#8221; and that facility-wide test results not be shared.</p>
<p>In the current court filings, Tyson’s stance is that since the plants continued to operate “at the direction of federal officers at the highest levels,” the federal courts must resolve any claims related to injuries and deaths that stemmed from that action.</p>
<p>In May, Tyson filed with the U.S. Supreme Court a petition seeking an extension of time in which it could file a petition for a writ of certiorari in a case involving a deceased Waterloo plant worker, Sedika Buljic. <a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2021/11/05/tyson-faces-new-legal-challenges-over-its-pandemic-response/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In that case</a>, the appeals court for the Eighth Circuit had affirmed a decision sending the matter to state court, stating the company was not “acting under” a federal officer in keeping its plants operating.</p>
<h4 class="editorialSubhed">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Tyson argues rulings jeopardize future cooperation in a crisis</h4>

	</h4>
<p>In its filings with the U.S. Supreme Court, Tyson now argues it was merely following “the federal government’s instructions to help avert an impending national food shortage,” adding that the Eighth Circuit’s ruling “will have drastic consequences for the next national emergency.”</p>
<p>Tyson says private companies “will not be so eager to willingly aid the federal government in a crisis” if they first must obtain a formal command to remain open and thus be entitled to a federal forum in which to defend any actions they took at the behest of the federal government.</p>
<p>On Friday, the company filed its writ with the court, according to <a href="https://pro.bloomberglaw.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg Law</a>, although that filing has yet to be posted to the court’s official website.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court receives more than 7,000 petitions for a writ of certiorari each term, but agrees to hear arguments in roughly 80 cases, according to the court.</p>
<p>Just last week, three Iowa lawsuits against Tyson were moved from state court to federal court. The plaintiffs are the families of Victor Barahona Rivera, who died on June 15, 2020 after working at Tyson for 27 years; Ken Jones, a 12-year Tyson employee who died on June 3, 2020; and Juan Jauregui Samudio, a five-year employee of Tyson who died on June 10, 2020.</p>
<p>The families allege Tyson was fully aware of the risks associated with COVID-19, but continued to expose workers to contamination by forcing them to work within six feet of one another without proper barriers between them or adequate personal protection equipment. They also claim Tyson imposed inadequate disinfecting and sanitizing procedures and failed to implement COVID-19 testing and screening.</p>
<p>Each of the three lawsuits names plant manager Rick Retzlaff, plant superintendent Nathan Carnine, plant safety manager Jorge Sandoval and area safety manager Laurie Garcia as defendants.</p>
<p>Tyson denies the allegations. According to court records, the company has denied the families’ claims for workers’ compensation benefits.</p>

The court overturned the State of New York’s right to <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-843_7j80.pdf" target="_blank">restrict who can carry concealed, loaded guns in public</a> and then struck down women’s <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/06/24/u-s-supreme-court-overturns-right-to-abortion-in-landmark-decision/" target="_blank">constitutional right to abortion</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On June 30, they limited the EPA’s ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions—when the world needs to reduce them drastically. In its decision on </span><a href="https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/supreme-court-epa-west-virginia-ruling-delay-us-climate-change-action?gclid=Cj0KCQjwz96WBhC8ARIsAATR251wxSiKXvToEdHPV1uSkxUhmJjasgW9MpP6_EwLC13hlI50kG6ROI4aAvVnEALw_wcB" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">West Virginia v. EPA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">the conservative court killed a rule that was already dead — Obama’s 2015 Clean Power Plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So why did the Supreme Court even look at the case? I don’t know. And my lawyer friends don’t understand either.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Long before this case, the court established that greenhouse gases, namely carbon dioxide, are air pollutants and that burning fossil fuels to generate electricity is a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, the Clean Air Act of 1970 gave the EPA broad authority to regulate air pollution. All this is established law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At issue with the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">West Virginia v. EPA</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> case is the practice of “shifting” electricity generation from fossil fuel sources to clean energy sources such as solar and wind power. The court said the EPA could not require electric utilities to do this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Virginia Clean Economy Act is transitioning the state to using 100 percent clean energy by 2050. We’re not alone. Just about every nation on the planet is shifting electricity generation from fossil fuels to clean energy sources. The poorest countries, Burundi and Somalia, are shifting away from fossil fuel energy generation; a small island in the Arctic, Grimsey, is making this shift—even the king of fossil fuels, the state of Texas, is a<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/18/texas-led-the-country-in-new-renewable-energy-projects-last-year.html" target="_blank"> major generator of renewable energy</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Most people agree, we must make the shift to combat the effects of climate change. </span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia’s Clean Energy Transition: A special series by the Virginia Mercury&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2020/11/30/virginias-clean-energy-transition-a-special-series-by-the-virginia-mercury/embed/#?secret=Q17NEjrCwS#?secret=OgOLcg5AID" data-secret="OgOLcg5AID" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But West Virginia, which, along with its fellow petitioner, the North American Coal Corporation, and other fossil-fuel burning entities, sued the EPA claiming it had overstepped its authority in regulating the shifting of electricity generation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The June 30 6–3 opinion creates confusion. The court struck down Obama’s 2015 pollution-reducing Clean Power Plan, which a federal circuit court</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">had already struck down in 2016 and which the Biden administration had said it would not enforce. The Trump administration’s EPA, under the leadership of Scott Pruitt and Andrew Wheeler (now director of Virginia’s new Office of Regulatory Management) repealed the Clean Power Plan and replaced it with their pollution-enabling Affordable Clean Energy rule. So, the court had no reason to even consider the Clean Power Plan other than to provide an advisory opinion, something courts never do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Environmentalists sued the EPA for repealing the Clean Power Plan and the new rule allowing more pollution. The Court of Appeals in D.C. struck down both rules and remanded them back to the Biden administration&#8217;s</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">EPA to come up with a new rule to combat climate change. The Biden administration has not yet issued a new rule.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Again, why even take up the case? The EPA has not issued a new rule—there’s nothing to rule on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In its bizarre ruling, the Supreme Court relied on the court’s “major questions doctrine.” What the heck is that? I thought. The climate crisis is not a major question. There’s no question. We know it’s here, affecting millions of people and costing billions of dollars. We also know that Congress gave EPA broad authority to protect us from air pollution and its harmful effects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is crystal clear that we have a greenhouse gas emission problem, and it is crystal clear that we need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by shifting away from burning fossil fuels for electric power. It’s crystal clear that Congress gave the EPA authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the conservative court thought Congress’s language for the EPA regulating greenhouse gases was “lurking” in the Clean Air Act. I beg to differ. The Clean Air Act states in Section 111 that the EPA “shall prescribe regulations which shall establish a procedure under which each state shall submit to the [EPA] a plan which (A) establishes standards of performance for any existing source for any air pollutant.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is not “gap filler” language, as the court’s majority wrote. Instead, by using the word “shall” twice, it gave the EPA explicit authority to regulate greenhouse gases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Justice Elena Kagan stated in her dissent that, with this new ruling, “the court appoints itself — instead of Congress or the expert agency—the decision-maker on climate policy. I cannot think of many things more frightening.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While the court’s decision has grabbed headlines, let’s not lose sight of what’s happening at the state level. Virginia must remain steadfast in its commitment to transitioning to clean energy sources by 2050. Virginia should also stay part of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative — the cap-and-trade program that is reducing carbon emissions while funding energy efficiency and flood protection programs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both efforts face the threat of rollbacks here, yet both are critical for Virginia to do its part in the face of climate change and the latest challenges to the EPA. </span></p>

Wade decision that established a constitutional right to an abortion. The decision doing just that came in June. (States Newsroom D.C. Bureau)</p><p><strong>By James Hudnut-Beumler and James P. Byrd, <em>Vanderbilt Divinity School</em></strong></p>
<p>At the close of its recent term the Supreme Court ruled on the cases of <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-1088_dbfi.pdf" target="_blank">Carson v. Makin</a> and <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/21-418_i425.pdf" target="_blank">Kennedy v. Bremerton School District</a>, rekindling controversy over one of the most enduring issues in American history: religious liberty. Another of this term’s blockbuster decisions, <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/dobbs-v-jackson-womens-health-organization/" target="_blank">Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization</a>, underlines the fact that religious beliefs and actions in the public realm matter. Whether the issue concerns religion and education, prayer or reproduction, Americans feel strongly about their religious liberties.</p>
<p>The Carson case came from Maine, where areas with too few students to justify a public high school used public money to pay private schools to educate their students. Under its policy, Maine only allowed nonsectarian private schools or nearby public school districts to receive the funds. Parents who wished to send their students to religious schools argued that the policy discriminated based on religion. The court’s majority agreed, ruling that denying state support to students attending religious schools because their schools were religious violated the First Amendment’s protections on religious freedom.</p>
<p>In the Kennedy case, the court chipped away at decades of rulings that deemed school employees leading prayer an unlawful establishment of religion because it entangled church and state in the act. In the court’s revised view, coach Joseph Kennedy possessed a First Amendment right to <a href="https://theconversation.com/supreme-court-to-decide-whether-a-public-school-football-coach-can-pray-on-the-field-177980" target="_blank">privately pray</a> after football games on the 50-yard line, permissible even if students joined him in praying.</p>
<p>Religious liberty is one of the earliest civic values associated with the United States, yet defining and defending it has proved a centuries-long process. Both sides of the courts’ divided opinions claimed to be speaking for religious liberty. This is possible because <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/" target="_blank">religious liberty under the Constitution</a> contains both a right to freely exercise religion and a right not to be coerced via the state into accepting someone else’s religious practices.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://divinity.vanderbilt.edu/people/bio/jim-hudnut-beumler" target="_blank">historians</a> of <a href="https://divinity.vanderbilt.edu/people/bio/jimmy-byrd" target="_blank">American religious history</a> and authors of a recent book, “<a href="https://www.wjkbooks.com/Products/0664264662/the-story-of-religion-in-america.aspx" target="_blank">The Story of Religion in America</a>,” we know that both sides of religious liberty – freedom to exercise one’s own religion and freedom from being forced to support other people’s religions – have a long and important past.</p>
<h2><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The founders on religious freedom</h4>

	</strong></h2>
<p>The Constitution’s First Amendment, adopted in 1791, defended the free exercise of religion and prohibited the founding of a national church. The leading founders on religious liberty and church-state issues were two Virginians, <a href="https://virginiahistory.org/learn/thomas-jefferson-and-virginia-statute-religious-freedom" target="_blank">Thomas Jefferson</a> and James Madison.</p>
<p>The problem with religious beliefs, <a href="https://www.montpelier.org/learn/religious-freedom" target="_blank">Madison</a> believed, was that most often people could not agree on them. Governments, he argued, therefore had no business supporting religion.</p>
<p>Religion could unite people, but most often it did the opposite, dividing people into opposing sides, each believing their side was sacred. In Madison’s view, therefore, religious differences made it harder to run a government for the <a href="https://thefederalistpapers.org/founders/madison/james-madison-religion-and-government-exist-in-greater-purity-the-less-they-are-mixed-together" target="_blank">common good</a>.</p>
<h2>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Early American religious liberty</h4>

	</h2>
<p>Over 150 years before religious liberty entered the Constitution, however, it lived in the mind and conduct of Roger Williams, a Puritan educated at the University of <a href="https://historycambridge.org/research/cambridge-the-focal-point-of-puritan-life-part-one/" target="_blank">Cambridge</a>, who challenged Puritan views on religious liberty and the relationship between church and state.</p>
<p>No sooner had Williams landed in New England than he began challenging Puritan authorities, saying that civil courts should not enforce religious belief and that the right to worship (or not) according to one’s own conscience was fundamental. He noted that the <a href="http://www.findingrogerwilliams.com/essays/native-americans" target="_blank">American Indians</a>, to whom his fellow Christians considered themselves superior, were often better people than the English.</p>
<p>These beliefs terrified and infuriated Puritan leaders, who promptly <a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/rhode-island-founder-banished-from-massachusetts" target="_blank">banished radical Roger</a> from the Massachusetts Bay Colony. He later resurfaced in what became the colony of Rhode Island, where he helped to start a new settlement called Providence, which, unlike Puritan-controlled Massachusetts Bay, would <a href="https://constitution.org/2-Authors/bcp/religlib.htm" target="_blank">allow religious liberty</a> for all who lived there.</p>
<p>Although the Puritans thought Williams’ ideas were <a href="https://www.massmoments.org/moment-details/roger-williams-banished.html" target="_blank">dangerous</a>, Williams believed the greatest danger was in government trying to <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/god-government-and-roger-williams-big-idea-6291280/" target="_blank">legislate religion</a>. He only had to point to the fact that more blood had been shed over religion than just about any issue, with Protestants fighting Catholics, <a href="https://faculty.etsu.edu/history/documents/rogerwilliams.htm" target="_blank">Christians fighting Muslims</a>, and European empires trying to forcibly convert Indigenous Americans in <a href="https://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/book/lookupid?key=ha001685353" target="_blank">so-called “missions</a>.”</p>

<p>Yet state-sponsored religion died hard. Massachusetts was the last state to abandon the establishment of a church, in 1833. Even after all the states had abandoned their tax-supported <a href="https://mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/801/established-churches-in-early-america" target="_blank">“official” denominations</a>, states continued to police religious and moral conduct.</p>
<p>Moreover, the states themselves often forced Christianity, and particularly <a href="https://oxfordre.com/americanhistory/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199329175.001.0001/acrefore-9780199329175-e-59" target="_blank">Protestantism</a>, onto the public in school and public policy. This continued until the First Amendment’s prohibitions on government religion was extended to the states via the 14th Amendment. Two Supreme Court cases involving Jehovah’s Witnesses’ refusing to salute the flag – Minersville School District v. Gobitis (1940) and <a href="https://mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/227/west-virginia-state-board-of-education-v-barnette" target="_blank">West Virginia v. Barnette</a> (1943) – were important in this. In other words, the right to religious liberty, in the sense of being allowed to refrain from an activity due to one’s religious convictions, is less than a long lifetime old.</p>
<p>Up through the Vietnam War, if a man applied to be a conscientious objector, draft boards examined whether he came from a denomination that objected to all participation in war – Mennonites or Quakers, for example. Objection to a particular war, or assertion of one’s own <a href="https://mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/241/welsh-v-unitedIn%20subsequent%20decades%20in%20subsequent%20decadesin%20subsequent%20decades-states" target="_blank">sincerely held beliefs</a>, did not get one off the hook for draft induction.</p>
<p>This orientation changed beginning with the Supreme Court’s recognition of individual conscience in two cases: <a href="https://mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/241/welsh-v-united-states" target="_blank">Welsh v. United States</a> (1970) and <a href="https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/234/gillette-v-united-states" target="_blank">Gillette v. United States</a> (1971). The rulings came too late to keep Muhammad Ali from going to jail when he resisted the draft in 1967. But they relocated the locus of conscience to individuals, provided their objections were sincerely held.</p>
<h2>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Individual consciences in collective conflict</h4>

	</h2>
<p>In subsequent decades American religious life has itself become more centered on individuals and less on the teachings of religious traditions. Courts have likewise focused more on particular people’s definitions of their own sincerely held beliefs. These shifts are both very American – as illustrated in the example of Roger Williams – and susceptible to <a href="https://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/responses/the-unconscionable-division-of-conscience-and-religious-freedom" target="_blank">greater social division</a> because citizens’ and groups’ beliefs may take them in opposite directions.</p>
<p>Religious liberty in America is perpetually a work in progress. The free exercise and establishment clauses of the First Amendment live in perpetual tension – two goods that must be balanced. The Supreme Court’s recent religious liberty rulings are fully a part of America’s long struggle to define religious freedom and only the most recent attempt to achieve a balance between goods.</p>

(Ariana Figueroa/States Newsroom)</p><p>WASHINGTON — A group of U.S. House Democrats Monday called for the passage of legislation that would add four justices to the Supreme Court, following the <a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2022/06/24/u-s-supreme-court-overturns-right-to-abortion-in-landmark-decision/" target="_blank">overturning</a> of the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that provided the constitutional right to abortion.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s an ultra-right-wing Republican Supreme Court,” Rep. Hank Johnson of Georgia said during a press conference outside the Capitol. “It is a Supreme Court where basic freedoms are under assault.”</p>
<p>The bill, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/117/bills/hr2584/BILLS-117hr2584ih.pdf" target="_blank">H.R. 2584</a>, introduced by Johnson, would expand the court from nine to 13 seats. The court’s current ideological makeup is six to three in favor of conservative-leaning justices.</p>
<p>Johnson’s legislation has 58 co-sponsors, all Democrats. They include <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2584/cosponsors?q=%7B%22cosponsor-state%22%3A%22Virginia%22%7D" target="_blank">two Virginia congressmen:</a> U.S. Reps. Don Beyer, D-Alexandria, and Gerry Connolly, D-Fairfax. However, if passed by the House, the measure would be dead on arrival in the 50-50 Senate, where any bill needs to meet a 60-vote threshold to advance.</p>
<p>Another sticking point is the Biden administration has voiced its opposition to expanding the court. <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/biden-support-expanding-supreme-court-white-house/story?id=85703773" target="_blank">During a foreign trip in June, </a>​​White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters that President Joe Biden “does not agree with” expanding the court.</p>
<p>And House Speaker Nancy Pelosi <a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2021/04/15/u-s-rep-hank-johnson-leads-dems-supreme-court-expansion-proposal/" target="_blank">last year</a> said she has no intentions of advancing the measure to the House floor.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/1141/cosponsors" target="_blank">Similar legislation</a> to expand the court introduced by Sen. Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, has just two co-sponsors — Elizabeth Warren, also of Massachusetts, and Tina Smith of Minnesota.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Aging out</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Johnson argued that Congress cannot wait for the conservative justices to age out of the Supreme Court. The youngest is Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who is 50, and the oldest is Justice Clarence Thomas, who is 74.</p>
<p>“We don&#8217;t have a generation to wait to reform the court,” Johnson said.</p>
<p>Congress has expanded and shrunk the court <a href="https://harvardlpr.com/2019/05/06/the-supreme-court-has-been-expanded-many-times-before-here-are-four-ways-to-do-it-today/" target="_blank">seven times throughout its existence.  </a></p>
<p>Joining House Democrats were Markey and leaders from progressive organizations such as Take Back the Court Action Fund, Stand Up America, League of Conservation Voters, Demand Justice, Center for Popular Democracy Action and the National Center for Lesbian Rights, among others.</p>
<p>The renewed call to expand the Supreme Court comes after conservative justices issued several controversial decisions this year. They ranged from weakening the separation of church and state to limiting the EPA’s ability to tackle climate change to dismantling gun control laws passed by states.</p>
<p>That was in addition to the reversal of Roe v. Wade. So far, eight states have <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/overview-abortion-laws" target="_blank">banned</a> access to abortions.</p>
<p>Watson Coleman said the current ideological makeup of the court is a threat and that other rights such as same-sex intimacy, same-sex marriage and privacy when it comes to birth control could easily be undone.</p>
<p>Justice Thomas wrote his own concurring opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, arguing that since the court has overturned the constitutional right to an abortion in that case, which was grounded in the 14th Amendment and the due process clause, <a href="https://tennesseelookout.com/2022/06/24/updated-u-s-supreme-court-overturns-right-to-abortion-in-landmark-decision/" target="_blank">other cases that have been rooted </a>in the same right to privacy could all be reconsidered.</p>
<p>“They will come for our right of contraception, they will come for our right for who to love,” Watson Coleman said of Thomas’ concurring opinion.</p>
<p>Levin said this is the first time the Supreme Court has rolled back a constitutional right, especially a “right that the people of this country have had for over 50 years.”</p>
<p>“America is supposed to be a secular democracy, not a theocracy,” Levin said, adding that the conservative justices were imposing their personal beliefs on Americans.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — Advocates told Congress on Thursday that a U.S. Supreme Court decision overturning a landmark abortion rights case is likely only the beginning, and could be followed by similar action by the high court on same-sex marriage, contraception and more.</p>

<p>Witnesses at a U.S. House Judiciary Committee advised that to prevent that from happening, Congress should enshrine in law the rights the Supreme Court has ruled Americans are guaranteed as part of <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/amendment-14/section-1/#:~:text=No%20State%20shall%20make%20or,equal%20protection%20of%20the%20laws." target="_blank">the 14th Amendment’s liberty clause. </a></p>
<p>Justice Clarence Thomas, writing in June on the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf" target="_blank">abortion rights case,</a> said the court should reconsider three other cases — those that allow Americans to determine if and how they use contraception, legalize same-sex marriage and prevent the government from interfering in private consensual adult sexual relationships.</p>
<p>Those cases — Griswold v. Connecticut, Obergefell v. Hodges and Lawrence v. Texas, respectively — all rely on the same substantive due process precedents that justices<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-overturns-right-abortion-landmark-decision-16" target="_blank"> ruled last month</a> no longer protect the right to terminate a pregnancy, in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization.</p>
<p>Melissa Murray, law processor and faculty director of the Birnbaum Women&#8217;s Leadership Network at New York University School of Law, told the House Judiciary Committee that while no other justices joined Thomas’ opinion, “it would be a mistake to dismiss” him calling for those three cases to be reconsidered.</p>
<p>“Like many of his past opinions advocating for the destruction of fundamental liberty and privacy rights, Justice Thomas is signaling that the goalpost has moved,” Murray testified.</p>
<p>But the current Supreme Court, or a future court with a similar majority of conservative justices, might not focus solely on undoing those three cases, Murray told the committee.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court opinions in the same lineage as two prior abortion rulings, Murray said, began “in 1923 with <a href="https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/786/meyer-v-nebraska" target="_blank">Meyer v. Nebraska </a>recognition of the right of parental autonomy” and go through the 2015 case that legalized same-sex marriage.</p>
<p>The right to interracial marriage, decided by the Supreme Court in the <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/388/1/" target="_blank">Loving v. Virginia case</a> in 1967, also exists in that line of reasoning.</p>
<p>Georgia Democratic Rep. Hank Johnson asked Murray why Thomas, “would exclude court review of that due process right.” Thomas is in an interracial marriage, and other critics have also asked why he did not cite the case in his opinion.</p>
<p>Murray said she was “confused” about why that case wasn’t included in “Justice Thomas’ long laundry list of rights to be overturned, but it surely would be there.”</p>
<p>“Could it be that he himself enjoys that right conferred under Loving?” Johnson asked.</p>
<p>“It would not be the first time someone offered freedom for me, but not for thee,” Murray responded.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Same-sex marriage plaintiff</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Jim Obergefell, the plaintiff in the Obergefell v. Hodges case that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide in June 2015, urged the panel to pass legislation through Congress to prevent the court from undoing that right as well as others.</p>
<p>He told the story of how when his husband, John Arthur, was dying of ALS, or Lou Gehrig&#8217;s disease, nine years ago, hospital staff in Ohio didn’t have to recognize their marriage from Maryland.</p>
<p>“Make no mistake, Ohio harmed us,” he said. “Even with our marriage license in hand, doctors, hospitals and others could … bar me from John’s room, from making decisions on his behalf.”</p>
<p>“John was nearing the end of his life and they had the right to ignore a dying man’s most important relationship, to ignore any request or decision John and I made as husbands. Is that moral? Is that just? Is that right?,” Obergefell said.</p>
<p>After his husband died, Obergefell testified, they continued to be unequal, as Ohio wouldn’t put his name as the surviving spouse on Arthur’s death certificate.</p>
<p>Sarah Warbelow, legal director for the Human Rights Campaign, told the panel the Supreme Court’s<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf" target="_blank"> majority opinion</a> on abortion, drafted by Justice Samuel Alito, is “terrifying.”</p>
<p>“It suggests that the court does not have respect for the decisions that it has made, nor for advancing the rights of the people of the United States,” she said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Defense of Marriage Act</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Judiciary panel Chair Jerry Nadler, a New York Democrat, asked witnesses if Congress should repeal the Defense of Marriage Act, a 1996<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/104th-congress/house-bill/3396" target="_blank"> law</a> that said states aren’t required to recognize a same-sex couple’s marriage from a state where those unions are legal.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court struck down section three of the law, which said the federal government didn’t need to recognize those marriages for the purpose of federal benefits, such as Social Security or veterans’ benefits. That case didn’t legalize same-sex marriages, however.</p>
<p>Nadler noted he has introduced legislation to undo the law, sometimes referred to as DOMA.</p>
<p>Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Washington state Democrat, said during the hearing that as a woman of color who has had an abortion, is in an interracial marriage and has a transgender daughter, the Supreme Court&#8217;s ruling on abortion and the possibility of a revocation of more constitutional rights &#8220;is a direct threat to me, my loved ones and most importantly to millions of people across this country who face one or more of these many threats.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jayapal noted she’s introduced a bill with California Democratic Rep. Mike Thompson to ensure access to contraception.</p>
<p>But she asked witnesses to explain how the Supreme Court overturning a fundamental right that two prior courts ruled was enshrined as a constitutional right under the 14th Amendment will affect Americans in the future.</p>
<p>“It very much encourages state legislatures to try to pass laws to undermine and undo these precedents,” Warbelow said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Alito majority opinion</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Ohio GOP Rep. Jim Jordan, ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee, argued it was unlikely the Supreme Court would undo other constitutional rights in future cases, citing Alito’s majority opinion that he wrote for himself, Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.</p>
<p>“Nothing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion,” Alito wrote.</p>
<p>Jordan continued reading from the Alito opinion in the abortion case, which said those five justices held “that Roe and Casey must be overruled. The Constitution makes no reference to abortion, and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision.”</p>
<p>​​Murray, however, said later during the hearing, in response to a question from Missouri Democratic Rep. Cori Bush, that the 14th Amendment — drafted during Reconstruction that followed the Civil War — was primarily concerned with eradicating the &#8220;very things that distinguished slavery from freedom, among them the absence of bodily autonomy and control over procreation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They knew about forced birth as a means of expanding the slave population in the period before the Civil War, so they were responding to this,&#8221; ​​Murray testified. &#8220;They also wanted to correct the injustice of having no family integrity, of lacking control over your children, of being ineligible for civil marriage.&#8221;</p>
<p>The drafters of the amendment, Murray testified, didn&#8217;t explicitly list those rights &#8220;because they were viewed to be captured in that grant of liberty.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alito&#8217;s opinion in the June abortion case says nothing about those elements of the amendment, she continued.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Traveling across state lines</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Jordan also rebuked House Democrats for setting up floor votes Friday on two bills addressing abortion access.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8297?r=1&amp;s=1" target="_blank"> first bill</a>, called the Ensuring Access to Abortion Act of 2022, would ensure patients can travel across state lines to access abortion in the places where it remains legal.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8296?s=1&amp;r=1" target="_blank"> second bill</a>, the Women’s Health Protection Act of 2022, would ensure patients have access to abortions throughout the country.</p>
<p>Nevada Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto tried to pass a similar<a href="https://www.cortezmasto.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Freedom%20to%20Travel%20for%20Health%20Care%20Act%20of%202022.pdf" target="_blank"> travel bill</a> through the U.S. Senate on Thursday as the House Judiciary Committee hearing was ongoing.</p>
<p>Oklahoma GOP Sen. James Lankford objected to her unanimous consent request, blocking the bill from passing.</p>
<p>Cortez Masto argued the legislation is necessary, saying “what legislators are doing across the country to restrict women from traveling is just bluntly unconstitutional.”</p>
<p>Just proposing a bill to ban patients from traveling out-of-state to access abortion, Cortez Masto said, is having a “chilling effect” on health care providers as well as patients.</p>
<p>“In my state, we are already seeing that these proposals are having a chilling effect on my providers, who are worried about offering quality abortion care in the face of potential lawsuits,” she said from the U.S. Senate floor.</p>
<p>“And in Montana, reproductive health clinics are even limiting care to instate residents only,” Cortez Masto continued. “Imagine traveling hundreds of miles for essential health care, only to be turned away for fear of a lawsuit.”</p>
<p>The bill, which did not pass, would have made it “crystal clear” that states cannot prosecute women who travel for abortion, or the health providers operating in states where the procedure remains legal, or anyone who helps a woman travel out of a state that bans or heavily restricts abortion.</p>
<p>Montana Republican Sen. Steve Daines spoke out against the legislation, calling it “radical.”</p>
<p>“Rather than use this opportunity to protect life, very soon the Senate Democrats will try to pass a very extreme abortion bill,” he said.</p>

</p><p>Republicans in Congress were jubilant at the U.S. Supreme Court’s <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-overturns-right-abortion-landmark-decision" target="_blank">ruling</a> overturning decades of precedent to revoke a constitutional right to an abortion, while Democrats were equally despondent about what they called an extremist decision that revoked a long-held right and represented an attack on women’s autonomy.</p>
<p>The party-line reaction hints at how lawmakers will approach abortion as the issue moves away from the court and more directly to the elected branches of government.</p>
<p>Democrats urged that voters remember the ruling when they go to the polls in the November mid-term elections and said they will redouble their attempts to pass legislation protecting the right to an abortion that’s stalled in the evenly divided U.S. Senate.</p>
<p>Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins, who backs abortion rights, said she voted to confirm Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch, and their agreement with the majority 6-3 decision was “inconsistent” with what they said during their hearings and in conversations with her. “The court “abandoned a fifty-year precedent at a time that the country is desperate for stability,” Collins said in a statement.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/MarkWarner/status/1540339187827843072?s=20&#038;t=hRL0hcZpQpDbTXWML2UfHg</p>
<p>The leaders of the House Pro-Choice Caucus, Democrats Diana DeGette of Colorado and Barbara Lee of California, said in a statement the ruling would force women in half the states to “face a terrifying legal landscape when trying to access the abortion care they need.”</p>
<p>“We cannot overstate the devastating impact that this horrific decision will have on millions of people across this country,” they said. “By disregarding fifty years of legal precedent, the U.S. Supreme Court has effectively stripped away from 36 million women the freedom to control their own bodies and have handed that power, instead, to the politicians in their states.”</p>
<p>The decision would “undoubtedly put the health and economic futures of millions of women at risk,” they said. They pledged to renew efforts to enshrine legal protections to abortion in legislation.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden said the ruling broke new ground for the court in revoking an existing right and would have immediate impact in states with more restrictive laws than Roe would have permitted.</p>
<p>“The court has done what it has never done before: Expressly take away a constitutional right that is so fundamental to so many Americans.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">McConnell compares to segregation decision</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Celebrating the ruling, Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell compared it to the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision that invalidated legal school segregation. Like the Friday ruling, the Brown decision also overturned a previous Supreme Court case.</p>
<p>“The Court has corrected a terrible legal and moral error, like when Brown v. Board overruled Plessy v. Ferguson,” McConnell said in a statement.</p>
<p>Statements from some Republican lawmakers recognized the ruling as the culmination of decades of activism aimed at overturning the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling.</p>
<p>“Millions of Americans have spent half a century praying, marching, and working toward today’s historic victories for the rule of law and for innocent life,” McConnell said. “I have been proud to stand with them throughout our long journey and I share their joy today.”</p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Bob Good, R-Campbell, told anti-abortion demonstrators outside the court Friday that they would &#8220;remember this day for the rest of your lives,&#8221; adding that &#8220;the worst Supreme Court decision in the history of the court has finally after nearly 50 years been overturned.&#8221; Good told the activists that he would continue to push for the Life at Conception Act, which would &#8220;implement equal protection under the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States for the right to life of each born and preborn human person.&#8221; Good, along with Virginia Congressmen Ben Cline and Rob Wittman, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1011/cosponsors?q=%7B%22cosponsor-state%22%3A%22Virginia%22%7D" target="_blank">are cosponsors</a>.</p>

<p>Several Republican members of Congress tweeted simply, “Life wins.”</p>
<p>Members  posting that message or a version of it included Lauren Boebert of Colorado, Jim Jordan and Mike Carey of Ohio, Minority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana, Jody Hice and Buddy Carter of Georgia, Yvette Herrell of New Mexico, Diana Harshbarger of Tennessee, Kat Cammack of Florida, Lisa McClain of Michigan and the House Republican Conference account.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden is scheduled to speak about the decision Friday afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Women in Congress </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The leaders of the Democratic Women’s Caucus in the House, including Co-Chairs Lois Frankel of Florida, Brenda Lawrence of Michigan, Jackie Speier of California and Whip Nikema Williams of Georgia, said the ruling would “go down in history as one of (the court’s) worst, most unjust decisions.”</p>
<p>“Women are not chattel, and the government should not have the right to mandate pregnancies,” they said in a statement. “Every situation and pregnancy is different, and all people deserve the freedom to control their bodies and make personal decisions about their lives and futures. We will never give up the fight for access to full health care.”</p>
<p>In her own tweet, Williams noted her decade-long employment with Planned Parenthood before coming to Congress that gave her a closer look at the consequences of restricting abortion access.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;ve seen the pain and devastation that comes when states eliminate equal access to legal, safe abortions,” she said. “The Supreme Court&#8217;s radical majority hasn&#8217;t just opened the door to that, it&#8217;s welcoming it with open arms.”</p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Schumer blames Senate GOP</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Several Democrats blamed Senate Republicans for the Supreme Court’s conservative makeup and called for action in the chamber to protect abortion rights on the federal level.</p>
<p>Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement the ruling made Friday “one of the darkest days our country has ever seen” and called Senate Republicans “complicit in today’s decision and all of its consequences for women and families.”</p>
<p>Schumer urged voters to remember the court’s decision in November.</p>
<p>“Today’s decision makes crystal clear the contrast as we approach the November elections,” the New York Democrat said in a statement.</p>
<p>“Elect more MAGA Republicans if you want nationwide abortion bans, the jailing of women and doctors and no exemptions for rape or incest. Or, elect more pro-choice Democrats to save Roe and protect a woman’s right to make their own decisions about their body, not politicians.”’</p>
<p>Biden also called for Congress to act and for voters to choose candidates in November who support abortion rights.</p>
<p>Senate Judiciary ranking Republican Chuck Grassley of Iowa celebrated the ruling, which he said protected “the rights of the unborn.” The ruling was well-reasoned in its overturning of judicial precedent — an action the high court has taken before, he noted.</p>
<p>“For many Americans, including myself, this decision is about far more than correcting a flawed legal analysis in Roe,” he said in a written statement. “It means that the rights of the unborn are no longer in jeopardy by our federal government. Our nation was founded on the fundamental principle we are endowed by our creator with the unalienable right to life — a right that must be protected.</p>
<p>“This ruling does not ban the practice of abortion but instead empowers the people, through their accountable elected representatives to make commonsense policy decisions. It takes policymaking out of the hands of unelected judges.”</p>
<p>Former Vice President Mike Pence, a longtime champion of the religious right, called for state abortion bans in every state.</p>
<p>“Having been given this second chance for Life, we must not rest and must not relent until the sanctity of life is restored to the center of American law in every state in the land,” he posted on Twitter.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Manchin, Collins blast Trump justices</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>But the court’s move Friday to directly contradict established precedent — especially by justices who’d explicitly identified Roe as settled during their confirmation hearings — opened it to criticism.</p>
<p>Even the most conservative member of Schumer’s caucus, West Virginia’s Joe Manchin III, said Friday he was “deeply disappointed” in the ruling.</p>
<p>Manchin, who considers himself pro-life and voted for two of former President Donald Trump’s nominees to the court, criticized those justices Friday for breaking with what they’d said in confirmation hearings.</p>
<p>“I trusted Justice (Neil) Gorsuch and Justice (Brett) Kavanaugh when they testified under oath that they also believed Roe v. Wade was settled legal precedent and I am alarmed they chose to reject the stability the ruling has provided for two generations of Americans,” Manchin said in a written statement.</p>
<p>Collins expressed displeasure with Gorsuch and Kavanaugh in a statement that slammed the decision for casting abortion policy into upheaval.</p>
<p>“This ill-considered action will further divide the country at a moment when, more than ever in modern times, we need the Court to show both consistency and restraint. Throwing out a precedent overnight that the country has relied upon for half a century is not conservative. It is a sudden and radical jolt to the country that will lead to political chaos, anger, and a further loss of confidence in our government.</p>
<p>“This decision is inconsistent with what Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh said in their testimony and their meetings with me, where they both were insistent on the importance of supporting long-standing precedents that the country has relied upon.”</p>
<p>Manchin and fellow “pro-life Democrat” Sen. Bob Casey Jr. of Pennsylvania blasted the decision for overturning established law.</p>
<p>“Today’s decision upends almost a half century of legal precedent and rips away a constitutional right that generations of women have known their entire lives,” Casey, whose father, as the commonwealth’s governor, challenged Roe in another of the cases the court overturned Friday, tweeted.</p>
<p>“This dangerous ruling won’t end abortions in this country, but it will put women’s lives at risk,” he added.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/timkaine/status/1540354234306203649?s=20&#038;t=hRL0hcZpQpDbTXWML2UfHg</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Senate fight to come?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>With abortion rights no longer guaranteed by the judicial branch, many Democrats on Friday appealed for passage of legislation to protect abortion rights, including a House-passed measure that has stalled under the Senate’s 60-vote threshold.</p>
<p>Collins’ statement promoted her own bill with Alaska Republican Lisa Murkowski that she said would codify the protections in Roe. She was also working with Virginia Democrat Tim Kaine on a bipartisan bill, she said.</p>
<p>Abortion rights should be consistent nationally, Collins said, though states should be allowed to make minor policy adjustments.</p>
<p>​​“Our goal with this legislation is to do what the Court should have done — provide the consistency in our abortion laws that Americans have relied upon for 50 years,” she said.</p>
<p>Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, promised the panel would hold a hearing next month to explore the “grim reality” of the decision’s consequences.</p>
<p>“I will keep fighting to enshrine into law a woman’s right to make her own reproductive choices,” Durbin said. “We cannot let our children inherit a nation that is less free and more dangerous than the one their parents grew up in.”</p>
<p>Durbin spoke with Vice President Kamala Harris about the ruling as the two traveled on Air Force Two Friday morning, according to a pool report.</p>

Wade. (Kate Masters/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin applauded Friday’s U.S. Supreme Court <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/06/24/u-s-supreme-court-overturns-right-to-abortion-in-landmark-decision/" target="_blank">decision</a> abolishing the constitutional right to an abortion and said Virginia Republicans will get to work on legislation “protecting the life of unborn children” by potentially banning most abortions after 15 weeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Supreme Court of the United States has rightfully returned power to the people and their elected representatives in the states,” Youngkin said in a statement released roughly an hour after the court handed down the seismic ruling that overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade decision. “I&#8217;m proud to be a pro-life governor and plan to take every action I can to protect life. The truth is, Virginians want fewer abortions, not more abortions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ruling, which gives states new power to restrict and regulate abortion, has no immediate impact in Virginia, where abortion remains legal largely because pro-choice Democrats have controlled the governor’s mansion for most of the last decade and currently hold a narrow majority in the state Senate. But it will undoubtedly make abortion rights a top issue in a politically divided state, where Republicans won the upper hand in last year’s elections and could potentially take full control of the statehouse in 2023.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats and abortion-rights supporters reacted to the court ruling with horror, calling it a devastating blow to a fundamental right women have had for 50 years.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">&#8216;We don&#8217;t want to go back in time&#8217;</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hannah Sellars, a 29-year-old Richmond resident who attended a pro-abortion rights rally at the state Capitol a few hours after the news hit, said she had hoped the draft version of the opinion leaked in May was just a threat or a “fluke.” Seeing it become real, she said, left her “terrified.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t want this to be the beginning of the end for women’s rights,” Sellars said. “Because we’ve come so far. We don’t want to go back in time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some protesters began an impromptu march on Capitol Square after the rally, but Capitol Police told them they weren’t allowed to continue demonstrating on the statehouse grounds because the rally permit had expired. As activists began planning more protests Friday night, Youngkin called for civility and asked Virginians to “respect the rule of law.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the area surrounding the Capitol will remain open for now, the state’s Department of General Services announced it was taking “preparatory measures” to secure Capitol Square, including installing additional protective fencing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am in regular contact with the Supreme Court justices and my administration is in coordination with our mayors and local and state police to ensure we are ready to take appropriate action if need be,” Youngkin stated. “Virginia will not stand for lawlessness or violence.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats and activists sought to rally supporters to protect and expand the slim Democratic majority in the state Senate and its ability to block imminent Republican efforts to roll back abortion access. Control of the House of Delegates, where Republicans have a 52-48 majority and have introduced several unsuccessful anti-abortion bills, will also be up for grabs in next year’s elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m angry today,” said Sen. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, who spoke at the same rally outside the Capitol. “I’m angry today because we are fighting the same fights that our parents, our grandparents and our great-grandparents fought. I’m fighting because for the first time in my lifetime, the Supreme Court has taken away one of my rights. I am angry because my seven-year-old daughter will have less rights when she comes of childbearing age than I do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But if we’ve got to fight, we’re going to keep on fighting,” she added.</span></p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A &#8216;bipartisan consensus?&#8217;</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Family Foundation, one of Virginia’s top anti-abortion groups, said it was “thrilled” by the ruling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, we pause to celebrate the right to life of babies around the nation being protected, but tomorrow the work begins in Virginia to protect life throughout the commonwealth,” said Family Foundation president Victoria Cobb.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin, who has expressed support for so-called pain threshold legislation that would ban most abortions after 15 weeks, said he’s invited four Republican General Assembly members to help him “bring together legislators and advocates” to prepare a bill for consideration in the 2023 legislative session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can build a bipartisan consensus on protecting the life of unborn children, especially when they begin to feel pain in the womb, and importantly supporting mothers and families who choose life.” Youngkin said.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_31569" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG_8839-scaled.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-31569" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG_8839-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1920" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG_8839-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG_8839-300x225.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG_8839-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG_8839-768x576.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG_8839-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG_8839-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Gov. Glenn Youngkin attended Virginia&#8217;s fourth March for Life, an annual anti-abortion event held outside the Capitol, on April 27, 2022. (Kate Masters/ Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor’s office said Youngkin supports abortion exceptions in cases involving rape or incest or where the mother’s life is at risk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaker Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, said House Republicans “stand ready” to reduce abortions in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I sincerely hope that Democrats will end their use of scare tactics and work with Republicans as the people of Virginia expect,” he said. “This decision places an enormous responsibility back into the hands of the General Assembly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The prospects for bipartisanship on such a deeply felt issue appeared dim. Some Democratic lawmakers noted Youngkin had only named Republicans to the group that will ostensibly work toward a compromise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Make no mistake—we will protect a person’s right to choose in Virginia,” the Senate Democratic Caucus said in a news release.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A key vote in Senate Democrats&#8217; narrow majority is Sen. Joe Morrissey, D-Richmond, who voiced “great surprise” Friday at the Supreme Court’s decision to disregard its convention of respecting long-held precedents that are “part of the fabric of the court and society.” Morrissey, whose Catholic faith informs his anti-abortion position, also emphasized his past votes in favor of women’s rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My position, which I think is shared by many, many people in my district, is that I am personally opposed to abortion,” Morrissey said. “However, as a legislator, I don&#8217;t think I have the right to tell other women what to do with their body”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morrissey disavowed “extremists on the left and on the right”— including his pro-abortion rights primary </span><a href="https://twitter.com/lashrecseaird/status/1540388460401401856?s=20&amp;t=Syv1uLFzquV9wiSbuwKcqw" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">opponent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Lashresce Aird — and said he believes his position aligns with the average person in his district.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think a suitable marker or middle ground is this — if the fetus can feel pain,” Morrissey said. “Whether that&#8217;s 20 weeks, 22 weeks, 21 weeks, that might be the point where the state says ‘we&#8217;re going to prohibit abortion.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, he didn’t fully commit to supporting potential legislation banning abortions based on a fetal pain threshold, saying he would give it “due consideration” and there “must be exceptions for rape or incest.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Siobhan Dunnavant, R-Henrico, an OBGYN who was one of the four Republicans Youngkin named to work on the issue, said overturning Roe was “the right thing to do constitutionally.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s time to take a deep breath and have an authentic conversation in Virginia,” Dunnavant said. “I am committed to having tough conversations, listening, building consensus and doing the right thing.”</span></p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">&#8216;Cruel, dangerous and devastating&#8217;</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under current state law, women have largely unrestricted access to abortion in the first and second trimesters. Abortion in the third trimester, which begins around the 28th week, are allowed only when three doctors decide continuing the pregnancy poses a severe threat to the mother.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abortions have generally declined in Virginia over the last five years, dropping from 17,381 procedures in 2016 to 15,688 in 2020, according to data provided to the Mercury by the state’s Department of Health, which includes both terminated pregnancies and procedures to remove stillborn infants from the womb. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That number increased by roughly 3.5 percent in 2021, rising to 16,251 procedures, aligning with a </span><a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2022/06/long-term-decline-us-abortions-reverses-showing-rising-need-abortion-supreme-court" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent reversal in national trends</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But state data also shows that the vast majority of procedures in which gestational age is known occur within the first trimester, or 12 weeks into pregnancy. Since 2016, only 45 abortions are confirmed to have been performed in the third trimester, the latest stage of pregnancy (of 97,211 procedures performed since 2016, roughly 34 percent do not include information about the trimester in which they were performed, according to state data).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most abortions after 20 weeks, something has gone terribly wrong,” McClellan said after the rally. “Most of the time, you’ve had a very devastating fetal diagnosis, and in those cases, the baby won’t survive. So families are left with a devastating diagnosis, and now the governor would take away their ability to decide what’s best for them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like other pro-choice advocates, she described Virginia as a “safe haven” in the South thanks to the General Assembly’s rollback of abortion restrictions under its former Democratic majority. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the draft leak in May, providers and pro-choice advocates have warned that out-of-state patients are likely to </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/06/09/one-of-virginias-biggest-pro-choice-advocacy-groups-is-preparing-for-a-post-roe-future/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drive up demand for the procedure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Kentucky and Tennesse have so-called “</span><a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2022/06/13-states-have-abortion-trigger-bans-heres-what-happens-when-roe-overturned" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">trigger laws</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” to ban abortion within 30 days of Roe being overturned, and West Virginia — which outlaws the procedure after 20 weeks — still has a </span><a href="https://mountainstatespotlight.org/2022/05/03/what-a-roe-v-wade-reversal-could-mean-for-wv-abortion-access/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">law criminalizing abortion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the books. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">REPRO Rising Virginia, a statewide pro-choice advocacy group, is expecting thousands of out-of-state patients to seek care in Virginia following the decision, according to executive director Tarina Keene.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Today’s Supreme Court decision is cruel, dangerous and devastating,” she said in a Friday statement. The Virginia chapter of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists also opposed the decision, describing it as a “dangerous intrusion” into the practice of medicine that could lead to doctors being criminalized for providing needed treatment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We remain opposed to government interference in the patient-physician relationship,” the organization said in a statement, adding that it was “unacceptable for doctors and health care professionals to be punished, fined, or sued and face imprisonment for delivering evidence-based care.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other attendees at Friday’s rally worried the decision could lead to the rollback of other rights under a Republican-controlled legislature — especially after Justice Clarence Thomas urged the Supreme Court to </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/24/thomas-constitutional-rights-00042256" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reconsider other rulings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on access to contraception, same-sex relationships and same-sex marriage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They came for women today,” said 28-year-old Jared Rondeau, who drove from Petersburg to attend the rally. “But they said in the ruling they’re coming for gay people tomorrow. And if I don’t come out now, who’s going to stand up for me?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alexandra Walker, 17, and Sonia Krishna, 16, said even though they aren’t old enough to vote yet, they’ll do what they can to fight back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think us coming out and making sure our legislators know this is not what Virginians want, this is not what Americans want… is so important,” Walker said. “It obviously didn&#8217;t deter the Supreme Court. But maybe it will help our lawmakers.”</span></p>

On Friday the court issued a landmark decision overturning the right to an abortion. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON —  The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf" target="_blank">overturned</a> the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that established abortion as a constitutional right.</p>
<p>The decision by five of the Court’s nine justices will allow each state to set its own abortion laws, leading to a patchwork of access throughout the country. The result is expected to be an uptick in the number of women traveling out of state for abortions, as well as unsafe abortions in states where the medical procedure will now be banned or heavily restricted.</p>
<p>“We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled,” Justice Samuel Alito wrote in his opinion, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.</p>
<p>Chief Justice John Roberts filed a separate opinion concurring in the judgment about the Mississippi law at the center of the case, making that a 6-3 ruling, but not about overturning the constitutional right to an abortion, making that a 5-4 ruling.</p>
<p>“The Constitution makes no reference to abortion, and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision, including the one on which the defenders of Roe and Casey now chiefly rely — the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,” Alito said.</p>
<p>“That provision has been held to guarantee some rights that are not mentioned in the Constitution, but any such right must be ‘deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition’ and ‘implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.’”</p>
<p>Justice Stephen Breyer wrote the dissent in the case for himself, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor.</p>
<p>“With sorrow — for this Court, but more, for the many millions of American women who have today lost a fundamental constitutional protection — we dissent,” he wrote.</p>
<p>The new status of abortion access on a state-by-state basis, Breyer wrote , “says that from the very moment of fertilization, a woman has no rights to speak of. A State can force her to bring a pregnancy to term, even at the steepest personal and familial costs.”</p>
<p>Breyer later added, “Whatever the exact scope of the coming laws, one result of today’s decision is certain: the curtailment of women’s rights, and of their status as free and equal citizens.”</p>
<p>Twenty-two states have laws that would restrict when and how a patient can terminate a pregnancy,<a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/abortion-policy-absence-roe" target="_blank"> according to the Guttmacher Institute</a>, a reproductive health and rights organization.</p>
<p>Arizona, Michigan and Wisconsin are among the 10 states that have pre-Roe abortion bans that are now expected to take effect. Thirteen states — including Idaho, Louisiana, Missouri and Tennessee — have laws enacted since Roe that will be “triggered” by the court’s decision.</p>
<p>In Virginia, legislation in 2020 removed many of the state’s former restrictions on the procedure, eliminating mandatory ultrasounds and 24-hour waiting periods along with strict regulations on abortion clinics. Those rollbacks were largely achieved through a Democratic majority in both the House of Delegates and Senate and with support from then-Gov. Ralph Northam.</p>
<p>But with Republicans now in control of the House — and a pro-life governor — Democrats say they’ll be put on the defensive if abortion rights are ultimately overturned at the federal level.</p>
<p>A dozen states, including Maine, Maryland, Nevada and Washington, have laws that would protect abortion access up to the point of viability, usually 22 to 24 weeks into a pregnancy.</p>
<p>Colorado, the District of Columbia, New Jersey, Oregon and Vermont have laws that protect abortion access throughout a pregnancy, according to the Guttmacher Institute.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Thomas targets birth control, same-sex marriage</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Justice Thomas wrote his own concurring opinion, arguing that since the court has overturned the constitutional right to an abortion, which was grounded in the 14th Amendment and the due process clause, other cases that have been rooted in the same right to privacy could all be reconsidered.</p>
<p>Those include:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">The Griswold v. Connecticut <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/381/479/" target="_blank">case</a> from 1965 that said states couldn’t bar married couples from making private decisions about birth control use.</li>
<li aria-level="1">The Lawrence v. Texas <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/539/558/" target="_blank">case</a> from 2003 that said states couldn’t criminalize consensual sexual relations between same-sex partners.</li>
<li aria-level="1">The Obergefell v. Hodges <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf" target="_blank">case</a> from 2015 that legalized same-sex marriage.</li>
</ul>
<p>“For that reason, in future cases, we should reconsider all of this Court’s substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell,” Thomas wrote.</p>
<p>Thomas also wrote of the Dobbs case that “The resolution of this case is thus straightforward. Because the Due Process Clause does not secure <i>any</i> substantive rights, it does not secure a right to abortion.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Reaction pours in</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The Center for Reproductive Rights, which brought the case to the Supreme Court, rebuked the Republican-nominated justices for ending the right to an abortion.</p>
<p>“The Court’s opinion delivers a wrecking ball to the constitutional right to abortion, destroying the protections of Roe v. Wade, and utterly disregarding the one in four women in America who make the decision to end a pregnancy,” said Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights.</p>
<p>“Utter chaos lies ahead, as some states race to the bottom with criminal abortion bans, forcing people to travel across multiple state lines and, for those without means to travel, carry their pregnancies to term — dictating their health, lives, and futures. Today’s decision will ignite a public health emergency,” Northup continued.</p>
<p>Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, an anti-abortion group, celebrated the decision, while its president called for “an entirely new pro-life movement” to begin.</p>
<p>“Today’s outcome raises the stakes of the midterm elections. Voters will debate and decide this issue and they deserve to know where every candidate in America stands,” Marjorie Dannenfelser said in a statement. “Federal as well as state lawmakers must commit to being consensus builders who advocate for the most ambitious protections possible.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Mississippi ban</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The court heard two hours of <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-considers-new-limits-abortions-mississippi-case" target="_blank">arguments</a> in December in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which arose after Mississippi enacted a law that banned the vast majority of abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.</p>
<p>U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth B. Prelogar, who argued on behalf of the federal government as a “friend of the Court,” <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2021/19-1392_gfbi.pdf" target="_blank">said</a> that the “real-world effects of overruling Roe” and the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/505/833" target="_blank">1992 Planned Parenthood v. Casey </a>decision that affirmed the right to an abortion “would be severe and swift.”</p>
<p>“Nearly half of the states already have or are expected to enact bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, many without exceptions for rape or incest,” Prelogar said. “Women who are unable to travel hundreds of miles to gain access to legal abortion will be required to continue with their pregnancies and give birth, with profound effects on their bodies, their health and the course of their lives.”</p>
<p>Mississippi Solicitor General Scott G. Stewart argued the nine justices should not only uphold Mississippi’s 2018 law, which had yet to go into effect, but overturn the two cases that have kept abortion access legal for nearly 50 years.</p>
<p>“Roe versus Wade and Planned Parenthood versus Casey haunt our country,” he said. “They&#8217;ve poisoned the law.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Abortion rights history</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Court first ruled that a pregnant woman has a constitutional right to abortion in the 1973 Roe v. Wade case that stemmed from a Texas woman being unable to access an abortion in her home state. The decision was 7-2.</p>
<p>Justice Harry Blackmun <a href="http://landmarkcases.c-span.org/pdf/Roe_Blackmun_Opinion.pdf" target="_blank">wrote</a> that the right to an abortion stemmed from the right to privacy under the 14th Amendment. But the court ruled that a woman&#8217;s fundamental right to terminate their pregnancy must be weighed against the government’s interest in protecting health and potential life.</p>
<p>The court established a trimester framework that determined when and how governments could impose regulations on abortion access.</p>
<p>In the 1992 Planned Parenthood v. Casey case, a 5-4 ruling, the court upheld a constitutional right to an abortion. But the decision overturned the trimester framework, instead setting viability, about 22 to 24 weeks into a pregnancy, as the line for government regulation.</p>
<p>The court said a woman had a right to an abortion before viability without undue interference from the government. After reaching a point of viability, states can regulate abortion as long as it doesn’t affect health or life.</p>
<p>In the plurality opinion, Justice Sandra Day O&#8217;Connor <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/505/833/" target="_blank">wrote</a> that “Some of us as individuals find abortion offensive to our most basic principles of morality, but that cannot control our decision. Our obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code.”</p>
<p>In a dissenting opinion, Justice Thomas <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/505/833/" target="_blank">wrote</a> for himself, Antonin Scalia and two others that they would have overturned Roe v. Wade, saying the issue in the case was &#8220;not whether the power of a woman to abort her unborn child is a &#8216;liberty&#8217; in the absolute sense; or even whether it is a liberty of great importance to many women. Of course it is both.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The issue is whether it is a liberty protected by the Constitution of the United States. I am sure it is not,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Will court survive a &#8216;stench&#8217;?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>During oral arguments in December in the Mississippi case the justices ruled on Friday, Justice Sotomayor expressed concern over how the court overturning cases that established abortion access as a constitutional right would impact its reputation.</p>
<p>“Now, the sponsors of this bill, the House bill in Mississippi, said we&#8217;re doing it because we have new justices. The newest ban that Mississippi has put in place, the six-week ban, the Senate sponsor said we&#8217;re doing it because we have new justices on the Supreme Court,” Sotomayor said.</p>
<p>“Will this institution survive the stench that this creates in the public perception that the Constitution and its reading are just political acts?”</p>
<p>Justice Kagan questioned whether the court overruling Roe and Casey would lead Americans to view the court as &#8220;a political institution that will go back and forth, depending on what part of the public yells the loudest or changes to the court&#8217;s membership.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Justice Breyer read from a decision the entire Supreme Court issued in Casey about when and how justices should overturn watershed cases to avoid a situation that “would subvert the Court&#8217;s legitimacy.”</p>
<p>“They say overruling unnecessarily and under pressure would lead to condemnation, the Court&#8217;s loss of confidence in the judiciary, the ability of the Court to exercise the judicial power and to function as the Supreme Court of a nation dedicated to the rule of law,” Breyer read.</p>
<p>The Mississippi law at the center of the argument allowed abortions after 15 weeks in cases of “severe fetal abnormality” or medical emergency, but it did not include exceptions for rape or incest.</p>
<p>At the time Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant signed the bill in March 2018, the 15-week threshold was the earliest abortion ban in the nation.</p>
<p>That has since changed, with <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/states-rush-revise-their-abortion-laws-major-us-supreme-court-decision-nears" target="_blank">several states enacting</a> laws restricting abortion below that benchmark, including an Oklahoma law that makes abortion a felony punishable by up to 10 years in state prison, a maximum fine of $10,000, or both.</p>
<p>Abortion rights organizations have filed lawsuits to stop many of those new laws from going into effect on the basis that they violated the constitutional right to an abortion that the court undid this week.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Politico leak</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Court majority opinion released Friday is similar to a draft version, led by Justice Alito, that was leaked to Politico in early May.</p>
<p>The leak was broadly criticized by Republicans, who at the time didn’t want to talk about the implications of the court overturning Roe, while Democrats rebuked the conservative justices for the expected decision.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, held a floor vote in May on a bill that would have codified a nationwide right to an abortion.</p>
<p>That legislation<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-democrats-fail-enshrine-nationwide-abortion-protections-vow-more-action" target="_blank"> couldn’t get past </a>the chamber’s 60-vote legislative filibuster.</p>
<p>Maine Sen. Susan Collins and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, both Republicans who expressed frustration with how the Trump-nominated justices portrayed their view of Roe as a settled precedent during their confirmation processes, voted against the bill.</p>
<p>West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin did as well.</p>
<p>Manchin said in a <a href="https://www.manchin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/manchin-statement-on-scotus-decision-to-overturn-roe-v-wade" target="_blank">statement</a> Friday that he was “deeply disappointed that the Supreme Court has voted to overturn Roe v. Wade.”</p>
<p>“I trusted Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh when they testified under oath that they also believed Roe v. Wade was settled legal precedent and I am alarmed they chose to reject the stability the ruling has provided for two generations of Americans,” Manchin continued.</p>

<p><b>U.S. abortion law <span class="il">timeline</span></b></p>
<p><b>1910</b></p>
<p>Abortion is illegal in all states, with some exceptions to save the life of the patient.</p>
<p><b>1959</b></p>
<p>The American Law Institute proposes a model penal code for state abortion laws. The code advocates legalizing abortion for reasons including the mental or physical health of the mother, pregnancy due to rape and incest, and fetal deformity.</p>
<p><b>1967</b></p>
<p>April 25: Colorado Gov. John A. Love signs the first American Law Institute-model abortion law in the United States, allowing abortion in cases of permanent mental or physical disability of either the child or mother or in cases of rape or incest. Similar laws are passed in California, Oregon, and North Carolina.</p>
<p><b>1970</b></p>
<p>April 11: New York legalizes abortion up to the 24th week of pregnancy, repealing the state’s 1830 law that banned abortion “after quickening” except to save a woman’s life. Similar laws are passed in Alaska, Hawaii and Washington state.</p>
<p><b>1971</b></p>
<p>April 21: The U.S. Supreme Court rules on its first case involving abortion in United States v. Vuitch, upholding a District of Columbia law permitting abortion only to preserve a patient’s life or health, meaning “psychological and physical well-being.”</p>
<p><b>1972</b></p>
<p>By year’s end 13 states have an American Law Institute-type law. Four states allow abortion on demand. Mississippi allows abortion for rape and incest [1966] while Alabama allows abortion for the mother’s physical health [1954]. In 31 states abortion is allowed only to save the patient’s life.</p>
<p><b>1973</b></p>
<p>Jan. 22: The U.S. Supreme Court issues its ruling in Roe v. Wade, finding that a “right of privacy” it had earlier discovered was “broad enough to encompass” a right to abortion and adopting a trimester scheme of pregnancy. In the first trimester, a state could enact virtually no regulation. In the second trimester, the state could enact some regulation, but only for the purpose of protecting maternal health. In the third trimester, after viability, a state could ostensibly “proscribe” abortion, provided it made exceptions to preserve the life and health of the woman seeking abortion. Issued on the same day, Doe v. Bolton defines “health” to mean “all factors” that affect the woman, including “physical, emotional, psychological, familial, and the woman’s age.”</p>
<p><b>1977</b></p>
<p>June 20: In Maher v. Roe, Beal v. Doe and Poelker v. Doe, the U.S. Supreme Court holds that federal and state governments are under no obligation to fund abortion in public assistance programs, even if childbirth expenses are paid for indigent women and even if the abortion is deemed to be “medically necessary.”</p>

<p>June 29: In Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the U.S. Supreme Court reaffirms the core holdings of Roe but modifies it by discarding the trimester scheme, upholding certain abortion restrictions and adopting the “undue burden” test of abortion laws, requiring opponents of an abortion regulation to prove the provision would create an “undue burden” on a woman’s right to abortion in order for it to be declared unconstitutional.</p>

Federal regulators and animal welfare groups have uncovered critical violations within the facility, including hundreds of puppy deaths with no causes listed. (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals)</p><p>A federal judge will allow Envigo — which is shutting down a controversial dog-breeding facility in Cumberland County under pressure from federal regulators because of a string of animal welfare violations— to sell more than 500 dogs to labs over the objections of the U.S. Department of Justice.</p>
<p>Federal attorneys seeking an injunction to enforce the terms of the act had argued that Envigo, which breeds the beagles for medical research, should be prohibited from selling the dogs since its had violated the terms of its license issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</p>
<p>&#8220;While extraordinary relief is warranted to address defendant’s failure to meet its obligations under the AWA and to protect the animals at the Cumberland facility from further harm, equitable considerations do not justify an order that would prevent defendant from fulfilling its existing contracts,&#8221; U.S. District Judge Norman Moon wrote <a href="https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/PI-Order.pdf" target="_blank">in an order</a> granting the injunction.</p>
<p>In May, after years of violations and legislative debate in Virginia, including<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/03/08/virginia-lawmakers-pass-new-regulations-for-controversial-beagle-breeding-facility/" target="_blank"> new regulations passed by the legislature</a> this year, federal agents <a href="https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/012-Joint-Motion-to-Extend-TRO.pdf" target="_blank">seized hundreds of dogs and puppies</a> found to be “in acute distress.”</p>
<p>In a statement, Daphna Nachminovitch, senior vice president of cruelty investigations for the Norfolk-based People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, said Inotiv, Envigo&#8217;s parent company, took in about $225 million in revenue in the past six months, less than 1 percent of which was from selling dogs.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wants to wring every last penny out of the exploitation of these long-neglected dogs, who have already been through so much,” Nachminovitch said. “Inotiv owes these beagles the opportunity to have what every dog deserves—the freedom to enjoy life in a loving home. It’s time for this company to finally do the right thing: Let all the dogs be adopted now.”</p>
<p>But Moon sided with Envigo, which argued that the research dogs are “exceedingly important to domestic pharmaceutical discovery and development,” noting that the Cumberland operation has produced &#8220;up to 25 percent of the domestic supply of beagles for research” and there aren&#8217;t enough animals to meet the demands of research institutions, according to court documents.</p>
<p>As condition of the injunction, however, Envigo won&#8217;t be able to transfer or euthanize any of the other 2,700 dogs at the facility without the approval of the Justice Department or the court, PETA said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would appear they will be assessed for adoption candidacy, and that should become clear by mid next week,&#8221; Dan Paden, PETA&#8217;s vice president of evidence analysis, told the Mercury.</p>

Joe Morrissey, D-Richmond. (Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Republican delegate and a Democratic senator huddled in the corner of a courtroom Tuesday afternoon, trying to make out what was said on a garbled audio recording that captured some of the expletives hurled in a heated altercation last month in a Richmond radio studio.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is that: ‘I will f**king knock you down’?” asked Del. Tim Anderson, R-Virginia Beach, a lawyer who was representing two radio producers seeking restraining orders against Sen. Joe Morrissey, D-Richmond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a judge looked on, Morrissey acknowledged he had said “Get the f**k out of my office” and called the station manager a “fat f**king pig.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At no time did I ever say ‘I’ll kick your ass,’” Morrissey insisted on the stand, contradicting the testimony offered by the radio employees, who said Morrissey’s May 4 studio outburst made them fear for their safety.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a hearing that lasted more than four hours, retired Arlington County judge Thomas Kelley Jr. dismissed the preliminary restraining orders that had been granted against Morrissey over the studio incident, leaving Morrissey free to continue showing up to the South Richmond building that houses both the radio station and his Senate district office. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview afterward, the senator said being Joe Morrissey often means “you have a bullseye on your back.” But he said he prevailed because “multiple observers” backed up his version of the story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kelley said he too heard the knockdown comment on the recording but concluded it didn’t rise to the level of overt threat necessary for a permanent restraining order, noting the setup of having a Democrat host a show on a right-wing talk radio network “at the very least is designed to generate controversy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The court is put in the position of looking at what happened,” Kelley said, stressing that he had to look at Morrissey’s comment as one piece of a larger incident.</span></p>

<audio class="wp-audio-shortcode" id="audio-32127-1" preload="none" style="width: 100%;" controls="controls"><source type="audio/mpeg" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/JoeMorrissey-AUDIO-of-incident.m4a?_=1" /><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/JoeMorrissey-AUDIO-of-incident.m4a">https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/JoeMorrissey-AUDIO-of-incident.m4a</a></audio>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The incident last month occurred in the middle of a live-streamed episode of the “Fighting Joe Morrissey Show” on WJFN Radio, the network operated by conservative commentator John Fredericks. </span>The show’s branding evokes Morrissey’s combative tendencies, featuring boxing gloves on its logo and incorporating the “Rocky” theme song.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a newly hired producer, David Pascoe, pressed Morrissey on his stance on abortion rights and the possible overturning of Roe v. Wade, Morrissey lashed out at both Pascoe and the station manager, Derek Clark. The episode has since been removed from the show’s Facebook page, but the video showed a visibly angry Morrissey yelling at coworkers offscreen and his legislative aide at one point grabbing his arm to try to pull him away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We saw Mr. Morrissey’s unhingedness. That enough is a threat,” Anderson said, adding that the two men who filed the complaints against Morrissey were raising legitimate “red flags” about disturbing behavior. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The judge denied a request from Morrissey’s lawyer, James Maloney, to collect attorney’s fees from the complainants, indicating he felt there was at least some validity to their claims even if they fell short legally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During Tuesday’s hearing at the Richmond courthouse, Morrissey and his lawyer characterized the incident as a boisterous workplace reprimand of a new hire who was “undermining” the star of the show. Morrissey compared the incident to “an underling telling Tom Brady” how to play quarterback. Pascoe testified Morrissey threatened to “ruin” and “destroy” him, but Morrissey denied making the remarks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The words never came out of my mouth,” the senator said on the stand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The blowup happened on Pascoe’s first day working on Morrissey’s show. While Pascoe claimed that there had been an agreement between Morrissey and himself to have a debate live on air, Morrissey said he had been taken aback by Pascoe’s unexpected interjections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As someone who had just moved to the area but was aware of Morrissey’s </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/virginia-state-bar-files-ethics-complaint-against-joe-morrissey-alleging-cover-up-of-sex-scandal/article_15384c5a-3a0f-576c-b15e-b36bdc2e3046.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">checkered history</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which includes a 1991 courthouse fistfight when Morrissey was Richmond’s top prosecutor, Pascoe said he was “sitting there aghast” watching a state senator erupt over being asked a political question. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve never had anybody in a professional setting act like this before… I left the studio because I didn’t feel safe,” Pascoe said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The judge quickly dismissed Pascoe’s request for a restraining order but allowed a more in-depth examination of Clark’s request since the two producers claimed Morrissey made more direct verbal threats toward Clark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clark said he had called the police to the studio after an incident he believed could amount to assault. But after police said he would have to take further action to try to bring charges against Morrissey, he chose to wait and seek advice from lawyers and his employer. He and Pascoe ultimately sought preliminary restraining orders on May 20. The station also briefly brought in armed security guards for their protection, according to court testimony. Morrissey dismissed the guards’ presence as “bizarre.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the arguments presented in court hinged on video and audio recording evidence of the altercation, including the clip of the Facebook Live stream that was being broadcast at the time, as well as recordings captured by a reporter present outside the studio. Both sides agreed that the speech in question was sometimes “inaudible,” and that the video recording didn’t fully capture what occurred.</span></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Joe Morrissey yelling at show producer" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6p7PaeUZcgI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dispute also centered on the question of who stood up from their chair first and who moved farther around the desk to confront the other person. Morrissey initially chastised Pascoe for suggesting the senator supported overturning Roe “in a roundabout way” but turned his ire toward Clark after Clark told Morrissey his behavior toward Pascoe was out of line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morrissey’s lawyer conceded the senator had used “colorful language” and said the episode may show a less-than-harmonious workplace, but argued there had been no serious threat of violence because Morrissey never touched the two men even though they were only separated by a desk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There was nothing preventing Mr. Morrissey from doing any kind of assaultive behavior he wanted,” Maloney said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clark testified that he had intervened to defend an employee who was being berated and calm the situation down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was scared,” Clark said. “I thought he was going to hit me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Morrissey and a witness called by Morrissey’s side, whose testimony the judge said he didn’t find credible, insisted it was Clark and Pascoe who had been the aggressors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It looked like Morrissey was about to get beat up by two guys,” said Tiffany Wilson, who testified she had been in the studio that day with a guest set to be interviewed in a later segment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morrissey and Wilson both claimed the aide who took Morrissey by the arm had been trying to get the senator out of the studio to prepare for the upcoming interview, but Anderson argued it didn’t make sense for the show’s host to leave the room during a brief commercial break.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wilson said she had not watched the video of the incident she was testifying about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two other people at the radio station that day, a receptionist and a man who works for Morrissey’s jury consulting business, testified they never heard Morrissey make any threats, though both acknowledged they didn’t see or hear the entire incident.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morrissey’s team tried to argue a size difference between Morrissey and Clark meant Clark had no reason to feel intimidated, but the judge said he felt physical stature was irrelevant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A small person can be intimidating,” Kelley said. “A big person can not be intimidating.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the hearing, Anderson said his clients would consider an appeal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s an unfortunate circumstance that we had to all go through this,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After denying under oath that he threatened Clark, Morrissey expressed no remorse over the incident while speaking to reporters in a courtroom hallway.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If a 350-pound bully gets in my face… yeah, I’ll knock him down,” Morrissey said. </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Supreme Court of Virginia will hear an appeal of two lower court rulings that found that residents living near a massive planned Wegmans distribution center project in Hanover didn’t have standing to challenge local officials’ approval of the project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The essence” of the Hanover Circuit rulings “is that literally no one can challenge the decision of the board at issue here,” argued five residents whose properties lie within 1,200 feet or across the street from the Wegmans site. They say the case will allow the high court to “determine once and for all” whether owners of property adjacent to projects with adverse impacts &#8220;have access to the courts to challenge&#8221; approvals granted by local governments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On May 23, the Supreme Court of Virginia announced it would hear the appeal. No schedule has yet been set.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re really hopeful that the Supreme Court is going to get this right and fix what Hanover County didn’t get right,” said Roderick Morgan, one of the residents involved in the suit. “It’s ridiculous that people have not had access to the courts because of this whole standing issue, and it’s people who are immediately adjacent to the property and really close by.”</span></p>
<p>Hanover County Director of Communications Kerri O&#8217;Brien said Hanover was &#8220;confident that the Supreme Court’s review of the steps taken by the board when it approved the zoning applications will show that the board’s consideration and approval of those applications are fully supported by the law.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wegmans did not provide a comment on the court&#8217;s decision to the Mercury. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Supreme Court&#8217;s decision to review the case is the latest twist in an ongoing fight by several overlapping groups of Hanover residents to block the construction of a 1.7 million square foot Wegmans distribution center roughly two miles from Interstate 95 and seven miles north of Richmond. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local and state officials have touted Wegman’s promise to create 700 jobs and invest $175 million in the Hanover facility as a major economic development win for the region. Former Gov. Ralph Northam’s administration awarded the company $2.35 million in grants to secure the commitment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, several local groups have opposed the project for a range of reasons including concerns about noise, truck traffic and the planned destruction of almost 15 acres of wetlands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Particularly objectionable for some is the site’s placement adjacent to Brown Grove, a historically Black community founded by freedpeople after the Civil War and where many of their descendants remain. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/12/17/hanover-naacp-asks-for-temporary-halt-to-wegmans-distribution-center-work/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One lawsuit filed by the Hanover NAACP against Virginia and the State Water Control Board</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which granted Wegmans a permit to disturb wetlands on the site, alleged that state officials had failed both to ensure the proposal was “the least environmentally damaging practicable alternative” and to meaningfully involve the Brown Grove community in the permitting process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A request to halt construction work until the legal matter was settled was rejected by the Richmond Circuit Court. The Court of Appeals of Virginia later upheld that decision. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A second lawsuit, filed by residents Roderick and Andrea Morgan, Sara Blose, Kathryn Woodcock and Timothy Miller against the Hanover County Board of Supervisors, contends Hanover officials had violated local ordinances and state laws in eight different ways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hanover Circuit Court in November 2020 and August 2021 dismissed all eight complaints, holding that the residents had “failed to plead facts sufficient to establish a particularized harm which is ‘different from that suffered by the public generally.’” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In appealing those decisions to the Supreme Court of Virginia, the residents emphasized the “particularized harms” they say they face as a result of the Hanover Board of Supervisors’ May 6, 2020 vote to rezone the Wegmans site, grant the project a special exception and approve revised proffers governing the use of the property.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The increased traffic, night sky light pollution from the taller parking light poles, increased noise from traffic and facility operations and a decrease in property values created a nuisance and were particularized injuries unique to the plaintiffs and not suffered generally by the public,” they wrote in the appeal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those harms give them standing to legally challenge the board’s May 2020 decision, they said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Project opponents in both suits are being represented by attorney Brian Buniva.</span></p>

(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)</p><p>A Republican lawyer who serves in the Virginia House of Delegates is pursing restraining orders that would make two books unavailable to minors after a retired judge acting on behalf of the Virginia Beach Circuit Court found  the books could be considered obscene due to explicit sexual content.</p>
<p>In an interview Thursday, Del. Tim Anderson, R-Virginia Beach, said he and his client in the case, Republican congressional candidate Tommy Altman, are now seeking temporary restraining orders that would prevent distribution of the books to minors by libraries and bookstores.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ACOMAF_2.jpeg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-31833 size-medium" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ACOMAF_2-200x300.jpeg" alt="" width="200" height="300" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ACOMAF_2-200x300.jpeg 200w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ACOMAF_2.jpeg 568w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a></p>
<p>The books in question are &#8220;A Court of Mist and Fury,&#8221; a fantasy novel that contains sex scenes, and &#8220;Gender Queer,&#8221; a memoir about LGBTQ identity written in a graphic or comic book style format. It has come under fire from some parents over an illustration depicting oral sex.</p>
<p>Virginia Democrats have pushed back against what they say is a wave of conservative attempts to censor what young people read. So far, those fights, which often center around books dealing with LGBTQ themes or race, have largely been restricted to the General Assembly and local school boards. But Anderson&#8217;s effort appears to be a significant escalation in tactics by getting Virginia courts involved in deciding whether some books should be off limits to young readers.</p>
<p>Anderson said he&#8217;s only trying to restrict the books&#8217; availability to minors, not to censor or ban them entirely.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just, they&#8217;re basically treated like adult magazines now,&#8221; Anderson said. &#8220;You can&#8217;t go watch an R-rated movie without your parents there. Same concept.&#8221;</p>
<p>The legal maneuver was already drawing backlash Thursday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Virginia Republicans want to ban books. Everywhere — they aren’t stopping at schools &amp; libraries,&#8221; Del. Marcus Simon, D-Fairfax, <a href="https://twitter.com/marcussimon/status/1527374412399267840?s=20&amp;t=7ODcPehsvz5jCpYQVhwyJw" target="_blank">said on Twitter.</a> &#8220;They are authoritarian bullies who want to control what you see, hear, learn and read. Everything they baselessly accuse the left of doing, they do.&#8221;</p>
<p>A little-utilized <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title18.2/chapter8/section18.2-384/" target="_blank">state law</a> allows &#8220;any citizen&#8221; to ask a court to weigh in on books alleged to be obscene.</p>
<p>After reviewing the two contested books, retired Petersburg-area Judge Pamela Baskervill issued two orders on May 18 finding probable cause the books could qualify as obscene, an initial step that allows the books&#8217; authors and publishers to respond in defense of their work within 21 days of being notified of the court proceedings. Baskervill is handling the case because all other judges in Virginia Beach recused themselves, according to Anderson.</p>
<p>Once a probable cause finding is made, the law also allows the court to grant a temporary restraining order &#8220;against the sale or distribution of the book alleged to be obscene.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what Anderson and Altman are now seeking, filing two motions for restraining orders that aim to prevent the Virginia Beach schools and Barnes &amp; Noble from making the books available to minors on their bookshelves. Baskervill has not yet acted on those requests.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Gender-Queer-Book-scaled.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-31362 size-medium" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Gender-Queer-Book-204x300.jpg" alt="Gender Queer: A Memoir" width="204" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/education/vp-nw-books-virginia-beach-20220516-rjy4vayorffojc57klxtyuf5qm-story.html" target="_blank">According to the Virginian-Pilot</a>, the Virginia Beach School Board recently decided to remove &#8220;Gender Queer&#8221; from its shelves after a review deemed the book &#8220;pervasively vulgar,&#8221; going against a staff recommendation to keep the book in school libraries.</p>
<p>Anderson said he came across the obscenity law &#8220;by accident&#8221; and is unaware of any recent examples of it being invoked. A judge signaling agreement that the books may be obscene, he said, is a &#8220;very big deal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She requested the books. She read them,&#8221; Anderson said. &#8220;There&#8217;s no first amendment right to distribute sexually explicit material to minors.&#8221;</p>
<p>In assessing obscenity claims, the state law instructs judges to consider &#8220;the artistic, literary, medical, scientific, cultural and educational values&#8221; of the book, as well as the &#8220;degree of public acceptance&#8221; of the book in the local community and the intent and reputation of the author.</p>
<p>The publishers of the two books did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment.</p>
<p>In a news release, Altman, one of <a href="https://www.vpap.org/candidates/federal/391163-tommy-altman/" target="_blank">four Republican</a>s vying for their party&#8217;s nomination to take on U.S. Rep. Elaine Luria, D-Norfolk, in a competitive Hampton Roads-area district, applauded the initial court ruling  as a win for &#8220;concerned parents who don&#8217;t want their minor children  being exposed to books depicting explicit sex acts and other vulgar topics in schools, libraries or bookstores.&#8221;</p>

Bill Stanley, R-Franklin. (Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Virginia Sen. Bill Stanley, R-Franklin, invoked his duties as a sitting lawmaker to request a delay in a high-profile lawsuit challenging the state&#8217;s ban on slots-like skill games, a move that appears to have bought his client valuable time to continue operating machines the General Assembly has tried to outlaw.</p>
<p>Though a judicial order granting the request hadn&#8217;t officially been entered as of mid-day Thursday, the <a href="https://www.chathamstartribune.com/news/article_e2139dfc-d128-11ec-b884-1fec5c7338cd.html" target="_blank">Chatham Star-Tribune reported this week</a> that Stanley&#8217;s request has been granted. Online records for the Greensville Circuit Court indicate a hearing scheduled for next week has been delayed to Nov. 2, giving skill machines another six-month reprieve.</p>
<p>Stanley is suing the state on behalf of former NASCAR driver Hermie Sadler, who owns several Virginia establishments, including the Sadler Travel Plaza in Emporia, that offer the legally disputed skill machines. Sadler Brothers Oil Company, the plaintiff in the suit, is also one of Stanley&#8217;s <a href="https://www.vpap.org/donors/260878/recipient/193542/?start_year=all&amp;end_year=all&amp;recip_type=all" target="_blank">campaign donors</a>.</p>
<p>The General Assembly passed a law that banned the machines last year, but a Greensville Circuit Court judge issued a temporary injunction in December allowing some machines to remain active until further court proceedings scheduled for this month.</p>
<p>On April 15, Stanley sent the judge overseeing the case <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Consent-Motion-to-Continue-with-Consent-Order-4-18-22.pdf" target="_blank">a letter</a> saying his responsibilities as a senator could complicate his ability to move forward with a May 18 hearing on whether the injunction should be made permanent. He asked that the matter be rescheduled for late summer or early fall, and court filings show the office of Attorney General Jason Miyares agreed with the request.</p>
<p>Stanley&#8217;s letter cited the General Assembly&#8217;s ongoing special session, which so far has required little actual work in Richmond and is almost entirely contingent on an unfinished budget a small group of legislators is working out in private. The legislature took no action this year on skill games, but Stanley suggested the special session and budget negotiations could potentially impact the skill-game industry.</p>
<p>He also raised the possibility of formally invoking his privileges as a lawmaker to force a delay in the hearing, citing a controversial state law that gives attorneys who serve in the General Assembly the ability to postpone court proceedings &#8220;as a matter of right&#8221; when the legislature is in session.</p>
<p>&#8220;Moreover, the special session may interfere with my availability to prepare for and appear at the final hearing as currently scheduled, which could require me to have no other choice but to invoke <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title30/chapter1/section30-5/#:~:text=%C2%A7%2030%2D5.-,Continuance%20or%20time%20for%20filing%20pleading%2C%20etc.%2C%20where%20party,or%20Division%20of%20Legislative%20Services." target="_blank">Virginia Code Section 30-5</a>,&#8221; Stanley wrote.</p>
<p>In an interview Thursday evening, Stanley said both sides in the case agreed to the delay &#8220;for the sake of judicial economy&#8221; and insisted casually mentioning 30-5 in a letter did not amount to using his status as a lawmaker to force a delay beneficial to his client.</p>
<p>&#8220;Both parties agreed to this,&#8221; Stanley said. &#8220;I can tell you at no time did I threaten to invoke 30-5 or else. That was just a consideration we could be heading toward trial here in a few weeks and we get called back into session.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stanley said he&#8217;s been hearing &#8220;noise&#8221; that something dealing with skill games could be inserted into the pending budget, but he couldn&#8217;t specify exactly what that might be.</p>
<p>&#8220;I kept hearing in the wind that potentially they were trying to legislate skill games in the budget language,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Those were not just speculations, it was coming from people who would know.&#8221;</p>
<p>The delay, Stanley said, avoids complications in the case and will allow the litigation to proceed when the state&#8217;s posture on skill games is clearer. He also noted the 30-5 law doesn&#8217;t empower him to extend a court injunction unless the court agrees it&#8217;s appropriate.</p>
<p>Stanley acknowledged the delay in the case helps Sadler by allowing his machines to remain in use, but he insisted he would&#8217;ve prevailed at the hearing had it gone forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;So they&#8217;d be on anyway,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>When asked why the state agreed to postpone the case, a Miyares spokeswoman said the attorney general&#8217;s office would not comment on pending litigation.</p>
<p>During his political campaign last year, Miyares attended a meet-and-greet hosted at the Sadler Travel Plaza, according to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=4208652429226749&amp;id=348454381913259" target="_blank">a Facebook post</a> by the Brunswick County Republican Committee that featured a photo of Miyares and other Republicans giving a thumbs-up by the truck stop&#8217;s sign.</p>
<p>Skill machines rapidly spread throughout Virginia convenience stores and gas stations in the last few years, operating in a legal gray area for much of their existence in the state.</p>
<p>Skill-game proponents argue the machines involve just enough skill to avoid gambling restrictions and give small business owners a chance to profit in an industry dominated by bigger, out-of-state gambling interests. Critics say skill-game companies exploited a loophole to set up a lucrative gambling venture in Virginia that went largely unregulated and untaxed until lawmakers moved to crack down.</p>
<p>The legislature moved to ban the machines in 2020, but former Gov. Ralph Northam allowed them to continue for a year to raise money for a COVID-19 relief fund. But Northam insisted on getting rid of the machines in 2021, and the ban took effect on July 1.</p>
<p>The special powers granted to lawyers in the General Assembly have come under increasing scrutiny in recent year, with critics accusing some lawmakers of abusing the privilege to gain an upper hand for paying clients.</p>
<p>In 2020, the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/70b9f61f390f03d86b929e2f6f17ef88" target="_blank">Associated Press reported</a> that Del. Jeff Campbell, R-Smyth, had used his status as a legislator to repeatedly delay a domestic violence case against one of his clients. Campbell also invoked the privilege to cause lengthy delays in a case accusing the Smyth County Board of Supervisors of violating open-meeting laws, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/e3f34f3fefc382486570c2eedfb6400c" target="_blank">according to the AP</a>.</p>
<p>The lawsuit Stanley and others are bringing on Sadler&#8217;s behalf argues, in part, that the ban on skill games violates free speech by singling out digital games for their resemblance to slots while allowing other skill-based arcade games to continue.</p>

Gov. Winsome Sears presides over the Senate. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, the first woman of color elected to statewide office in Virginia, has signed onto an <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20-1199/222877/20220509173517989_20-1199%20and%2021-707%20Amicus%20Robinson%20Supp.%20Pet.pdf" target="_blank">amicus brief</a> asking the U.S. Supreme Court to restrict the use of racial preferences in college admissions by siding with the Asian-American plaintiffs in a pending affirmative action case.</p>
<p>Earle-Sears signed the anti-affirmative action brief along with North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, noting it represents the views of two Black Republicans elected to statewide office in southern states that &#8220;not only formed part of the Confederacy, but also enacted and then enforced Jim Crow laws until the 1960s.&#8221; The brief was filed by lawyers for the Thomas More Society, a conservative legal group.</p>
<p>The 18-page document, which advises the court but has no binding legal weight, takes aim at what it describes as a &#8220;toxic ideology that is increasingly dividing American society based on race&#8221; and argues &#8220;the dream of a colorblind nation continues to be opposed under the pretense of making that dream real.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Students, whether in college or kindergarten, should be educated to engage with an idea’s merits, not the race of an idea’s proponent,&#8221; the brief says. &#8220;Unfortunately, students are taught the exact opposite lesson by the actions of the government itself when it discriminates on the basis of race.&#8221;</p>
<p>The suit against Harvard could lead to the overturning of longstanding legal precedent allowing institutions of higher education to consider race as a factor in admissions to achieve the goal of greater student diversity. The plaintiffs in the case claim Harvard&#8217;s policies have systematically denied equal treatment to Asian-American students by disfavoring them in the admissions process on personal scores to counteract strong academic scores.</p>
<p>Harvard has denied that its policies amount to discrimination, arguing all students benefit from a diverse campus.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the lawsuit against Harvard succeeds, it would diminish students’ opportunities to live and learn in a diverse campus environment—denying them the kind of experiences that are central to Harvard’s educational mission and critical for success in our diverse society,&#8221; the school says on <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/admissionscase/lawsuit/" target="_blank">its website about the case</a>.</p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce/ For The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Two vacant seats in the Virginia Supreme Court hang in the balance in the political standoff in the Virginia Assembly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">State lawmakers said in interviews this week that their negotiations over the justices continue but indicated they are no closer to resolution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We do not have an agreement on how to proceed with the Senate,” Del. Rob Bell, R-Albemarle, chair of the House Courts of Justice committee, told the Mercury. Bell declined to comment further on the specifics of the negotiations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At issue are two of the seven seats in the state Supreme Court. The two seats opened in the last year after Chief Justice Donald Lemons and  Justice William Mims announced their retirements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Selecting justices is a constitutional duty of the General Assembly, which elects the justices by a majority vote. Once elected, a justice can serve for a 12-year term. In recent history Republican legislatures have elected justices as a matter of course. But this year, the appointments are one of many political deadlocks in the current divided legislature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’ve been talking about this since January but there are a couple things that get hung up in it,” Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Bath, co-chair of Senate judiciary committee, told the Mercury.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Deeds said  the “obvious solution” would be to give House Republicans one choice and Senate Democrats another choice. But even if they could agree on those appointments, there are other cascading effects, like if a justice is elevated from the appeals court and has to be replaced. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The solutions are within grasp, we are still talking, still being civil with one another, but the discussions continue,” Deeds said.  “And right now I don’t know if there is anything we can do to force the situation ahead.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Republicans have less incentive to negotiate because if lawmakers adjourn without an agreement, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin has authority to put his own judges on the bench without the legislature’s involvement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Those justices could serve until the end of the year but would have to be confirmed by the legislature when it reconvenes in January. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Former Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe used that tactic to appoint Jane Marum Roush to the state Supreme Court in 2015. Republicans, who controlled both houses of the legislature at the time, then replaced her with Judge Stephen McCullough in 2016.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Deeds said he hopes his Republican colleagues are not stalling to try to punt the decision to the governor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That possibility has crossed my mind more than once, but I am going to give them the benefit of the doubt that they are operating in good faith because we certainly are,” Deeds said. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘It is a bad practice’</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The state Supreme Court vacancies add to a larger list of conflicts lawmakers have had over appointments this year. In February, Democrats </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/02/08/senate-democrats-block-wheeler-appointment/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">rejected Andrew Wheeler</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, Youngkin’s pick for secretary of natural and historic resources. Wheeler is a former coal industry lobbyist and was the controversial head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under President Donald Trump.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Republicans in the House of Delegates then </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/02/15/after-nominee-standoff-youngkin-is-poised-to-appoint-a-majority-on-the-virginia-board-of-education/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">fired back by voting down </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">some of Gov. Ralph Northam’s picks for the Virginia Board of Education, who had spent months already serving on the board while they waited for their confirmation. And in March, </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/03/10/virginia-senate-blocks-youngkins-picks-for-parole-board/." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400"> Senate Democrats voted to block a normally routine resolution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that would have confirmed four of Youngkin’s appointments to the Parole Board and one to the Safety and Health Codes Board</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On top of that, Democrats </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/08/10/virginia-democrats-reshape-court-of-appeals-with-eight-new-appointments/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">voted last year to expand</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> the number of seats on the state’s Court of Appeals and then appointed eight new judges to the court. Several of those judges are considered frontrunners for the Supreme Court nominations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">University of Richmond law professor Carl Tobias says the Supreme Court seats should not become a part of the political maneuvers, that lawmakers should have undertaken their constitutional duty to name successors during the regular session earlier this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It should not be that hard. Democrats get one and Republicans get one and hopefully everybody can vote to elect them and go home. But I don’t think it’s that simple, so we’ll see,” said Tobias</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In practice, the state Supreme Court can still function with five justices instead of seven. And since most of the justices are similarly moderate, it does not drastically affect the balance of the court. But Tobias said the process should be free from political gamesmanship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It is a bad practice, bad for the court and the legislature,” Tobias said.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Does the court reflect Virginia diversity? </h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, members of the organized Jewish community have asked lawmakers and Youngkin to consider a Jewish justice, especially since there has never been a Jewish member of the Virginia Supreme Court in the state’s history. Jeffrey Brooke, a lawyer in Virginia Beach, wrote a letter to lawmakers signed by 18 other lawyers and community leaders. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The undersigned are non-partisan and and at the same time concerned about quotas and religious litmus tests,” the letter states. “But at some point, the citizens of the commonwealth must ask themselves as we do, why  would a religious group which has been so essential for the administration of justice in Virginia be excluded from the Supreme Court bench for all of these centuries?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of the five justices currently on the state Supreme Court, two are women and two are Black. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Elsewhere across the country, many state Supreme Courts do not reflect the diversity of the state they service. As recently as last year, only 58 of the 339 state supreme court justices across the country were people of color, according to a </span><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/state-supreme-court-diversity-april-2021-update" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> from the Brennan Center. The report looked at race, gender and previous careers but not at the religious faith or identify of justices. </span></p>

<p>This week, Goldman sought to introduce the leaked U.S. Supreme Court opinion potentially overturning Roe v. Wade to make a point about the importance of having a correctly proportioned state legislature. Goldman is trying to have the court order new House of Delegates elections this year to remedy Virginia&#8217;s delayed redistricting process, which allowed current House members to win two-year terms in districts that hadn&#8217;t been updated to reflect a decade of population changes.</p>
<p>But the judge appears to be losing patience with Goldman&#8217;s habit of filing motions the court didn&#8217;t ask for.</p>
<p>&#8220;Put simply, Plaintiff should know better,&#8221; Judge David S. Novak of the Eastern District of Virginia wrote in an order issued Thursday. &#8220;Although he is proceeding <em>pro se</em>, Plaintiff himself has decades of experience as a lawyer. Going forward, the court expects that he will refrain from abusing the judicial process and that he will conduct himself in a professional manner.&#8221;</p>
<p>In his motion, Goldman asked the court to admit the leaked abortion opinion as a &#8220;supplemental authority&#8221; because &#8220;the role played by state legislatures such as the General Assembly of Virginia in securing our rights may be headed for significant expansion in the most complicated areas.&#8221;</p>
<p>Novak wasn&#8217;t buying it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither draft opinions nor press reports have <em>any </em>impact on the decisions of this court,&#8221; Novak wrote.</p>

U.S. Senate Democrats on Tuesday pledged a new vote codifying the right to an abortion after publication of a draft court ruling that indicates the Supreme Court is on track to overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade abortion decision. (Marisa Demarco/Source New Mexico)</p><p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Senate Democrats on Tuesday pledged a new vote codifying the right to an abortion after publication of a draft court ruling that indicates the Supreme Court is on track to overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade abortion decision.</p>
<p>Democrats, who likely won’t have the votes to advance that bill, also predicted that abortion will emerge as a major issue in the upcoming midterm elections for members of Congress.</p>
<p>Their comments came as abortion rights supporters across the United States reeled in reaction to the disclosure of the initial draft U.S. Supreme Court opinion, led by Justice Samuel Alito and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473" target="_blank">leaked to Politico. </a>While the court ruling is not final until published, the draft states that earlier abortion decisions “must be overruled.”</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said Tuesday he plans to release a new bill this week that senators will vote on next week to codify Roe v. Wade.</p>
<p>But in the evenly divided Senate, it will run into problems getting past a legislative filibuster that requires 60 votes for legislation to advance.</p>
<p>Were Roe v. Wade to be struck down by the court, which is dominated 6-3 by conservatives, the question would be left up to states, and more than two dozen Republican-led states have been <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/states-rush-revise-their-abortion-laws-major-us-supreme-court-decision-nears" target="_blank">racing to enact abortion bans and restrictions.</a></p>
<p>Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts said <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/read-justice-alito-initial-abortion-opinion-overturn-roe-v-wade-pdf-00029504" target="_blank">the draft</a>, published on Monday night, was authentic, though he cautioned it wasn’t the final opinion, and said he’d directed the Marshal of the Court to investigate the leak.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/MarkWarner/status/1521467172656226304?s=20&#038;t=atpM4zafkC55s7DguKcdsA</p>
<p>Republicans called for the Justice Department to also investigate how the draft made its way to two journalists, saying the leak was a violation of the court’s judicial process.</p>
<p>Roberts said the leak of the document was wrong.</p>
<p>“Court employees have an exemplary and important tradition of respecting the confidentiality of the judicial process and upholding the trust of the Court,” Roberts said in the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/press/pressreleases/pr_05-03-22" target="_blank">statement</a>. “This was a singular and egregious breach of that trust that is an affront to the Court and the community of public servants who work here.”</p>
<p>The court is expected to release its official ruling in the case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, within the next two months, though many organizations have long expected the six conservative justices to at least pare back the constitutional right to an abortion.</p>
<p>Democratic senators on Tuesday said a final decision undoing the constitutional right to an abortion the Supreme Court established five decades ago would be unacceptable and harmful to women.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/timkaine/status/1521452918351802370?s=20&#038;t=atpM4zafkC55s7DguKcdsA</p>
<p>Montana Democratic Sen. Jon Tester said letting each state, once again, set its own abortion laws would be a “step in the wrong direction.”</p>
<p>“I think that a woman&#8217;s right to choose, a woman&#8217;s right to make their own health care decisions is really fundamental to who we are as a nation,” Tester said.</p>
<p>Washington Democratic Sen. Patty Murray criticized the conservative justices for moving to undo nationwide protections for people seeking to terminate a pregnancy.</p>
<p>“We do not want this to become a country where women are forced to remain pregnant no matter their personal circumstances and yes, we are talking about situations like rape and incest,” Murray said.</p>
<p>“A country where extreme politicians will control patients’ most private decisions. A country where for the very first time ever the next generation of women will have fewer rights than their mothers.”</p>
<p>Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said abortion rights will become a “major issue” in November’s midterms elections.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;ve seen legislation being passed in state legislatures across the country to limit reproductive freedom for women. But there was always the belief that Roe versus Wade was there,” Peters said. “If Roe versus Wade is overturned. It&#8217;s a completely different ballgame.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">60 votes needed</h4>

	
<p>In the Senate, Democrats would need 60 senators to vote to get past the legislative filibuster and actually pass legislation codifying abortion access throughout the country. Those votes would be required to end debate and move on to final passage, which is a simple majority vote.</p>
<p>Peters, asked if Democrats could somehow get to a 60-seat majority in the midterm elections, said “it would be pretty difficult to get there.”</p>
<p>While the entire U.S. House — an increasing number of whom represent gerrymandered districts — will be up for reelection in November, just one-third of the U.S. Senate will face voters.</p>
<p>This year that will be 35 seats, with 14 occupied by Democrats and 21 filled by Republicans.</p>

    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Senators’ positions </h4>

	
<p>Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock said he’s going to “do everything” he can to “support reproductive rights.”</p>
<p>He’s one of many Senate Democrats who support eliminating the filibuster.</p>
<p>“No Senate procedure should get in the way of basic civil rights — voting rights, reproductive rights,” Warnock said.</p>
<p>Arizona Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly isn’t as convinced that the Senate should change its procedures, but didn’t rule out backing a change to how bills are processed.</p>
<p>“If there is a proposal to change the rules, I will make a decision on what is in the best interest of the country and the folks I represent in Arizona,” Kelly said.</p>
<p>Fellow Arizona Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema doesn’t back such a change and neither does West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin III.</p>
<p>That means Senate Democrats don’t have the votes during this Congress to codify abortion rights or change the rules to make it easier to pass abortion rights legislation.</p>
<p>If Democrats lose control of the Senate following the midterm elections, Republicans are expected to keep the filibuster in place.</p>
<p>Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said Tuesday he would “absolutely” commit to keeping it intact.</p>
<p>“We don&#8217;t want to break the Senate and that&#8217;s breaking the Senate,” he said.</p>
<p>McConnell declined to answer questions on how a final Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade would affect women throughout the country or whether he’d bring legislation to the floor to address federal abortion laws.</p>
<p>“All of this puts the cart before the horse,” he said.</p>
<p>National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Rick Scott, a Florida Republican senator, declined to say if the Supreme Court overturning abortion as a fundamental right would affect the election.</p>
<p>“I think this is an important issue to many people, but so is inflation, so is crime, so is the border,” Scott said. “So, these are important to people and people are gonna be passionate about this. And we ought to be passionate about what we believe in.”</p>
<p>Scott — who infuriated many fellow GOP senators earlier this year when he released an 11-point plan without leadership approval — declined to say if the GOP would try to pass a bill banning abortion nationwide if they gain control of the Senate in the midterms.</p>
<p>“We’ll worry about that next year,” Scott said.</p>

    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Inconsistent’ justices</h4>

	
<p>While many Senate Republicans oppose abortion rights and would support the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, two expressed frustration with the possibility.</p>
<p>Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins — who voted to confirm Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, but not Amy Coney Barrett— said in a statement that “If this leaked draft opinion is the final decision and this reporting is accurate, it would be completely inconsistent with what Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh said in their hearings and in our meetings in my office.”</p>
<p>Collins declined to answer reporters’ questions throughout the morning, simply saying she’d released a statement.</p>
<p>Alaska GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski — who supported Gorsuch and Barrett, but not Kavanaugh — told reporters that certain justices voting to overturn precedent would erode her confidence in the court.</p>
<p>“If in fact this draft is where the Court ends up being, it has rocked my confidence in the court. That is because I think there were some representations made with regards to precedent and settled,” Murkowski. “Comments were made to me and to others about Roe being settled and being precedent.”</p>
<p>When the Senate <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1172/vote_117_2_00065.htm" target="_blank">took a procedural vote</a> in February on a House-passed <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3755" target="_blank">bill</a> that would codify the right to an abortion, Collins, Murkowski and Manchin all voted against moving to final passage.</p>
<p>Schumer said he expects a new vote could be different from the one taken just over two months ago.</p>
<p>“It’s a different world now, the tectonic plates of our politics on women’s choice and on rights in general are changing,” Schumer said.</p>
<p>“Every senator, now under the real glare of Roe v. Wade being repealed by the courts, is going to have to show which side they’re on. And we will find the best way to go forward after that. But don’t think that what happened two (months) ago will be exactly the same.”</p>

School re-openings were a controversial part of the Coronavirus pandemic, COVID-19 pandemic during 2020 and 2021. (Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Who will benefit from the appeal of a </span><a href="https://wtop.com/virginia/2022/03/judge-rules-in-favor-of-immunocompromised-students-but-masking-still-optional-in-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">federal court ruling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> – sought by Gov. Glenn Youngkin, Attorney General Jason Miyares and other administration officials – that would challenge whether 12 students with serious health problems can legally ask classmates and teachers to continue to wear masks?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Certainly not the overwhelmingly majority of public school students in Virginia. Youngkin’s first-day-in-office </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/74---eo/74---eo/EO-2---School-Mask-Mandate-Executive-Order-Exception.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">executive order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> giving parents the option to mask their children, and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+SB739" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">a subsequent bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> passed by the General Assembly effective March 1 doing the same thing, mean the subject is basically moot. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Those moves happened even as the pandemic continues. (The death toll in America from COVID-19 is more than </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths/?itid=hp_pandemic_gfx/&amp;state=US" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">991,000</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, though the recent trend is positive. </span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/see-the-numbers/covid-19-in-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">More than 20,200</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> Virginians have died since early 2020.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The 12 children with a variety of serious illnesses don’t benefit from the administration’s posturing, either. They’re at a greater risk of catching COVID-19 – and possibly dying. These young people have cancer, cystic fibrosis, asthma and more. The issue is far from an intellectual one for them and their parents. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They gain nothing from the Youngkin administration’s <a href="https://wtop.com/virginia/2022/04/va-appeals-mask-ruling-for-12-immunocompromised-students/" target="_blank">harsh publicity stunt</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, this is all about scoring political points and making hay for the next election. Republicans Youngkin, Miyares and others in the administration seek total domination of the mask-optional initiatives. Even though they essentially have it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Their message to the small handful of families trying to get their youngsters back in school safely? Pfft. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/virginia/vp-nw-virginia-judge-ruling-kids-20220324-53cn5i7sb5gf5hcxxygdw345rm-story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">U.S. District Judge Norman Moon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> ruled in late March that the specific 12 students could ask their schools to mandate masking. The families, with the help of the Virginia ACLU and other groups, </span><a href="https://acluva.org/en/press-releases/parents-students-disabilities-file-suit-stop-youngkins-no-mask-mandate" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">said the mask-optional policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> effectively kept their children out of school. That’s a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, they contend. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Moon also took pains to note the executive order and state law remain in effect. As the Associated Press reported, families of other disabled children would have to make their own pleas for relief. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is not a class action,” Moon wrote, “and the 12 plaintiffs in this case have no legal right to ask the Court to deviate from that state law in any schools in Virginia (much less school districts) their children do not attend, or indeed even those areas of their schools in which plaintiffs’ children do not frequent.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That means the Youngkin administration and Miyares got practically everything they wanted. Nor do the school divisions have to grant the families’ requests for mandatory masking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wondered why Miyares appealed. His spokeswoman, Victoria LaCivita, declined to comment on “active litigation.” Nor did the attorney general’s website have any news on the issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I requested Youngkin’s reasoning for the appeal, his spokeswoman referred me to Miyares’ office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaitlin Banner is deputy legal director for the Washington Lawyers’ Committee, one of the groups that assisted the 12 families of children with serious illnesses. She told me several of the students are back in school since Judge Moon’s ruling. She said he looked properly at the ADA and determined “that students have the right to attend schools safely.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One parent upset by the administration’s decision to appeal is Chris Seaman, who lives in Crozet and is the father of an 8-year-old boy fighting leukemia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s really a slap in the face, to be honest,” Seaman told me by phone this week. “We just want to be able to get our kids to go to school in a safe environment.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seaman’s son and a younger sibling have attended Brownsville Elementary in Albemarle County. The third-grader has been learning remotely because he’s undergone chemotherapy, T-cell therapy and a bone marrow transplant over the years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But his family wants him to return. They have a meeting scheduled this week with school administrators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m hopeful they’ll be willing to give us the accommodation” that his son’s classmates and instructors wear masks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Here’s what Seaman and his wife have done since their older son was diagnosed with cancer more than three years ago: There have been weekly, then monthly, trips to Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, where the boy was in a clinical trial. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The journey is five hours one-way. They’ve made the trip dozens of times. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though their child is now in remission, Seaman said, he’s still taking several medications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If he gets COVID, and he’s immunocompromised, he would be at higher risk for severe disease,” the father said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Parents in the local community have been supportive of the family. People have told him they’ll continue to mask, Seaman said, “and we’re grateful for that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His view of the state officials appealing Judge Moon’s ruling? “It feels like they’re deliberately targeting our kids,” Seaman said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Indeed. And for what?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Miyares, Youngkin &amp; Co. should declare victory and drop the appeal. They’ve won their assault on mandatory masking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What they don’t want is for some of the dozen children to die from COVID-19, possibly spread by a classmate or educator. They would then have to explain why they were so adamant about their legal – and political – agenda on masks in schools. </span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce/ For The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a 4-2 <a href="https://www.vacourts.gov/opinions/opnscvwp/1210489.pdf" target="_blank">opinion</a>, the Supreme Court of Virginia refused to unseal judicial disciplinary records detailing why a Virginia Beach judge was suspended from the bench amid controversy over her past tenure as chair of the Virginia Parole Board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judge Adrianne Bennett, who joined the Virginia Beach Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court after stepping down from the Parole Board in early 2020, had asked the Supreme Court to intervene in her case before the Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission, which investigates accusations of judicial misconduct.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Supreme Court declined to get involved, but sealed key documents in the case that would have shed light on the inquiry into Bennett, who is still listed as a presiding judge on her courthouse’s website. The Richmond Times-Dispatch challenged that decision, asking the court to unseal records that, by law, typically lose their confidential status if they rise to the state’s highest court.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the court agreed to unseal legal filings in the case, a majority of the justices concluded the JIRC records themselves should remain under seal to protect the disciplinary process for judges. Bennett herself attached those records to a filing in the Supreme Court, but the majority said that wasn’t enough to nullify the confidentiality of JIRC proceedings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If a litigant could bypass the confidentiality of judicial disciplinary proceedings by simply attaching a record of those proceedings to a pleading, the confidentiality protections would be largely illusory,” the majority wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a strongly worded dissent, Justices D. Arthur Kelsey and Teresa M. Chafin argued the majority opinion cuts against the principle that court business should be open to the public.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Judge Bennett filed a mandamus action in the Supreme Court of Virginia asking us to order the Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission (“JIRC”) to reinstate her to the bench,” Kelsey wrote in the dissent. “From the start, Judge Bennett made clear that she did not want anyone but us to see the reason why JIRC had suspended her. The majority holds that Judge Bennett has a statutory right to keep that information secret and that the public has no constitutional right to break the seal of secrecy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Mercury requested the unsealed records from the Supreme Court but had not received them as of Thursday afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a series of watchdog reports last year, the state’s Office of the Inspector General found Bennett’s Parole Board violated its own policies and state law in a series of controversial release decisions made just before she left in early 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most notably, Bennett was accused of forgoing neutrality to act as an advocate for Vincent Martin, an inmate who was released that year after serving 40 years in prison for the murder of a Richmond police officer in 1979. A draft OSIG report leaked to the media last year included an allegation Bennett told a hearing examiner there was no need to conduct a new parole interview with Martin and that a 2018 interview report could be submitted as “their own,” an instruction at least one Parole Board staffer felt could be construed as falsifying official records. That allegation was dropped from the final watchdog report released to the General Assembly and the media.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The secrecy surrounding the process has made it difficult to determine whether the JIRC proceedings against Bennett were connected to the allegations of misconduct by the Parole Board she led. The </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/records-judge-adrianne-bennett-the-former-parole-board-chairwoman-on-extended-leave/article_fc6b0258-9df3-5594-89d7-2b40f5841365.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Times-Dispatch reported last year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Bennett was on “extended leave.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lee Floyd, an attorney representing Bennett, applauded the Supreme Court’s ruling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Today’s decision from the Virginia Supreme Court struck the careful balance between the fundamental notion of public access to the courts and the statutory safeguards that protect judges from unwarranted complaints,” Floyd said. “Judge Bennett continues to serve honorably on the bench.”</span></p>
<p>Floyd would not comment further when asked to elaborate on the reason for Bennett&#8217;s suspension.</p>
<p><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title17.1/chapter9/section17.1-911/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">State law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allows JIRC to temporarily suspend judges during a pending investigation if it finds the judge’s continued presence on the bench presents “a substantial and immediate threat to the public interest in the administration of justice.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JIRC Counsel Ray Morrogh said he could not offer any additional comment on the case, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">given the court’s order and the confidential nature of the proceedings.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disciplinary options available to JIRC include informal talking-tos, heightened supervision and permanent removal from the bench, depending on the severity of the offense. But the commission has strict confidentiality rules surrounding that process. Even when the commission makes an adverse finding against a judge, according to JIRC rules, those records are supposed to be destroyed “upon the judge’s death, resignation or retirement not subject to recall.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proceedings that lead to a formal complaint being filed with the Supreme Court are supposed to be open under state law, a fact the dissenting justices noted. That law says “the record of any proceeding filed with the Supreme Court shall lose its confidential character.”</span></p>
<p>“This is one of those occasions in which, despite the sometimes anfractuous lexicon of the law, simple words have simple meanings,” the dissenting justices wrote. “<em>Any</em> JIRC proceeding includes the one involving Judge Bennett. <em>Filed</em> includes the JIRC documents she filed with the Supreme Court. And <em>shall lose its confidential character</em> means that the JIRC record cannot (as opposed to may or may not) be hidden from the public.”</p>

(Graham Moomaw / Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three Virginians and a company run by one </span><a href="https://pacificlegal.org/press-release/virginia-property-owners-sue-over-states-law-that-allows-hunters-to-violate-private-property-rights-when-retrieving-hunting-dogs/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are suing Virginia’s Department of Wildlife Resources</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the state’s controversial right to retrieve law, which allows hunters to go onto private property to retrieve hunting dogs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of the plaintiffs have “been subject to repeated invasions by hunters and their dogs acting under color of lawful authority,” argues <a href="https://pacificlegal.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/2022.04.12-Medeiros-v.-DWR-PLF-Petition.pdf" target="_blank">the suit</a>, which was filed Tuesday in Henrico Circuit Court, where DWR is headquartered. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those invasions, they say, have led to damages including livestock deaths and loss of business as well as “a diminution in the value of their properties.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This case goes to the very definition of private property,” said Daniel Woislaw, the lead attorney for the plaintiffs in the suit. “The right to exclude trespassers from private property is one of the fundamental things that makes property private. And when the government takes away that right, then it has to compensate property owners for that under the Constitution.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DWR spokesperson Paige Pearson said Thursday that the agency hasn’t yet been served with the suit.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right to retrieve has been a perennial point of strife in Virginia, particularly in its eastern region where populations are increasing and the use of dogs to hunt deer is a longstanding tradition. There, conflicts have become so heated that some landowners angry at hunters’ presence have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">even begun setting snare traps for hounds</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a deterrent — a development that led one lawmaker to <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/02/03/house-panel-shows-little-appetite-for-hunting-law-changes/" target="_blank">present legislation banning the traps</a> during the most recent General Assembly session. (The proposal failed.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, the General Assembly has upheld the 1938 law, </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginias-unique-right-to-retrieve-remains-intact/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most recently rejecting proposals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to prohibit anyone with a trespassing conviction from exercising the right or to attempt to notify the landowner before entering a private property. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The suit filed in Henrico Circuit Tuesday is being brought by Dinwiddie farmer James Medeiros, Halifax recreational hunting business owner Robert Pierce and Chesterfield horse-boarding business owner Mauricio Tovar. Pierce’s business, Blue Wing LLC, is also listed as a plaintiff. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All four outline various harms they say they have suffered as a result of hunters being allowed to enter their property to retrieve their dogs. Medeiros said dogs have killed his chickens, led to cattle injuries and caused “disruptions to his family life and business operations.” Pierce said posts have been pulled from his gates by hunters seeking their dogs and that lawful users of his recreational hunting property have been repeatedly disrupted, leading to the loss of customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The hunting dogs have become such a nuisance on the Blue Wing Property that Mr. Pierce has installed a kennel to house dogs that can be captured and kept awaiting retrieval by their owners,” the suit alleges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plaintiffs are seeking a ruling that Virginia’s right to retrieve law constitutes “an uncompensated physical taking of their property” and are asking for compensation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm they have retained, the national Pacific Legal Foundation, also represented property owners in the recent U.S. Supreme Court case </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cedar Point Nursery v. Hassid</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where the court found that a California regulation allowing union organizers access to private property constituted a taking that would require compensation to property owners. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the court’s opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts quoted earlier Supreme Court rulings to conclude that “the right to exclude is ‘universally held to be a fundamental element of the property right,’ and is ‘one of the most essential sticks in the bundle of rights that are commonly characterized as property.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the June 2021 ruling, Virginia wildlife officials have several times voiced questions about what the Cedar Point case </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">will mean for the state’s right to retrieve law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It does clearly perhaps have some applicability with respect to the right to retrieve,” said Virginia Board of Wildlife Resources Chair John Daniel during a meeting several weeks after the decision. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s going on here is similar to what happened in Cedar Point Nursery,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” said Woislaw. “Here, you have hundreds being given the right to enter on private property.” </span></p>

(Laura Olson/ States Newsroom) </p><p>WASHINGTON — A U.S. Supreme Court dominated by conservative justices could fundamentally reshape the college admissions process later this year when it takes up two landmark cases challenging affirmative action in higher education.</p>
<p>The court recently agreed to hear two cases that challenge race-conscious admissions programs at<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20-1199/169941/20210225095525027_Harvard%20Cert%20Petn%20Feb%2025.pdf" target="_blank"> Harvard University</a> the nation&#8217;s oldest private university and the<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/21/21-707/199684/20211111164129792_UNC%20Cert%20Petition%20-%20Nov%2011%20-%20330pm%20002.pdf" target="_blank"> University of North Carolina, one of its oldest public ones</a>. The decision to take up these cases indicates the conservative justices who now make up a 6-3 majority of the bench could be poised to make significant changes to the legal standard on affirmative action, according to legal experts.</p>
<p>However, one voice that would likely not be heard on the decision is that of Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson, a Harvard graduate. Jackson has been nominated by President Joe Biden to replace Justice Stephen Breyer, a member of the liberal faction on the court who announced earlier this year he would step down at the end of the current term.</p>
<p>Jackson said March 23 at her Senate confirmation hearings that she would recuse herself if confirmed as a justice before the court hears the marquee cases this fall.</p>
<p>Jackson, who would be the first Black woman on the Supreme Court if confirmed, is a graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School and will complete a six-year term on the Harvard Board of Overseers this spring.</p>
<p>When questioned about the potential conflict of interest, Jackson was unequivocal.</p>
<p>“If you’re confirmed, do you intend to recuse from this lawsuit?” Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said of the affirmative action case.</p>
<p>“That is my plan, senator,” Jackson said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Discrimination argued</h4>

	
<p>The cases against Harvard and North Carolina argue that Asian American students have suffered discrimination in the admissions process at both schools. Those familiar with the cases say they could open the door for a significant ruling.</p>
<p>“I think this could pose a very real threat to the ability of schools to pursue diversity as well as equity in their admissions process, as well as in the way they shape and think about the academic environment that is created on higher education campuses,”  said Sarah Hinger, a staff attorney in the racial justice program at the American Civil Liberties Union.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court last ruled on an affirmative action case in 2016, recent history in the timeline of case law. Taking up a related case so soon indicates the court may be intending to revisit the precedent on the constitutionality of race in college admissions.</p>
<p>The potential shakeup comes as many colleges are shifting away from a reliance on standardized test scores, a trend that grew out of the educational disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic. Scores traditionally have been relied upon by many colleges and universities in their admissions processes, despite arguments by some that they are not as good a predictor of a student’s success as a high school GPA.</p>
<p>Harvard University recently<a href="https://college.harvard.edu/about/news-announcements/admissions-update-2023-2026-application-cycles" target="_blank"> made standardized test scores optional</a> for the next four years. And leaders in Iowa, Colorado, Montana, Illinois and Washington have made tests optional for admission to many of their public colleges and universities.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the plaintiffs at the Supreme Court want universities to have a more objective admissions process.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCOURTS-mad-1_14-cv-14176/pdf/USCOURTS-mad-1_14-cv-14176-4.pdf" target="_blank"> case against Harvard</a> argues it discriminates against Asian American students by using subjective standards to weigh admissions. According to the group, Asian American applicants are significantly less likely to be admitted to Harvard than similarly qualified white, Black or Hispanic applicants.</p>
<p>In the<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/USCOURTS-ncmd-1_14-cv-00954" target="_blank"> North Carolina case</a>, the plaintiffs argue the university&#8217;s consideration of race in the application process violates the Constitution and discriminates against white and Asian American applicants by giving preference to Black, Native American or Hispanic applicants.</p>
<p>Both cases have been pursued by a nonprofit, <a href="https://studentsforfairadmissions.org/" target="_blank">Students for Fair Admissions</a>. The president of the group is Edward Blum, a retired financier who has launched other lawsuits against the use of race in the college admissions process.</p>
<p>Blum says UNC and Harvard have “racially gerrymandered” their freshman classes and should use an admissions process that is blind to race.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are grateful the Supreme Court accepted these important cases for review. It is our hope that the justices will end the use of race as an admissions factor at Harvard, UNC and all colleges and universities,” Blum said in a statement.</p>
<p>Both universities have<a href="https://admissionslawsuit.unc.edu/" target="_blank"> defended their processes</a> as consistent with the law and denied discrimination against other applicants.</p>
<p>“The Supreme Court decision to review the unanimous decisions of the lower federal courts puts at risk 40 years of legal precedent granting colleges and universities the freedom and flexibility to create diverse campus communities,” Harvard President Lawrence Bacow said in a statement.</p>
<p>“Considering race as one factor among many in admissions decisions produces a more diverse student body which strengthens the learning environment for all.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The ‘plus factor’</h4>

	
<p>Since 1978, the Supreme Court has maintained that colleges and universities may consider race or ethnicity as a “plus factor” in admissions to try to create more diversity on campuses. Schools cannot have racial quotas or use race as a sole determining factor.</p>
<p>But the victories for affirmative action were narrow in the last three different Supreme Court decisions, where the justices split 5-4, 5-4 and 4-3 to uphold its constitutionality.</p>
<p>Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito were the<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-981_4g15.PDF" target="_blank"> dissenters</a> in the 2016 decision. Now they have three more conservatives on the bench with them: Brett Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch.</p>
<p>“Affirmative action has survived by only one vote, literally, for the past 45 years,” said Kevin Brown, law professor at Indiana University’s Maurer School of Law.  “What makes it more problematic this time is the lineup of the court is more conservative, so we might end up with a different judgment.”</p>
<p>If the Supreme Court prohibits the consideration of race in applications, Brown and other scholars predict lower enrollments from historically underrepresented minorities, especially Black and Latino students.</p>
<p>The most profound effects would play out in selective universities and graduate programs, where more of the “plus factor” comes into play to narrow down the abundance of highly qualified candidates that exceed available spots.</p>
<p>Brown said it could have negative effects not only for those that do not get the opportunity to go to those schools, but also for the students in less diverse classrooms.</p>
<p>For example, he said many of his students come to law school with few experiences around people of color. And the conversations in his race and law course are much richer when Black and Latino students are in the room.</p>
<p>“We are running the tremendous risk of putting people in positions of power who know very little about half the population,” Brown said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Increasing diversity</h4>

	
<p>Affirmative action policies were designed to increase diversity on campus and respond to a history of inequality and segregation in the United States, where students of color were kept out of many schools for years.</p>
<p>President Lyndon B. Johnson described the policy in a<a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/commencement-address-howard-university-fulfill-these-rights" target="_blank"> commencement address at Howard University</a>  on June 4, 1965. “You do not take a person who, for years, has been hobbled by chains and liberate him, bring him up to the starting line of a race and then say, ‘you are free to compete with all the others,’ and still justly believe that you have been completely fair.”</p>
<p>But the policies have been controversial.  A 2019 <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/FT_19.02.25_Admissions_Topline.pdf" target="_blank">Pew Research Center survey</a>  found that nearly three-fourths of respondents said colleges and universities should not consider race or ethnicity when making decisions about student enrollment.</p>
<p>Some states have banned affirmative action over the past 26 years. Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Oklahoma and Washington all have bans, mostly through ballot initiatives or legislative referenda. The Supreme Court reversed a Texas ban in 2003.</p>
<p>Those states may offer some indication of what could happen if the Supreme Court overturns affirmative action. In states with a ban,<a href="http://jhr.uwpress.org/content/47/2/435.short?casa_token=kYjdLKqTAfsAAAAA:WEJ8idc1spqFkSNBlZWN05hPhXb2B7SWGH-9oRBueh4Qxvzf8RzuqPEFkrGaZITnpBPzJAV4zQ" target="_blank"> researchers have found</a> that enrollment of under-represented minorities, especially Black and Latino students, decreased at selective institutions, graduate and professional schools.</p>
<p><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/stoken/default+domain/UH4YSS3QHRCBY2VJEKPT/full" target="_blank">A 2020 study</a> from researchers at the University of Washington and Brookings Institution found &#8220;persistent declines in the share of underrepresented minorities&#8221; at flagship universities in the states with an affirmative action ban.</p>
<p>This is despite efforts in some colleges to try other tactics to help make their colleges more diverse, like admitting the top 10 percent of each high school class or accounting for socio-economic status.</p>
<p>“The danger is a Supreme Court decision that outlaws affirmative action or racial awareness as a college builds a class of students at a school, will result in lower enrollment, especially of Black students, at our most elite colleges,” said Robert Shireman, who studies higher education as a fellow at The Century Foundation.</p>
<p>But many colleges and universities have already seen waning enrollment of Black students in recent years.</p>
<p>An analysis of federal data from before the pandemic found overall declines in college enrollment nationwide and especially among Black students, whose enrollment declines exceeded changes in population growth, according to a<a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/time-worry-college-enrollment-declines-among-black-students/" target="_blank"> report from the Center for American Progress</a>.</p>
<p>Jared Bass, senior director for higher education at the Center for American Progress, said those declines have continued through the pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are seeing a decline among Black students in higher education, and this is also feeding into the concern about representation in highly selective institutions,&#8221; said  Bass. &#8220;It is definitely a concern when you think about the college culture and the students impacted.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bass and other experts are worried that if the court bans affirmative action, those gaps could be even bigger , especially at highly selective schools. When college admissions officers consider a student&#8217;s race, it is part of a holistic assessment of the pool of qualified students to try to bring in a balanced and diverse set of students.</p>
<p>In an<a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/14-981-bsac-California.pdf" target="_blank"> amicus brief</a> to the Supreme Court in 2015, the state of California said that as a result of its affirmative action ban, the University of California has struggled to attain a level of racial diversity on its campuses that reflects the state. Vice President Kamala Harris, then the attorney general for the state, led the brief.</p>

(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)</p><p>Two dozen congressional Democrats are calling for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas to recuse himself from cases involving the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, following revelations his wife communicated with the Trump White House about overturning the election. No members of Virginia&#8217;s delegation signed the letter.</p>
<p>In addition, it appears likely that the U.S. House committee probing the attack will ask Virginia “Ginni” Thomas, a Nebraska native and longtime conservative activist, to answer questions about her recently disclosed text messages as the panel’s investigation steps up.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2022.3.29%20Letter%20to%20Roberts%20and%20Thomas%20on%20SCOTUS%20Ethics.pdf" target="_blank">a Monday letter</a> to Chief Justice John Roberts and Thomas, the 24 Democrats from both chambers of Congress cited recently published texts between Ginni Thomas and then-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, a former North Carolina congressman.</p>
<p>The Democrats said the texts present a serious conflict of interest for Clarence Thomas and a court that is unique in not being governed by a code of ethics.</p>
<p>In the 29 texts, first reported by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/24/virginia-thomas-mark-meadows-texts/" target="_blank">The Washington Post</a> and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ginni-thomas-clarence-wife-mark-meadows-texts-2020-election-overturn/" target="_blank">CBS News</a>, Ginni Thomas urged Meadows to resist the results of the 2020 election: “Help This Great President stand firm, Mark!!!&#8230;You are the leader, with him, who is standing for America’s constitutional governance at the precipice. The majority knows Biden and the Left is attempting the greatest Heist of our History.”</p>
<p>Many of former President Donald Trump’s supporters, including <a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/03/03/a-year-after-jan-6-attack-on-the-u-s-capitol-lives-on-in-hundreds-of-court-cases/" target="_blank">those who breached the Capitol on Jan. 6</a>, contend the election was somehow stolen, though there is no evidence to support the claim.</p>
<p>The correspondence, given to the Jan. 6 panel by Meadows, documents a closer relationship between Ginni Thomas and the White House than was previously known, though she had publicly advocated for Trump and allies to try to reverse the election results.</p>
<p>The texts “raise serious questions about Justice Thomas’s participation in cases before the Supreme Court involving the 2020 election and the January 6th insurrection,” the congressional Democrats wrote.</p>
<p>Clarence Thomas, the longest-serving member of the court and a stalwart member of its conservative wing, was the only justice to disagree with a ruling allowing the Jan. 6 committee access to Trump White House records.</p>
<p>He did not disclose at the time his wife’s activism on the issue, or that her messages could be part of the records being sought.</p>
<p>In addition to Thomas recusing himself from future cases, the lawmakers said the court should adopt a formal code of ethics to govern future situations. They asked for Roberts to commit to creating a “binding Code of Conduct” by April 28. The Supreme Court is the only court in the country that is not formally governed by any code of ethics, they said.</p>
<p>The Democrats also asked for a written explanation from Thomas for why he declined to recuse himself from the case concerning White House records.</p>
<p>The group was led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington and includes Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden of Oregon, and Reps. Cori Bush of Missouri, Steve Cohen of Tennessee, Deborah Ross of North Carolina and Hank Johnson of Georgia.</p>
<p>Johnson also is calling for legislation to be passed which would require the Judicial Conference of the United States to create a code of ethical conduct for the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Representatives for the court did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.</p>
<p>In the texts, Ginni Thomas professed beliefs in far-right conspiracy theories, including that Trump had watermarked ballots to track potential fraud and that supporters of Joe Biden would face military tribunals for sedition at the U.S. Naval Base in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.</p>
<p>She also provided unsolicited advice to Meadows about Trump’s legal team and strategy as the lame-duck president sought to challenge the election in court.</p>
<p>Meadows was generally supportive of Thomas’ efforts, but noncommittal about her specific recommendations.</p>
<p>“I will stand firm,” he wrote in a Nov. 10 text. “We will fight until there is no fight left. Our country is too precious to give up on. Thanks for all you do.”</p>
<p>Though he did not sign the Democrats’ letter, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told reporters Tuesday Clarence Thomas should recuse himself from future cases involving Jan. 6.</p>
<p>Other Democrats, including <a href="https://twitter.com/RepHankJohnson/status/1508846119001882627" target="_blank">Johnson</a> and New York Rep. Alexandria <a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1508789261730041859" target="_blank">Ocasio-Cortez</a>, have gone further and called for Justice Thomas to resign or be impeached.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Committee action</h4>

	
<p>The House Jan. 6 committee is considering questioning Ginni Thomas, according to media reports.</p>
<p>CNN <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/28/politics/january-6-committee-ginni-thomas/index.html" target="_blank">reported Monday</a> that “most” members of the committee favor questioning her.</p>
<p>Members of the panel, which is made up of seven Democrats and two Republicans, did not discuss that possibility in a Monday evening meeting.</p>
<p>A spokesman for committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., did not respond to a message seeking comment Tuesday. A spokesman for committee Vice Chair Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., declined to comment.</p>
<p>The panel on Monday did adopt a report recommending that the U.S. House cite Daniel Scavino, Jr. and Peter Navarro, both Trump administration officials, for criminal contempt of Congress. If the House agrees, the referral would be sent to the Department of Justice.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Coup in search of a legal theory’</h4>

	
<p>Several cases involving the 2020 election and its aftermath are working their way through federal courts.</p>
<p>A federal judge found Monday that Trump and legal adviser John Eastman likely broke the law in their efforts to challenge the 2020 election.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Court Judge David O. Carter ordered Eastman to hand over documents to the Jan. 6 panel, denying Eastman’s claim for attorney-client privilege because that privilege does not extend to unlawful acts.</p>
<p>“Dr. Eastman and President Trump launched a campaign to overturn a democratic election, an action unprecedented in American history,” <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/eastman-select-committee-order.pdf" target="_blank">the judge wrote</a>.</p>
<p>“Their campaign was not confined to the ivory tower — it was a coup in search of a legal theory. The plan spurred violent attack on the seat of our nation’s government, led to the death of several law enforcement officers, and deepened public distrust in our political process.”</p>

(Screenshot/ Senate Judiciary Committee feed)</p><p>WASHINGTON – Representatives of the American Bar Association reiterated their finding that Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson is well qualified to sit on the U.S. Supreme Court, and law enforcement groups rebutted GOP accusations Jackson is soft on child pornographers during the final day of Jackson’s confirmation hearings Thursday.</p>
<p>Republicans, however, called in witnesses to continue hammering away at Jackson’s record, while the Democratic chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee singled out Republican Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Ben Sasse of Nebraska for praise for not joining in attacks on Jackson.</p>
<p>Sasse <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/what-senators-asked-ketanji-brown-jackson-third-day-us-supreme-court-hearings" target="_blank">remarked Wednesday</a> that some senators had a habit of “jackassery” in their bids for camera attention.</p>
<p>Following <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/ketanji-brown-jackson-defends-her-record-under-grilling-us-senate-republicans" target="_blank">two days</a> of sometimes <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/gop-senators-attack-interrupt-final-day-questioning-supreme-court-nominee" target="_blank">intense questioning</a> of Jackson, Thursday’s hearing was more relaxed as senators questioned three members of the ABA’s Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary and other outside witnesses.</p>
<p>Jackson was absent from the hearing, since nominees do not normally attend, as were several members of the committee.</p>
<p>The ABA panel had given Jackson its highest rating of “well-qualified” for the Supreme Court, and the three lead evaluators of the standing committee gave glowing reviews of Jackson’s record to the senators. They said 250 judges, attorneys and academics with first-hand experience working with Jackson found she had the highest integrity and intellect and was unfailingly fair.</p>
<p>“Everyone we talked to, interviewed or had substantive contact with uniformly gave the highest praise: brilliant, beyond reproach, first-rate, patient, insightful, impeccable, A-plus,” Ann Claire Williams, a retired federal judge said.</p>
<p>The evaluators also said Jackson was undeniably within the mainstream in her sentencing practices, a focal point of criticism from some Republicans who attacked the sentences she gave child pornography offenders.</p>
<p>The group’s review included evaluations from prosecutors, none of whom judged Jackson to be soft on crime, as some Republicans on the panel tried to paint her during the previous three days of hearings.</p>
<p>“One prosecutor stated that Judge Jackson was generally regarded by his office as ‘a good draw,’ because as he put it, ‘She is a smart judge without any biases, which is all we&#8217;re asking for,’” said D. Jean Veta, the panel’s representative from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>
<p>Frederick L. Thomas, a captain in the East Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Sheriff’s Office and the national president of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, testified that the group representing Black police officers was honored to endorse Jackson.</p>
<p>“Judge Jackson has demonstrated deep knowledge and respect for the law, balanced judgment, and unwavering commitment to justice,” he said.</p>
<p>Jackson, who grew up in Miami and attended Harvard College and Harvard Law School, would be the first Black woman to sit on the high court if confirmed.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Beyond the pale’</h4>

	
<p>At the outset of Thursday’s hearing, Chairman Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, praised the Senate panel’s conduct over the prior three days.</p>
<p>He specifically thanked Grassley, the ranking Republican on the committee, for his “high degree of integrity.”</p>
<p>Most of the 11 Republicans on the panel conducted themselves professionally, Durbin said. The only exceptions came from a handful whose attacks, he said, were “beyond the pale.”</p>
<p>“Some of the attacks on this judge were unfair, unrelenting and beneath the dignity of the United States Senate,” Durbin said. “My lasting impression is a judge who sat there through it all, head held high with dignity and determination and strength.”</p>
<p>Durbin commended Grassley and Sasse by name for their conduct.</p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Joyce Beatty, an Ohio Democrat who chairs the Congressional Black Caucus, thanked CBC member Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., for his Wednesday remarks to Jackson that focused on the significance of having a Black woman confirmed to the court.</p>
<p>It is important for young people to see those of all backgrounds in the highest positions in the country, Beatty told the Senate panel.</p>
<p>“It spoke not only to Black America, but to America, of how valuable this will be,” Beatty said. “Because what we will see when she is confirmed is what America looks like.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Republicans continue critiques</h4>

	
<p>After hearing from the ABA panel, a group of 10 outside witnesses — five invited by Democrats and five by Republicans — testified.</p>
<p>The Republican witnesses appeared to have been selected to continue lines of criticism that GOP senators raised repeatedly throughout the week, including that Jackson lacked a coherent judicial philosophy and was too lenient in sentencing as a trial judge, particularly in cases involving child pornography.</p>
<p>Tennessee Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn said Thursday she was unsatisfied with Jackson’s answers about her judicial philosophy.</p>
<p>“We had a very difficult time — we never got her to nail down her judicial philosophy,” Blackburn said. “That concerned us.”</p>
<p>Jennifer Mascott, a law professor at George Mason University invited to testify by Republicans, said that a judge’s philosophy is critical, and that Jackson had indicated she would depart from the strict textualist philosophies of conservative Supreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas, the late Antonin Scalia, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.</p>
<p>Jackson said repeatedly Tuesday and Wednesday that her methodology as a working judge stood in for the more academic concept of judicial philosophy. Her methodology, she said throughout the week, including in <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/ketanji-brown-jackson-vows-decide-us-supreme-court-cases-neutral-posture" target="_blank">her Monday opening statement</a>, was rooted in the goal of approaching each case from a “neutral posture.”</p>
<p>Mascott told North Carolina Republican Thom Tillis that Jackson’s testimony earlier in the week indicated that she would look “to a variety of sources” — not only text — when developing opinions.</p>
<p>Risa Goluboff, a Democratic witness and dean of the University of Virginia law school who, like Jackson, clerked for the retiring Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, told the panel Jackson based her legal conclusions on existing authorities.</p>
<p>“It is absolutely my view that she does not get outside her lane,” Goluboff said. “She is, I think, quite consistent and very committed to the text and to precedent.”</p>
<p>Tillis called Jackson “eminently qualified,” and said other Republicans likely agreed.</p>
<p>Tillis voted against Jackson’s confirmation to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals last year, though, and he appeared to have reservations about Jackson’s views on the free speech rights of anti-abortion advocates.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, he asked Jackson about her brief in a case asking that women seeking abortions are provided a “buffer zone” to keep activists trying to dissuade them from the procedure.</p>
<p>In the brief, Jackson said some activists could be hostile, noisy and “in-your-face.” Thursday, Tillis questioned one such “sidewalk counselor,” Eleanor McCullen, a smiling and amiable woman who carries cards that read, “hope, health and love” and was a GOP witness Thursday.</p>
<p>“You&#8217;re either an Oscar-winning actress or the fact of the matter is that was a wholly unfair description of who you are,” Tillis said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Anti-human-trafficking witness</h4>

	
<p>Alesandra Serano, a former federal prosecutor who is now an executive with the anti-human-trafficking group Operation Underground Railroad, told Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., that demand for online child pornography helped drive sex trafficking of children.</p>
<p>Hawley had spent much of his time over the week focusing on Jackson’s sentencing in several child pornography cases that he said was too lenient.</p>
<p>Serano told Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican who’d also zeroed in on child pornography cases, that she was not familiar with Jackson’s sentencing record, but generally favored judges imposing harsher sentences for offenders caught with more child pornographic material.</p>
<p>The committee is scheduled to meet Monday to consider the Jackson nomination but is not expected to vote until April 4. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is expected to bring Jackson’s nomination up for a floor vote by April 8, ahead of a Senate recess.</p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a Thursday floor speech he would not support Jackson’s confirmation.</p>
<p>“I cannot and will not support Judge Jackson for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court,” McConnell said.</p>
<p>It’s not clear if any other Republicans will vote for her confirmation.</p>

(Screenshot/ Senate Judiciary Committee feed) </p><p>WASHINGTON — In the third day of hearings Wednesday on the nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson to the U.S. Supreme Court, several Republicans on the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee interrogated her about sentences she handed down for child pornography offenses, disagreeing vehemently with her judicial decisions.</p>
<p>Republicans grilled her with questions she had already answered about seven cases — out of hundreds she handled as a federal district court judge — that dealt with child pornography, in an attempt to paint her as soft on offenders convicted of heinous charges.</p>
<p>Jackson in response to Sens. Lindsey Graham, Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley defended her record and attempted to explain the complexity of federal sentencing, as she had on Tuesday.</p>
<p>She objected to Hawley and other Republicans’ focus on sentencing in such a small number of cases, repeating throughout the day that “no one case can stand in for a judge&#8217;s entire record.”</p>
<p>Democrats on the 22-member committee stressed her qualifications and her high ratings from law enforcement groups like the Fraternal Order of Police. Sen. Jon Ossoff, a Georgia Democrat, invited Jackson to talk about her brother, who is a law enforcement officer, as well as her two uncles who served in law enforcement.</p>
<p>“We looked up to them, and we understood through their service what it meant to give back to your community,” Jackson said of her uncles.</p>
<p>New Jersey Democrat Cory Booker used his time not to question Jackson, but to defend her from the attacks launched by Republicans.</p>
<p>Booker called the bombardment “a new low” that “set a dangerous precedent.” Jackson is “a mainstream judge,” he said. Most federal judges sentence child pornography offenders to less than federal guidelines call for, he said.</p>
<p>Jackson, if confirmed, would be the first Black woman and first former public defender to serve on the Supreme Court. She was born in Washington, D.C., but <a href="https://floridaphoenix.com/blog/heres-more-about-judge-ketanji-brown-jackson-who-has-miami-roots/" target="_blank">grew up in Florida </a>and would be the first Floridian to sit on the high court. She graduated from Miami Palmetto Senior High School before going on to Harvard College and Harvard Law School.</p>
<p>It is not yet clear if any Republicans in the evenly divided Senate will back her nomination. If there’s a tie 50-50 floor vote on the confirmation, it would be broken by Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>Committee Chairman Dick Durbin said at the end of the hearing Wednesday that the nomination will be taken up by the panel on Monday. But the vote likely will not come until a week later, on April 4.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">GOP barrage</h4>

	
<p>Time and again Republicans on Wednesday returned to questions about child pornography. Hawley, a Missouri Republican, asked Jackson if she regretted giving sentences that he believed were not long enough.</p>
<p>“What I regret is that in a hearing about my qualifications to be a justice on the Supreme Court, we’ve spent a lot of time focusing on this small subset of my sentences, and I’ve tried to explain –,” she said, before Hawley cut her off.</p>
<p>“Do you regret your cases? I don’t understand,” Hawley said.</p>
<p>Cruz, a Texas Republican, accused her and Durbin of “filibustering” her responses.</p>
<p>Throughout Jackson’s exchange with Cruz, Durbin asked him to allow Jackson to respond to his questions instead of interrupting her.</p>
<p>“You don’t want her to answer that question?” Cruz said, later accusing Durbin of trying to hide her response from “the American people.”</p>
<p>“You wouldn’t let her answer anyways,” Durbin said.</p>
<p>Durbin also had to repeatedly intervene with Graham, a South Carolina Republican, to ask that he allow Jackson to answer questions instead of interrupting her.</p>
<p>Graham asked her questions about Justice Brett Kavanaugh and if she would like to be treated the way he was during his confirmation hearing, and if she thought that treatment would be fair. Accusations of sexual assault were made against Kavanaugh in his extremely contentious confirmation hearing in 2018.</p>
<p>Graham previously voted to confirm Jackson in her current role as a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>
<p>Cruz asked about how she would approach a role as an associate justice on the Supreme Court and asked her to give a definition of a woman, the same question GOP Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee asked the previous day.</p>
<p>“If I can change my gender, if I can be a woman and then an hour later if I decide I&#8217;m not a woman anymore, I guess I would lose Article III standing?” Cruz asked. Article III allows someone who has a personal stake in an outcome to bring a suit in a federal court.</p>
<p>He continued, “Tell me, does that same principle apply to other protected characteristics? For example, I&#8217;m a Hispanic man, could I decide I was an Asian man, what I had the ability to be an Asian man, and challenge Harvard&#8217;s discrimination because I made that decision?”</p>
<p>“Senator, I&#8217;m not able to answer your question,” Jackson said. “You&#8217;re asking me about hypotheticals and –”</p>
<p>Cruz cut her off. He said that she was the only Supreme Court Justice nominee to not be able to give a definition of what it meant to be a “woman” — though no other nominee has been asked that question during their confirmation hearings.</p>
<p>The Harvard affirmative action case that Cruz mentioned is set to be heard by the Supreme Court later this year. Jackson said during Wednesday’s hearing that if she was confirmed, she would recuse herself because it involves her alma mater.</p>
<p>Republicans also pressed her again on her opinion of expanding the court, a question she said Tuesday she could not answer because the decision to add more justices to the Supreme Court would be made by Congress, not the judges.</p>
<p>Jackson again said that she felt she should not answer that topic, as it was currently being discussed, and it would be inappropriate for her to give an answer, especially when that decision was up to Congress.</p>
<p>Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett was asked her view on “court packing” in her 2020 confirmation hearing, and she also declined to answer the question, saying that the size of the Supreme Court is up to Congress.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Republican letter</h4>

	
<p>After Hawley finished wrapping up his questions, Cruz interrupted Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono, a Democrat, when it was her turn for questions, saying he wanted to enter a letter into the public record and he wanted to be recognized.</p>
<p>The letter was signed by 10 GOP senators on the committee, every Republican except for Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, asking they be allowed to view pre-sentencing reports for Jackson’s cases involving child pornography.</p>
<p>Sen. Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, told Cruz to follow the rules and let Hirono ask her questions.</p>
<p>“I know the junior senator from Texas likes to get on TV,” Leahy said.</p>
<p>Hirono asked Jackson about how her time in public school helped shape her. Jackson, if confirmed, would be one of four justices who attended public school on the court.</p>
<p>Durbin later pushed back against Republicans’ request for pre-sentencing information on the cases, as those documents could contain sensitive information such as a victim&#8217;s name.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe that this information is going to change anyone&#8217;s vote,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Jackson will be done testifying after Wednesday. The confirmation hearings will wrap up on Thursday, when the Judiciary Committee listens to testimony from the American Bar Association and other witnesses, including U.S. Rep. Joyce Beatty, an Ohio Democrat and chair of the Congressional Black Caucus.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has said he hopes to have a final confirmation vote by Easter, or April 17. If Jackson is confirmed, she would join the Supreme Court later this summer.</p>
<p>“Yesterday, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson offered a 13-hour master class of why she deserves to be the 116th justice of the United States Supreme Court. She was simply impressive,” Schumer, who also joined the hearing audience at one point, said on the Senate floor on Wednesday.</p>
<p>“It was clear to anyone watching Judge Jackson’s brilliant legal mind that it was running in high gear; she remained measured and poised and thoughtful as she worked through yesterday’s grueling series of questions.”</p>

(Screenshot/ Senate Judiciary Committee feed)</p><p>WASHINGTON – Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday sharpened their criticisms of U.S. Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson, probing her work as a public defender on behalf of terrorism suspects, the judicial sentences she has handed down for child pornography offenses and her views of critical race theory.</p>
<p>Jackson defended her record in a handful of tense exchanges with Republican members, clearly disagreeing with accusations from Texas Sen. Ted Cruz that she was too lenient in the child pornography sentencing decisions.</p>
<p>Democrats on the evenly split panel said Jackson’s record as a federal trial judge and appeals judge on the D.C. Circuit Court showed she was an impartial jurist.</p>
<p>All but two of the 22 senators on the committee had 30 minutes to question Jackson during a lengthy session that began at 9 a.m. and appeared ready to stretch into the night. Committee Chairman Dick Durbin announced that two senators, Democrat Jon Ossoff of Georgia and Republican Thom Tillis of North Carolina, would take their turns on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The hearing opened with questions from Durbin, D-Ill., that gave Jackson an opportunity to preempt several lines of attack expected from Republican senators. Nearly all are expected to vote on the floor against her nomination.</p>
<p>Jackson described to Durbin her process for removing her own biases as a judge and articulated a vision of a constrained federal judiciary, a day after Republican senators complained that Jackson had not disclosed her judicial philosophy and said they feared she would be an activist justice. She repeated throughout the day her process and that she wanted to “stay in my lane” as a judge, not advocate for policy positions.</p>
<p>“I am not importing my personal views or policy preferences,” she said. “The entire exercise is about trying to understand what those who created this policy or this law intended.”</p>
<p>She also defended her sentencing record for people convicted of possessing child pornography after some Republicans, including Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn and Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, <a href="https://tennesseelookout.com/2022/03/22/heres-what-senators-said-on-the-first-day-of-the-u-s-supreme-court-hearings/" target="_blank">argued on Monday</a> she was too lenient.</p>
<p>Victims’ statements in such cases were powerful, Jackson said, and she in every case considered the views of the children affected. She did not subscribe to the idea that those convicted of possession — and not production — were only “lookers,” she said.</p>
<p>“I say to them that there is only a market for this kind of material because there are lookers, that you are contributing to child sex abuse,” she said. “And then I impose a significant sentence.”</p>
<p>She still has nightmares, she said, about a victim who developed agoraphobia — a fear of leaving the home — because the prospect that strangers had seen images of her sexual abuse was overwhelming.</p>
<p>Democrats on the panel touted endorsements Jackson had won from leading police groups to rebut the accusation Jackson is not tough enough on criminals.</p>
<p>Jackson, who grew up in Miami and would be the first person from Florida to sit on the court, said law enforcement had long been part of her family life. She had two uncles who were police officers, who, she remembered, would come to family gatherings straight after a shift and place their guns atop tall furniture to keep out of reach of children.</p>
<p>She also has a younger brother who worked as a police officer in Baltimore, she said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">GOP attacks</h4>

	
<p>South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, a former defense attorney in the U.S. Air Force, said he would not hold against Jackson her work as a public defender on behalf of terrorism suspects held at a U.S. Naval Base at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. Graham said he understood that public defenders don’t choose their clients and that defense attorneys are an important part of the legal system.</p>
<p>But Graham, who voted to confirm Jackson for her current role as a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, did take issue with arguments Jackson raised as a public defender, including that the United States committed war crimes against Guantánamo Bay detainees, an apparent reference to a case when Jackson represented a detainee tortured by military handlers at the detention facility.</p>
<p>Jackson said she was preserving legal arguments on behalf of her clients.</p>
<p>Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas also objected to Jackson’s use of the term war criminal in cases that named then-President George W. Bush and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld in their official capacities.</p>
<p>Graham criticized a legal brief Jackson filed after joining a private practice that argued so-called enemy combatants at Guantánamo Bay should be tried or freed, not held indefinitely.</p>
<p>“I hope that they all die in jail if they’re going to go back and kill Americans,” he said. “It won’t bother me one bit if 39 of them die in prison. That’s a better outcome than letting them go.”</p>
<p>Jackson said she was representing her clients’ views, not her own.</p>
<p>Graham also spent much of his 30 minutes complaining about Democratic senators’ treatment of past Supreme Court nominees picked by Republican presidents.</p>
<p>Graham probed Jackson about her religious beliefs and to place on a scale of 1-10 her level of faith. When Jackson objected to providing details about her beliefs, Graham said he asked because Democrats raised the issue about Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who was nominated by President Donald Trump, during her confirmation hearings.</p>
<p>“There’s two standards here,” Graham said.</p>
<p>Cruz, who overlapped with Jackson for two years at Harvard Law School, accused Jackson of endorsing the teaching of critical race theory. It is a legal theory, taught in higher education and much maligned by conservatives, that argues race is a prevailing factor in all parts of American life.</p>
<p>Cruz brought and displayed blown-up posters showing pages in books taught at Georgetown Day School, a private school in Washington, D.C., where Jackson sits on the board.</p>
<p>Cruz argued that such books taught that “babies are racist” and asked if Jackson endorsed that view.</p>
<p>“Senator,” Jackson began to respond before pausing for more than six seconds. “I do not believe that any child should be made to feel as though they are racist or though they are not valued or though they are less than, that they are victims, that they are oppressors. I don’t believe in any of that.”</p>
<p>The board does not oversee curriculum at the school, Jackson said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Opportunity for role models’</h4>

	
<p>Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., noted Jackson would be the fourth woman on the nine-justice Supreme Court, the closest to gender parity the court had reached.</p>
<p>Jackson, who would be the first Black woman on the court, said that kind of milestone was important to young people who may not see people of their backgrounds reflected in elite institutions like the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>“One of the things that having diverse members of the court does is it provides for the opportunity for role models,” Jackson told Feinstein. “Having meaningful numbers of women and people of color, I think matters.”</p>
<p>Jackson also told Feinstein that she considered Supreme Court decisions upholding the right to abortion “settled.”</p>
<p>Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn, the last senator to question the judge, quoted from a brief Jackson wrote that described anti-abortion advocates as a “hostile, noisy crowd of in-your-face protestors.”</p>
<p>“I find it incredibly concerning that someone who is nominated to a position with life tenure on the Supreme Court holds such a hostile view toward … a mainstream belief that every life is worth protecting,” Blackburn, a Republican, said.</p>
<p>Jackson said she wrote the brief more than two decades ago, on behalf of clients. The description referred specifically to a crowd that women seeking abortions had to get through, not anti-abortion protestors generally, she said.</p>
<p>Blackburn also asked Jackson to define &#8220;woman,&#8221; <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/22/blackburn-jackson-define-the-word-woman-00019543" target="_blank">part of a line of questioning</a> that focused on gender identity and transgender swimmer Lia Thomas.</p>
<p>“I can’t,” Jackson said.</p>
<p>“You can’t?” Blackburn said.</p>
<p>“Not in this context. I’m not a biologist,” Jackson said.</p>
<p><em>This post has been updated to include questioning from Sen. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican.</em></p>

(Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson began her four-day confirmation process to become the nation’s first Black female associate justice on Monday, listening to hours of opening statements from Senate Judiciary Committee members before giving her own.</p>
<p>In her first public remarks since President Joe Biden nominated her last month, Jackson, <a href="https://floridaphoenix.com/2022/02/25/biden-to-tap-judge-ketanji-brown-jackson-for-the-u-s-supreme-court-reports-say/" target="_blank">who grew up in Miami</a>, told the senators about her upbringing and career, including her time clerking for retiring Justice Stephen Breyer. Her daughters, husband and parents looked on from the audience.</p>
<p>“It is extremely humbling to be considered for Justice Breyer’s seat. And I know that I could never fill his shoes, but if confirmed I would hope to carry on his spirit,” Jackson said.</p>
<p>The first day included four hours of statements from U.S. senators, with members of both political parties congratulating her on her nomination and impressive career.</p>
<p>Republicans, however, previewed the questions they will ask Jackson during the next two days, including bringing up their concerns with her openness to sharing her judicial philosophy and how she handled sentencing for some cases while a U.S. District Court judge. Most if not all Republicans are expected to oppose her nomination on the floor, but there would be enough votes for confirmation if all Democrats in the evenly divided Senate vote for Jackson and Vice President Kamala Harris casts a tie-breaking vote.</p>
<p>Jackson, 51, told the senators that she takes her responsibility and duty to be an independent judge very seriously, deciding her cases from a “neutral posture.”</p>
<p>“I know that my role as a judge is a limited one, that the Constitution empowers me only to decide cases and controversies that are properly presented,” Jackson testified. “And I know that my judicial role is further constrained by careful adherence to precedent.”</p>
<p>Jackson wrapped up her opening statement saying that she has dedicated her “career to ensuring that the words engraved on the front of the Supreme Court building ‘equal justice under law’ are a reality and not just an ideal.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Durbin and Grassley</h4>

	
<p>Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, and ranking member Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, used their opening statements to outline their political parties&#8217; views on the judge’s qualifications and pitfalls, while attempting to set a collegial tone.</p>
<p>“The reality is that the court’s members in one respect have never really reflected the nation they served,” Durbin said. “When the Supreme Court met for the very first time in February of 1790 in the Exchange Building in New York, there were nearly 700,000 slaves without the right of citizenship in this new nation of nearly 4 million people.”</p>
<p>“Neither African Americans nor women had the right to vote. There was no equal justice under the law for a majority of people living in America,” Durbin continued.</p>
<p>Durbin attempted to rebuff several GOP criticisms of Jackson, including that she is “a product of a campaign of dark money” judicial groups that want to overhaul the nation’s courts, that she has been soft on crime and that she would be a “rubber stamp” for the Biden administration.</p>
<p>“There may be some who claim, without a shred of evidence, that you’ll be a rubber stamp for this president. For these would-be critics, I have four words — look at the record,” Durbin said.</p>
<p>Jackson has been before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee three times, he said, noting that her confirmation process for the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia took place just last year.</p>
<p>Her time as a federal public defender, member of the U.S. Sentencing Commission, district court judge and a member of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit are all well documented, he said.</p>
<p>Grassley said Republicans would “conduct a thorough, exhaustive examination of Judge Jackson’s record and views” and ask “tough questions” about her judicial philosophy.</p>
<p>“In any Supreme Court nomination, the most important thing that I look for is the nominee’s view of the law, judicial philosophy and view on the role of a judge in our constitutional system,” Grassley said. “I’ll be looking to see whether Judge Jackson is committed to the Constitution as originally understood.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What the GOP will ask</h4>

	
<p>Republicans are likely to ask Jackson numerous questions during the next two days about her education, previous court cases, writings and outlook on the role of an associate justice on the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn said during his opening statement it would be “imperative” that the senators gain an understanding of her judicial philosophy.</p>
<p>“I have to say I was a bit troubled that you have not so far provided us with much clarity on that matter,” Cornyn said. “Someone as accomplished as you are — who has spent years engaging and thinking about our Constitution and laws –— has surely formed a judicial philosophy.”</p>
<p>“This is not your first rodeo,” Cornyn added.</p>
<p>Grassley, and numerous GOP senators on the panel, said they were also concerned about so-called “dark money groups,” including Demand Justice, advocating for judges who believe the U.S. Constitution is a “living” document.</p>
<p>The group has cheered Jackson’s nomination to associate justice, a stance that has raised several Republicans&#8217; suspicions about Jackson.</p>
<p>Rhode Island Democrat Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said those concerns were “ironic” since “hundreds of millions of dollars in right-wing dark money built the current court majority.”</p>
<p>Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley and Tennessee Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn both mentioned concerns with how Jackson sentenced people convicted of possession or distribution of child pornography.</p>
<p>“I want to be candid with you today, so you know exactly what it is I want to talk about,” Hawley said before listing off cases in which he felt Jackson was too lenient in sentencing.</p>
<p>“In each of these seven, Judge Jackson handed down a lenient sentence that was below what the federal guidelines recommended and below what prosecutors requested. And so I think there’s a lot to talk about there, and I look forward to talking about it.”</p>
<p>The White House has dismissed Hawley’s claims. Press secretary Jen Psaki said last week that some of Hawley’s research was taken out of context and that, as a trial judge, Jackson had largely stayed within sentencing guidelines or issued stronger sentences.</p>
<p>“Attempts to smear or discredit her history and her work are not borne out in facts,” she said.</p>
<p>Jackson’s own opening statement took place mid-afternoon, after she was introduced by Thomas B. Griffith, a retired judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and Lisa M. Fairfax, Jackson&#8217;s former college roommate and a presidential professor at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School.</p>
<p>Jackson will return to the hearing room Tuesday to begin the first day of questioning from members, with each senator getting 30 minutes. That portion of the hearing process will continue Wednesday, with senators each getting a second, 20-minute round.</p>
<p>The hearing will wrap up Thursday when the Judiciary Committee hears from the American Bar Association and other witnesses.</p>
<p>The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary –— which evaluates judges based on integrity, professional competence and judicial temperament —  has <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/ABA%20SCFJ%20Rating%20Letter%20-%20Judge%20Ketanji%20Brown%20Jackson%202022.03.18.pdf" target="_blank">rated</a> Jackson as “well qualified,” its highest rating.</p>
<p>The earliest the Judiciary Committee would vote to send Jackson’s nomination for associate justice to the Senate floor is next week. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer hopes to hold a final floor vote before Easter, which is April 17.</p>
<p>Jackson, if confirmed, would join the Supreme Court later this summer following the retirement of Justice Breyer.</p>

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)</p><p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson began the arduous Senate confirmation process Wednesday, meeting on Capitol Hill with four key senators.</p>
<p>Jackson, who would become the first Black woman on the court if confirmed, started her morning with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat. Schumer said he expects Republicans will vote for Jackson, despite several expressing opposition to her nomination.</p>
<p>She later spoke privately with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican; Senate Judiciary Chair Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat; and the panel’s top Republican, Chuck Grassley of Iowa.</p>
<p>The Judiciary panel is scheduled to begin confirmation hearings Monday, March 21, when members of the committee and Jackson make their opening statements.</p>
<p>The next two days will include rounds of questions from senators before the American Bar Association and other witnesses testify on March 24.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s meetings all started off with a small group of reporters and photojournalists rushing into the rooms to capture images of the historic nominee before staff quickly ushered them out so she could talk candidly with top lawmakers.</p>
<p>Schumer said after his roughly 30-minute meeting with Jackson that he believes she belongs on the court. Schumer said Jackson reminds him of Justice Stephen Breyer, whom she clerked for and would replace on the court if confirmed.</p>
<p>“She has real empathy,” Schumer said. “I think it&#8217;s very important in a judge — because you&#8217;re having two sides clashing over whatever the issue is — to be able to empathize and walk in the other person&#8217;s shoes.”</p>
<p>Meetings between Supreme Court nominees and senators often veer away from their resumes and judicial philosophies to more personal topics. Schumer said he and Jackson talked about how both of their families are close-knit, gathering together for weekly dinners.</p>
<p>“She understands life in a very real way because of her experiences,” Schumer said of both her personal life and the “breadth” of her professional experiences.</p>
<p>Jackson <a href="https://floridaphoenix.com/2022/01/27/a-top-candidate-for-the-u-s-supreme-court-has-roots-in-miami/" target="_blank">grew up in Miami,</a> where she graduated from Miami Palmetto Senior High School. Jackson’s parents both started out as public school teachers. Her father, Johnny Brown, later became an attorney for the Miami-Dade School Board, and her mother, Ellery Brown, became the principal at New World School of the Arts, a public high school with a magnet program.</p>
<p>Grassley said while posing for photos with Jackson before their afternoon meeting that he would work to ensure her confirmation process is “fair” and “dignified.”</p>
<p>“I just think that we&#8217;re gonna meet our constitutional responsibility of advise and consent with dignity and fairness and most importantly, thoroughness,” Grassley said.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-taps-judge-ketanji-brown-jackson-first-black-woman-us-supreme-court-2" target="_blank">nominated</a> Jackson last month, fulfilling a campaign promise to place a Black woman on the Supreme Court for the first time in the nation&#8217;s history.</p>
<p>Jackson, who earned her law degree from Harvard University and received bipartisan support for her confirmation as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit last year, would also be the first former public defender on the court.</p>
<p>She will continue meeting privately with Democratic and Republican senators during the next few weeks as she simultaneously prepares to undergo days of questioning from the 22 lawmakers on the Judiciary Committee.</p>
<p>Durbin said after his roughly 45-minute meeting with Jackson that he believes Republicans have enough time to prepare for the hearings.</p>
<p>“That will be the 24th day after President Biden’s announcement of this nominee,” Durbin said. “In comparison, Amy Coney Barrett came before the committee 16 days after President Trump&#8217;s announcement.”</p>
<p>Durbin said the goal is for Jackson to meet with all members of the committee ahead of the hearings. She would then continue meeting with other senators ahead of a floor vote.</p>
<p>Durbin said Jackson’s confirmation hearings could be open to the public, even though Senate office buildings are currently open only to lawmakers, staff, credentialed press and people on official business. Before the COVID-19 pandemic began, the three buildings just steps from the Capitol were available to members of the public, who were able to attend hearings and markups in designated seats.</p>
<p>“As long as we have an opportunity for an orderly witnessing of this process, I would support it. But I want to make sure first and foremost that we take into consideration public health and security, and I&#8217;ll rely on the experts to give advice on that,” Durbin said.</p>
<p>Durbin didn’t want to speculate on when the Judiciary Committee would vote to send Jackson’s nomination to the Senate floor.</p>
<p>That vote is expected to take place within the two weeks after her hearings. Schumer is planning a floor vote on her confirmation before the Senate leaves town on Friday, April 8 for its Easter recess.</p>
<p>If confirmed, Jackson would not alter the court’s 6-3 conservative tilt.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Attorney General Jason Miyares is the first Republican to hold the office in nearly a decade. So his office says it’s natural to expect the state’s legal position to change after eight years under the control of Democrat Mark Herring.</p>
<p>Asked for a complete accounting of cases in which Miyares directed the state to change sides or withdraw, Miyares’s spokeswoman, Victoria LaCivita, listed five:</p>
<p>• <a href="https://apnews.com/article/voting-rights-lawsuits-virginia-constitutions-congress-7f4ac55ee95eb26ceaeea6d529649b32" target="_blank">Virginia v. Ferriero</a>: A case filed against National Archivist David Ferriero to compel him to recognize the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment and include it in the U.S. Constitution. Miyares filed to withdraw from the lawsuit, which would leave Nevada and Illinois as plaintiffs.</p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2021/20-1530" target="_blank">West Virginia v. EPA</a>: Herring had added his name to a brief last year opposing the case aimed at blocking environmental regulations. <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/new-va-ag-pulls-out-of-supreme-court-climate-case/" target="_blank">Miyares says</a> the state will “no longer be a participating party” because “Virginia is no longer anti-coal.”</p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2021/19-1392" target="_blank">Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization</a>: In this case, Herring had joined 22 attorneys general to argue Mississippi’s 15-week abortion ban was unconstitutional.  In a statement, Miyares said, “Virginia is now of the belief that the Constitution is silent on the question of abortion.”</p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2021/20-1088" target="_blank">Carson v. Makin</a>: Miyares also withdrew from a brief Herring had signed onto opposing a lawsuit in which families in Maine are seeking to force a local school district to provide tuition assistance for religious schools. “The Commonwealth believes that the First Amendment prohibits states from withholding tuition assistance from families solely on the ground that those families choose to send their children to religious schools,” LaCivita said.</p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2021/20-843" target="_blank">New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association v. Bruen</a>: In this pending case, a New York couple is suing to overturn a state law that limits concealed carry handgun permits to people who can show a special need for protection. Miyares said he withdrew from a brief Herring had signed supporting limits to concealed carry permits because he believes the law “is in direct conflict with the Second Amendment.”</p>
<p>“It is expected for a new attorney general to assess the state’s legal positions and make their own decisions regarding the future of the legal challenges,” LaCivita said of the changes in an email. “These decisions must be made at the very beginning of the administration, out of respect to the court.”</p>
<p>Legal experts say the actions are entirely symbolic and will have no effect on the outcome of any of the lawsuits.</p>
<p>“I don’t think any judges are sitting there counting the number of attorneys general on one side or the other,” said Saikrishna Prakash, a professor at University of Virginia School of Law. “They’re looking at arguments and trying to come to a conclusion. The fact that Jason Miyares has changed the views of the attorney general’s office is not going to matter at all.”</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Attorney General Jason Miyares says his staff can’t keep up with a surge of criminal appeals being heard by the newly expanded Virginia Court of Appeals.</p>
<p>As of 2022, the court now provides by-right appeals in all cases and, in the case of criminal appeals, the attorney general’s office is responsible for representing the state.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Criminal-Appeals-Letter-Final.pdf" target="_blank">a letter to General Assembly leaders</a>, Miyares wrote that under the old system the AG’s office handled approximately 250 criminal cases per year. Under the new system, he said the criminal appeals team was assigned more than 300 cases in January alone.</p>
<p>“In order for our appellate attorneys to give every Virginian with an appellate case the due diligence and attention they deserve, additional funding is critically important,” Miyares wrote. “Without it, the office will run into a significant backlog of criminal appeals in the Commonwealth of Virginia.”</p>

<p>Miyares, who has faced derision from Democrats for his decision to <a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/partisan-debate-erupts-in-va-senate-over-miyares-firing-of-30-in-ags-office/article_49f4ffd3-3653-5340-95c4-aa3c76c862b4.html" target="_blank">cull staff</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/01/23/heaphy-uva-miyares-removal/" target="_blank">fire university counsel</a>, called the issue bi-partisan. He noted that his predecessor, Democrat Mark Herring, had made a similar request, which was only partially granted, with lawmakers agreeing to add funding for 19 new positions last year, which would roughly double the staff.</p>
<p>But Miyares says the office needs at least 75 people to keep up with the news caseload</p>
<p>Democratic leaders in the Senate did not sound particularly sympathetic to Miyares this week.</p>
<p>Sen. John Edwards, D-Roanoke, who spearheaded the effort to expand the court, said this week he was unaware of the issue.</p>
<p>Sen. Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, who also worked on the issue, suggested Miyares find the positions internally, noting that had already fired attorneys tasked with <a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/miyares-fires-30-in-ags-office-including-lawyer-investigating-dangerous-conditions-at-richmond-apartments/article_280125a7-9dda-58db-a0e0-667758fafd0f.html" target="_blank">investigating human rights abuses</a> and announced plans to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/01/19/miyares-attorney-general-virginia-agenda/" target="_blank">reconfigure a unit</a> that investigates wrongful convictions.</p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thirteen Virginia residents ranging in age from 10 to 19 are suing the state of Virginia over what they say are its contributions to climate change as a result of decades of issuing permits for fossil fuel infrastructure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s “historic and ongoing permitting of fossil fuel infrastructure has, and continues to, cause dangerous levels of greenhouse gas pollution, including carbon dioxide,” the plaintiffs wrote. “This GHG pollution causes and contributes to the ongoing climate crisis and causes grave harm to these 13 youth plaintiffs.” </span></p>
<p><a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/571d109b04426270152febe0/t/620421566d141446e7316cdb/1644437851120/2022.02.09_VA+Complaint_Final.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The suit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which has been filed in Richmond Circuit Court, asks the court to overturn parts of Virginia’s Gas and Oil Act and find that Virginia’s “policy and practice” of permitting fossil fuel projects violates the plaintiff’s rights. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legal argument hinges on their interpretation of the public trust doctrine, which holds that the state has a duty to hold certain natural resources in trust for the public. In their suit, they argue that by approving fossil fuel infrastructure, Virginia is failing to protect “Virginia’s atmosphere, lands, and waters from pollution, impairment, or destruction.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorneys with Our Children’s Trust, an Oregon-based nonprofit law firm that focuses on climate cases involving young people, are representing the 13 Virginia residents. The group also has suits pending in Alaska and Montana and is involved in regulatory petitions in Florida, Colorado and North Carolina. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2015, the nonprofit filed a federal suit known as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Juliana v. United States</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on similar grounds. Although a district court initially allowed the case to go forward, </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/17/climate/juliana-climate-case.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a federal appeals court threw out the suit in 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an opinion, Judge Andrew Hurwitz wrote that the court had “reluctantly concluded that the plaintiffs’ case must be made to the political branches or to the electorate at large.” Judge Josephine Staton dissented, concluding that the young plaintiffs had presented sufficient evidence to argue their case at trial and that “the Constitution does not condone the nation’s willful destruction.” </span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce/ For The Virginia Mercury)</p><p>The Supreme Court of Virginia denied a petition Monday filed by parents in Chesapeake seeking to overturn Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s executive order ending mask mandates in public schools.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.oag.state.va.us/files/MIYARES2022/ORD02-07-2022Castillo,M.pdf" target="_blank">ruling</a> fell on procedural grounds, with the justices writing in a footnote that, “by this dismissal, we offer no opinion on the legality of EO 2 or any other issue pertaining to petitioners’ claims.”</p>
<p>Likewise, legal experts said the decision offered no obvious clues as to how the court might rule should one of several other pending lawsuits addressing Youngkin’s executive order make its way to the court.</p>
<p>“This is an extremely technical ruling,” said Carl Tobias, a professor at University of Richmond School of Law. “This is not a merits ruling.”</p>
<p>Instead, the justices wrote that their decision came down to the legal relief the group of parents sought, which is called a writ of mandamus — a mechanism in which a court directs a lower court or public official to perform a statutory duty.</p>
<p>The justices wrote that they could only issue such a writ in situations where a public official’s role is purely ministerial. And in the case of mask mandates in school, they wrote that a state law passed last year requiring school districts to adhere to CDC guidelines “to the maximum extent practicable” leaves school leaders with at least some discretion regarding how to act.</p>
<p>The line of reasoning would seem to poke holes in former Gov. Ralph Northam’s assertion that the law required mask mandates stay in place as long as they are recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It also appears to cut against Youngkin’s assertion that he has the authority to overrule local mandates via executive order.</p>
<p>Steve Emmert, an appellate lawyer in Virginia <a href="https://virginia-appeals.com/" target="_blank">who writes</a> about legal issues in the state, said it would be unwise to read too much into either line of reasoning given the broader context of the order.</p>
<p>The only hint he said he reads in the order about the court’s thinking on the issue has to do with process: that the court would be more likely to issue a ruling on the merits of the case in a lawsuit seeking injunctive relief, such as the lawsuit filed by seven school districts that have chosen to keep their mask mandates in place.</p>
<p>A lower court judge in Arlington <a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-education-richmond-lawsuits-0cfd73b7b905006f9d8f6d49a4f1de86?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=44444444-4444-4444-4444-444444444444" target="_blank">ruled Friday</a> that the districts may keep their mask mandates in place while the case advances. Attorney General Jason Miyares said he will appeal the ruling.</p>
<p>Emmert said that under judicial reforms passed last year, it would next go to the Virginia Court of Appeals. He said it could be as long as a month and a half until the appeal is heard.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury - July 26, 2018)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hits keep coming for the embattled Mountain Valley Pipeline, with the Richmond-based U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals overturning yet another key project approval this week, this time because of impacts to two endangered fish species. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court in an opinion filed Thursday determined that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service had erred in a September 2020 finding that Mountain Valley was unlikely to jeopardize several endangered species. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We recognize that this decision will further delay the completion of an already mostly finished pipeline, but the Endangered Species Act’s directive to federal agencies could not be clearer: ‘halt and reverse the trend toward species extinction, whatever the cost,’” Judge James Wynn wrote in the 4th Circuit’s opinion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mountain Valley Pipeline spokesperson Natalie Cox said the company is evaluating the decision but is “disappointed” in it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For eight years, the MVP project team has worked diligently with state and federal regulators to ensure this important infrastructure project is built and operated to the highest levels of safety and environmental standards,” she wrote in an email. “The MVP has undergone an unprecedented level of review, and rigorous analysis has repeatedly demonstrated that this project can in fact be built safely and responsibly.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The case, which was brought by a consortium of environmental groups including Appalachian Voices, Wild Virginia, the Sierra Club and the Center for Biological Diversity, marks </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/federal-commission-orders-work-stopped-on-mountain-valley-pipeline/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the second time Mountain Valley’s Fish and Wildlife permit has been called into question</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the courts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ruling is also the third blow the pipeline has received in just over a week. On Jan. 25, the 4th Circuit </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/01/25/federal-court-again-yanks-two-mountain-valley-pipeline-approvals/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">yanked the project’s Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management approvals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, finding that those agencies’ evaluations of impacts had been inadequate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this week’s decision, the court again said it had found deficiencies in federal agency reviews, this time pointing to flaws in the Fish and Wildlife Service’s assessment of the current condition of two endangered fish species, the Roanoke logperch and candy darter, as well as ongoing impacts to the remaining populations. It also accused the agency of failing to properly evaluate the impacts of climate change, which is mentioned in only one sentence of the biological opinion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scientists have recorded seven existing populations of the Roanoke logperch, which is found in four Virginia and North Carolina river systems. Of those, the Roanoke River population is considered especially notable, with 15 percent expected to be impacted by the pipeline. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The candy darter is found in 18 fragmented populations in Virginia and West Virginia. One 2018 species status report by the Fish and Wildlife Service found that it is at risk of going totally extinct over the next 25 years. The 4th Circuit noted that two of the populations that will be impacted by Mountain Valley are considered to be “among the most genetically pure populations” remaining and “essential to the recovery of the species.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both species struggle to survive in waters with heavy loads of sediment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court found that because of the deficiencies in Fish and Wildlife’s analysis, the agency’s determination that the pipeline would not jeopardize the candy darter or the Roanoke logperch was “arbitrary.” Judge Wynn’s opinion orders that the analysis be redone but warns that federal agencies may not take any actions that “deepen” the jeopardy populations face. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Put differently, if a species is already speeding toward the extinction cliff, an agency may not press on the gas,” he wrote. “We urge the Fish and Wildlife Service to consider this directive carefully while reassessing impacts to the two endangered fish at issue, especially the apparently not-long-for-this-world candy darter.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental groups celebrated the decision Thursday and urged the developers to cancel the project, </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/more-delays-cost-increases-for-mountain-valley-pipeline/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">which is billions over budget and several years behind schedule</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three more key federal agencies have been sent back to the drawing board after failing to analyze MVP’s harmful impacts,” said Sierra Club Senior Director of Energy Campaigns Kelly Sheehan in a statement. “The previous administration’s rushed, shoddy permitting put the entire project in question.”</span></p>

Dick Durbin (R) (D-IL) and ranking member Chuck Grassley (L) (R-IA) in the Oval Office on February 01, 2022 in Washington, DC. Biden is expected to name a replacement for retiring Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer before the end of the month.  (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Dick Durbin, and the panel’s top Republican, Chuck Grassley, met with the president Tuesday afternoon to discuss a 40-day confirmation timeline for a new Supreme Court pick.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Constitution says, &#8216;advise and consent, advice and consent,&#8217; and I&#8217;m serious when I say that I want the advice of the Senate as well as the consent to arrive on who the nominee should be,” President Joe Biden told reporters, according to pool reports.</p>
<p>Biden said that once he announces a nominee to replace Justice Stephen Breyer by the end of the month, he’s hoping for a 40-day confirmation process, a similar timeline to other nominees. That would put the final Senate vote sometime this spring, since Biden has said he will make an announcement by the end of February.</p>
<p>Biden has vowed to pick the first Black woman to serve on the court.</p>
<p>“He’s looking at the nominees and going to report to us,” Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, said to reporters after he returned from the White House.</p>
<p>Breyer, 83, was nominated by President Bill Clinton in 1994. <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/01/27/reports-supreme-court-justice-breyer-to-step-down/?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=1013604d-6f02-4891-be82-a9766c2acf17" target="_blank">He will retire</a> at the end of the 2022 term.</p>
<p>“I had the chance to tell him that I want somebody that’s going to interpret the law, not make law,” Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said after the White House meeting.</p>
<p>The last Supreme Court nominee, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, took 27 days to confirm in a Senate controlled by Republicans in 2020.</p>
<p>During a Tuesday press briefing, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that Biden has been looking at potential Supreme Court nominations for about a year.</p>
<p>“The president’s view is that after 230 years of the Supreme Court being in existence, the fact that not a single Black woman has served on the Supreme Court is a failure in the process, not a failure or a lack of qualified Black women to serve as Supreme Court justices,” she said.</p>
<p>Senate leaders of both parties had little to say about a prospective Supreme Court pick following their weekly caucus lunches, reserving most of their remarks for the economy and tensions with Russia.</p>
<p>Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said Biden’s pledge to select a Black woman would help make the Supreme Court more reflective of the U.S. population.</p>
<p>Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, the No. 4 Senate Democrat, noted that Tuesday was the first day of Black History Month and said the prospect of confirming a Black nominee was “very exciting.”</p>
<p>Republicans, including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Minority Whip John Thune of South Dakota, pledged to treat Biden’s nominee with respect during a “thoughtful process.”</p>
<p>“It’s pretty hard to comment on a nominee until you get one,” McConnell told reporters.</p>

<p>“The Republican minority will treat the nominee with respect and go through the process in a serious, thoughtful way,” he said.</p>
<p>Biden’s pledge to choose a Black woman to serve on the court would allow him to fulfill a campaign promise from 2020.</p>
<p>So far, Justices Thurgood Marshall and Clarence Thomas have been the only Black members of the court. One woman of color, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, has served.</p>
<p>Some top contenders include 51-year-old <a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2022/01/28/ketanji-brown-jackson-biden-supreme-court/" target="_blank">Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson</a>, who currently serves on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. She was previously vetted by the Obama administration in 2016 as a possible nominee to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia.</p>
<p>House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn of South Carolina is also pushing for the nomination of 55-year-old Michelle Childs, a federal judge in South Carolina who has been nominated to serve on the federal appeals court in Washington.</p>
<p>Childs also has the approval of South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham, who praised her as a  “highly qualified” candidate during an <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/michelle-childs-supreme-court-biden-lindsey-graham-face-the-nation/" target="_blank">interview</a> on “Face the Nation.” Graham is a top member of Senate Judiciary.</p>
<p>Another possible front-runner is 45-year-old California Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger and 47-year-old Georgia U.S. District Court Judge Leslie Abrams Gardner, the sister of Stacey Abrams, who is currently running for governor in Georgia.</p>

(Ariana Figueroa/States Newsroom)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer formally announced his retirement Thursday, giving President Joe Biden his first, and possibly only, opportunity to make a nomination for the lifetime appointment.</p>
<p>At the White House, Biden said he will make his decision by the end of February and recommitted to nominating the court’s first Black female justice, fulfilling a promise he made repeatedly while campaigning for the Oval Office.</p>
<p>“The person I will nominate will be someone of extraordinary qualifications, character, experience and integrity. And that person will be the first Black woman ever nominated to the United States Supreme Court,” Biden said. “It’s long overdue in my opinion.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/press/Letter_to_President_January-27-2022.pdf" target="_blank">Breyer’s retirement</a>, which will take effect in late June or July when the court recesses, follows nearly 28 years as an associate justice who often sided with the court’s more liberal members.</p>
<p>The 83-year-old was the eldest of the nine and had been facing public pressure from left-leaning groups for months to retire while Democrats hold control of the White House and the Senate.</p>
<p>Appearing with Breyer on Thursday from the Roosevelt Room, Biden said that he has not yet made a decision about whom he will nominate, but said he has begun studying candidates&#8217; backgrounds and writings.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="izZFR5Yj7V"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/01/27/reports-supreme-court-justice-breyer-to-step-down/">Reports: Supreme Court Justice Breyer to step down</a></p></blockquote>

<p>If confirmed, Biden’s nominee would be the sixth woman to join the court and the third Black American to be approved since the first justice took his oath of office in 1789.</p>
<p>“I’m ready for a Black woman to be on the Supreme Court,” <a href="https://twitter.com/CoryBooker/status/1486760907392925699" target="_blank">tweeted </a>New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker, one of three Black members of the Senate.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Senate GOP pushback</h4>

	
<p>Biden’s nominee is expected to face a tense confirmation process in the evenly divided Senate, where Republicans are already signaling they may not support his pick.</p>
<p>“Justice Breyer’s successor should be an individual within the legal mainstream who can receive similar broad, bipartisan support,” Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, said in a statement. “Such a candidate will preserve faith in the court, and reflect Americans’ will when they elected an evenly divided Senate.”</p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement that the evenly divided Senate means Biden has “a mandate… to govern from the middle, steward our institutions, and unite America.”</p>
<p>“The President must not outsource this important decision to the radical left. The American people deserve a nominee with demonstrated reverence for the written text of our laws and our Constitution,” McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, continued.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Focus on Judiciary</h4>

	
<p>The first step for Biden’s nominee, once formally announced, will be to schedule private meetings, or conversations, with senators. While nominees typically meet with all or nearly all 100 lawmakers, there’s usually a special focus on those who sit on the Judiciary Committee, which holds the confirmation hearing.</p>
<p>The Biden administration will likely dedicate several White House staffers to prepare the nominee for those meetings and shepherd her through the confirmation process.</p>
<p>The Judiciary Committee, divided between 11 Democrats and 11 Republicans, is expected to move “expeditiously” to confirm Biden’s pick, according to Chairman Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat.</p>
<p>This would be Durbin’s first Supreme Court nomination process as chairman, though he’s been on the panel for more than 16 years.</p>
<p>California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein was the top Democrat on the panel and oversaw confirmation hearings for the three Supreme Court nominees former President Donald Trump named.</p>
<p>Feinstein stepped down from that role in November 2020 after several left-leaning organizations called for her resignation over her approach to Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett&#8217;s confirmation hearing. Many Democratic groups felt that Feinstein’s cordial tone with the chairman at the time, Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, and a hug at the end of the hearings didn’t strike the right tone.</p>
<p>“After serving as the lead Democrat on the Judiciary Committee for four years, I will not seek the chairmanship or ranking member position in the next Congress,” Feinstein said in a statement at the time.</p>
<p>Republicans also have a different leader on the panel than they did during the last Supreme Court confirmation process — Grassley, who has overseen the confirmation hearings of two justices during previous stints as chairman.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Possible deadlock</h4>

	
<p>If Biden’s nominee gets the backing of at least one Republican on the Judiciary Committee, her nomination will go directly to the Senate floor for a vote. But if the panel deadlocks with all Democrats voting for her and all Republicans voting against her, the Senate will need to go through the extra step of discharging her nomination from the committee.</p>
<p>The Senate would debate the motion to discharge for up to four hours, after which it would vote to bring the nomination to the Senate floor. If a simple majority of the Senate votes to do that, the Supreme Court nominee would move forward for procedural votes and a confirmation vote.</p>
<p>If all GOP senators oppose the nominee, then all 50 Senate Democrats, including centrist Arizona Sen. Krysten Sinema and West Virginia’s Joe Manchin, will need to vote to confirm her and Vice President Kamala Harris would need to break the tie.</p>
<p>Manchin, i<a href="https://twitter.com/WVMetroNews/status/1486722129311588360" target="_blank">n a Thursday interview</a> with West Virginia MetroNews&#8217; &#8220;Talkline&#8221; program, said he wouldn’t rule out a nominee who is more left-leaning than he is, noting “it&#8217;s not too hard to get more liberal than me.”</p>
<p>Manchin said that Biden’s nominee, regardless of philosophical beliefs, wouldn’t change the balance of the 6-3 conservative-leaning court and that he’s more interested in their disposition.</p>
<p>“Do they have the disposition to be able to work with their fellow justices, to make good judgment and be able to disperse and use the rule of law as your guide?” Manchin said. “That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m looking for, so it will be the character of the person.”</p>
<p>One of Biden’s possible nominees, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson — who grew up in Miami — already has experience with the Senate’s judicial confirmation process.</p>
<p>The Senate voted 53-44 in June 2021 to confirm her to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit with Republicans Susan Collins of Maine, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska voting with Democrats to approve her.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">&#8216;Rigorous&#8217; process</h4>

	
<p>Biden said his process to pick a nominee for the seat will be “rigorous” and that the woman he selects will be “worthy of Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence and decency.”</p>
<p>Breyer’s remarks about his retirement focused less on this career and more on the diversity of the country’s 330 million residents as well as the way many of the United States’ founders referred to democracy as an “experiment.”</p>
<p>Breyer said that his wife had paid many of their grandchildren to memorize former President Abraham Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address, before repeating several lines of the speech himself.</p>
<p>“My grandchildren and their children; they&#8217;ll determine whether the experiment still works,” Breyer said. “And of course, I am an optimist, and I’m pretty sure it will. Does it surprise you that that&#8217;s the thought that comes into my mind today?”</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Lawmakers in the Virginia Senate rejected legislation requested by the state’s new Republican attorney general that would have allowed him to overrule local prosecutors when police disagreed with their charging decisions.</p>
<p>Attorney General Jason Miyares, who ran on a law-and-order platform despite the position’s limited criminal law enforcement powers, made the legislation a centerpiece of his campaign.</p>
<p>It was always a longshot given Democrats maintained control of the Senate. But the proposal was also roundly rejected by a bi-partisan association of locally elected commonwealth’s attorneys around the state.</p>
<p>“The Virginia Association of Commonwealths Attorneys opposes this bill basically on the principle that we don’t believe the legislature should be centralizing local criminal justice,” said Derek Davis, the commonwealth’s attorney in Surry County, speaking on behalf of the group before the Senate’s Judiciary Committee.</p>
<p>In a last-ditch effort to save the bill, its Senate patron, Sen. Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover, narrowed the bill to only apply to child sex offenses, arguing that the attorney general’s office already has the power to enforce child pornography laws and internet crimes.</p>
<p>Miyares’ office argued that the change would merely make more resources available to help local prosecutors tackle complex cases that can span multiple jurisdictions. He said it would result in “a class of super prosecutors focused on child sex offense cases.”</p>
<p>Democrats on the committee argued that the attorney general’s office could already provide the assistance on a voluntary basis.</p>
<p>Miyares had pitched the legislation as a way to push back against a new class of criminal-justice-reform minded prosecutors who have been elected in recent years. It was supported by associations that represent police officers around the state.</p>
<p>One Democrat on the committee, Sen. Chap Petersen, D-Fairfax City, supported the bill,<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/judge-zaldivar-sentence-abuse/2021/09/20/85258424-1a40-11ec-8380-5fbadbc43ef8_story.html" target="_blank"> citing a recent case</a> in which a man convicted of sexually abusing a child in Fairfax County was sentenced to 17 years as part of a plea deal, drawing outrage from family members.</p>
<p>In addition to drawing opposition from local commonwealth’s attorneys, a lobbying group representing defense lawyers also opposed the change.</p>
<p>“It’s unusual for prosecutors and defense attorneys to be on the same side,” observed Sen. John Edwards, D-Roanoke, who chairs the Senate’s judiciary committee, which heard the bill.</p>

(Ariana Figueroa/States Newsroom)</p><p>The U.S. Supreme Court’s conservative majority appeared unconvinced Friday of the Biden administration’s authority to impose a vaccine-or-test mandate on private businesses, casting doubt on a key piece of the White House COVID-19 response.</p>
<p>The justices seemed potentially more comfortable with another Biden administration rule to fight the virus that requires certain health care workers be vaccinated against COVID-19, with no options for testing.</p>
<p>The court’s six conservative members during a two-hour special hearing on Friday on the workplace rule questioned the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s authority to impose an emergency vaccine rule on employers of more than 100 workers.</p>
<p>States have asked the court to pause the OSHA rule’s implementation, scheduled for Monday. The justices could issue a ruling as soon as this weekend.</p>
<p>Under the proposed Biden administration rule, those businesses either must have their entire workforce vaccinated against COVID-19 or require unvaccinated employees to test regularly and wear masks on the job.</p>
<p>The conservative justices characterized the emergency standard as a broader public health measure than OSHA has previously imposed and argued that Congress has had sufficient time to impose such a mandate if it wanted.</p>
<p>Chief Justice John Roberts said the OSHA mandate and a separate but similar one by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that requires health care workers in facilities receiving federal funding be vaccinated — which was challenged by states in another unusually long argument following the OSHA case — were part of an administration-wide program.</p>
<p>That approach undercut the government’s case that each agency was working within its particular authority, he said.</p>
<p>“As more and more agencies come into place, it’s a little hard to accept the idea that it is particularized to this thing,” Roberts told U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, the administration’s chief lawyer.</p>
<p>“It seems to me that the government is trying to work across the waterfront and it’s just going agency by agency. This has been referred to as a workaround, and I’m wondering what it is you’re trying to work around.”</p>
<p>Justice Neil M. Gorsuch asked why the issue was not best answered by “the people’s representatives in the states and the halls of Congress” instead of an emergency order by OSHA.</p>
<p>“Congress has had a year to act on the question of vaccine mandates already,” he said.</p>
<p>Roberts, Gorsuch and Justice Samuel Alito said the OSHA rule was “unprecedented.”</p>
<p>Benjamin Flowers, the Ohio solicitor general who argued the case for a group of Republican-led states that are challenging the OSHA mandate, said on such an important policy, Congress — not an executive branch agency — should be involved, even during an emergency.</p>
<p>“When there’s an emergency, it’s especially important that it be a considered, thoughtful process,” he said.</p>
<p>The court’s three liberal members — Justices Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor — defended both the OSHA rule and the health care workers mandate.</p>
<p>The court could only strike down the OSHA rule before it takes effect Monday if it would be in the public interest to do so, Breyer said.</p>
<p>With nearly 750,000 new cases Thursday — about 10 times the number when OSHA wrote the rule — and hospitals filled with unvaccinated people, Breyer said states would not be acting in the public interest.</p>
<p>“I would find it unbelievable that it would be in the public interest to suddenly stop these vaccinations,” he said.</p>
<p>Kagan said vaccinations have been shown to be the best way to prevent COVID-19, with masking the second-best. The federal law creating OSHA permits the agency to take necessary emergency measures to protect workers’ health.</p>
<p>“Why isn’t that necessary? What else should be done?” Kagan asked. “It’s obviously the policy that gears to preventing most sickness and death. And the agency has done everything but stand on its head to show quite clearly that no other policy will prevent sickness and death anywhere like this one will.”</p>
<p>Scott Keller, an attorney for the National Federation of Independent Business, which is challenging the mandate, said the requirement would lead workers to quit their jobs.</p>
<p>But waves of sick workers who cannot report to their jobs would also be disruptive, Sotomayor said.</p>
<p>The states challenging the workplace mandate include Ohio, Tennessee, Idaho, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, Arizona, New Hampshire, Florida, Georgia, Iowa and Louisiana.</p>
<p>Health care workers case</p>
<p>The court also heard arguments on the case challenging the related CMS requirement that certain health care workers be vaccinated against COVID-19.</p>
<p>Louisiana Solicitor General Elizabeth Murrill and Missouri Deputy Solicitor General Jesus A. Osete argued for the states challenging that mandate. Montana, Georgia, Arizona, Idaho, Iowa and New Hampshire are also part of the challenge.</p>
<p>Roberts appeared to possibly give more leeway to the Department of Health and Human Services, the parent agency to CMS, to impose rules on facilities that receive federal health funding.</p>
<p>Similar rules mandate where hand sanitizer must be or how high beds must be, Sotomayor said.</p>
<p>“I’m not saying that there’s not some limit there,” Roberts said. “But I don’t know why a provision addressing an infectious disease of this scope is beyond the secretary’s determination that the mandate at issue here is necessary.”</p>
<p>Murrill said the federal government is required to consult states on such major policies because of the major effect on health care.</p>
<p>“I cannot (underscore) enough the impact on states and their provider networks,” she said.</p>
<p>In a statement, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that unvaccinated people remain at high risk of serious consequences from COVID-19 and that the policies before the court were important pieces of the government’s response.</p>
<p>“Unvaccinated Americans continue to face a real threat of severe illness and death — including from Omicron,” she said.</p>
<p>“The OSHA rule ensures that employers are protecting their employees by encouraging workers to get vaccinated and requiring unvaccinated workers to mask and test. The CMS healthcare rule protects vulnerable patients by requiring that covered healthcare providers get vaccinated. The need and the urgency for these policies is greater than ever, and we are confident in the legal authority for both policies.”</p>
<p>Flowers and Murrill argued remotely instead of in person because of recent positive COVID-19 tests, Reuters reported Friday.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Ohio Attorney General’s office confirmed Flowers tested positive Thursday. He first tested positive late last month and has since fully recovered, but the court-required test still detected the virus Thursday, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Representatives for the Louisiana Attorney General’s office did not immediately return a message seeking confirmation.</p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce/ For the Virginia Mercury)</p><p>A Louisiana federal judge has put a hold on President Joe Biden’s mandate that Head Start workers be vaccinated against COVID-19.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Terry Doughty, who previously ruled against a vaccine mandate for health care workers, <a href="https://www.alabamaag.gov/Documents/news/Head%20Start%20Mandate%20Stay%20Order.pdf" target="_blank">issued a preliminary injunction</a> on New Year’s Day restricting the executive branch from enforcing in 24 states a mandate for Head Start, a federal pre-K program for low-income families.</p>
<p>The mandate called for all employees, volunteers and contractors with Head Start to be fully vaccinated by the end of January. Children under 5 who attend the program are not yet eligible to be vaccinated and at risk of COVID-19 infections.</p>
<p>A group of 24 Republican state attorneys general, led by Louisiana’s Jeff Landry and including Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Ohio and Tennessee, challenged the mandate last month.</p>
<p>Doughty, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, expressed skepticism about the federal government’s ability to contain the pandemic, including through vaccine mandates.</p>
<p>“In the immortal words of President Ronald Reagan, the nine most terrifying words in the English language are, ‘I’m from the government and I’m here to help,’” he wrote in the order’s second paragraph. “In order to help rid the United States of the COVID-19 virus, the government has imposed four vaccine mandates,” including the one for Head Start.</p>
<p>Still, he said the decision was not about the wisdom of the mandate, but the constitutional separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches.</p>
<p>Executive agencies “DO NOT have the power to impose the Head Start Mandate” without an act of Congress, he wrote.</p>
<p>Doughty’s order will remain in effect until the final resolution of the case or by orders in his court or by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals or the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court will hear arguments Friday on whether the order invalidating a vaccine-or-testing mandate for large employers and the vaccine mandate for health care workers should stay in place.</p>
<p>Medical experts have urged vaccinations as the best method of preventing COVID-19. White House Chief Medical Advisor Anthony Fauci<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr4QVGE-_qU" target="_blank"> told NBC News</a> last month that the “real problem” with the current omicron variant wave was that many people eligible for vaccines have not received them.</p>
<p>According to<a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total" target="_blank"> Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data</a>, fewer than two-thirds of U.S. residents 5 and older are fully vaccinated, and only about one-third of those who are fully vaccinated have received a booster dose that is now recommended.</p>
<p>In addition to his ruling on the health care workers mandate, Doughty<a href="https://lailluminator.com/2021/06/16/federal-judge-halts-biden-pause-on-new-oil-and-gas-leases-across-the-u-s/" target="_blank"> also struck down</a> Biden’s pause of new oil and gas leases on federal lands and waters last year, a major setback for the president’s climate change agenda.</p>
<p>Although he considers himself conservative, Doughty<a href="https://www.theadvertiser.com/story/news/2021/12/01/judge-terry-doughty-blocked-bidens-covid-vaccine-mandate-what-know/8821010002/" target="_blank"> has said</a> he does not consider politics when making judicial decisions.</p>
<p>Trump appointed Doughty in 2017 and the U.S. Senate approved him, 98-0, the following year.</p>
<p>The White House referred a request for comment to the Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
<p>Representatives for HHS did not immediately respond.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ruling, issued by Judge Joseph J. Ellis in Spotsylvania Circuit Court, was the culmination of a more than three-year legal fight by a group of REC members, led by retired Department of Justice lawyer Seth Heald, to amend the cooperative’s bylaws. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most significant of the changes would have required all board of directors meetings to be open to cooperative members, except for executive sessions during which confidential or sensitive information could be discussed. That amendment would also have required the board to give 72 hours notice before any meeting and to livestream their meetings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A second amendment would have altered the system of electing board members and required directors to reveal the candidates for whom they cast “proxy” votes, or votes that members cede to the board to cast as they choose. Currently, the board relies on secret balloting to allot proxy votes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, a third would have required directors’ annual compensation to be published every year in the co-op magazine and set a 60-day notice period for any board vote on changes to compensation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These are modest proposals. They are proposals that have proved workable in other electric cooperatives,” said Evan Johns, an attorney with Appalachian Mountain Advocates representing Heald and his co-plaintiffs, during arguments Tuesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Rappahannock Electric Cooperative, Virginia&#8217;s largest co-op with more than 140,000 members, has staunchly resisted the changes, arguing that they would fundamentally prevent the cooperative from fulfilling its duties under state law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This would greatly hinder the operational efficiency and effectiveness of the cooperative,” REC Board of Directors Chairman Christopher Shipe told the court Tuesday during trial. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike investor-owned utilities, cooperatives are nonprofit and owned by their members. Electric cooperatives are built around <a href="https://www.electric.coop/seven-cooperative-principles%E2%80%8B" target="_blank">seven basic principles</a>, of which one is democratic member control. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We operate under democratic procedures in the boardroom,” Shipe testified Tuesday. “We’re a cooperative, but we’re a private business organized under the cooperative principles.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, he contended that open meetings would be “unworkable.” Not only must the board of directors regularly deal with sensitive contract and grid information not appropriate for public consumption, he contended, but opening meetings could expose the co-op to “safety and security” risks, including of cyberattacks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The world we operate in is full of threats and full of risks,” Rappahannock CEO and President John Hewa testified later. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, opening up board meetings to member observation could politicize the co-op’s operations and complicate decision-making “because of things being misconstrued, misstatements and things being taken out of context and tracked,” Shipe told the court. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is the risk of constant exposure to litigation something that would cause paralysis on the board?” Andy Sherrod, a Hirschler Fleishcher attorney representing the REC, asked. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Definitely,” Shipe responded. </span></p>

John Levasseur, a former REC board member — noted that numerous other electric cooperatives around the nation have open board meetings and are still able to function. Some states, such as Colorado, require electric co-ops to open up board meetings to members. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6561940-Electric-Cooperative-Governance-Task-Force-Report.html" target="_blank">secret 2018 report</a> by a task force convened by the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, the trade association for electric cooperatives, stated that “on balance, the task force supports permitting members to attend board of directors meetings, other than portions of meetings at which legal, employee and other confidential matters are addressed.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hewa later described the task force report as less specific recommendations for how every co-op should function and more “intended to invoke and further encourage discussion in corporate boardrooms.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most prominently, the nation’s largest electric co-op, Pedernales Electric Cooperative in Texas, began holding open, live-streamed board meetings over a decade ago after widespread scandals involving the board’s leadership triggered a class-action lawsuit, the criminal conviction of a top official and state as well as </span><a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-110hhrg46194/pdf/CHRG-110hhrg46194.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">congressional hearings on electric cooperative governance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, the Powell Valley Electric Cooperative, which has approximately 33,000 members spanning counties in Southwest Virginia and Tennessee, also began holding open board meetings in 2018. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PVEC member William Kornrich of Sneedville, Tenn., who has been involved in governance reforms at that co-op, testified that he has attended roughly 30 board meetings since Powell Valley opened them up to observation and that the co-op has continued to operate without major problems. Board members go into executive session to discuss confidential and sensitive matters three to four times per year, he said, and typically spend about an hour to an hour and a half in open session each month.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Rappahannock Electric Cooperative officials said that they didn’t believe more than 10 percent of their board’s business could be done in public. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is my view that outside the consent agenda we’d have to go into some kind of executive session. It is not appropriate for open meetings,” said Shipe. “Open meetings would preclude us from fulfilling our statutory requirements.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hewa, the Rappahannock CEO, who previously served as CEO of Pedernales Electric Co-op after the institution of reforms there, said in response to questions from Heald’s attorneys that “over 50 percent” of that board’s business had been conducted in executive session, but not as much as 90 percent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-op leaders said Rappahannock’s size meant its situation was not comparable to Powell Valley. Furthermore, Hewa pointed out that unlike Pedernales, Rappahannock Electric Cooperative is regulated by the state and subject to federal disclosure requirements as a federal borrower through the Rural Utilities Service. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe Rappahannock is the most wisely and truly transparent cooperative out there,” Hewa said. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘All things necessary and incidental’ but ‘not absolute’ </h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the full day of trial, Ellis said his role was not to determine whether the proposed bylaws were “good” or “bad” or whether they might complicate the work of Rappahannock Electric’s board, but whether they would fundamentally prevent that board from fulfilling its statutory role. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular, Ellis pointed to a September 2020 ruling in the case by Spotsylvania Judge William Glover that led to many of the disputes going to trial this December. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The board cannot prevent a vote on bylaws changes simply on the theory that the proposed alteration or repeal would impinge on the ability of the board to conduct its business,” Glover wrote. “However, there may be proposals which would alter the existing bylaws to the extent that the board could not continue to execute its statutory role.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Utility Cooperatives Act defines the principal purpose of electric co-ops as “making energy, energy services and other utility services available at the lowest cost consistent with sound economy and prudent management of the business of such cooperative and such other purposes as its membership shall approve.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The act also grants a cooperative’s board of directors the power “to do all things necessary or incidental in conducting the business of the cooperative,” including the power “to make its own rules and regulations as to its procedure.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, Judge Ellis cautioned, “the power of the Rappahannock Electric Cooperative is not absolute. It’s not.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Late in the day, he told Hewa that it was hard to understand how it was in the highest and best interest of co-op members to be “completely locked out” of the board of directors’ decision-making process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the case took a twist when Ellis determined that he was required to look at the three bylaw proposals as a slate, rather than on an individual basis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consequently, he said, if he found that any one of the proposals would fundamentally prevent the board from fulfilling its statutory role, he would have to reject all of them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t know if I have a choice,” he said, before telling Heald’s attorneys, “I understand your dismay.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately Ellis ruled that the provision in the first bylaw amendment requiring 72 hours notice before a meeting, without any accommodation for emergencies, would prevent the board from fulfilling its role. Rappahannock had argued that such a change would bar the board from meeting even in the case of a hurricane or other storm producing widespread outages, a concern echoed by Ellis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Having said that, let me point out this is named a cooperative for a reason,” the judge continued. “And certainly the attitudes I’ve heard today express to this court that it’s not as cooperative as it should be.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the trial, Shipe said that he didn’t agree with Ellis’ assessment of Rappahannock’s cooperative spirit and that he was “sorry that was the judge’s impression.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, both he and Hewa applauded the ruling, with Shipe saying that “the judge was trying to find the right balance in this case” and that the full slate of bylaws “was a bridge too far in its entirety.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Maybe we can find some compromise,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heald said he was “extremely disappointed” in the case’s outcome and that the plaintiffs were evaluating whether or not they would appeal. During the trial, their attorneys disputed Ellis’ interpretation of the law as requiring him to assess the proposals as a slate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The way hurdles have been thrown in our path all along the way makes it seem really unlikely that the bylaw amendment process is an effective tool for reforming a co-op if it really wants to fight your reforms,” said Heald. “Maybe legislation is a better way to handle it.” </span></p>

(Julia Rendleman/ For the Virginia Mercury)</p><p>The Supreme Court of Virginia has blocked an attempt by the company that provided health care in state prisons to continue fighting the cancelation of its contract by prison officials.</p>
<p>The court on Saturday denied a motion for a stay and a petition for review filed by Armor Correctional Health Services, which has been battling the Virgina Department of Corrections for months over a decision to terminate a contract with company and bring prison health care back in house.</p>
<p>The decision comes after the Circuit Court for the City of Richmond found the DOC &#8220;did not act arbitrarily and capriciously&#8221; in ending the arrangement with Armor, which had held the contract since 2014.</p>
<p>“Today’s proceedings are a victory for the quality of health care in our facilities,” Harold Clarke, corrections department director, said in a statement Saturday. “Our goal has always been to provide the constitutionally-mandated level of health care in our facilities and this transition will ensure that we are able to continue to do so in the future.”</p>

<p>VitalCore Health Strategies, a Kansas-based correctional health care company, began a contract on Dec. 12 with the state to provide prison health care on an interim basis &#8220;while the department prepares to fully assume responsibility for delivering health care services to the nearly 25,000 inmates in state custody,&#8221; the Department of Corrections said.</p>
<p>Armor had waged a protracted campaign to keep the $90 million contract, which <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/07/26/virginia-department-of-corrections-announces-plans-to-de-privatize-prison-healthcare/" target="_blank">state officials moved to end</a> last summer after years of rising health care costs and complaints over substandard medical care in Virginia prisons. The Miami-based company lobbied gubernatorial campaigns and members of the General Assembly, blaming the pandemic for staffing shortfalls and accusing the state of mismanagement.</p>
<p>“We believe​, and our outcomes show, Armor has been a valuable partner in providing quality health care to individuals incarcerated in Virginia and obviously we are disappointed we are no longer working with the commonwealth,&#8221; Santhia Curtis, Armor’s general counsel, said in an email to the Mercury.</p>

Above are the proposed U.S. House of Representative districts. (Screengrab)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Special redistricting experts working for the Virginia Supreme Court have submitted redrawn federal and state legislative districts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The<a href="https://www.vacourts.gov/courts/scv/districting/maps_special_masters.pdf" target="_blank"> new maps</a> for the U.S. House of Representatives, the House of Delegates and the state Senate are out for public review in advance of public hearings at the court Dec. 15 and 17. The court will consider the comments and approve new maps by Dec. 19.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislators and others were scrambling Thursday to review the proposed maps. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversations with some of them show that the efforts by special masters Sean P. Trende and Bernard N. Grofman met expectations for maps drawn with communities, not political incumbents, in mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This gets pretty close to being fair,” said Del. Lashrecse Aird, D-Petersburg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One key principle that the masters kept in mind was the idea of “communities of interest” in which actual groupings of voters around related cities, towns and counties were given more weight than drawing oddly shaped districts designed to maintain the political status quo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We carefully drew districts that met constitutional and statutory population requirements,&#8221; Trende and Grofman wrote in their summary released Dec. 8. &#8220;In doing so, we minimized county and city splits, while respecting natural boundaries and communities of interest (“COIs”) to the extent possible.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That, said Liz White, director of OneVirginia2021, a nonprofit that pushed hard to take redistricting out of the hands of the majority party in the General Assembly, is “a huge part of the national redistricting movement.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At a glance they look fair as part of a partisan balance,” White said. “It’s great they are out so soon to give the public a chance to look at them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Takeaways from early reviews of the maps<a href="https://www.vpap.org/visuals/visual/first-look-at-court-maps/" target="_blank"> tended to show</a> that the maps tend to favor Democrats more than Republicans because they are concentrated around natural social centers, such as cities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed redraw of the 7</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Congressional District, however, was immediately controversial because the special masters recommended that the entire district be moved farther north to include Stafford and Prince Williams counties that are quickly diversifying and growing more Democratic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current 7</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> District would be distributed between the 5th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and 1st</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Congressional Districts, seats now held by Republicans Bob Good and Rob Wittman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The loser in the plans appears to be U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Henrico, an up-and-coming politician who has received national attention and has been a major GOP target. She had planned to run for a third term, but if she wants to do so now, she’ll have to run elsewhere. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Possibilities include running in the 1</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> District and facing Wittman, who would be a strong competitor or the new 7</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> District, which is 50 miles from her home in Henrico County.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s bad news for Spanberger but good news overall for the Democrats,” said Stephen Farnsworth, a professor of political science at the University of Mary Washington. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">White, of OneVirginia2021, said “it is not the job of the special masters to protect anyone.” Spanberger’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Sally Hudson, D-Charlottesville, gave a positive review of the new proposed 57</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">district, which she currently represents. The map places Charlottesville squarely in the center of the district with suburbs extended outward “like a doughnut,” she said. “It’s natural. Voters can work in the city and live, shop and play just outside of it.” Several Republican lawmakers did not respond to requests for comment on the new maps. Garren Shipley, a spokesman for incoming GOP House Majority Leader Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, said &#8220;We have a blanket no comment policy on redistricting.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the public hearings and the Supreme Court’s final decision, the new maps will be set. There won’t be a legislative or gubernatorial review, White says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Map redrawing has long been a controversial process because the party in charge of the General Assembly typically got its way to make new maps that kept their people in power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fed up, voters approved a Constitutional amendment in 2020 calling for a 16-member redistricting commission comprised of eight citizens nominated by legislators and eight lawmakers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The commission, however, was paralyzed by partisanship and acrimony, failing to agree on a single set of maps.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

(Image via U.S. Supreme Court website)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court is weighing potentially sweeping changes to the right to an abortion, after two hours of arguments Wednesday morning on a Mississippi law that bans most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.</p>
<p>The court’s conservatives, who hold a 6-3 majority, appeared through their questions to be sympathetic to Mississippi’s arguments that its law should be upheld—and they also seemed open to the possibility of undoing other precedent-setting abortion cases.</p>
<p>Supporters of the Mississippi law argued not only that it should be upheld, but that two key cases that have determined when a woman has the right to seek an abortion also should be overturned: the 1973 <i>Roe v. Wade</i> decision as well as the 1992 <i>Planned Parenthood v. Casey </i>ruling.</p>
<p>That would allow states to decide if they want to allow the medical procedure within their borders, the lawyers contended.</p>
<p>“When an issue affects everyone, and when the Constitution does not take sides on it, it belongs to the people,” said Mississippi Solicitor General Scott Stewart, arguing that the precedents set in prior landmark abortion cases “have failed.”</p>
<p>Attorneys arguing on behalf of Mississippi’s only abortion clinic and of the federal government told the justices that the right to an abortion was correctly established in the <i>Roe v. Wade</i> decision and then reaffirmed in the <i>Planned Parenthood v. Casey </i>ruling.</p>
<p>Undoing that right would have devastating consequences for people seeking abortions throughout the country, they said.</p>
<p>Some may be forced to travel out of state to seek care. If they lack the money and time off from work to do so, they may have no option beyond carrying a child to term, even if it is not in their best interest or that of their family, the lawyers said.</p>
<p>“There is no less need now than there was 30 years or 50 years ago for women to be able to make this fundamental choice for themselves about their bodies, lives and health,” said Julie Rickelman, senior director of litigation at the Center for Reproductive Rights.</p>
<p>“Why is 15 weeks not enough time?” Chief Justice John Roberts asked Rickelman.</p>
<p>She noted that the Mississippi law would ban most abortions nine weeks earlier than the current legal standard, giving patients less time to navigate an array of regulatory barriers that some states have enacted to make it harder to seek an abortion.</p>
<p>The <i>Roe</i> decision established a legal right to an abortion during the first two trimesters of pregnancy, or 26 weeks. In the Casey decision, the court ruled that people can obtain an abortion until viability, or the point when a fetus can survive outside the womb — generally about 24 weeks.</p>
<p>The case <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2021/19-1392_gfbi.pdf" target="_blank">argued Wednesday</a> is <i>Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#8217;s Health.</i></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Ramifications for dozens of states   </h4>

	
<p>Wednesday’s hearing came after the top court already has been grappling with abortion rights.</p>
<p>Since announcing in May that the justices would take up the Mississippi case, the court has heard arguments over a Texas law designed to skirt the court’s past decisions and ban abortions about six weeks after a woman’s last menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>The pair of legal battles has thrust the contentious social issue back into the national spotlight, and thousands of activists in both support of and opposition to abortion rights flooded <a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2021/12/01/protesters-rally-at-supreme-court-as-justices-hear-landmark-abortion-case/" target="_blank">the sidewalks around the court</a> on Wednesday to chant and wave signs.</p>
<p>Dr. Nisha Verma, an obstetrician-gynecologist who practices at Emory University in Atlanta, said she regularly attends local protests in support of abortion access, and is worried about what will happen in her state if Roe is overturned.</p>
<p>Many of her patients don’t know until their second or third trimester that they or their fetus have developed a medical issue that requires terminating a pregnancy, Verma said.</p>
<p>“A lot of times this is an act of compassion, that people are trying to do the right thing in their pregnancy or [for] their existing children,” she said.</p>
<p>The pending abortion case <a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2021/10/18/how-a-mississippi-court-case-could-pave-the-way-for-an-abortion-ban-in-arizona-and-across-u-s/" target="_blank">could spur a cascade of legal changes</a> across two dozen states if justices back the restrictive Mississippi law — and potentially dismantle the landmark 1973 ruling affirming the right to an abortion.</p>
<p>A dozen states — including Louisiana, Tennessee, Missouri and Idaho — have “trigger laws” that would go into effect banning abortions if <i>Roe v. Wade</i> is overturned, according to the Guttmacher Institute, an organization focused on reproductive health and rights.</p>
<p>Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona and five others still have abortion bans that pre-date <i>Roe v. Wade</i> on the books, which would become enforceable again if the case is overturned.</p>
<p>Amanda Davis, of Virginia, said during an interview outside the court on Wednesday that she’s been attending protests against abortion rights since the 1990s. Her faith as a Christian helped her decide.</p>
<p>“The Bible says do not murder, and I consider abortion murder,” Davis said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Debate over precedents</h4>

	
<p>During Wednesday’s arguments, the court’s liberal members repeatedly emphasized the implications of undoing the prior rulings.</p>
<p>“Will this institution survive the stench that this creates in the public perception that the Constitution and its reading are just political acts?” Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked at one point.</p>
<p>Justice Brett Kavanaugh, one of the justices appointed by former President Donald Trump, giving the court its conservative majority, noted that if the Mississippi law is upheld, states would not be barred from allowing abortion.</p>
<p>He listed a long line of major cases in which the Supreme Court overruled precedents, including <i>Brown v. Board of Education,</i> which found that racial segregation in schools violated the Constitution.</p>
<p>If the court had adhered to its earlier decisions in those cases, Kavanaugh said, “the country would be a much different place.”</p>
<p>Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar underscored how deeply the <i>Roe </i>decision has been woven into everyday American life, noting that while some people don’t agree with the decision, they know what the court ruled and what it means if they have an unintended pregnancy.</p>
<p>“For the court to reverse course now, I think would run counter to that societal reliance and the very concept we have of what equality is guaranteed to women in this country,” Prelogar said.</p>

Jackson Women's Health, a case about a Mississippi law that bans most abortions after 15 weeks, on Dec. 1, 2021 in Washington, DC. With the addition of conservative justices to the court by former President Donald Trump, experts believe this could be the most important abortion case in decades and could undermine or overturn Roe v. Wade. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Lucia Ruta remembers a time when abortions were illegal.</p>
<p>A native of Washington, D.C., she says she received an abortion in a back alley when she was 16, in the 1960s.</p>
<p>“The doctor told me that if I made as so much a whimper, he was going to stop and kick me out,” she said. “I was one of the lucky ones. My life was not destroyed, and I didn’t die.”</p>
<p>Ruta was among the thousands of protestors outside the U.S. Supreme Court Wednesday as the justices heard oral arguments on a Mississippi law that bans abortions after 15 weeks, a direct challenge to the landmark <i>Roe v. Wade</i> decision that could <a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2021/10/18/how-a-mississippi-court-case-could-pave-the-way-for-an-abortion-ban-in-arizona-and-across-u-s/" target="_blank">pave the way to overturning abortion rights.</a></p>
<p>Supporters of abortion rights and abortion opponents jostled in front of the court on a sunny Washington morning, with temperatures in the 40s, waving signs, chanting and shouting through bullhorns. A man holding a huge “Hands off Roe!” sign positioned himself in front of a line of signs that advised “Trust Jesus” and “Jesus Saves from Hell.”</p>
<p>Those on opposite sides of the debate were separated more or less by barriers, and police circulated in the crowd and guarded the long flight of court steps, but the protest was peaceful.</p>
<p>Ruta said she strongly opposes attempts to change abortion law. “To turn back <i>Roe</i> after 50 years is just astounding,” she said. “This has nothing to do with life — it has everything to do with the oppression of women, because we’ve come too far to go backwards.”</p>
<p>Anne Perdue of Roanoke said she disagrees and believes that a pregnancy should be carried to full term and that the child should be put up for adoption. She said her faith believes that all life is sacred.</p>
<p>“I feel like God withdraws his favor from our nation when we shed innocent blood,” she said.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/ProtectChoice/status/1466125485893632002?s=20</p>
<p>Perdue said that after she had her first child, she quickly got pregnant again and was pressured to consider having an abortion, but she decided against it.</p>
<p>“I believe there are too many options to abortions and that life is the choice,” she said.</p>
<p>But Dr. Nisha Verma, an obstetrician-gynecologist at Emory University in Atlanta, said that much of the abortion care she provides her patients is due to medical complications experienced during a pregnancy, and an abortion becomes necessary.</p>
<p>“I take care of patients every day that they don’t find out until their second trimester ultrasound that their baby has a terrible genetic anomaly that is going to be lethal, and they need an abortion,” she said.</p>
<p>“I think we often talk about abortion like this isolated political issue, but for me as an abortion care provider, this is happening in real people’s lives, and I feel really strongly that the people I take care of every day are capable of making these decisions for themselves,” she added.</p>
<p>Some members of Congress also stopped by.</p>
<p>Democratic Reps. Judy Chu of California and Cori Bush of Missouri rallied with abortion rights supporters. Chu led the House effort to pass the “<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3755/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22Womens+Health+Protection+Act%22%2C%22Womens%22%2C%22Health%22%2C%22Protection%22%2C%22Act%22%5D%7D&amp;r=2&amp;s=1" target="_blank">Women’s Health Protection Act</a>” in September, which would codify <i>Roe v. Wade</i> into law. It has not passed the Senate.</p>
<p>Bush declined to comment, but held a sign in support of abortion rights.</p>
<p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, (D-Calif.), said in a statement that the Supreme Court has the “responsibility to honor the Constitution, the law and this basic truth: every woman has the constitutional right to basic reproductive health care.”</p>
<p>“Mississippi’s radical abortion ban, part of a nationwide assault against women’s freedoms targeting in particular women of color and women from low-income communities, is brazenly unconstitutional and designed to destroy <i>Roe v. Wade</i>,” she said.</p>
<p>Later in the protest, several buses arrived filled with students from Liberty University, a private evangelical college in Lynchburg. Among them was Kate Jones, an 18-year-old from Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Jones said she never had a strong stance on abortion until she began attending Liberty University earlier this year. Clutching a Bible close to her chest, she said as she started studying scripture, she noticed how everything comes back to life and the importance of it.</p>
<p>“If we stand for life, how can we stand for something that causes death and has brought so much hurt and pain into the world?” she said.</p>
<p>Jones said that she did not feel like she was at the Supreme Court to protest, but instead to pray for those in government, such as President Joe Biden and the Supreme Court justices, so that “they’re guided to the truth and that they make the right decision.”</p>
<p>Sheila Katz, CEO of the National Council of Jewish Women, said that access to abortion is not only a Jewish issue, but also a racial, economic, health care and religious freedom issue.</p>
<p>“No one should be able to dictate one perception of when life begins in this country,” she said.</p>
<p>Katz, of Maryland, added that the Jewish faith does not share that belief.</p>
<p>“In our Torah, our sacred texts, says that abortion is not only permitted, but required at times, and so the only way we can have religious freedom and my ability to choose to have an abortion if I like, is if everyone can make their own health and moral informed decisions,” she said.</p>
<p>Katz said that there are religious groups whose members support abortion rights. The Pew Research Center <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/01/22/american-religious-groups-vary-widely-in-their-views-of-abortion/" target="_blank">found</a> that religious groups with the highest percentages of members backing abortion rights included members of the Episcopal Church, the United Church of Christ and American Jews.</p>
<p>“Today’s Hanukkah, so I think there’s nothing more fitting than being here saying we’re fighting for our religious freedom during a holiday that’s all about fighting for our religious freedom,” Katz said.</p>

<p>No observer of contemporary gun politics could fail to notice a jarring disconnect between the two very different trajectories of the gun rights movement today.</p>
<p>On the one hand, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ahmaud-arbery-kyle-rittenhouse-us-supreme-court-wisconsin-kenosha-9eaa5468dcebd01a9c927467a58f5a71" target="_blank">more states are allowing Americans to carry weapons</a> in public without permits, and the gun-rights movement could be on the verge of a major <a href="https://theconversation.com/supreme-court-appears-to-suggest-right-to-guns-at-home-extends-to-carrying-them-in-public-too-171263" target="_blank">Supreme Court victory</a>. On the other, the National Rifle Association, which advocates on behalf of gun owners, faces an <a href="https://giffords.org/blog/2021/01/nra-in-disarray-what-you-need-to-know-blog/" target="_blank">existential crisis</a> that’s mostly due to the NRA’s own missteps.</p>
<p>As a political scientist who has studied <a href="https://www.routledge.com/The-Politics-of-Gun-Control/Spitzer/p/book/9780367502843" target="_blank">gun politics and policy</a> for over 30 years, I’m confident that there is no precedent for this contradictory situation. Moreover, there’s no reason to believe that the Fairfax-headquartered NRA’s problems will influence how the courts treat gun-rights cases.</p>
<h2>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">2 very different lawsuits are pending</h4>

	</h2>
<p>The Supreme Court case, <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2021/20-843" target="_blank">New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen</a>, challenges a state law that requires authorities to exercise discretion when issuing concealed-carry pistol permits. When justices heard <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/03/us/politics/supreme-court-guns-second-amendment.html" target="_blank">oral arguments</a> on Nov. 3, a majority of them <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2021/11/majority-of-court-appears-dubious-of-new-york-gun-control-law-but-justices-mull-narrow-ruling/" target="_blank">appeared to be skeptical</a> about the law’s constitutionality – despite the fact that it was <a href="https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/23/100-years-ago-the-shot-that-spurred-new-yorks-gun-control-law/" target="_blank">first enacted in 1911</a> and has withstood legal challenges in the past.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as it marks the <a href="https://ca.movies.yahoo.com/nra-turns-150-organization-rich-145324606.html" target="_blank">150th anniversary</a> of its 1871 founding, the NRA looks like an organization in jeopardy.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/04/21/839999178/secret-recording-reveals-nras-legal-troubles-have-cost-the-organization-100-mill" target="_blank">Expensive and protracted litigation</a> exposed a pattern of <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/11/02/1051363337/misfire-takes-a-hard-look-at-nepotism-fraud-and-corruption-in-the-nra" target="_blank">lavish perks for its top officials</a>, including private jets, designer clothes and vacations at expensive resorts – as well as plenty of cronyism and sweetheart contracts.</p>
<p>Many of these allegations of misdeeds were crystallized in a <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2020/attorney-general-james-files-lawsuit-dissolve-nra" target="_blank">160-page lawsuit</a> brought by the New York Attorney General’s office in August 2020. It called for the <a href="https://theconversation.com/judge-rejects-nras-bankruptcy-bid-allowing-new-yorks-lawsuit-against-the-gun-group-to-proceed-5-questions-answered-160424" target="_blank">NRA’s dissolution</a> and the removal of <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/wayne-lapierre-allegedly-used-nra-personal-piggy-bank-n-y-n1236068" target="_blank">Wayne LaPierre</a> as its CEO.</p>
<p>A nonprofit gun-control <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/11/03/1052073569/nra-gabby-giffords-campaign-finance-lawsuit" target="_blank">group led by former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords</a>, who survived being shot at close range, is also suing the NRA. The Giffords group alleges financial misconduct and possible campaign finance law violations.</p>
<p>Also, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/three-nra-board-members-resign-in-latest-sign-of-upheaval-at-gun-rights-group/2019/08/01/aad49bc0-b49d-11e9-8f6c-7828e68cb15f_story.html" target="_blank">some NRA board members have resigned</a> in recent years due to their objections to the organization’s track record. In September 2021, a dissident board member called for the entire board to be replaced and for <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/nra-board-member-calls-for-ceo-wayne-lapierres-removal-11632517397" target="_blank">LaPierre’s removal</a>.</p>
<p>And in November, a National Public Radio report on <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/11/09/1049054141/a-secret-tape-made-after-columbine-shows-the-nras-evolution-on-school-shootings" target="_blank">secret recordings</a> of a 1999 conference call among the organization’s top leaders held immediately after the <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/1990s/columbine-high-school-shootings" target="_blank">Columbine High School shootings</a> further tarnished the NRA’s reputation.</p>
<p>The recordings revealed frank discussions of the organization’s public relations strategy and derided some of the organization’s more zealous members as “hillbillies” and “fruitcakes.”</p>
<p>The organization has not released clear information about how any of this has affected membership. <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/vbnv9b/nra-membership-dues-tanked-last-year" target="_blank">Because the NRA gets 40 percent of its annual revenue</a> from member dues, which are reportedly stagnant, this exposure could be affecting its bottom line.</p>
<h2>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What’s happening in court</h4>

	</h2>
<p>The NRA’s national reputation, however, might not matter that much.</p>
<p>First, while the NRA has long played a key role in Second Amendment litigation, many affiliated and unaffiliated organizations have taken on the task of challenging laws that restrict gun rights, such as the New York State Rifle and Pistol Association – the plaintiff in the <a href="https://theconversation.com/first-major-second-amendment-case-before-the-supreme-court-in-over-a-decade-could-topple-gun-restrictions-166703" target="_blank">pending Supreme Court case</a>. Similar <a href="https://stateassociations.nra.org/find-your-state-association/" target="_blank">state-specific</a> organizations exist throughout the country.</p>
<p>Second, and arguably more important, recent Republican presidents have been remarkably successful in appointing to the federal court system a large number of young and very <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3782576" target="_blank">conservative jurists</a>. They have expressed great sympathy for an expansive reading of gun rights under the Second Amendment. Their interpretation goes further than the standard the court set out in its 2008 <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2007/07-290" target="_blank">D.C. v. Heller</a> ruling, when the court for the first time established that Americans have a right to own handguns for personal protection in their homes.</p>
<p>Even though he served for only one term, President <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/01/13/how-trump-compares-with-other-recent-presidents-in-appointing-federal-judges/" target="_blank">Donald Trump was particularly successful</a> in filling judicial vacancies, thanks in large measure to Republican Senate leader <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/07/02/886285772/trump-and-mcconnell-via-swath-of-judges-will-affect-u-s-law-for-decades" target="_blank">Mitch McConnell’s efforts</a>.</p>
<p>The three conservative Supreme Court justices Trump appointed, <a href="https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2021/10/22/originalists-gorsuch-kavanaugh-barrett-under-microscope-in-2nd-amendment-case/?slreturn=20211022150937" target="_blank">Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett</a>, had all previously expressed their support for the rights of gun owners. And Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, who have been on the court far longer, have often expressed dissatisfaction that gun rights <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/11/17/no-courts-dont-treat-second-amendment-second-class-right/" target="_blank">have not received sufficient deference</a> in prior court rulings.</p>
<h2>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Public opinion is shifting</h4>

	</h2>
<p>There’s another paradox that could matter too: <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/357317/stricter-gun-laws-less-popular.aspx" target="_blank">Most Americans, especially Democrats, continue to support stricter gun laws</a>, and yet people in the U.S. are <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/13/key-facts-about-americans-and-guns/" target="_blank">buying guns</a>, mostly handguns, at a record pace.</p>
<p>Notably, support for stricter gun control <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/357317/stricter-gun-laws-less-popular.aspx" target="_blank">fell in the past year by 5 percentage points</a> to 52 percent, according to a Gallup poll conducted in October 2021. That decline followed a 7-percentage-point drop Gallup measured a year earlier. Still, the poll reflects overwhelming support for existing gun laws: Only 11 percent favor making gun laws less strict.</p>
<p>A record-setting <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/nics_firearm_checks_top_10_highest_days_weeks.pdf/view" target="_blank">1.2 million background checks</a>, a proxy for gun sales, were conducted in two separate single weeks in March 2021. The buying spree <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/29/us/gun-purchases-ownership-pandemic.html" target="_blank">was fanned by</a> fears that arose during the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrations tied to the Black Lives Matter movement and the 2020 elections.</p>
<p>However, only about 20 percent of these purchases were new gun owners. For the most part, the nation’s <a href="https://wamu.org/story/20/09/18/how-many-people-in-the-u-s-own-guns/" target="_blank">estimated 72 million gun owners</a> are adding to their firearm collections.</p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce/ For The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><strong>By Thomas Wolf, Esq.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is for my fellow Democrats who fear having Virginia’s redistricting map determined by the Virginia Supreme Court, all of whose members were elected by a Republican-controlled house of the General Assembly. Don’t worry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having practiced before that court, interacted with its members in person, and read their opinions for more than four decades, I feel I know the justices pretty well. These are not “<a href="https://bluevirginia.us/2020/04/del-mark-levine-for-naive-virginians-who-think-the-republican-supreme-court-of-virginia-will-play-fair-let-wisconsin-be-your-guide" target="_blank">partisan Republican hacks in robes</a>,” as some have alleged.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not even close.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginians can accurately state that their judges are better than those of most states. That’s because our process for selecting judges is better than most states and we have a proud tradition of selecting good judges, not just political cronies, to sit on our courts. To get a seat on any court, a nominee must receive a majority vote from each chamber of the Virginia General Assembly. Though party affiliation is often a factor, there is a long history of choosing judges based on their merits, not their ideology.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even when the process has become blatantly political, as when the Republican-controlled General Assembly <a href="https://wamu.org/story/16/01/15/justice_jane_roush_expected_to_be_ousted_from_virginia_supreme_court/" target="_blank">refused to reappoint</a> Justice Jane Roush because her recess appointment by Gov. Terry McAuliffe had supposedly been without adequate genuflection to Republican bosses (although she had been initially put forth by the Republican chair of the House Courts of Justice Committee who called her “the best Circuit Court judge in Virginia”) Republicans replaced her with a member of the Court of Appeals, Stephen McCullough, who was widely respected in both parties for his intellect and his integrity. No one could consider McCullough a purely political appointment. His written opinions since elevation to the court have borne out the validity of his selection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chief Justice Donald Lemons and Justice William Mims are other good examples. Both were political before going on the bench. Lemons was supported for a seat on the court by his former law partner, Pat McSweeney, the controversial chair of the Republican Party of Virginia who loudly <a href="https://www.dailypress.com/news/dp-xpm-19960804-1996-08-04-9608040032-story.html" target="_blank">defended the Confederate fla</a>g.  Mims was elected as a Republican to both the House of Delegates and the state Senate, and was later selected by the Republican-controlled General Assembly to replace Attorney General Bob McDonnell, who resigned to run for governor.  Yet Lemons and Mims have both demonstrated over time and beyond argument that they are competent, fair-minded jurists just trying to interpret and apply the law honestly, even when they don’t like it. You may not always agree with their opinions, but no one could accuse them of trying to bend the law to serve a political credo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know that, far from being ideologues who would manipulate the redistricting process to benefit their Republican friends, the current justices of the Virginia Supreme Court are honest jurists of the highest ethical standards, and dedicated to carrying out their sacred duties to the very best of their abilities. Therefore, although I am a staunch Democrat and believe that our immediate past president, who openly attempted to overthrow the federal government and to thwart the 2020 electoral results in many states, is the greatest threat to American democracy in my lifetime, I have every confidence that, to a person, the Virginia Supreme Court will do the right thing to insure the redistricting map is drawn competently, fairly and free of gerrymandering.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many hardcore Democrats feel that Virginia’s redistricting constitutional amendment denied them the hard-won opportunity to do to Republicans what Republicans did to Democrats — redraw political districts for the express purpose of gaining a massive political advantage.  But Virginians voted overwhelmingly (66 percent) to put an end to that cycle.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know that gerrymandering districts to make them safe for one party or the other is one of the root causes of the never-ending vitriolic political strife in this country. With election of their party’s nominee assured in their district, politicians have no incentive to appeal to the moderate middle. Worried only about challenges from the fringe, they focus on appealing to the most extreme members of their party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginians are sick of that model and the hypocrisy and corruption it breeds. So, foregoing the chance for their own party to be assured victory through re-districting, a strong majority of Virginians demanded that the voters themselves choose their representatives, rather than have the representatives corrupt the democratic process by choosing their voters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s Constitution requires an impartial redistricting. I’m sure we can count on our Supreme Court to carry that out faithfully.</span></p>

																						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1024" height="683" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/210609_VA_Supreme_Court-01-1024x683.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="" style="margin-bottom: 10px;" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/210609_VA_Supreme_Court-01-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/210609_VA_Supreme_Court-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/210609_VA_Supreme_Court-01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/210609_VA_Supreme_Court-01-696x464.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/210609_VA_Supreme_Court-01-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/210609_VA_Supreme_Court-01-630x420.jpg 630w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/210609_VA_Supreme_Court-01.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p style="font-size:12px;">The Supreme Court of Virginia in Richmond, Va. (Parker Michels-Boyce/ For The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia State Supreme Court has rejected three “special master” candidates nominated by Republicans to help redraw Virginia’s legislative lines.</span></p>
<p>The nominees, the justices said in an order this morning, will serve as officers of the court in a &#8220;quasi-judicial capacity&#8221; and therefore &#8220;must be neutral and must not act as advocates or representatives of any political party.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court ordered the Republicans to come up with three new candidates by Monday. It also dropped a Democratic candidate, who was not named, because of his stated concerns about working with another map-drawer as the process requires, and told party members they also had until Monday to come up with another nominee.</span></p>
<p>https://twitter.com/ssurovell/status/1459180442914066451?s=20</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The decision came after outcry from Democrats that the Republican nominees had obvious conflicts of interest. “It troubles me that the Republicans would even try this,” says Del. Marcus Simon, D-Fairfax, who had served on the redistricting commission but <a href="https://twitter.com/marcussimon/status/1458556268172431366?s=20" target="_blank">resigned this week</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court’s decision is the latest turn as the state struggles with a new regime to draw new legislative boundaries for state and federal races next year.  A bipartisan 16-member commission was created by a Constitutional amendment to move the process away from the secretive traditional method employed by the majority party in the General Assembly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The commission, beset by <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/we-have-had-the-airing-of-the-grievances-va-redistricting-commission-moves-onto-congressional-maps/" target="_blank">partisan squabbling</a>, failed to produce the new maps and the task moved to the State Supreme Court, which told both parties to suggest a slate of special masters to draw up maps for U.S. House of Representatives and state Senate and House districts. Of the six candidates, one would be picked from each side. The candidates must have no conflicts of interest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once selected, they would have 30 days to come up with newly-drawn voting district lines based on the latest U.S. census.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the GOP nominees was Thomas Bryan, a former member of the U.S. Census Bureau, but Democrats objected, noting that he accepted $20,000 in consulting fees from the Virginia Senate Republican Caucus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another was Adam Kincaid, who used to handle redistricting affairs for the National Republican Congressional Committee and is now the executive of the National Republican Redistricting Trust.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third was Adam Foltz, who handled redistricting work for Republican groups in Wisconsin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Democrats complained that all three were highly partisan and had close ties to the Republican Party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Democrats nominated academics with no overt party ties. They include Bernard N. Grofman, a professor at the University of California Irvine; and Nathaniel Persily and Bruce E. Cain, both professors at Stanford University.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court did not say which of the Democratic nominees was being asked to stand down. Liz White, executive director of the advocacy group OneVirginia 2021, said an unnamed Democratic nominee had expressed concerns about having to work with another special master. One person usually carries out such work.</span></p>
<p>The group had urged the Supreme Court in a letter this week to &#8220;select special masters who reflect a track record of nonpartisanship&#8221; and &#8220;consider the gridlock of the commission and its partisan map drawers as a cautionary tale while they make this important decision.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Bill Stanley, R-Franklin, who also served on the redistricting commission, said the court’s decision shows that it “wants to remind us to remove partisanship from the process.”</span></p>

Gerry Connolly (D-11th) speaks to members of the media in 2019.  He signed onto a letter requesting an investigation into the hiring of a federal judge's law clerk. (Alex Wong/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Democratic leaders of the U.S. House Judiciary Committee are urging the chief justice of the Supreme Court to investigate decisions by federal judges in Georgia and Alabama to hire a law clerk who allegedly has “a history of nakedly racist and hateful conduct.”</p>
<p>The letter says the Democrats have “grave concern” about the hiring by Judge William Pryor, chief judge of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, and Judge Corey Maze of the Northern District of Alabama.</p>
<p>States in the 11th Circuit include Florida, Alabama and Georgia. The letter was led by Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler of New York and Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property, and the Internet Chairman Hank Johnson of Georgia. The letter was also signed by Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties Chair Steve Cohen, (D-Tenn.),  and Oversight and Reform Subcommittee on Government Operations Chair Gerry Connolly, (D-Va.).</p>
<p>“Placing an individual with this history in such close proximity to judicial decision-making threatens to seriously undermine the public’s faith in the federal judiciary,” the House Democrats <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/uploadedfiles/house_chairs_letter_2_11.10.21.pdf" target="_blank">wrote</a>.</p>
<p>“To put it mildly, it would be reasonable to question these judges’ impartiality in cases where race, religion, or national origin plays a role, which is the statutory standard for disqualification,” they wrote.</p>
<p>They did not name the law clerk in their letter but in footnotes link to articles about Crystal Clanton, a <a href="https://www.law.gmu.edu/assets/files/career/clerkship_list_by_judge_17August2021.pdf" target="_blank">student at Antonin Scalia Law School at George Mason University in Virginia.</a></p>
<p>The legal blog Above the Law <a href="https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/law-school-student-famous-for-saying-i-hate-black-people-now-has-prestigious-federal-clerkship/?rf=1" target="_blank">first reported</a> Clanton had been hired for the “incredibly prestigious” clerkships, set for 2022 and 2023, by Pryor and Maze.</p>
<p>Clanton made <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-conservative-nonprofit-that-seeks-to-transform-college-campuses-faces-allegations-of-racial-bias-and-illegal-campaign-activity" target="_blank">headlines in 2017 </a> when The New Yorker reported that she sent a racist text message to her co-workers at the conservative student group Turning Point USA, writing “I HATE BLACK PEOPLE… I hate blacks. End of story.”  The New Yorker reviewed a screenshot of the text.</p>
<p>Clanton told the publication that  “I have no recollection of these messages and they do not reflect what I believe or who I am and the same was true when I was a teenager.”</p>
<p>The House Democrats’ letter details other reported incidents, such as when Clanton sent a photo of a man with brown skin to her co-workers with the caption “just thinking about ways to do another 9/11,” <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/online/exclusive-clarence-thomas-wife-hired-ex-tpusa-staffer-known-for-saying-i-hate-blacks/" target="_blank">according to the publication Mediaite.</a></p>
<p>When she worked at Turning Point USA, Clanton fired the organization&#8217;s only Black employee on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, and that employee stated in The New Yorker article that she felt “very uncomfortable working there because I was black.”</p>
<p>Clanton left Turning Point USA and later worked for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas’ wife, Ginni.</p>
<p>The House Democrats wrote to Justice John Roberts as the presiding member of the Judicial Conference of the United States, the national policy-making body for the federal courts. They also addressed the letter to Judge Charles Wilson, the most senior active member of the 11th Circuit appeals court.</p>
<p>They said while the reported remarks are “worrying in the extreme,” their concern was more that Pryor and Maze would make such a hire. They said the clerk’s past conduct was clearly available at the time of the hiring decisions.</p>
<p>“If the judges were not aware of their law clerk’s widely reported record, their negligent hiring practices present their own set of problems with the judiciary and the judges’ abilities to discharge their administrative responsibilities competently,” the Democrats said.</p>
<p>Due to a federal holiday, Pryor and Maze could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>The Democrats said that “to date, the news of these judges’ hiring decisions has been met with uniform silence by the judges themselves, the courts on which they sit, and the Judicial Conference.”</p>
<p>The lawmakers wrote that they expect a briefing on the matter by Dec. 1.</p>

(Laura Olson/ States Newsroom) </p><p>WASHINGTON — Conservative justices on the U.S. Supreme Court expressed skepticism Wednesday after listening to two hours of oral arguments on a New York law that imposes strict limits on carrying a gun outside the home—a case that will test how far states can go when crafting their own laws.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/20-843.html" target="_blank"><i>New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Assoc. v. Bruen</i></a><i>,</i> attorney Paul Clement—former U.S. solicitor general in the Bush administration—argued that New York’s restrictive gun laws infringe on an individual&#8217;s <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-2/" target="_blank">Second Amendment</a> right to keep and bear arms.</p>
<p>“Carrying a firearm outside the home is a fundamental, constitutional right,” he said in his opening presentation to the court.</p>
<p>Chief Justice John Roberts said he found it surprising that local officials could make decisions about a constitutional right. Several other members of the court expressed that sentiment, but also agreed that states could decide whether to exclude guns from “sensitive places” in New York such as public transportation, New York University, Columbia University and Times Square on New Year’s Eve.</p>
<p>Justices Neil Gorsuch, Amy Coney Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh expressed their concern about the high bar applicants needed to meet in order to obtain a gun permit.</p>
<p>Barbara Underwood, New York&#8217;s solicitor general, defended the state’s law, arguing that the state is not an outlier in its restrictions because states have used a variety of regulations over the years.</p>
<p>Some cities also place their own restrictions, such as Chicago and Baltimore.</p>
<p>“And it’s not an outlier in asking a licensed applicant to show good cause for a carry license,” she said.</p>
<p>Justice Elena Kagan said that the brief Clement submitted to the court focused on the argument that the New York law is a “regulatory scheme” that deprives most people of their right to carry a gun, rather than the two individuals who brought the case against New York.</p>
<p>Most states broadly grant requests to carry weapons outside the home except for California, New York, Delaware, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Connecticut and Rhode Island. Those states have wide discretion to deny an applicant a concealed carry permit.</p>
<p>In those <a href="https://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/citation/quotes/8684" target="_blank">states</a>, about 1% of all residents are approved for concealed carry, compared to about 10% in other states with looser laws.</p>
<p>States with tougher standards generally require an individual to demonstrate a need for self-protection, referred to as “proper cause.” A general desire to possess a concealed carry gun is not a sufficient reason in those states.</p>
<p>The gun rights advocates who are challenging New York’s law, Robert Nash and Brandon Koch, had applications for a concealed-carry license denied, but were granted “restricted” licenses to carry a gun for target shooting and hunting.</p>
<p>This is the first gun rights case the Supreme Court has taken up in years.</p>
<p>In 2008, the Court ruled in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf" target="_blank"><i>District of Columbia v. Heller</i></a> that the Second Amendment does allow an individual the right to have a gun in his or her home for the purposes of self defense. In 2010, the Court confirmed in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-1521.pdf" target="_blank"><i>McDonald v. City of Chicago</i></a> that the states must adhere to that right.</p>
<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor noted that based on history, states have put in place their own restrictions on guns.</p>
<p>“Those 43 states that you&#8217;re talking about, most of them didn&#8217;t give unrestricted rights to carry of one form or another until recent times,” she said. “Before recent times, there were so many different regulations. What it appears to me is that the history and tradition of carrying weapons is that states get a lot of deference on this.”</p>
<p>New Jersey Acting Attorney General Andrew Bruck also defended the need to show proof that an individual needs to carry a gun outside the home.</p>
<p>“New Jersey residents should be able to go to a shopping mall or sporting event without having to worry about whether the person behind them is secretly carrying a firearm for no good reason,” Bruck said in a statement.</p>
<p>“The Second Amendment has always allowed states to adopt common-sense restrictions on carrying a concealed firearm in public—to protect their residents. A Supreme Court decision striking down reasonable firearm licensing laws would pose a significant risk to public safety.”</p>
<p>The Pew Research Center <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/13/key-facts-about-americans-and-guns/" target="_blank">found</a> that about 3 in every 10 Americans own a gun and that men are more likely to own a firearm than women, from 39% of men to 22% of women.</p>
<p>Some of the most recent <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/08/16/what-the-data-says-about-gun-deaths-in-the-u-s/" target="_blank">data</a> for gun deaths found that there were 39,773 deaths from gun-related injuries in 2017. Pew found that about 60% of gun deaths were by suicide.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.thetrace.org/2021/05/supreme-court-gun-rights-concealed-carry-new-york-corlett/" target="_blank">Supreme Court is set to hear arguments Nov. 3</a>, 2021, on a clear question: Does the constitutional right to possess a gun extend outside the home? The answer may alter gun regulations in many states.</p>
<p>The crux of the <a href="https://theconversation.com/first-major-second-amendment-case-before-the-supreme-court-in-over-a-decade-could-topple-gun-restrictions-166703" target="_blank">issue before the court</a> is captured by a debate that Thomas Jefferson had with himself at the time of the founding.</p>
<p>When Jefferson was drafting a proposed constitution for his home state of Virginia in June 1776, he <a href="https://www.monticello.org/site/research-and-collections/no-freeman-shall-be-debarred-use-arms#footnote3_h70lbu1" target="_blank">suggested a clause</a> that read “No freeman shall ever be debarred the use of arms.”</p>
<p>In the second draft, he added in brackets, “[within his own lands or tenements].”</p>
<p>Jefferson’s debate with himself captures the question posed to the court: Is the purpose of the right to “keep and bear arms” the protection of a citizen’s “own lands,” or is it self-protection in general? Does the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution recognize a right to keep and bear arms in the home, or a right to “keep” firearms in the home and also “bear” them outside of the home for protection in society?</p>
<p>The plaintiffs in the upcoming case <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/new-york-state-rifle-pistol-association-inc-v-bruen/" target="_blank">New York Rifle &amp; Pistol Association v. Bruen</a> want the court to strike down the state’s restrictions and allow citizens who meet basic requirements, such as having no criminal convictions, to carry concealed weapons.</p>
<h2>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Gun in the house</h4>

	</h2>
<p>There are surprisingly few <a href="https://theconversation.com/first-major-second-amendment-case-before-the-supreme-court-in-over-a-decade-could-topple-gun-restrictions-166703" target="_blank">Supreme Court rulings</a> on the meaning of the Second Amendment.</p>
<p>The question of whether the amendment recognizes a fundamental right – on par with free speech or free exercise of religion – was not decided until 2008 in the landmark ruling in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf" target="_blank">District of Columbia v. Heller</a>. For the first time, the court recognized a clear individual right to bear arms for the purpose of self-defense. This <a href="http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2036448_2036452_2036455,00.html" target="_blank">deeply disputed 5-4 ruling</a> was expanded <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-1521.pdf" target="_blank">two years later to cover state laws</a>.</p>
<p>The Heller ruling stated that the Second Amendment’s right is like the others in the <a href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/bill-of-rights-transcript" target="_blank">Bill of Rights</a>, which cannot be violated without the most compelling reasons. The amendment, the ruling says, “surely <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf#page=66" target="_blank">elevates above all other interests</a> the right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home.” The Washington, D.C., law intended to reduce crime cannot ban firearms in “<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf#page=59" target="_blank">the home</a>, where the need for defense of self, family, and property is most acute.”</p>
<p>That ruling – written by Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in 2016 and was <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/04/07/522902281/senate-confirms-gorsuch-to-supreme-court" target="_blank">replaced by Justice Neil Gorsuch</a> – also recognized that “like most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf#page=57" target="_blank">not unlimited</a>.” Scalia cited regulations like “longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill” or “prohibitions on carrying concealed weapons” as “presumptively lawful.”</p>
<p>The principal dissent was written by Justice Stephen Breyer, the only dissenter in Heller still serving on the court. He emphasized the balance between core rights and the needs for public safety.</p>
<p>“If a resident has a <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf#page=146" target="_blank">handgun in the home</a> that he can use for self-defense,” wrote Breyer, “then he has a handgun in the home that he can use to commit suicide or engage in acts of domestic violence.”</p>

<h2>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Concealed carry laws</h4>

	</h2>
<p>State governments follow very different procedures for determining who will be allowed to carry a concealed firearm outside of the home.</p>
<p>“<a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/open-carry-states" target="_blank">Open carry</a>,” or just having a handgun in plain sight on a belt holster or carrying a long gun (rifle or shotgun), is actually legal in many places. The general idea is that carrying openly would be done only by an honest actor, so less regulation is needed. “Concealed carry,” having a hidden weapon in a pocket or under a jacket, is far more restricted.</p>
<p>At one end of the continuum are near-bans on what are called “concealed carry licenses,” while at the other end are states in which no license is needed. These laws are referred to as “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/01/us/texas-open-carry-laws/index.html" target="_blank">constitutional carry</a>,” meaning the U.S. Constitution itself is a citizen’s <a href="https://concealedguns.procon.org/state-by-state-concealed-carry-permit-laws/" target="_blank">license to carry</a> a firearm.</p>
<p>In between these two positions are rules known as “shall issue,” whereby the government issues a license if the applicant meets the requirements such as having no felony convictions, or “may issue,” which gives the government discretion to deny a license based on perceptions of fitness.</p>
<p>New York state has “may issue” laws with <a href="https://codes.findlaw.com/ny/penal-law/pen-sect-400-00.html" target="_blank">stringent requirements</a>, which in practice allow almost no licenses to be issued. Applicants must</p>
<h2>Regulation or eradication</h2>
<p>The strongest argument in the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20-843/164031/20201217110211298_2020-12-17%20NRA-Corlett%20Cert%20Petition%20FINAL.pdf" target="_blank">gun owners’ brief</a> to the Supreme Court relates to New York’s insistence that citizens show an exceptional or extraordinary need to exercise a right that the court has recognized as fundamental.</p>
<p>No other fundamental right, such as freedom of speech or religion, is limited to people who can demonstrate special circumstances. Instead, fundamental rights are understood to be held by ordinary people in ordinary circumstances.</p>
<p>The strongest argument in the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20-843/169604/20210222170827872_20-843_Brief%20in%20Opposition.pdf" target="_blank">opposing brief</a> from the New York State Police is federalism – the longstanding conservative argument that state lawmakers hold wide latitude to determine their own regulations to serve as “<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20-843/169604/20210222170827872_20-843_Brief%20in%20Opposition.pdf#page=33" target="_blank">laboratories of experimentation</a>,” as Justice Louis Brandeis <a href="https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep285/usrep285262/usrep285262.pdf#page=50" target="_blank">phrased it</a> in 1932. The federalist principle suggests that the court should defer to the judgment of state legislatures representing the needs of local citizens.</p>
<p>As a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-53851-4" target="_blank">close observer of the Supreme Court</a>, I can imagine an outcome to the case in which the justices rule that, under the Second Amendment, a state can limit but not eliminate the core purposes of the protected right.</p>
<p>The Heller decision identifies at least one purpose as self-defense. The question is whether a specific concealed carry law creates a burden so strong that it becomes equivalent to eradication of the right to self-protection, or whether it imposes a legitimate public safety regulation that still maintains the core right for citizens who assert it.</p>
<h2>Individual rights vs. fellow citizens</h2>
<p>The most permissive laws that allow unrestricted concealed carry are almost certainly not mandated by the Constitution.</p>
<p>“Shall issue” laws, which allow states to screen applicants for flaws but compel local governments to provide a concealed carry license to qualified citizens, are likely to be seen even by the conservative justices as legitimate regulations that do not create unconstitutional burdens.</p>
<p>However, the current court might be likely to see a “may issue” law like New York’s, which allows the government to deny a license to nearly every applicant, as creating a burden that blocks the core of the right to self-protection where ordinary citizens are exposed to greater threats – outside the home.</p>
<p>The dissenters will likely focus on Scalia’s invocation of the home as the height of the defensive right, allowing for restrictions outside one’s “own lands,” where individual rights are balanced against the interests of fellow citizens.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In school board meetings, city council sessions and public hearings across the country – including here in Virginia – you see due process dissolve into red-faced rants, threats and arrests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the grounds of the university Thomas Jefferson founded and in Charlottesville, we saw it explode in blood and death four years ago – a prelude to even more stunning violence at the U.S. Capitol in a failed Jan. 6 bid to halt the next president’s inauguration on the site two weeks later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peaceful marches in protest of manifest racial injustice – the broad-daylight police murder of a Black man on a street in Minneapolis – were hijacked by malign interests who fomented violence that burned the very communities where the most oppressed lived.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spread across the slick cardstock mailings and the even slicker attack ads pervading the airwaves and your online portals are bitter, cutting words – distortions usually and often outright mistruths – as candidates in a deadlocked governor’s race finish their scorched-earth, damn-the-consequences campaigns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even in arenas where Americans retreat for the diversion sports provides from the nastiness of society, fans believe the tickets they bought entitle them not only to watch the event but to intercede into the on-field game, <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/look-tennessee-fans-throw-trash-on-home-field-delaying-ole-miss-game-20-minutes-over-officiating-call/" target="_blank">raining bottles,</a> cans and even golf balls onto officials and visiting teams.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twenty-one years into the 21st century, this is what we’ve become: the Divided States of America. Yet it doesn’t reflect how shocking and dangerous our national dysfunction has become.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are a nation losing the ability to communicate and reason. We have obliterated our sense of common ground and shared experience and are becoming a culture of perpetually warring tribes, all easily susceptible to disinformation, manipulation and subversion, not just from our most aggressive foreign adversaries but domestic enemies of our democratic republic, the Constitution and the rule of law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been fully two decades since the attacks of Sept. 11 last galvanized America behind a unified purpose – defeating an evil rooted in a diabolical, murderous distortion of Islam. U.S. troops were sent to Afghanistan and fought the nation’s longest war to root it out, only to be withdrawn in chaos, death and heartbreak two months ago while agents of the very darkness they sought to eradicate</span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/biden-defends-afghanistan-exit-again-as-taliban-declares-victory-over-u-s" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">reasserted their absolute rule</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> almost overnight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All we have to show for those 20 years of lost American treasure, blood and life is deeper political division back home. Our protracted failure hung over the recent 20th anniversary of 9/11 like the thick palls of acrid, toxic smoke that poured from the Pentagon, the World Trade Center and a crater gouged into a Pennsylvania meadow that heartbreaking morning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But now when we look for the enemy, increasingly we see ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It crept upon us incrementally and insidiously, with each new outrage that we internalize, rationalize and ultimately acquiesce to as an ever-diminished “new normal.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We ignore the warning signs. And they are plentiful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here in Virginia, Loudoun County’s school board meetings have become the stuff of national news. For the better part of this year, parents and board members have disputed the district’s bathroom and locker room policies for trans students, particularly after reports of a restroom sexual assault on a girl. They’ve also angrily rejected what they say is the teaching of “</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/what-is-critical-race-theory.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">critical race theory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” a doctrine that systemic racism has always pervaded U.S. institutions and something the district says is not and never has been in its curriculum. Meetings start as shouting matches and worsen from there, leading at one point to</span><a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/loudoun-county-father-arrested-at-school-board-meeting-wants-court-venue-changed/ar-AAPO3T0" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">an arrest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and spectators being cleared.</span><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/loudoun-county-superintendent-apologizes-board-member-resigns-sexual-assault-backlash" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">One board member recently resigned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> amid the long-running conflict.</span></p>

The night before the bloody showdown in Charlottesville’s downtown mall, columns of neo-Nazis and white supremacists carrying tiki torches marched through the University of Virginia campus, surrounding students and screaming “</span><a href="https://www.adl.org/education/references/hate-symbols/you-will-not-replace-us" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will not replace us!</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” and the Hitlerian battle cry, “</span><a href="https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/166923" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blood and soil!</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The closer this fall’s gubernatorial race gets, the meaner and less tethered to truth communications from the candidates – Democratic former Gov. Terry McAuliffe and Republican Glenn Youngkin – become. And the same is true for down-ticket races. “Wrong about vaccines … dead wrong for Virginia,” said the baleful voiceover in a televised campaign ad for one House of Delegates candidate. Its sinister tone is ubiquitous, not only over the air but in our snail mail and your social media feeds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two Saturdays ago, actionable unrest showed up in a sellout college football crowd of more than 100,000 in Knoxville, Tennessee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the homestown Tennessee Volunteers came up one yard shy of a first down on a desperation fourth down attempt with less than a minute to play and officials awarded the ball back to the visiting Mississippi Rebels,</span><a href="https://youtu.be/kIsBS3t-vg4" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">projectiles rained</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> onto the visitors’ bench, forcing players and coaches out to midfield, outside the range of most of the water bottles, beer cans, vape pens, small batteries, golf balls and even a squeeze bottle of mustard that pelted the turf. Officials suspended the game for nearly 20 minutes – longer than a halftime – as the fusillade continued. Both schools’ bands and cheerleaders were evacuated, some of them using posterboard spirit signs to</span> <a href="https://youtu.be/Z_GC1x4v7mw" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shield their heads</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as they scurried for the tunnels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full disclosure here: I am not only an Ole Miss alumnus, I am a former player. In hostile SEC venues long ago, I dodged an occasional ice cube, a small battery or two and once, after a blowout loss in LSU’s Tiger Stadium in 1976, an empty Jack Daniel’s bottle flung from the cheap seats (which, come to think of it, may have been from one of our own fans). Certainly, visiting teams sometimes got similar mistreatment at our home arenas. It is wrong in every instance. However, the display of hooliganism to the degree and duration that millions saw live from Rocky Top should be a wakeup call. When spectators </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">en masse</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> presume the right to physically intrude upon the game, our sports-loving country has lost the balm of sports as we know it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it all too far gone? What would it take to turn things around? Another 9/11-type act of war from a foreign enemy that refocuses our collective rage outward rather than within?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s a damnable price to pay just for us to see one another as fellow Americans again, to focus on the vastness of where we agree rather than dwelling on petty vexations that divide us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But maybe the timelier question at the merciful end of yet another socially corrosive Virginia election is not whether we </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">can</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recover a sense or community, it’s whether we even </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">want</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to.</span></p>

(Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>When lawmakers voted to reform probation in Virginia earlier this year, they said their motive was simple: Stop people from getting sent back to prison for minor violations like missing an appointment or failing a drug test.</p>
<p>But three months after the new law went into effect, officials across the criminal justice system say the rules have led to confusion, inconsistent enforcement and, in some cases, deliberate pushback from judges and prosecutors.</p>
<p>“We spent two decades trying to reduce disparity in sentencing,” said Jody Fridley, deputy director of the Virginia Sentencing Commission, during a recent meeting. “This has just opened up the possibility for more disparity.”</p>
<p>The legislation lawmakers passed prohibits judges from incarcerating probationers for their first technical offense and limits punishment for a second technical offense to a maximum of 14 days in jail. Only after a third offense is a judge allowed to impose a longer sentence.</p>
<p>The legislation also caps probation at a maximum of five years for a felony and one year for a misdemeanor. The measure was championed by Democrats, who celebrated the new law with a <a href="https://www.wric.com/news/politics/capitol-connection/rapper-meek-mill-joins-northam-for-probation-reform-bill-signing/" target="_blank">bill signing that featured</a> rapper Meek Mill, whose own experience with probation helped make the case for the new law.</p>
<p>But in practice, confusion remains about what exactly counts as a technical violation. To illustrate the issue, Fidley described two recent cases in which a sex offender was issued a probation violation for attempting to contact a minor online. In one jurisdiction, the probation officer wrote it up as a major violation because the terms of the probation included special provisions barring use of social media and contacting minors. The approach led to a sentence recommendation of between three months and one year.</p>
<p>In another jurisdiction, a probation officer cited it as a technical violation because it was interpreted more generally as failing to follow instructions, which is not considered a major violation. Because it was a first offense, no term of incarceration was recommended.</p>
<p>Members of the sentencing commission, which sets sentencing guidelines and tracks how often judges follow them, said they believed the issue could be resolved with further guidance. “We can’t allow this kind of disparity to continue,” said Sen. John Edwards, D-Roanoke, who chairs the Senate’s judiciary committee. “It’s too confusing for too many people.”</p>
<p>Other questions about the law, however, will likely be more difficult to untangle.</p>
<p>The strongest rebuke of the new law has come from a circuit court judge in Loudoun County, James Fisher, who <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Fisher-Opinion.pdf" target="_blank">issued an opinion</a> calling the law an unconstitutional infringement on judicial discretion. As a circuit court judge, Fisher’s ruling does not set precedent and has no bearing outside of his courtroom, but he has directed the local probation department to continue reporting violations to him using the old guidelines.</p>
<p>“Exactly what to do with a given probationer when he or she violates the court’s order of supervised probation is squarely within the realm of judicial discretion,” he wrote. “These considerations may not be justly micromanaged by legislation because they necessarily require individualized analysis of considerations and circumstances too numerous to detail.”</p>
<p>Fisher, who recently <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/09/17/virginia-judge-jails-alleged-domestic-violence-victim-for-smoking-pot-on-day-of-court-testimony/" target="_blank">made news</a> for ordering the alleged victim in a domestic violence trial jailed on a contempt charge, has a reputation for harsh sentences. But some of the issues he raised with the new law are shared by other judges, prosecutors and probation officers.</p>
<p>He noted it is a common practice in Loudoun and other jurisdictions to wait for multiple technical probation violations to accrue before bringing a defendant back to court. In those cases, he noted that multiple offenses could all be considered a first offense, meaning the judge could issue no punishment.</p>
<p>“An offender … who absconds from supervision after repeated probation failures and who remains at large for a lengthy period of time may be treated as a first offender for violation purposes, while a different offender who is brought to court immediately after each and every separate violation will after a third adjudication be subject to an enforcement penalty,” he wrote.</p>
<p>The sentencing commission reported that some judges are reportedly sidestepping that potential dilemma by simply treating each technical violation as a separate hearing, meaning that a defendant could rack up three or more offenses in a single day.</p>
<p>In addition to concerns about sentencing disparities caused by the disparate approaches, commission staff worried that a move by probation officers to begin sending every technical violation to court could end up hurting the criminal defendants the law was supposed to help by leaving them with an even longer criminal history than they might have faced otherwise.</p>
<p>They also worried that the law might be leading some judges and prosecutors toward harsher sentences in the first place. “Some prosecutors have said they would be adjusting their plea agreements … because of the limited possibilities for returning defendants to court for public safety reason,” Fridley said. “The analogy that they use is they get one bite at the apple now. Do they take the risk?”</p>
<p>Supporters of the law voiced frustration with what they view as efforts to circumvent its intent.</p>
<p>Del. Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, who proposed the legislation, called the practice of treating multiple simultaneous violations as separate offenses an unintended loophole. “That would not be my intent,” he said. “Hopefully next year we’ll be able to clean the language up.”</p>
<p>Brad Haywood, the chief public defender in Arlington and the executive director of Justice Forward, which helped author the legislation, said the fight illustrates how deeply ingrained the ‘90s-style, tough-on-crime attitude is in the criminal justice system &#8212; even as policy makers take steps toward reform.</p>
<p>“We’re finding a lot of people really believe in it, really committed to it,” Haywood said. “We’re developing new reform opponents in different parts of the justice system we never really anticipated.<br />
That’s really disappointing.”</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>A federal judge is urging Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring to issue a formal opinion on the state’s election calendar after U.S. census delays forced members of the General Assembly to run in outdated districts this year.</p>
<p>Herring has steadfastly declined to weigh in despite receiving a formal request for an opinion five months ago from Del. Lee Carter, D-Manassas. The issue, which has been the subject of open speculation among lawmakers for more than a year, is now at the center of a lawsuit that aims to force a new round of House of Delegates elections next year once redrawn districts are finalized.</p>
<p>“Maybe the attorney general wants to opine &#8212; he may want to,” said U.S. District Judge David Novak during a hearing Tuesday, suggesting that some clear legal direction from Herring might resolve the need for the lawsuit. “I want him to do his job, but I’m not ordering it.”</p>
<p>The two lawyers from Herring’s office in the hearing, who were representing Gov. Ralph Northam and the Board of Elections in the lawsuit, bristled at Novak’s request, repeatedly calling it “neither here nor there.”</p>
<p>They also defended Herring’s right not to respond in a filing ahead of the hearing, writing that the office “has a longstanding practice of exercising discretion to decline, when appropriate, to respond to requests for official advisory opinions, including requests from legislators.”</p>
<p>Because census data came in late, all 100 members of the House of Delegates are running in districts that were drawn based on 2010 population figures. But a decade of growth in urban areas and shrinking in rural ones has left some districts looking lopsided despite being initially drawn to all contain about 86,000 residents.</p>
<p>In some cases, the differences are extreme. An analysis by the Virginia Public Access Project found District 87 in Loudoun County now contains an extra 40,000 people. On the other side of the coin, eight predominantly rural districts are short at least 10,000 people.</p>

<p>Paul Goldman, a Democratic lawyer and onetime aide to former Gov. Doug Wilder, says the state of affairs has the effect of diluting the power of his vote, which is what prompted him to file the lawsuit in May.</p>
<p>Goldman renewed those arguments in Tuesday’s hearing, but Novak questioned whether Goldman was actually harmed by leaving the current districts in place for full, two-year terms, noting that Goldman’s district lost 900 residents, meaning he would actually be overrepresented in the General Assembly.</p>
<p>But Novak voiced frustration that the attorney general’s office hadn’t raised the issue of Goldman’s standing in their motion to dismiss, which instead focused on the state&#8217;s immunity from such lawsuits and whether a federal court had jurisdiction in the case &#8212; an argument Novak swiftly dismissed.</p>
<p>Novak did side with the government on one count, dismissing part of Goldman&#8217;s claim and excusing Northam and individual members of the board of elections from the suit.</p>
<p>But to decide whether the remainder of the case should go forward, he requested additional arguments on elements dealing with the court&#8217;s jurisdiction.</p>
<p>After Novak proposed a three-day deadline for additional filings, the attorney general’s office protested, calling the timing unreasonable.</p>
<p>Novak snapped back: “I wouldn’t be in this position if you had done your job the first time.”</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Herring, Charlotte Gomer, said in an email that &#8220;just because an opinion has not yet been issued doesn’t mean one won’t be issued, and the timeline for processing and responding to an opinion request can vary widely from a few weeks to a few months or longer, depending on the complexity of the subject matter and other factors.&#8221;</p>
<p>She also downplayed the significance of attorney general&#8217;s opinions, noting that they are only advisory and do not make create new law or change existing law.</p>
<p>Novak&#8217;s frustration was not limited to Herring&#8217;s office. During the hearing, he urged Goldman, who is representing himself in the lawsuit, to follow court rules. He expressed particular frustration that Goldman had sent a press release about the case to his office. He also took issue with Goldman’s filings, which veered into allusions and allegory involving elephants and the magician Harry Houdini.</p>

But Paul Goldman, a Democratic lawyer and onetime aide to former Gov. Doug Wilder, says Virginia’s political class is ignoring an inconvenient truth: Technically speaking, the 2021 House elections are invalid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the November elections are being held on an old political map that hasn’t been updated to reflect a decade of population shifts, Goldman is arguing in a federal lawsuit against the state, the courts should step in and order a do-over in 2022. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the state had no control over late-arriving U.S. Census data that delayed its constitutionally required redistricting process, Goldman says that’s no reason to let state delegates who win in November serve full, two-year terms while wide population disparities exist between districts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to <a href="https://www.vpap.org/visuals/visual/gainers-losers-in-redistricting/" target="_blank">analysis by the Virginia Public Access Project</a>, a Northern Virginia district based in fast-growing Loudoun County now has a population of over 130,000, while other districts in Southsidme and Southwest Virginia have less than 70,000 people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goldman says that’s an impermissible violation of the one-person, one-vote principle, diluting the vote of anyone who now finds themselves in an overpopulated district.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There&#8217;s no reason except that the incumbents don&#8217;t want to run again.” Goldman said in an interview Thursday. &#8220;State leaders have an obligation to defend your rights. I shouldn&#8217;t have to go to court to get them to do what&#8217;s right.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The remedy Goldman’s proposing is another round of elections next year on forthcoming maps that will be drawn either by the new <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/10/05/were-sort-of-stuck-va-redistricting-commission-divided-over-race-as-deadline-looms/" target="_blank">Virginia Redistricting Commission</a> or the Supreme Court of Virginia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a normal redistricting year, that ongoing work would have been completed months ago and the House elections would be conducted using a new map. If nothing else changes, the adjusted districts won&#8217;t have full effect until early 2024, when the winners of the 2023 House and Senate races begin a new two-year term.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goldman, a former chairman of the Democratic Party of Virginia, says asking Virginians to wait that long runs counter to the Democratic Party&#8217;s stance on protecting voting rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I actually believe in these things,” Goldman said. “And I&#8217;m not sure there&#8217;s that many people in politics that actually give a damn unless they can make some money off it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To bolster his case, Goldman is pointing to a similar case 40 years ago, when a court invalidated a new redistricting plan just before the 1981 House races.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because Virginia&#8217;s citizens are entitled to vote as soon as possible for their representatives under a constitutional apportionment plan, we will limit the terms of members of the House of Delegates elected in 1981 to one year,” read a court ruling ordering the state to hold House elections on proper maps in 1982.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the only two states with legislative elections in 2021, only Virginia and New Jersey were put in a major logistical bind over the pandemic-delayed census data. In New Jersey, Democrats resolved the problem by successfully asking voters to approve a constitutional amendment on the ballot allowing 2021’s winners to serve two-year terms in old districts if necessary. In Virginia, the issue has gone almost completely unaddressed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The prospect of having House elections in 2021, 2022 and 2023 had been discussed as a possibility since <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/05/06/covid-19-could-force-the-virginia-house-to-have-elections-3-years-in-a-row-heres-how/" target="_blank">early 2020</a>. But state officials haven’t done much to clarify whether the roughly 200 House candidates on the ballot this year are running for one- or two-year terms. Del. Lee Carter, D-Manassas, asked Attorney General Mark Herring&#8217;s office for a formal opinion on the matter earlier this year, but no such opinion was issued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Herring’s office is trying to have Goldman’s lawsuit thrown out on technical grounds, arguing Goldman is suing the wrong people because none of the Executive Branch officials named as defendants have the power to set elections or draw new maps. Gov. Ralph Northam, the State Board of Elections and Elections Commissioner Chris Piper all cannot do what Goldman is asking, the state’s response argues, and federal courts shouldn&#8217;t intervene in what should be a state matter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Plaintiff asks the Court to require the Defendants to set a general election in November 2022, though Defendants have no authority under the Virginia Constitution or Virginia Code to set such an election,” a dismissal motion from Herring’s office states. “Plaintiff further asks this Court to require Defendants to set such an election when district plans have not yet been established to govern the November 2022 election and Defendants do not have authority to establish such district plans.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a court filing responding to the state’s argument, Goldman cited Russian fabulist Ivan Andreyevich Krylov and the illusionist Harry Houdini to argue officials are refusing to see the “elephant in the room.” Or trying to make it vanish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond-based U.S. District Court Judge David J. Novak seems to be taking the case seriously, ordering the state to identify by noon today “who in the Virginia government” has the powers in question. An expedited hearing in the case has been set for Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Herring’s office would not comment Thursday when asked if the state has an official position on whether new elections are necessary in 2022 and why no legal opinion was issued on the matter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the state hasn’t weighed in on the substance of the case, the costs and administrative burdens of having House elections three years in a row could be a factor the court will consider if the case advances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both parties seem content to run on the old maps for now because they produced a 55-seat majority for Democrats in 2019 but still may be more favorable for Republicans than new maps reflecting stronger population growth in blue areas. That could change after the Nov. 2 elections, when it will be clear who the losers are and who has an incentive to try for a redo as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goldman said he sees “incumbent protection” as the driving force behind the reluctance to address the constitutional issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why should people have to wait two years to get to vote?,” he said. “Just because it&#8217;s inconvenient for Mark Herring and the Democrats?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Progressive activist Josh Stanfield, who helped run Carter’s failed gubernatorial campaign earlier this year, sought to join Goldman’s lawsuit. The judge rejected his attempt, while acknowledging any Virginia voter could argue they have a stake in the case.</span></p>

<p>The stakes in one of the most significant Second Amendment cases in U.S. history are high.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court’s ruling in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/20-843.html" target="_blank">New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association v. Bruen</a>, expected by mid-2022, could declare a New York state restriction on carrying concealed handguns in public places unconstitutional.</p>
<p>Such a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs, which include a National Rifle Association affiliate, could loosen gun regulations in many parts of the country.</p>
<p>In my view <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3B2h368AAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao" target="_blank">as a Second Amendment scholar</a>, this case is also noteworthy in that how the court reaches its conclusion could affect the Second Amendment analysis of all weapons laws in the future.</p>
<p>The court is set to hear <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/oral_arguments.aspx" target="_blank">oral arguments</a> on Nov. 3.</p>
<h2>Long on the books</h2>
<p>In 1911, after an increase in homicides, New York instituted a handgun permitting system. In 1913, the permitting system was amended to address concealed carrying.</p>
<p>For more than a century, someone seeking to carry a concealed handgun for self-defense in the state has needed to file a permit application showing that they have what the law calls “<a href="https://ypdcrime.com/penal.law/article400.php#p400.00" target="_blank">proper cause</a>.”</p>
<p>To obtain an unrestricted permit, <a href="https://casetext.com/case/matter-of-klenosky-v-ny-city-police-dept" target="_blank">applicants must</a> “demonstrate a special need for self-protection distinguishable from that of the general community,” such as by showing they are being stalked.</p>
<p>New York’s attorneys defend this restrictive approach to issuing concealed carry permits as an effective means to reduce gun violence. In 2020, there were <a href="https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/past-tolls" target="_blank">43,592 gun deaths in the United States</a>, including suicides and homicides. There are also <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2020-12-11/329-americans-are-injured-by-guns-every-day-study" target="_blank">over 80,000</a> non-fatal firearm injuries each year.</p>
<p>New York has some of the strictest gun laws in the country, and its homicide rate is <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/national-homicide-rate-rises-fbi-report-and-reflected-new-york-state" target="_blank">below the national average</a>.</p>
<h2>The plaintiffs</h2>
<p><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/New_York_State_Rifle_%26_Pistol_Association_Inc._v._Corlett" target="_blank">Robert Nash and Brandon Koch</a> were denied unrestricted concealed carry permits because a judge determined that they did not satisfy New York’s proper-cause standard.</p>
<p>Instead, Koch was <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20-843/183836/20210713165345228_NYSRPA%20v.%20Corlett%20Joint%20Appendix%20Corlett__final.pdf" target="_blank">issued a license</a> to carry a concealed handgun for self-defense while traveling to and from work. Both plaintiffs’ licenses also permit them to carry concealed handguns for hunting and target practice, and for self-defense in areas not “<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20-843/192555/20210915203840523_20-843%20Brief%20for%20Resps.pdf" target="_blank">frequented by the general public</a>.”</p>
<p>Along with the NRA’s New York affiliate, Nash and Koch contend that these limitations on their ability to carry a concealed handgun violate their right to bear arms. They assert a broad view of the right to carry a handgun, one that extends virtually “<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20-843/183837/20210713165751150_2021.07.13%20FINAL%20NYSRPA%20v.%20Corlett%20Opening%20Brief.pdf" target="_blank">whenever and wherever</a>” the need for self-defense might arise.</p>
<p>New York’s law defies that conception of the Second Amendment.</p>
<h2>The Heller ruling’s muted effects</h2>
<p>In considering Bruen, the Supreme Court will focus on the meaning of an important precedent: <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2007/07-290" target="_blank">District of Columbia v. Heller</a>.</p>
<p>When the Supreme Court issued its Heller ruling in 2008, a 5-4 majority struck down Washington, D.C.‘s ban on the possession of handguns in the home. The court held for the first time that the Second Amendment protects an individual’s right to keep and bear arms.</p>
<p>Writing for the majority, the late Justice Antonin Scalia declared that the “central component” of the Second Amendment was not a “<a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendment/amendment-ii" target="_blank">well regulated Militia</a>,” but rather “the inherent right of self-defense.”</p>
<p>But the majority’s decision included cautionary language that lower-court judges <a href="https://ssrn.com/abstract=3165011" target="_blank">have since relied on to uphold gun laws</a>.</p>
<p>“The right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited” and is “not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose,” Scalia wrote. His opinion even contained a list of “presumptively lawful regulatory measures,” such as restrictions on the possession of firearms by felons or bans on carrying them in sensitive places like schools and government buildings.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/NRA-petition-13-137.pdf" target="_blank">NRA and other gun rights supporters have bristled</a> at the general acceptance by judges of the constitutionality of laws restricting firearm use.</p>
<p>That discontent culminated in Bruen.</p>
<h2>More and more states have allowed concealed handguns</h2>
<p>In 1980, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3789216" target="_blank">most Americans</a> lived in places that either banned concealed carry or had a New York-style “proper cause” permitting regime. <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/03/05/the-nra-lobbyist-behind-floridas-pro-gun-policies" target="_blank">An NRA push</a> beginning in the late 1980s <a href="https://www.rand.org/research/gun-policy/analysis/concealed-carry.html" target="_blank">loosened public carry laws</a> around the country.</p>
<p>In states where gun rights advocates possess relatively little clout, they hope that Bruen will accomplish through the courts what they have failed to accomplish through the political process.</p>
<p>Today, New York is <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/26/990846329/supreme-court-to-take-up-first-major-gun-rights-case-in-more-than-a-decade" target="_blank">one of eight states</a> requiring that people seeking to carry concealed handguns have a “proper” or “good” cause. California, Delaware, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Rhode Island have similar laws on the books.</p>
<p>If the court strikes down New York’s law, Americans in those states could expect an increase in the number of people legally carrying handguns in their communities. Anyone who wants to carry a concealed handgun would have an easier time doing so.</p>
<h2>A &#8216;text, history and tradition test’</h2>
<p>Bruen could also be a turning point for how judges evaluate all Second Amendment cases – whether they’re about assault weapons, tasers or felon-in-possession offenses.</p>
<p>Until now, <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2018/5/23/17383644/second-2nd-amendment-gun-control-debate-santa-fe-parkland-heller-anniversary-constitution" target="_blank">judges have generally assessed</a> whether such restrictions are justified by current public safety concerns.</p>
<p>Many gun rights advocates are asking the Supreme Court to reject that approach. Instead, they want judges to decide cases on the <a href="https://www.law.gmu.edu/pubs/papers/ls1917" target="_blank">sole basis of history and tradition</a> unless the judiciary’s interpretation of the text of the Second Amendment resolves the issue. This is known as the “text, history and tradition” test.</p>
<p>Justice Brett Kavanaugh is credited with <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/deca496973477c748525791f004d84f9/$file/10-7036-1333156.pdf" target="_blank">first articulating</a> this test in a dissent he issued prior to his rise to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett all have embraced similar judicial philosophies to some degree.</p>
<p>But there’s a catch: Guns have <a href="https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4825&amp;context=lcp" target="_blank">always been regulated in America</a>.</p>
<p>New York’s regulation has been on the books for over a century and <a href="https://lawreview.law.ucdavis.edu/online/55/cornell.html" target="_blank">had a legacy</a> that extended back even further.</p>
<p>If the justices abandon a conventional approach for the text, history and tradition test, I would expect a new round of lawsuits over weapons laws that have already survived prior court challenges. Gun rights advocates would likely, for example, sue over restrictions on <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/newjerseyguns.pdf" target="_blank">large-capacity magazines</a> or <a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1661065.html" target="_blank">safe storage requirements</a> in places where those issues have already been resolved.</p>
<p>This litigation would call on judges to rule on the sole basis of a <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2019/11/symposium-disrupting-the-consensus-on-second-amendment-doctrine-would-be-a-mistake/" target="_blank">difficult historical exercise</a>: comparing modern laws addressing modern guns and contemporary gun violence to the laws, practices and weapons of a bygone era.</p>
<h2>Trump’s justices may tip the scales</h2>
<p>The court has three main options.</p>
<p>It could uphold New York’s law. It could strike it down. Or it could find a middle ground, such as issuing a <a href="https://reason.com/volokh/2021/04/26/making-sense-of-the-limited-cert-grant-in-nys-rifle-pistol-association-v-corlett/" target="_blank">narrow ruling</a> that punts big questions about gun restrictions down the road.</p>

<p>Chief Justice John Roberts has steered his colleagues toward narrow rulings <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/07/opinion/john-roberts-supreme-court.html" target="_blank">before</a>. But he will hold little sway if the three justices former President Donald Trump appointed team up with Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas, the court’s two other conservatives, on a far-reaching majority opinion.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was jittery when she took the witness stand, by all accounts. Katie Orndorff, 33, was testifying in her boyfriend’s felony domestic violence trial in a Leesburg courtroom. Then, through a fast, strange and terrifying turn of events, the witness/victim became the accused and, before she knew it, was being dragged off to jail after a judge summarily found her in contempt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her supposed crime? She had smoked marijuana at home – since July 1, something as legal in Virginia as having a beer – to steady her nerves in advance of confronting her former boyfriend and alleged abuser — accused of punching her in the face —  in court where prosecutors assured her she was safe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During Orndorff’s testimony, Loudoun County Circuit Judge James P. Fisher turned the proceeding in a whole new direction, effectively assuming the role of prosecutor. The former commonwealth’s attorney asked her if she used drugs. She admitted smoking pot hours earlier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prosecutors, however, said the woman showed no signs of impairment – no slurred speech, no incoherence, no dozing off – but was clearly nervous. One would expect as much from a woman whose testimony could put her tormentor in prison or perhaps subject her to his wrath should he be acquitted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before she grasped what had happened, Fisher had sentenced Orndorff to 10 days in jail without allowing her the benefit of counsel or even advising her of her rights. Fisher declared a mistrial in the felony assault and battery proceedings against her alleged assailant. Orndorff served two days behind bars before being freed on $1,000 bond pending an appeal of her conviction. Fisher canceled a hearing Thursday on a motion to vacate the contempt charge after he rejected the motion as “wholly without merit.” Protesters who had gathered outside the Loudoun County Courthouse demanded an investigation into Fisher’s actions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This judge shouldn’t be on the bench,” said domestic violence survivor and women’s rights activist Lisa Sales according to</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/09/23/protesters-call-for-investigation-into-judge-who-jailed-witness-in-domestic-violence-case/?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=326d1de6-4c7a-4490-af6c-1542a66b5070" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">reporting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Mercury’s Ned Oliver.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The courtroom drama portrayed in news accounts was at once Kafkaesque and infuriating. The terrified, confused woman being victimized anew as deputies muscled her from the courtroom to a jail cell on a judge’s order. Dismayed and apoplectic prosecutors. Accountability deferred and perhaps a free pass for a defendant with two previous domestic violence convictions. A stark and dispiriting message to battered women.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Grisham would struggle to make readers believe a scene like this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So did Fisher’s actions breach Virginia’s</span><a href="https://www.vacourts.gov/courts/scv/canons_of_judicial_conduct.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Canons of Judicial Conduct</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">? While they seemed outrageous to me and the 30 or so protesters on the courthouse lawn Thursday, I am not a lawyer and don’t know what the threshold is for making such a  determination. Perhaps Fisher’s actions were legally justified. Perhaps they were beyond the pale. Who decides?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By law, it’s the</span><a href="https://www.virginia.gov/agencies/judicial-inquiry-and-review-commission/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is the state agency that, since 1971, has been responsible under the Virginia Constitution and state statutes for vetting allegations from the public, from lawyers, court staff and other jurists against judges accused of misconduct or physical or mental impairments that render them unfit for the job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before 1971, the only means for removing a Virginia judge for cause or infirmity was impeachment by the General Assembly. That happened just twice, in 1903 and 1908.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost everything JIRC does is, by law, secret. Even lawyers like Brad Haywood who have filed complaints with JIRC against judges for alleged violations rarely learn anything about their complaints.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s no transparency at all. It’s a black box,” said Haywood, the chief public defender in Arlington and Falls Church who said he has filed several JIRC complaints.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only feedback he said he’s ever received is a two-paragraph form letter from JIRC acknowledging receipt of his complaint and advising him that the commission will do what it deems most appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is not something that a defense attorney does lightly. There is a belief that when you do that, judges are ready and they’re going to take it out on you. Most lawyers, unless something terrible happens, they’re not going to file a JIRC complaint,” Haywood said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seven-member commission has authority to dismiss a complaint. If it substantiates a charge but determines it does not rise to the level of a judge’s censure, removal or forced retirement, it can advise the judge of its findings and dismiss the complaint – essentially a warning – while reserving the right to resurrect the charges should the judge face another valid complaint.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Complaints emerge from their cocoon of secrecy only if JIRC finds a charge credible and egregious enough to advance to the Virginia Supreme Court for adjudication. The court conducts its own proceedings from scratch and determines whether a judge should be censured, removed or forced into retirement, or whether a complaint should be dismissed. According to JIRC, of the thousands of complaints it has handled in its 50 years, only 15 judges have had their cases reach the court: seven were censured, three were removed from the bench and five had their cases dismissed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a timelier snapshot, </span><a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">annual statistical summaries</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the commission files with the General Assembly show that JIRC received 2,274 complaints from November 2015 through October 2020. Two complaints (involving a total of three judges) made it to the high court, according to published</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">online Supreme Court opinions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. See <a href="https://www.vacourts.gov/opinions/opnscvwp/1170889.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://www.vacourts.gov/opinions/opnscvwp/1170133.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> for examples. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is, however, a fully confidential alternative to being subjected to public Supreme Court proceedings that JIRC can offer judges in cases where validated claims are not deemed grave enough for the court’s attention. The commission has the discretion to enter into “supervision agreements” with judges. Both remedial and punitive, judges who meet an agreement’s terms and conditions and successfully complete its steps can have the charges dismissed. Failure to comply with the agreement constitutes another misconduct charge. Some legal scholars argue that the agreements are an overreach not authorized by state law but they are allowed under a state Supreme Court</span><a href="https://www.vacourts.gov/opinions/opnscvwp/1051990.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">decision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Confidentiality pervades the judicial branch of state government. In Virginia, judges from Juvenile and Domestic Relations Courts to Supreme Court justices are elected by the General Assembly in a largely veiled process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once appointed to a set term of years, judges have broad authority to act outside the public view except for proceedings in open court such as hearings, arguments or trials and most filings related to those matters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of the secrecy is reasonable. Public and private-sector hiring decisions are almost exclusively deliberated in private. Judges also need some leeway to conduct sensitive closed-door proceedings in matters before the court.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But are Virginians owed more transparency and accountability about legitimately questionable actions by judges whom the law vests with great power over individuals’ liberty and property?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open government advocates think so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s so bad that I have this bad habit of pretending it doesn’t even exist,” said Megan Rhyne, the executive director of the Virginia Coalition for Open Government, who earned a law degree from the University of Colorado. The courts are off-limits as far as Virginia’s Freedom of Information Act is concerned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s just no way to demand accountability. There is nothing you can latch onto the way you could with a state agency or a local government to say to them, ‘You should be more accountable!’” she said. “Nothing sticks when you’re dealing with the judiciary.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not as though the press and public are trying to intrude on legitimately closed judicial deliberations. They’re not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These guys buy chairs. They pay payrolls. They talk about expansions, and all of that should be subject to disclosure just like anything else,” Rhyne said. “Yet anything a judge has is off-limits.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which brings us back to Judge Fisher and the issue of who judges the judges. Has a complaint been filed against him? Did his actions violate the Canons of Judicial Conduct? And will we ever find out, one way or the other?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the past five years hold any clue, the chances of that are roughly 2 out of 2,274.</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Protesters outside the Loudoun County courthouse Thursday denounced a local judge who <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/09/17/virginia-judge-jails-alleged-domestic-violence-victim-for-smoking-pot-on-day-of-court-testimony/" target="_blank">sent the alleged victim in a domestic violence case to jail</a> on a contempt charge.</p>
<p>“This judge shouldn’t be on the bench,” said Lisa Sales, a women’s rights activist and domestic violence survivor who organized the gathering of about 30 people.</p>
<p>Sales called for an investigation into Judge James P. Fisher and more transparency from the state’s Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission, which is tasked with fielding complaints about judges and operates largely in secret.</p>
<p>Loudoun County Supervisor Juli Briskman described the turn of events that led 33-year-old Katie Orndoff to be held in jail for two days as misogynistic and patriarchal.</p>
<p>“This will not stand in Loudoun County,” she said.</p>
<p>Fisher ordered Orndoff jailed as she was testifying against her boyfriend in a felony domestic violence case. More than an hour into her testimony, Fisher stopped the proceedings to question whether she was intoxicated &#8212; a subject that had come up during what prosecutors described as a difficult cross examination. She said she had smoked marijuana the morning of the trial, which occurred in the afternoon.</p>
<p>He immediately ordered her jailed for 10 days and she was removed from the courtroom by deputies. She served two days before he released her on bail while she appealed the charge. Meanwhile, he declared a mistrial in the domestic violence case.</p>
<p>Prosecutors and lawyers for Orndoff both say she did not appear intoxicated and that Fisher’s inquiry violated Orndoff’s rights. They also note that marijuana is legal and it was never established that Orndoff was actively under the influence.</p>
<p>A hearing had been scheduled for Thursday to reconsider the contempt charge, but in a filing Fisher called the motion to vacate “wholly without merit.”</p>
<p>Among other things, he noted that Orndoff’s attorneys had already appealed the case to the Virginia Court of Appeals.</p>
<p>A hearing was also canceled in the domestic violence case against Orndoff’s partner, James Page Phillips, who is accused of punching her in the face twice. If found guilty, it would be his third offense.</p>
<p>But Loudoun Commonwealth’s Attorney Buta Biberaj said she doubts the case will advance given Fisher’s actions.</p>
<p>“It has made the prosecution of this nearly impossible,” said Biberaj at Thursday’s courthouse rally.</p>
<p>That said, Biberaj said her office would not give up on the case if Orndoff remains willing to testify &#8212; something she said remains to be seen.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if Mrs. Orndoff, as any victim in this case, would subject themselves to that travesty.”</p>
