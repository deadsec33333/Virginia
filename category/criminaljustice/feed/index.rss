Biden on Monday commuted the sentences of 37 federal death row inmates. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)</p><p dir="ltr">President Joe Biden commuted the sentences on Monday of 37 death row inmates, citing his conscience as a force behind the decision. He also left the death sentences unchanged for three men charged with hate-motivated mass shootings and terrorism.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Biden, who imposed a moratorium on federal executions during his administration, commuted the death sentences to life sentences without the possibility of parole, saying in a statement that he’s dedicated his career “to reducing violent crime and ensuring a fair and effective justice system.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Make no mistake: I condemn these murderers, grieve for the victims of their despicable acts, and ache for all the families who have suffered unimaginable and irreparable loss,” Biden said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“But guided by my conscience and my experience as a public defender, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Vice President, and now President, I am more convinced than ever that we must stop the use of the death penalty at the federal level. In good conscience, I cannot stand back and let a new administration resume executions that I halted.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The three men Biden left on death row Monday include Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, sentenced in 2015 of bombing the Boston Marathon in 2013; Dylann Roof, sentenced in 2017 of fatally shooting nine members of Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in 2015 in Charleston, South Carolina; and Robert Bowers, sentenced in 2023 for the deadly shooting in 2018 that killed 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The president’s commutations Monday come after he <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-commutes-sentences-nearly-1500-people-pardons-39-historic-clemency-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commuted the sentences</a> on Dec. 12 of 1,500 people who were placed in home confinement during the coronavirus pandemic. He also granted pardons for 39 individuals convicted of nonviolent crimes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Biden received <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/criminal-justice/shapiro-conahan-says-biden-commuting-kids-for-cash-judges-sentence-absolutely-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">criticism</a> from Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and others for including among the mass commutations a Pennsylvania judge convicted in 2011 of sending children to prison in exchange for millions of dollars in kickbacks from a private jail — a crime that became known in the commonwealth as the “<a href="https://penncapital-star.com/criminal-justice/shapiro-conahan-says-biden-commuting-kids-for-cash-judges-sentence-absolutely-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cash for Kids</a>” scheme.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Advocates for abolishing the death penalty and some U.S. House Democrats had <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-dem-quartet-calls-biden-spare-lives-federal-death-row-inmates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pressured Biden</a> to commute death penalty sentences ahead of President-elect Donald Trump’s return to the White House. Trump expedited some executions during his first term.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a statement, Trump transition spokesman Steven Cheung blasted the commutations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“These are among the worst killers in the world and this abhorrent decision by Joe Biden is a slap in the face to the victims, their families, and their loved ones,” Cheung wrote. “President Trump stands for the rule of law, which will return when he is back in the White House after he was elected with a massive mandate from the American people.”</p>

(Pixabay/Creative Commons license)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia lawmakers are preparing to reintroduce bipartisan legislation aimed at creating a regulated and taxed adult-use cannabis marketplace in the state. The renewed push comes after Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed a similar proposal earlier this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax, and Sen. Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach, are once again spearheading the effort, planning to bring forward the same proposal that previously passed both chambers of the General Assembly with bipartisan support. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB448" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The measure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as sent to Youngkin’s desk at the time, would establish a legal framework to regulate the sale and taxation of cannabis for adults 21 and older, marking a significant step toward implementing the retail market many advocates have long championed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re trying to start with the same bill since we were able to get both chambers aboard, including a couple Republicans. I think there’s a good chance that a few more Republicans will join in this time, especially in the Senate,” Krizek said in a phone interview earlier this week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While several GOP lawmakers supported the proposal at various points as it moved through the legislature during the 2024 session, only Sen. Christie New Craig, R-Chesapeake, voted for the bill’s final version in the state Senate. In the House, freshman Del. Chris Obenshain, R-Montgomery County, a former assistant attorney general, was the sole Republican to back the measure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia was the first southern state to legalize public possession of up to one ounce of marijuana by adults 21 and over and allow them to grow up to four plants of marijuana in a private residence. However, the General Assembly has yet to create a framework for a legal marketplace for cannabis products in the commonwealth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without a legal market in place, residents can grow small amounts at home or possess cannabis, but buying or selling it remains illegal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the proposed plan, the state would license cannabis retailers, establish clear rules for production and sales, and tax products to generate new revenue. Lawmakers argue that a regulated market would also curtail illegal cannabis sales and provide consumer protections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, the General Assembly approved a version of the bill that would have established a market, only for Youngkin to veto the legislation, citing concerns over enforcement and the state’s role in managing cannabis commerce. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The proposed legalization of retail marijuana in the commonwealth endangers Virginians’ health and safety,” </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/101RteYQu09LrjbzzSqiFu9EIxyw7jMcCEnRvwRap-NA/edit?tab=t.0" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">he said in a statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in March. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“States following this path have seen adverse effects on children’s and adolescent’s health and safety, increased gang activity and violent crime, significant deterioration in mental health, decreased road safety, and significant costs associated with retail marijuana that far exceed tax revenue.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin has since repeatedly expressed skepticism about expanding legal cannabis in Virginia, and his spokesman Christian Martinez said on Wednesday that this hasn’t changed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Krizek remains hopeful that in his final year as governor, Youngkin may be open to negotiating with Democrats as he looks to solidify his legacy.</span></p>

Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax (courtesy of Krizek campaign)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can’t get into his head, obviously, but I think it’s for that reason it’s worth trying, it’s worth putting this out as an opportunity for a compromise in some other capacity,” Krizek said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">”I think it&#8217;s very possible, because he’s already a lame duck and this is it for him, and if he wants to have one of his legacies be an unregulated cannabis free-for-all, then that will be his legacy. Or he could choose a rational marketplace with safe, tested and taxed products.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.roanoke.edu/documents/rcpoll/RC%20Poll%20Topline%20Feb2024.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conducted by the Institute for Policy and Opinion Research at Roanoke College and released during the legislative debate found that 63% of Virginians strongly or somewhat support measures to help small businesses compete with pharmaceutical companies and existing medical cannabis dispensaries, while only 15% are somewhat or strongly opposed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And advocates believe there is growing momentum to push the legislation forward again. Supporters highlight the potential for tax revenue, job creation, and investments in addiction treatment and restorative justice programs funded by cannabis taxes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greg Habeeb, a former Republican member of the House of Delegates from Salem and a lobbyist for the Virginia Cannabis Association who helped draft Rouse’s bill earlier this year, said in an interview Thursday that Youngkin’s veto of the legislation caused an explosion of illegal corner marijuana stores, pop up shops and street dealers across the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Everybody who was trying to engage in this market in a proper way, some of the people selling hemp products, some of the people selling CPD products, they’ve almost all been wiped out of business,” Habeeb said. “That’s exactly what we said would happen if the government vetoed the bill to the extent there was a legally operating market in which this is essentially destroyed, and yet every day there are stories about raids and busts and illegal stores.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually Virginia is “going to have to wake up and create a regulated system, so we can get rid of these illegal stores and get this stuff out of the hands of our dealers and kids,” Habeeb said, adding that Republicans will continue to say its  Democrats fault for legalizing cannabis in the first place, and both Democrats and Republicans will continue to blame each other for the status quo, if it remains unchanged.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How that plays out for their individual legacies will have to be seen, but collectively creating a system where it’s legal to possess, legal to share, legal to grow, but illegal to sell in a regulated way, has created this system. It is completely unacceptable and I think history will tell us that it was a disaster.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The discussion around creating a legal marketplace for adult-use cannabis in Virginia is reignited as the Virginia Cannabis Control Authority (CCA) — the state agency created in 2021 to oversee the regulation and enforcement of cannabis laws in Virginia — unveiled its </span><a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/664229cd06b6f9326d1e815c/t/675708223e9a06386996e75e/1733756963828/2024-Virginia-Statewide-Impaired-Driving-Survey-report.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">latest survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on marijuana-impaired driving. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between August and September, the CCA surveyed 783 Virginia residents aged 16 or older with a driver’s license, including 310 who identified as past three-month marijuana users. The results, which build on the inaugural 2022 study, were released as part of National Impaired Driving Prevention Month this December.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey revealed nearly one-third of Virginia drivers believe those who consume marijuana are typically safe drivers. Furthermore, 22% of respondents admitted to driving while high a few times a year or more, and 34% acknowledged riding as passengers with drivers under the influence of marijuana. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forty-six percent of marijuana users reported they do not always plan for a sober ride home. These figures remain unchanged or have increased since the 2022 survey, underscoring the need for continued education and awareness campaigns, the CCA said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite these concerns, the survey also pointed to progress. The percentage of drivers who believe they are likely to be pulled over for driving under the influence of marijuana increased to 29%, up from 24% in 2022. Additionally, 47% of marijuana users said they always plan for a sober ride home, up from 42% last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This survey shows that while we’ve made some progress, there’s still considerable work to do,” said Jeremy Preiss, acting Head and Chief Officer of Regulatory, Policy, and External Affairs at the CCA. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Driving under the influence of marijuana is illegal in Virginia. State law prohibits using cannabis while driving or as a passenger in a vehicle. Violations can result in fines, license suspension, or even jail time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the survey still found that 1 in 10 Virginia drivers (9%) incorrectly assume that there is no penalty for driving under the influence of marijuana.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite enforcement concerns and Youngkin’s previous resistance, Krizek and Rouse — who is seeking his party’s nomination for lieutenant governor in 2025 — remain optimistic that a renewed effort can succeed, especially with continued bipartisan backing and public support for a regulated market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their proposal is expected to be introduced when the General Assembly reconvenes in January. It will likely reignite debate over cannabis reform in Virginia, as lawmakers weigh economic benefits, public health concerns, and the political landscape leading up to the 2025 gubernatorial elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’d never say never, but I also realize that the governor has been pretty adamantly against the bill,” Krizek said. “I still think we have to do it, it would be legislative malpractice to not give it another try.” </span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s top investigatory body is turning its attention to Red Onion State Prison following alarming reports of self-harm and poor conditions at the supermax facility in Wise County.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrea Sapone, the state’s new corrections ombudsman, announced Monday that her office will prioritize an investigation into living conditions and the health and safety of incarcerated individuals at the prison, which has faced scrutiny after a hunger strike in 2023 and six cases of people burning themselves this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Office of the State Inspector General takes all allegations of abuse seriously,” she told the House of Delegates’ Public Safety Committee. “A Red Onion investigation will be prioritized as soon as we have full staff to do it properly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An offer has been extended for one position, and a pool of candidates is under consideration to fill four more roles, an OSIG spokesperson confirmed to The Mercury.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calls for oversight at Red Onion have grown louder from prison reform advocates, lawmakers and families of incarcerated individuals. Allegations against the facility include poor living conditions, mistreatment and the extended  use of solitary confinement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a presentation to the committee on Monday, Department of Corrections director Chad Dotson suggested the recent incidents of self-harm were attempts by inmates to secure transfers to other prisons closer to their families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s no evidence whatsoever that there was any kind of a plot or a protest,” Dotson said. “All the inmates involved said they did it because they wanted to get away from Red Onion. Two of these have a history of self-harm.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Taj Mahon-Haft, founder of the Humanization Project, pushed back, emphasizing that the underlying issue is the level of desperation that drives people to harm themselves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mahon-Haft, who was formerly incarcerated, said he understands firsthand the challenges of imprisonment, particularly how prolonged isolation can lead to harmful thoughts or actions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">April Wright shared a harrowing account during the meeting, revealing that her incarcerated son had apparently attempted to hang himself. Wright said she only learned of the incident when another inmate reached out to inform her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of solitary confinement, or what Virginia calls “restorative housing,”  was another major focus of the discussion. Under a state law enacted last year, incarcerated individuals in restorative housing are now granted four hours a day outside their cells. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dotson described the practice as a temporary measure, explaining that it is reserved for individuals with serious behavioral infractions who may pose a threat to themselves or others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plaintiffs in a </span><a href="https://www.acluva.org/en/press-releases/hundreds-virginians-held-prolonged-solitary-confinement-join-aclu-virginia-class#:~:text=%E2%80%93%20A%20federal%20judge%20in%20the,Department%20of%20Corrections%20(VADOC)." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filed by the Virginia chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) allege they were placed in confined housing for extended periods, with at least one person claiming the experience left them feeling suicidal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s clear that this is a systemic problem,” ACLU attorney Geri Greenspan said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, the General Assembly passed a </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB719" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">aimed at further reforming confinement practices in Virginia prisons, but it was vetoed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin. While it remains unclear if a similar bill will be introduced in the upcoming legislative session, members of the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus have hinted at the possibility. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, Del. Marcus Simon, D-Fairfax, is looking forward to a formal investigation into Red Onion State Prison. 	<div class="halfwidth">

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think the most important thing we heard was the commitment from the ombudsman to make this investigation into Red Onion her top priority,” Simon said. “I think that&#8217;s a win.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hired in late September by the Office of the State Inspector General, Sapone said her office has already begun tracking letters and emails from those seeking assistance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It takes a village to raise and identify concerns and find solutions,” Sapone told members of Virginia’s Corrections Oversight Committee Friday morning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Office of the State Inspector General (OSIG) plans to improve transparency and accessibility for its corrections ombudsman unit by updating its website to include the unit’s mailing address and an online complaint form,Sapone said. She added that she is working on protocol to ensure that inmates and family members who reach out can be informed about the status of investigated claims. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sapone also called for a formal memorandum of understanding between OSIG and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Department of Corrections to establish coordination procedures for investigations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Dave Marsden, D-Alexandria, a member of the Corrections Oversight Committee, said that he and other lawmakers are frequently  contacted by incarcerated people and their families seeking assistance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He emphasized that while it may be tempting for lawmakers to intervene directly in complaints it is crucial to forward the information to the ombudsman to ensure a proper investigation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You know, you hear compelling stories that may or may not be true and we need to regulate ourselves to make sure that our role is to oversee the ombudsman’s office and not get engaged in individual cases,” Marsden said. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">People in Red Onion State Prison relay poor conditions</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An investigation into living conditions and treatment of inmates at Red Onion State Prison is what some lawmakers, prison reform advocates and loved ones of people incarcerated there have been calling for in recent weeks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ahead of Thanksgiving, Department of Corrections Director Chad Dotson confirmed that six incarcerated individuals had intentionally </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/virginia-department-of-corrections-confirm-inmates-burned-themselves-lawmakers-want-investigation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">burned themselves</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He said that they received medical treatment and were referred to mental health services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The confirmation came after the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus (VLBC) urged Dotson and Gov. Glenn Youngkin to investigate. The caucus, which had been contacted by families of those incarcerated, suggested the self-harm incidents were acts of protests against prison conditions or efforts to prompt transfers to other facilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Red Onion has also seen hunger strikes, with inmates citing  poor living conditions and food, mistreatment,racism by some correctional officers and the excessive use of solitary confinement, according to the caucus </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, the caucus said the hunger strike and the self-harm “reflect the psychological and physical toll that gruesome prison conditions can have on incarcerated individuals.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Dotson confirmed that at least six people at the prison had harmed themselves, he said they did so by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“tampering with electrical outlets.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dotson dismissed reports from the prison as “bad-faith efforts to try to score cheap political points by advocacy groups.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also accused these groups of pushing for “prison abolition and policies that would make Virginians less safe.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ekong Eshiet, who is incarcerated at Red Onion, has recently expressed concerns about his safety. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allegedly among those who engaged in self-harm, Eshiet was contacted by The Mercury through JPay, a service that allows incarcerated people to communicate with those who are outside the prison. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He suggested reaching out to his sister, who did not respond to calls or messages before this article’s publication. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prison Radio, an organization that amplifies the voices of incarcerated individuals, has released an </span><a href="https://www.prisonradio.org/commentary/hunger-strike-and-self-immolation-update/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">audio recording of Eshiet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the recording he recounts facing discrimination due to his name and Muslim faith and described the challenges he encountered during his personal hunger strike. He also spoke openly about setting himself on fire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eshiet described his situation as being “in fear for my life.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expressing his hope for a transfer to another facility to serve the remainder of his  sentence, Eshiet said, “I’m trying to get up off this. I’m doing my best, like I’m going about this the right way. I guess, like with the hunger strike way. But if I have to, I don’t mind setting myself on fire again.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Sen. Barbara Favola, D-Arlington, the situation seems like “a cry for help.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I mean something has to be going on, right?” she said in an interview with The Mercury. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like the VLBC, Favola has been working to uncover more information about potential issues within the prison. Earlier in November, she and Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, sent a letter to Dotson, requesting a detailed report after families of inmates shared troubling anecdotes about conditions at Red Onion and another facility, Wallens Ridge. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can’t say that I have any evidence to point specific fingers at,” Favola said. However, she expressed hope that the newly established ombudsman position will facilitate  a thorough investigation into the matter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Lamont Bagby, D-Henrico, the VLBC chair, told The Mercury that he and his colleagues are still “gathering intel”on the conditions at Red Onion. As the caucus prepares to unveil its legislative priorities ahead of the upcoming General Assembly session, Bagby suggested that continued prison reform efforts may be among the initiatives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB719" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aims to regulate the duration a person can spend in solitary confinement. Although Virginia law refers to the practice as “restorative housing,” concerns about its excessive use have been raised by lawmakers and reform advocates. The measure passed the Democratic-controlled legislature earlier this year but was ultimately </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+amd+SB719AG" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">by Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill would have mandated  mental health evaluations every two days for individuals in solitary confinement and built on a related reform </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB887" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">signed into law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Youngkin last year. That earlier legislation requires that people in solitary confinement receive a designated number of hours outside their cells each day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his veto message for the 2024 bill, Youngkin described the measure as “unnecessary bureaucracy” that would burden facility administrators and hinder the department’s focus on “safety and inmate rehabilitation.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Renewed hope’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, prison reform advocates, incarcerated individuals and their families continue to speak out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the recent Corrections Oversight Committee meeting, several people used the public comment period to share concerns about the conditions their loved ones have reported. They urged lawmakers to visit the prisons firsthand and called for thorough investigations into the issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kimberly Dyke-Harsley El shared that a family member, currently incarcerated at Greensville Correctional Center, went several days without access to his blood pressure medication. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, Gigi Badawi recounted spending over a year navigating back-and-forth communications with the Department of Corrections to ensure necessary medication for her son at Indian Creek Correctional Center. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And activist Phil Wilayto called on  lawmakers to investigate  the allegations emerging from  Red Onion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s time for those of us who have advocated for our incarcerated loved ones to be taken seriously instead of immediately dismissed,” Badawi said. “I have renewed hope that the new ombudsman and her team will look into allegations.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers in Virginia’s Legislative Black Caucus say a dozen prisoners have harmed themselves since mid-September and want an investigation into inmates’ claims of poor living conditions and treatment in the high-security prison. Earlier this year prisoners there held </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/hunger-strike-red-onion-prison-virginia/article_be16e382-affc-11ee-8c36-437a567e5383.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hunger strikes</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to protest conditions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People who have been incarcerated at Red Onion State Prison describe being regularly subjected to racial and physical abuse from correctional officers, medical neglect including the withholding of medicine, excessive stays in solitary confinement with one report of 600 consecutive days, inedible food having been covered in maggots and officers’ spit, and violent dog attacks,” according to the release from the Black Caucus. “These repeated and tragic self-immolation attempts, and accompanying hunger strikes, reflect the psychological and physical toll that gruesome prison conditions can have on incarcerated individuals.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Wednesday statement from DOC director Chadwick Dotson confirmed that six people had burned themselves by “using improvised devices that were created by tampering with electrical outlets.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that all six were treated for their injuries and returned to Red Onion where they have been referred to the mental health staff for treatment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christian Martinez, a spokesperson for Gov. Glenn Youngkin, said that the governor was aware of the situation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dotson also had pointed words for groups making allegations against Red Onion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The recent round of stories about Red Onion are nothing more than bad-faith efforts to try to score cheap political points by advocacy groups who pursue prison abolition and policies that would make Virginians less safe,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alison Chaffin, who has a loved one in Red Onion, said that she was frustrated by Dotson’s response.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“(VBLC) asked him to investigate, and then this is his response,” she said. “He says ‘It&#8217;s not self-immolating.” But they burned themselves — I thought that was the definition.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, lawmakers in Virginia’s Black Caucus stressed their commitment to legislation, pointing to a bill to regulate the number of days an incarcerated person can spend in solitary confinement. The bill passed the legislature this year before being</span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB719" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">by Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The reality that these individuals felt there was no other avenue to have their claims taken seriously, investigated, and remedied is a grave indictment of the Commonwealth of Virginia and reminds us of the urgent need for comprehensive prison reform,” the VBLC statement said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than labeling it solitary confinement, Virginia has what it calls “</span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title53.1/chapter2/section53.1-39.2/#:~:text=5.-,An%20incarcerated%20person%20who%20has%20been%20placed%20in%20restorative%20housing,may%20include%20recreation%20in%20a" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">restorative housing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is defined as “special purpose bed assignments operated under maximum security regulations and procedures and utilized for the personal protection or custodial management of an incarcerated person.”</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">RICHMOND, Va. &#8212; Federal and state lawmakers have introduced legislation to strengthen support for and better protect sexual assault victims on college campuses, but the progress has been stagnant.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A congressional bill introduced by a Virginia senator previously died and was reintroduced, but it is still in committee.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A bill in the General Assembly recently died, with the final decision to kill it happening just months after Liberty University received the largest fine ever issued for breaking the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Act.</p>
<p dir="ltr">S.5086 &#8211; SOS Campus Act</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., reintroduced <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/5086/text" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/5086/text&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1732371896430000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1Mw-4iqJSCMDBegjgUmwnw">a proposal</a> in September after an earlier <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/4846?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%224846%22%7D&amp;s=1&amp;r=9" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/4846?q%3D%257B%2522search%2522%253A%25224846%2522%257D%26s%3D1%26r%3D9&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1732371896430000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3U3oCMyRRr7zd4Ob-Hh5QY">version</a> died in the last session of Congress. This bill amends the Higher Education Act of 1965, which, among other things, created the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Act.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The act requires higher education institutions to provide support for victims of violent crimes and to make publicly available campus crime statistics and institutional policies for campus safety, according to the Clery Center.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Kaine’s bill would require schools that receive federal funding to appoint an advocate, independent of the institution, who guides victims of sexual assault throughout the process. This would include better connection to available resources, emotional counseling and protection for the student from more harm – such as disciplinary action or penalization for reporting the incident.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bill requires the advocate to report incidents to an investigative body and submit an annual report to the learning institution with the number of victims and how each resource was used.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The SOS Campus Act was referred to the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, according to Kaine.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The inspiration for the legislation is to protect the rights of students to feel safe on campus, according to Kaine.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“That’s why I’ve worked on legislation, including the SOS Campus Act, to prevent sexual assault and support survivors,” Kaine stated. “I will keep working to garner support among my colleagues for the SOS Campus Act and work to get it passed and signed into law.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">HB 369 &#8211; Sexual Misconduct Policies and Task Force</p>
<p dir="ltr">Del. Marty Martinez, D-Loudoun, introduced <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/HB369" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/HB369&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1732371896430000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0X1b_ife_8AXjVfJigr1-j">House Bill 369</a>, which had similar objectives to Kaine’s bill, to update sexual misconduct policies and increase accountability for institutions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bill was introduced in the 2024 General Assembly session, but a Rules subcommittee continued the bill to the 2025 session. The bill was officially left in that committee on Nov. 18, effectively killing it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bill would create a task force which produced an annual climate survey, install a crisis center, establish a designated confidential adviser on all campuses and impose civil penalties for institutions that violate the proposed guidelines.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The State Council of Higher Education for Virginia would appoint the task force, whose charge would be to create a base sexual misconduct campus climate survey, according to SCHEV communications director Bob Spieldenner. This survey would be distributed to all institutions across the state, which would be a routine task for SCHEV, he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Schools could tailor the survey with campus-specific questions before sending them to students, according to the bill. The results would be shared with SCHEV and posted online within about four months for public viewing, along with the institution’s website.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bill required for-profit, private institutions to have a designated crisis center with a confidential, independent advocate to provide support to victims of sexual assault and direct them on the next steps. This is something that nonprofit, private universities are already required to do.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bill also created accountability on institutions to report alleged incidents and investigations. If an institution did not take any action “after reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing,” then they would be fined up to $150,000 (or 1% of institution’s annual operating budget, whichever is lower) for each violation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, was a co-patron of the measure. The bill was a step toward the ultimate goal of every individual to feel safe at their school, he stated.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Virginia’s students have one job &#8212; to learn,” Helmer stated. “And as legislators, it’s our job to protect them when our schools won’t.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Neither Martinez nor Helmer responded when asked if they had plans to reintroduce this bill or similar legislation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Liberty University Shows Cracks In System</p>

(Courtesy of Google) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares has joined the U.S. Department of Justice and a coalition of 38 state attorneys general in proposing sweeping remedies to dismantle Google’s unlawful monopoly over internet search engines and restore competition in the digital marketplace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The push follows </span><a href="https://www.oag.state.va.us/media-center/news-releases/2807-november-21-2024-virginia-justice-department-seek-limits-to-google-business-practices-to-end-search-engine-monopoly" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a landmark ruling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in August 2024 by a federal district court in Washington, D.C., which found that Google violated federal antitrust laws by maintaining a monopoly in online search and search advertising through anticompetitive practices. The court’s decision marked a significant win in the ongoing efforts to curb Big Tech dominance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The remedies proposed are reasonable, measured steps to restore competition and protect consumers,” Miyares said in a statement Thursday. “Virginia is proud to help produce a balanced resolution that benefits consumers and competitors alike.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_30211" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/ga-2022-4-3/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-30211" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GA-2022-4-3-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GA-2022-4-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GA-2022-4-3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GA-2022-4-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GA-2022-4-3.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Attorney General Jason Miyares (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia initially joined the fight against Google in December 2020, alleging in a lawsuit that the tech giant used illegal contracts and other conduct to suppress competition and secure its monopoly power. That case complemented a similar federal antitrust lawsuit filed by the Justice Department in October of that year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A multi-day hearing to consider the proposed remedies is scheduled for April 22, 2025, and is expected to conclude by May 2, 2025, according to a news release by the attorney general’s oOffice.The outcome of this case will likely have far-reaching implications for competition in the tech industry and consumer choice in digital services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kent Walker, Google’s chief legal officer, sharply criticized the Justice Department’s latest move, accusing the agency of pushing “a radical interventionist agenda” that would harm Americans and America’s global technology leadership. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“DOJ’s wildly overbroad proposal goes miles beyond the court’s decision. It would break a range of Google products — even beyond Search — that people love and find helpful in their everyday lives,” Walker wrote </span><a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/doj-search-remedies-nov-2024/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in a blog post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Thursday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://oag.dc.gov/sites/default/files/2024-11/2024.11.20%20Google%20Plaintiffs%20Initial%20PFJ%20%281%29.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposed final judgment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or PFJ, filed with the courts seeks to dismantle Google’s dominance by prohibiting its lucrative search distribution contracts and revenue-sharing agreements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the legal challenge proves successful, Google would no longer be allowed to pay manufacturers, device makers, or browsers to make Google Search the default search engine. Additionally, the company would be required to share data and information obtained through its monopoly with competitors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The PFJ also calls for Google to divest Chrome, its popular browser that accounts for a substantial share of the portal’s search traffic and powers its targeted advertising to users. Furthermore, the judgment opens the door to additional divestitures, including Google’s Android operating system, if the company fails to comply with remedies or if the proposed measures prove ineffective.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The judgment further prohibits Google from leveraging its ownership of Android to stifle competition. The company specifically would be barred from mandating the use of Google Search or Google AI on Android devices, degrading the performance of rival services, or using its control over distributors to favor its products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a measure proposed solely by the states, Google would also be required to fund a public education campaign to inform consumers about the company’s anticompetitive practices, the resulting legal action, and the alternatives available to them for search engines and digital tools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The order establishes a five-member technical committee tasked with overseeing the implementation, monitoring and enforcement of these remedies over a ten-year period.</span></p>

(Courtesy of Flock Safety)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State lawmakers are debating whether to regulate law enforcement departments’ use of Automated License Plate Readers (ALPR). They heard  constituents’ perspectives on the technology and reviewed studies from the Virginia State Crime Commission at a meeting in Richmond on Thursday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ALPRs are typically mounted cameras (but can also be dashboard cameras) that capture a photograph or video clip of a vehicle and its license plate along with the location, date and time of the capture. The technology has grown in popularity across the country in both public and private sector use — from </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/22/crime-suburbs-license-plate-readers/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">homeowner associations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and businesses to </span><a href="https://www.29news.com/2024/09/23/flock-cameras-put-use-charlottesville/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">law enforcement </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">agencies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Thursday’s </span><a href="https://vscc.virginia.gov/2024/Nov14mtg/Presentation%20-VSCC%20ALPR.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">presentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the commission&#8217;s deputy director Colin Drabert outlined a study and feedback from unnamed “stakeholders.” Their responses, he said, reflected that there are numerous benefits as well as concerns surrounding law enforcement using the technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Few rigorous studies have been conducted on the effectiveness of ALPR,” he said. “However, the studies that have been conducted have shown that ALPR is particularly effective in assisting law enforcement with locating stolen vehicles and investigating other offenses.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also noted the stakeholders’ concern that camera placement in minority communities “would result in disparate impacts to the residents of those communities.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Department of Criminal Justice Services is in the process of determining how many Virginia law enforcement agencies are already using ALPR — information that will be available “in the near future,” Drabert said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least 18 states currently regulate the use of ALPRs and 17 of them also regulate the length of time that law enforcement can retain data. For instance, New Hampshire allows for three minutes while Alabama allows for up to five years. Several states range from a few weeks to a few months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though law enforcement agencies can share data with other public and private entities that use ALPR, Drabert stressed multiple times that ALPR alone does not reveal people’s identities. He said that law enforcement has to access separate databases to determine who owns a vehicle that was flagged by the technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drabert explained that law enforcement that uses ALPR receives alerts for “hot list” features like stolen vehicles or license plates, vehicles associated with people known to be potentially engaged in criminal activity and vehicles associated with missing people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charlottesville police chief Michael Kochis made a case for using ALPRs during public comment and said that some community members in his community had been asking for them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said that “people whose homes were being shot up on a weekly basis” kept asking “when are we going to get it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In September, Charlottesville’s city council approved  the installation of Flock Safety Cameras — a leading ALPR company in America — following a series of community meetings that garnered mixed feedback from residents. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But common concerns that have emerged in Virginia and nationwide amid the rise in ALPR use have been privacy and prevention of unreasonable searches and seizures by governments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Norfolk residents recently filed a federal </span><a href="https://www.wtkr.com/news/in-the-community/norfolk/new-lawsuit-challenges-whether-flock-cameras-in-norfolk-are-constitutional" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lawsuit </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">challenging the use of Flock cameras, alleging that they violate people’s Fourth Amendment rights — which protect against unreasonable searches and seizures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drabert noted cases where ALPR use resulted in erroneous searches, such as when a mother and children in Colorado were </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/01/08/955165485/no-charges-for-colorado-officers-who-held-black-children-at-gunpoint" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">held at gunpoint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after being wrongly suspected of being in a stolen car. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legal Aid Justice Center attorney Ruby Cherian asked lawmakers to consider “guardrails” for law enforcements’ use of the technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Officers should be required to get a warrant to search the database to protect privacy rights and prevent misuse and abuse,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Wren Williams, R-Patrick, asked if a 30-day limit on data storage would be reasonable. Cherian agreed, though she said she’d like to see a shorter cutoff. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The crime commission will meet again on Dec. 16, when Del. Charniele Herring, D-Alexandria, said some decisions can be made on how to move forward with potential regulations. After Thursday’s meeting, Herring said that she wants to read through documents stemming from the presentation and analyze other information and cases regarding ALPR use. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think something needs to be in place,” she said. </span></p>

(Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Democratic-led House of Delegates panel on Wednesday advanced three proposed constitutional amendments, including a revised measure seeking to enshrine abortion rights in the state’s highest law. The new proposal would also require third-trimester abortions to be approved by one doctor instead of three, as the law currently mandates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 22-member House Privileges and Elections Committee further backed amendments to extend constitutional protections to marriage equality and the automatic restoration of voting rights for felons who have served their time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The right to love, the right to vote, the right to bodily autonomy and privacy, these are the very rights and freedoms that are crucial to the foundation of this commonwealth and this nation,” committee chair Del. Marcia Price, D-Newport News, said in a brief news conference Wednesday afternoon. “We showed up today to do our jobs and to do everything within our power to protect these rights and freedoms for all Virginians.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The revised abortion amendment language in </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/HJ1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HJ1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shocked the committee’s Republican members, who only saw the changes after the meeting was already underway. Price called a  five-minute recess to allow lawmakers to review the new language before deliberations and voting proceeded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think we’re still trying to figure out what happened today,” a visibly frustrated House Minority Leader Del. Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, said after the three-hour hearing. “Something this important and impactful — literally life-and-death decisions — I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything pushed through this fast where we didn’t get a chance to see it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gilbert warned that Price’s decision to not allow the committee more time to review the revised legislation would set a precedent for the way the House conducts its business in the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were literally given five minutes to huddle and look at it before we had to decide what we were grappling with, and I think we still don’t know, other than it’s pretty clear that this is a pretty extreme version of efforts to protect abortion that goes well beyond what has been done in other states,” Gilbert said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price, however, defended her decision to move forward with taking a vote on the proposal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have an entire legislative process just like any other committee, and [the resolution] will go to the floor where (Republicans) will also have a chance to either put forward amendments or have their voice heard as well,” she said at the news conference.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amending the state Constitution takes several years in Virginia. The proposed amendment must be approved by the legislature in two separate years, with a General Assembly election occurring in between. Only then can the amendment proceed to a statewide referendum for voters to decide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the next election in Virginia is in November 2025, the earliest the three amendments that the committee advanced Wednesday could be put on the ballot is November 2026 — if the measures pass in the 2025 and 2026 legislative sessions. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The abortion rights amendment</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under current Virginia law, third-trimester abortions require approval from three doctors. The new amendment would reduce this requirement to just one doctor when a late-term abortion is deemed necessary to protect the life of the pregnant individual, or their physical or mental health, or when a physician determines the fetus is not viable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Wednesday’s hearing, dozens of abortion opponents lined up to speak against the proposal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among them was Olivia Turner, president of the Virginia Society for Human Life, who told the panel that her group opposed both the original amendment and its substitute. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don’t know what’s going on with this new version, and how it will impact our ability as the people of Virginia to pass rational and reasonable protective laws in the future,” Turner said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Gilbert, the House Minority Leader, said that the amendment capsized Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court case that established abortion as a constitutional right and that was repealed in 2022. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Roe v. Wade has within it a compelling state interest in protecting the life of the unborn at a certain point in the pregnancy. This amendment doesn’t contain that protection at all, it leans in the other direction,” Gilbert said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The legislation we just saw, which was dropped on us literally today without any ability to look at it, reflect on it, think about it, compare notes, talk to experts, only leans into the protection of the patient, which is the mother. And so there is no more protection for the unborn, which was envisioned and embodied in Roe (v.) Wade.”</span></p>

(Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But House Majority Leader Charniele Herring, D-Alexandria, the sponsor of HJ1, said that in her amendment both the state interest in protecting the unborn and life of the mother are considered. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The parameters are set out so if there is a live fetus, there are protections. But if there is a miscarriage, then the physician and the mother will be able to make a decision to abort and to complete a miscarriage. So they do coexist,” Herring said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abortion rights advocates urged the committee to vote in favor of the amendment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This amendment will protect Virginians’ rights to make their own reproductive health care decisions, including access to abortion, contraception, fertility treatment and miscarriage care,” said Jamie Lockhart, executive director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right now, with no state or federal protections in place, Virginians face the constant risk that anti-abortion politicians could restrict or ban essential care. No one is more qualified than an individual and their health care provider to make these complex personal decisions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After defeating a Republican motion to kill the proposed amendment, the committee moved to advance the measure by a 12-9 party-line vote.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Restoration of rights amendment </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/HJ2" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HJ2</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sponsored by Del. Elizabeth Bennett-Parker, D-Alexandria, seeks to automate the process of restoring voting rights to people convicted of felony crimes who have served their sentences. The proposal comes in response to a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/03/23/youngkin-administration-now-requires-felons-to-apply-to-get-their-voting-rights-back/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2023 policy change</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> implemented by Gov. Glenn Youngkin that requires people with felony convictions to proactively apply to regain their voting rights upon release from prison and is not automatically restoring rights for any group of offenders — a shift from Virginia’s three previous governors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bennett-Parker told reporters Wednesday that her amendment proposes automatic restoration of voting rights for individuals who have been released from incarceration, which she said would foster “a more just and bare” society.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The disenfranchisement of people with all convictions is a relic of Virginia’s Jim Crow past and was intentionally inserted into the 1902 Virginia Constitution to disenfranchise as many Black voters as possible,” Bennett-Parker said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She added that the right to vote is fundamental and the amendment ensures that if a person has served their time they deserve to have their rights to participate in democracy restored.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia is the only state to permanently disenfranchise all individuals with felony convictions unless they individually petition the governor for rights restoration. The current system has no transparency and changes every four years, so no one knows what steps to take to get their rights restored. This amendment creates a process that is bound by transparent rules and criteria that will apply equally to everybody.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee backed HJ2 with a 12-9 party-line vote.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Marriage equality amendment</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the U.S. Supreme Court granted same-sex couples the right to marry in the Obergefell v. Hodges ruling in 2014, the state Constitution still includes the 2006 Marshall-Newman Amendment, which defines marriage as solely between one man and one woman and bans recognition of any legal status that approximates “the design, qualities, significance, or effects of marriage.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because it could become law again should the Supreme Court overturn its 2014 ruling one day, Del. Mark Sickles, D-Arlington, sponsored </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/HJ9" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HJ9</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in an effort to repeal the current constitutional provision and enshrine marriage as a “fundamental right inherent in the liberty of persons,” unrestricted by factors like sex, gender or race. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeff Caruso, executive director of the Virginia Catholic Conference, told the committee that his group has opposed efforts to repeal the Marshall-Newman Amendment for more than 16 years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We affirm the dignity of every person, we also affirm that marriage has an original design and purpose, which predates any nation, any religion and any law, and we urge you to uphold that principle today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Narissa Rahaman, executive director of Equality Virginia, pushed back against that notion and reminded the panel that today there are more than 20,000 same-sex couples in Virginia who have more similarities than differences with couples in traditional marriages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Here in Virginia we have seen how a state has evolved in its thinking about same-sex couples, and LGTBQ people overall. Now it’s time for our state to fully complete our evolution and finish the job in protecting marriage equality for all,” Rahaman said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee advanced the amendment on a bipartisan 16-5 vote, with four Republicans joining Democrats. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think our straightforward amendment will be welcomed by Virginia citizens and I’m really appreciative of the vote today in the committee,” Sickles said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All three amendments are now set to be voted on by the General Assembly during its 2025 session, which begins in January. </span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce/For the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Five Waynesboro voters have filed a lawsuit to prevent the majority of the Waynesboro Board of Elections from following through on their controversial pledge to refuse certification of the November 2024 election results, a move they argue would violate Virginia state law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plaintiffs — Jennifer Lewis, Ann Criser-Shedd, Greg Fife, Chris Graham and Andrea Jackson — are seeking a court order to compel the election officials to certify the city’s votes.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://advancementproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024.10.21-Waynesboro-Complaint-File-Stamped.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, filed in Waynesboro Circuit Court on Oct. 21, comes after two GOP officials from Waynesboro  filed </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/15/waynesboro-gop-officials-sue-over-va-s-voting-system-threaten-to-block-election-certification/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">their own lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> challenging Virginia’s voting system ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election while threatening to not certify the results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In their complaint, Curtis Lilly, the chairman of the Waynesboro Electoral Board, and Scott Mares, the board’s vice chair, expressed their concerns over the reliability of electronic voting systems, which they argue are prone to inaccuracies. Instead, they demanded that all ballots be counted by hand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, state law does not currently require a mandatory hand-count unless irregularities are proven, and all paper ballots are required to be counted by optical scanning machines, which help speed up the counting process and reduce the risk of human error. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before each election, the scanners undergo rigorous testing using a predetermined sample of votes to ensure accurate tallying before any real votes are counted. Additionally, it is illegal to connect ballot scanning machines to the Internet at any point, further safeguarding the integrity of the voting process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of the scanners used in Virginia’s elections are certified to meet both state and federal standards and are handled under a strict chain of custody to ensure security and accuracy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In their counter-suit, the five Waynesboro voters ask the court to require the election officials to certify the election results unless they prevail in their own suit. The plaintiffs further argue that the election officials’ stance violates the Virginia Constitution, which mandates that election results be certified in accordance with established procedures, including the use of legally authorized voting equipment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The chairman and vice chairman should do their job; instead they are purposely misinterpreting what they are charged to do. I cast my vote and have every right to expect that it will be counted on Election Day,” said Lewis, one of the plaintiffs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackson, another plaintiff, said that voting in the 2024 election was “very important” to her. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am frustrated that the election officials are not doing what they take an oath to do, which is to make sure the election runs smoothly and every vote counts. Instead they are distracting us from our local elections by filing nonsensical court cases,” Jackson said. </span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Santia Nance and Gin Carter said they haven’t washed a single dish since their partners were released from prison. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As both loathe the household chore, Nance’s husband Quadaire Patterson and Carter’s husband Taj Mahon-Haft have been more than happy to take it on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Carter is in her fourth year of veterinarian school, Mahon-Haft said doing the dishes is just one more way to support her after she emotionally supported him through his incarceration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The couples were part of a multi-group effort to change state law expanding pathways for early release of  incarcerated people who meet certain criteria. They also made friends along the way as people were released this past July through expansions to Earned Sentence Credits — a way that people with good behavior and who participate in educational advancements can trim some of their prison sentences. Despite initial opposition to its expansions in 2022, Gov. Glenn Youngkin </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/16/earned-sentence-credit-expansions-new-parole-board-operations-to-take-effect-this-year/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">allowed its implementation this year.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid navigating these new chapters in their lives, some have petitioned for a chance to vote in this year’s elections. Several of them say they have little hope they will be able to. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Constitutionally disenfranchised</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/constitution/article2/section1/#:~:text=Virginia%20Law,-Constitution&amp;text=No%20person%20who%20has%20been,his%20competency%20has%20been%20reestablished." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s Constitution,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> people with felony convictions are all but permanently disenfranchised unless a governor pardons them or restores their rights. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell, along with former democratic Govs. Terry McAuliffe and Ralph Northam, had streamlined the process and eventually made people </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210408122644/https://www.restore.virginia.gov/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">automatically eligible for rights restoration if their sentence was complete</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Then Youngkin </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/surovell-spruill-ask-if-youngkin-has-changed-rights-restoration-process/article_dd1232ba-c4fb-11ed-8b57-3723c72fb438.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">quietly adjusted the process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, requiring individuals to submit petitions to regain their rights, resulting in lower </span><a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/local/virginia/virginians-whose-rights-have-been-restored-drops-in-second-year-of-youngkin-administration-reports-show/291-fbe59fc9-c488-4449-be3e-ad4c0ba1c374" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">restoration numbers </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">compared to previous administrations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exact criteria the governor considers when granting or rejecting applications remains unclear. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s chapter of the NAACP took Youngkin’s administration to court last year to get answers but </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/judge-finds-for-youngkin-administration-in-naacps-foia-case/article_210d11ec-9936-11ee-a87e-138606562546.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a judge ruled that most details are exempt from being shared </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">through a provision in the Freedom of Information Act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what was shared in the administration’s FOIA response indicated that people who have completed probation and paid any due fines might be more likely to get a “yes” from him. An applicant disclosed in the FOIA who was classified “ineligible at this time” was still on probation and paying fines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then-spokeswoman for the governor, Macaulay Porter, told media at the time that the administration had acted “in good faith” in disclosing the information that it did provide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, applicants aren’t fully aware of what exact criteria they’d need to meet in order to be restored. In interviews with The Mercury, formerly incarcerated people shared their lingering </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">questions about whether their rights will be restored — including if their offense type matters as a disqualifier, if probation and fines are indeed a component, or if their potential good standing and public service to their community might be a factor in their favor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some also wonder if the “individual basis” petition review system the administration has reiterated over the past year is actually happening.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Copy-and-paste rejections</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the partially-filled FOIA, a “reentry resource packet” people are given when they leave prison includes a paper informing them to apply for their rights to be restored. Though there’s no indication of the time it would take in that packet, other materials in the FOIA show it can take two to three months as various state agencies are involved in the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About three months after applying for restoration, Newport News resident Justin Brown received an email with a rejection letter addressed “Dear applicant,” which didn’t describe why he was rejected. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The message was part of a mass email response the Youngkin administration sent to several hundred people who had applied for rights restoration; all of their email addresses were visible to everyone who’d gotten the message. The applicants began to chat in the email thread, revealing a series of concerns and questions about their access to the ballot box.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe each and every one of us has a right to know why we were denied,” said one of the respondents. </span></p>

(Courtesy Justin Brown)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several speculated they were denied because of this year’s high profile federal elections. Some posited that the process isn’t handled on an individual basis, since they were all mass emailed with the same generic rejection letter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some respondents noted that like the governor, they are Republicans too.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One such would-be Republican voter called it an “insult to injury” to not be able to vote while, as a former felon, he also struggles to find work that would put the medic training he gained during his military service to use. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Once I started talking with everyone else and seeing that this is a pattern of this administration, I wanted to raise some alarm bells,” Brown said in an interview with The Mercury. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He reached out to his state lawmaker, Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, who said she contacted the Secretary of the Commonwealth, Kelly Gee. Price told The Mercury that she had a conversation with Gee wherein the secretary apologized for the email error and stressed that while the alert to Brown and others had been done in mass, the restorations are handled on an individual basis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown said that he filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Justice (which is also </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/14/voter-purge-lawsuits-add-to-disenfranchisement-allegations-against-youngkin-administration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">currently suing Virginia over a purge of voter registrations too close to Election Day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). He hopes the DOJ could investigate the restoration process to ensure that it’s indeed being handled on a case-by-case basis, which the mass email put into question for him.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Unclear criteria</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several other people with felony records told The Mercury they don’t recall getting mail or emails about their rejections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mahon-Haft, who has applied twice, discovered his latest rejection through checking an online portal. He doesn’t know why he was rejected, but he is still on probation. Patterson, who is also still on probation, hasn’t applied yet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our constitution has this antiquated language for a governor to determine your destiny,” Patterson said. “We’ve finished our sentences, but there’s this extra sentence that carries on.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jared Rose, a Roanoke resident who works for a </span><a href="https://www.vacares.org/subcontractors--caas.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state-funded nonprofit organization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.roanokeva.gov/2677/Gun-Violence-Prevention-Commission" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">serves on the city’s Gun Violence Prevention Commission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wonders if his probation status might result in a rejection. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He hopes to become a peer recovery specialist to help people overcome substance abuse disorders and plans to start a nonprofit to pair formerly incarcerated people as mentors with at-risk youth. When he checked his restoration status on the portal, he said there was no information, despite applying earlier in the year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I did a crime. I broke the law, you know, this is what I’ve got to deal with,” Rose said. “But somewhere along the line, there’s just so much red tape.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Looking forward</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mahon-Haft can’t vote for lawmakers yet, but he will frequent Virginia’s Capitol in the next legislative session to support their work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He and Carter had previously co-founded an organization called The Humanization Project, an advocacy group that also participates in educational programming. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40495" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:200px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/23/these-virginians-wont-be-able-to-vote-next-month/tandg/" rel="attachment wp-att-40495"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-40495" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/TandG-200x300.jpeg" alt="" width="200" height="300" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/TandG-200x300.jpeg 200w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/TandG.jpeg 562w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Taj Mahon-Haft (left) and Gin Carter (right) on their wedding day in August 2024. Image courtesy Mahon-Haft.</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s easy to hate a conviction, but it’s not very easy to hate somebody when you know seven layers of them,” Mahon-Haft said. “You might have one thing you don&#8217;t agree with, but you can see them as a human being. When you see people as human beings, you have more humane policy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’s grateful that Youngkin reversed his course on the Earned Sentence Credit law, for example. When announcing </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/youngkin-announces-efforts-to-support-formerly-incarcerated-people/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">his own efforts to support formerly incarcerated people with re-entry </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">this summer, Youngkin indicated that reversal was more about being in alignment with the state’s Supreme Court — which had ruled in favor of a man whose incarceration had been extended despite his earned credits that should have allowed him earlier release. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Supreme Court this past year was very clear on the current sentence credits, and so we’re fully complying,” Youngkin said at the time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as Mahon-Haft and Carter’s relationship helped spark an organization, Nance co-founded </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sistas In Prison Reform with other women whose loved ones were or are still incarcerated. And while she and Patterson are still planning a wedding to celebrate their union, they went ahead and eloped earlier this month. Mahon-Haft and Carter wed over the summer in Southwest Virginia, with some of their recently-released friends also part of the celebration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The couples plan to continue public engagement around the lived experiences of incarcerated people and their families, as well as advocate for laws that help people better reintegrate into society after time spent in prison.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mahon-Haft also plans to keep applying for restoration until he gets a &#8220;yes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And if Democrats in Virginia’s state legislature get their wish, automatic restoration for completed sentences could be enshrined in the state’s constitution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To do so, a constitutional amendment will need to pass the state legislature two years in a row, with an election in the House of Delegates in between, before appearing on statewide ballots for everyone else to weigh in on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Democrats plan to kickstart that process next year, with the potential for it to appear on statewide ballots by 2026. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown, the Newport News resident, is already excited about the prospect and plans to visit Virginia’s Capitol to engage with lawmakers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until then and beyond, Mahon-Haft will continue to wash his wife’s dishes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At some point years ago, when he was still locked up, I had a pile of dishes in my sink, and I joked ‘You never pull your weight in this relationship — why don&#8217;t you ever do the dishes?’” Carter recalled. She remembered that Mahon-Haft told her if she stuck by him through the end of his sentence, he’d do her dishes the rest of her life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He&#8217;s made good on that so far!” she said. </span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce for the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two GOP officials from Waynesboro have filed a lawsuit challenging Virginia&#8217;s voting system ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election while threatening to not certify the results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In their complaint, Curtis Lilly, the chairman of the Waynesboro Electoral Board, and Scott Mares, the board’s vice chair, are raising concerns about the validity of future results while echoing unmerited claims that the 2020 election, in which Democrat Joe Biden defeated then-President Donald Trump with more than 7 million votes, was stolen.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Filed on Oct. 4 at the Waynesboro Circuit Court against Virginia Department of Elections Commissioner Susan Beals and State Board of Elections Chairman John O’Bannon, the suit alleges that the voting machines used in the state are unverifiable and could potentially be manipulated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plaintiffs further claim the machines may be connected to the internet, allowing for external tampering, though this is illegal under state law and no evidence has been provided to support this allegation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When reached by phone Tuesday, Lilly declined to be interviewed for this story. Mares did not respond to several calls seeking comment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lilly and Mares argue that under the current legal regime, local electoral board members are unable to personally review and verify that the voting machine program being used to count the ballots “is keeping and recording a true and accurate count,” and that the device’s record tape accurately represents the ballots cast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Consequently, the plaintiffs believe that the voting machine is counting the votes in secret, because neither the program counting the votes recorded on the ballots nor the ballots themselves can be examined,” the complaint says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lilly further stated in an affidavit attached to the complaint that he “cannot ensure that the machines do not connect to the internet, allowing for vote counting algorithm manipulation, nor can I ensure with any certainty that the electronic ballot scanners are presenting results which are consistent with the contents of the ballot box.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Henry Chambers, a professor for constitutional law at the University of Richmond School of Law, said in a phone interview Tuesday that the lawsuit appears to be based on long debunked conspiracy theories circulating after the 2020 presidential election that claimed vote counting machines had been programmed to get votes wrong and to flip votes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s not really a serious thing, but some people have bought into it and it sounds like these folks have bought into it, too,” Chambers said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Their notion is that vote counting that is done by a machine is done in secret, and therefore you have to hand-count the votes, presumably in public, in order to have a real tally of the actual vote count,” Chamber continued. “That would suggest that voting that is not done by hand and in public qualifies as counting in secret, which in theory would violate the state Constitution.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, voters cast paper ballots, which are then counted by optical scanning machines — as required </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title24.2/chapter6/section24.2-626/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">by state law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — to expedite the process and avoid human error. Ballot scanning machines are certified to meet both state and federal standards and are maintained under a controlled chain of custody.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before every election, the scanners are tested using a predetermined sample of votes to ensure they are tallied accurately before any actual votes are cast, and it is against the law to connect a ballot scanning machine to the Internet at any point. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals, who was appointed as Virginia’s top elections official in March 2022, did not respond to text messages seeking comment Tuesday, and a spokeswoman for the Department of the Elections said in an email that the department does not comment on pending litigation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/08/08/virginias-top-elections-official-says-shes-confident-about-the-accuracy-of-results/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in July, Beals said that hacking the scanning machines was impossible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Period. They cannot be,” she said, adding that after the testing of the devices ahead of the election and on Election Day, officials also conduct risk-eliminating audits, which she called the back-end check.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So we have three different checks throughout the system just to make sure that the machines are reporting accurately.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chambers, the UR professor, called the plaintiffs’ argument that the machine counting of ballots happened in secrecy “an odd thing,” because the machine itself is doing the counting in a public space, supervised by election officials. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The problem with counting being done in public is that one can’t necessarily explicitly see what’s going on. But the fact is, we have lots of things that count things and we just agree that it’s being counted correctly, like ATM machines,” Chambers said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No one would say that the ATM machine is spitting out money in secret, but it’s spitting out money in response to a request. Here, a voting machine is counting votes in response to a ballot being fed through a machine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By asking for ballots to be hand-counted instead of being tabulated by machines, the plaintiffs could really be asking for a slow-down of the count, Chambers added, which “can introduce additional problems with a valid count — and that is the whole point of feeding the ballots through during the day and having a continuous count is so that you can have results in a reasonable and fair time. Hand counting is used only when necessary when you&#8217;re talking about things like absentee ballots or ballots that can’t be read by the machine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also remains unclear why the GOP election officials who filed the suit would threaten to not certify the presidential election, in a county that leans Republican and where Trump won with 51-46% in 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rich Anderson, the chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia, underscored that the lawsuit was a lone effort by a small group of GOP officials from one locality. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As far as I know it’s only happening in this one jurisdiction out of 133, but it’s all going to get settled in the courts anyway,” Anderson said in a phone interview. “What they’re asking is the court to render its opinion, which it will do, and the opinion will likely be on the side of Virginia law, which says that ballots are counted through the optical scanners, not by hand.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The counting of ballots by optical scanning machines has been proven as safe and reliable, Anderson said. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, the Founding Freedoms Law Center, the legal division of the Family Foundation, announced it filed a lawsuit in Henrico County Circuit Court, claiming the state violated their clients&#8217; right to free speech and religious freedom. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The suit names the Virginia Board of Counseling, Virginia Department of Health Professions, and its director, Arne Owens, as the defendants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The American Medical Association has denounced conversion therapy, </span><a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/population-care/advocating-lgbtq-community" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">saying</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the practice is based on the idea that “homosexuality and gender nonconformity are mental disorders and that sexual orientation and gender identity can be changed,” assumptions that are not based on medical or scientific evidence.</span></p>
<p>Narissa Rahaman, executive director for Equality Virginia, said the Family Foundation&#8217;s latest action is another attempt to discriminate against LGBTQ+ people.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once again, anti-LGBTQ+ forces are just trying to find new ways to advance their failing cause,&#8221; Rahaman said in a statement. &#8220;To the LGBTQ+ youth in Virginia and around the country who have been subjected to this dangerous practice: We will not stop fighting for you. You are worthy of love, support and access to affirming therapy.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, Virginia </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title54.1/chapter24/section54.1-2409.5/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">banned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conversion therapy, which prohibits state-licensed healthcare providers and counselors from practicing it on anyone under 18. Sen. <a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+SB245" target="_blank">Scott Surovell</a>, D-Fairfax, and Del. <a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+HB386" target="_blank">Patrick Hope</a>, D-Arlington, carried the legislation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the suit, John and Janet Raymond, the plaintiffs and owners of the Associate Counseling Center in Front Royal, have lost “significant” business income due to the ban.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Raymonds wish to counsel children who are seeking help to align their sexual feelings, actions, and identity toward a biblical sexual ethic, in accordance with God‘s design for human beings, including those struggling with homosexuality and so-called &#8216;gender identity,’” the suit states.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40202" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1024px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-40202" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_2721-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_2721-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_2721-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_2721-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_2721-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_2721.jpg 1620w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  John and Janet Raymond, owners of the Associate Counseling Center in Front Royal, are suing the state for prohibiting their right to practice conversion therapy. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia lawsuit was announced soon after Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear banned the practice through an executive order on Sept. 18. Republicans outraged by the decision said it violated parental rights and hindered their legal authority to make decisions about their child’s care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founding Freedoms Law Center attorney Josh Hetzler said their case is independent of Kentucky’s recent action, but makes the Virginia lawsuit “all the more timely” and could be a learning opportunity for the neighbor state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We think our case is going to help (and) hopefully when we win, Kentucky will see the writing on the wall and will do the right thing as well,” Hetzler said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a </span><a href="https://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/therapeutic-response.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the American Psychological Association, behavior therapists used treatment like inducing nausea, providing electric shocks, or having the individual snap an elastic band around their wrist when they became aroused by same-sex erotic images or thoughts. Virginia’s ban on the practice in 2020 came after</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2020/02/18/after-years-of-efforts-virginia-passes-law-to-ban-conversion-therapy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> several years of failed legislative efforts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to make it illegal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, minors’ sexuality and gender expression have been at the forefront of political discussions concerning education and athletics in Virginia schools. Both Democrats and Republicans have  fought over the protections and rights of minors as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most notable actions came when Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration overhauled the state&#8217;s </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/09/12/despite-law-few-virginia-school-districts-adopt-state-model-transgender-policies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> model school policies for transgender and nonbinary students designed under former Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam to protect the privacy and rights of such minors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, groups including the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia have filed lawsuits challenging the Virginia Department of Education on the policies that some schools have adopted. In February, the ACLU and Freshfields filed three related lawsuits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One case, involving at least one teacher refusing to address a transgender student by her preferred first name, was </span><a href="https://www.wtkr.com/news/in-the-community/historic-triangle/york-county-court-dismisses-lawsuit-challenging-virginias-transgender-student-policies" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dismissed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in July. The other two cases are still being litigated in the Eastern District of Virginia and the Hanover County Circuit Court.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the Mercury </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/07/12/changes-to-sex-listed-on-virginia-birth-certificates-more-than-doubled-after-2020-law/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the number of Virginians changing the sex listed on their birth certificate more than doubled between 2020 and 2022, after lawmakers passed </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+SB657" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> streamlining the process for individuals wanting to do so.</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce for the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bipartisan coalition of lawmakers in Virginia and other states want to strengthen privacy laws regarding the non-consensual distribution of intimate images. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forty-nine states including Virginia already have some law on the books to protect peoples’  sexual or intimate images from being shared without their consent, but model policy from former democratic House of Delegates candidate Susanna Gibson provides a blueprint for lawmakers to use. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The issue took center stage in Gibson’s campaign last year, when news media was alerted to sex videos she and her husband had streamed online. Though the married couple had consented to the content that they streamed together being published on a particular pornography website, they did not consent to the content being recorded or widely disseminated beyond their audience of followers on that website. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Screenshots of Gibson’s nude body then circulated on social media along with derogatory language by online users. The </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/susanna-gibson-chatterbate-video-porn-republican-party-of-virginia/article_d1e5aaa6-72a8-11ee-92c9-afa9a79d1c01.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Party of Virginia later sent out campaign mailers with cropped, explicit photos of Gibson. </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">At one point a false emergency call had been placed to </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/henrico-officers-sent-to-susanna-gibsons-house-on-a-false-call/article_8c021524-69f2-11ee-83b2-3f32185898ed.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">send law enforcement to her home — an act colloquially referred to as “swatting.” </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gibson also </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/susanna-gibson-revenge-porn-virginia-lawmaker/article_aef20e14-9089-11ee-9f6a-4f33e3f98a70.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said that people loitered outside of her home and she received death threats.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the fallout, Gibson also said prospective young women political candidates in other states had reached out to her. Learning her story had them concerned that ex-partners could someday share nude images of them, and made them afraid to run for office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I quickly realized that my path had shifted from candidacy to advocacy,” Gibson said in a press call Wednesday to announce model policy from her organization, MyOwn Image. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year Gibson worked with Del. Irene Shin, D-Fairfax to expand the statute of limitations for prosecutions of unlawful dissemination of images in Virginia. The new model policy, which Gibson and MyOwn board members say six states are planning to implement, would create various tiers of misdemeanor and felony penalties for unlawful dissemination and remove language that requires proof of intent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic Florida lawmaker Katherine Waldron said the measure is important because without the consent of the person whose image is being shared, the intent to cause them harm, or lack thereof, doesn’t erase the harm that happens. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She and several other lawmakers that joined the press call relayed how victims’ mental health, personal relationships, employment or ability to find employment can be negatively impaired. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While several speakers acknowledged that anyone can become a victim of their image being shared without their consent, they noted how it often happens to women, minors or victims of sex trafficking. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Jersey assemblywoman Jessica Ramirez also noted how the crime could deter women from office, echoing Gibson’s concern, or be used as an intimidation tactic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We know that women still have a long way to go with representation in our halls of power,” she said. “So when these images are shared or used as a threat, it really can impact elections. It can impact someone’s desire to step up and run for office. We have to take action now to ensure that anyone can engage in public service without fear of intimidation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia delegates Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield and Karrie Delaney, D-Fairfax, plan to build on Virginia’s law using the model policy, they said. Coyner, who was inspired to carry the legislation as the mother of teen daughters, expressed concerns about artificial intelligence as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The rapid rise of (artificial intelligence) image generation software has heightened the threat posed by non consensual disclosure of intimate images,” Coyner said. “I know fellow parents are familiar with the harms and risks of social media and cyberbullying, but the increased risk posed by digitally forged intimate images make these issues much more severe.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, South Carolina is the only state without existing protections against non-consensual distribution of intimate images. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former Miss South Carolina Jill Dudley joined the call along with the state’s deputy attorney general and Republican state representative Chris Wooten. All will press for the creation of a law based on the model policy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dudley, who advocates for protections and support for survivors of rape and sexual assault, stressed that distributing someone’s intimate image, whether real or artificial, fits within the scope of rape culture. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Rape culture thrives when we blame or shame victims, when we dismiss their trauma, or when we fail to address sexual violence in all of its forms.”</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce for The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal judges in the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond on Tuesday appeared sympathetic to the plaintiffs in a case challenging Virginia’s disenfranchisement of people with felony convictions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a federal district judge </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/18/judge-rules-suit-against-virginia-felon-disenfranchisement-rule-can-proceed/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">allowed the challenge to move forward</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> earlier this year, alleging that </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/youngkin-voting-rights-aclu-virginia/article_90a9275e-e565-11ee-8466-3ff35b49eb1c.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has been out of compliance with a Reconstruction-era federal law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the 4th Circuit had a hearing on the state’s attempt to toss the case. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deputy Solicitor General Kevin Gallagher, in defense of the state, said the “unique” and old federal statute “is not something that people are trying to enforce.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defendants include Gov. Glenn Youngkin, the Secretary of the Commonwealth — who was Kay Coles James when the suit was first filed — and several election officials. Tuesday’s hearing was part of their interlocutory appeal limited to whether Virginia is entitled to sovereign immunity — basically, whether or not the state and its agents can be found to have done wrong or not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An interlocutory appeal is a type of appeal that can be filed while a case is active and before a final judgment. Neither the interlocutory appeal nor the Readmission Act case have been ruled on yet. And though the appeal was the point of Tuesday’s meeting, discussion veered into the Readmission case. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latter is focused on the 1870 Virginia Readmission Act, a federal law that allowed Virginia, a former Confederate state, to rejoin the U.S. Congress. Similar laws were also employed as other formerly Confederate states rejoined, with the condition that states’ constitutions could not be used to deprive anyone of voting rights, “except as punishment for such crimes that are now felonies at common law.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Common law” felonies were defined as a limited set of crimes, whereas today people with any felony conviction in Virginia permanently lose the right to vote unless a governor restores it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our claim is that essentially, Virginia made a promise when it was brought back into the United States Congress. It’s now time to keep that promise and to abide by the Virginia Readmission Act,” said ACLU attorney Vishal Agraharkar in a call with The Mercury on Monday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the defendants’ filing argues that Congress lacks the power to prohibit states from disenfranchising people with felony convictions under the Fourteenth Amendment in the U.S. Constitution and that states could choose to permanently disenfranchise people with felonies of all types, not just those in common law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the Tuesday hearing, Judge Roger Gregory noted Congress’ intent when using the Readmission Acts following the Civil War. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“(Congress) knew what (formerly-Confederate states) were going to do to newly-freed persons — they didn’t trust them,” Gregory said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gallager argued that the act was more limited to that time as a “contract between Congress and Virginia” to reenter the Union. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ACLU is working on the case with the WilmerHale law firm and a voting rights group called Protect Democracy. Plaintiffs are Virginians with felony convictions who have tried to have their rights restored by Youngkin without success. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while it’s Virginia’s constitution which grants governors purview over restoration of rights that is at the core of the Readmission Act case, Youngkin has been at the center of legal challenges to restorations under his administration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A once automatic process, Youngkin’s administration adjusted it last year to a petition-based one. As </span><a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/local/virginia/virginians-whose-rights-have-been-restored-drops-in-second-year-of-youngkin-administration-reports-show/291-fbe59fc9-c488-4449-be3e-ad4c0ba1c374" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">restoration numbers have dropped</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> under his tenure as governor, </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/judge-finds-for-youngkin-administration-in-naacps-foia-case/article_210d11ec-9936-11ee-a87e-138606562546.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">various lawsuits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have sprung up </span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/virginia-news/judge-rejects-lawsuit-but-compares-youngkins-power-to-restore-voting-rights-to-a-kings/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seeking answers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about criteria for restorations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a case by a man who sought answers about his restoration rejection was dismissed, the judge presiding over that case opined that “much like a monarch, the governor receives petitions for relief, may or may not rule upon them, and, when he does rule, need not explain his reasons.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judge Gregory was curious about criteria Tuesday as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do we know what the governor’s role is, really?” he posited. “Do we have facts, depositions about how that works and ‘how does he filter them out?’” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then suggested that a deposition would be the “best way” to glean information “for the only person that can restore rights.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court made no decision on the merits of the interlocutory appeal. From there, the Readmission Act case could potentially continue to be discussed and advance closer to a ruling. </span></p>

(Scott Olson/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the aftermath of the recent </span><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/georgia-school-shooting-suspect-gun-backpack-hid-bathroom/story?id=113622880" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">school shooting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Winder, Georgia, that left four students and teachers dead, and the threats of violence made online in various Virginia school districts, the NAACP Virginia State Conference has pushed for increased action on social media education, mental health services and a renewed commitment to addressing racism and inequality in public schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No student should live in fear of attending school, nor should any student be the target of racially motivated hatred,” the Rev. Cozy Bailey, the group’s president, said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We call on school districts, state leaders, and policymakers to prioritize expanding both mental health services and DEI initiatives in schools. These efforts are not mutually exclusive but critical to building inclusive and supportive environments where all students feel safe and valued,” Bailey said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Virginia has been spared a fatal school shooting since November 2022, when three people were killed and two others were injured in </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/12/26/uva-shooting-timeline-what-happened/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a mass shooting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the University of Virginia, online threats continue to disrupt school operations and scare parents and students. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just last week, the Harrisonburg Police Department </span><a href="https://www.dnronline.com/places/local/rockingham_county/harrisonburg/harrisonburg-teen-arrested-after-posting-shooting-threat-on-social-media/article_1bf1d0aa-3d4c-58a6-9b99-29b6af85bba6.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">arrested</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a 16-year-old male suspected of making violent threats against other students. The arrest was the result of an investigation into the threats posted to social media on Sept. 15, which resulted in both Harrisonburg High School and Rocktown High School closing the next day as a matter of precaution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/us/school-shootings-fast-facts-dg/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent report by CNN</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there have been 50 school shootings this year in the United States. While this is lower than last year’s 82 school shootings, if patterns move as they have historically, a dramatic uptick is to be expected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While addressing school security is critical, the Virginia NAACP stresses that a comprehensive strategy is needed to tackle not only gun control but also the mental health crisis facing youth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This strategy must also confront the harmful effects of racism that persist in educational settings and has motivated racial issues that the Virginia NAACP regularly receives reports about, the organization said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The rise in violent threats demonstrates the pressing need for DEI programs and inclusive curriculums that can address these systemic issues and create inclusive school environments. Calls to dismantle DEI efforts ignore the reality of the continued presence of racism in schools, where marginalized students are often most vulnerable,” the statement said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bailey, the group’s president, added that the mental health and safety of Virginia’s school children must remain a top priority.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia NAACP further called for collaboration between local governments, law enforcement, community organizations, and educational institutions to ensure that schools are not only secure but equipped to confront both mental health challenges and the ongoing issue of racial discrimination.</span></p>

(Courtesy of Ben Crump Law)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A newly released report by the disAbility Law Center of Virginia (dLCV) reveals that the death of Irvo Otieno, who </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-03-29/irvo-otieno-henrico-county-funeral" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">was killed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Central State Hospital in Dinwiddie County during a mental health crisis while in police custody last year, could have been prevented had sheriff’s deputies and hospital staff not used prone restraint, a controversial method of subduing individuals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a presentation of the findings before the House Appropriations Committee at the state Capitol in Richmond Tuesday, Colleen Miller, the dLCV’s executive director, urged lawmakers to end the criminalization of mental illness, remove law enforcement from the state’s response to people with mental health episodes and address the conditions in Virginia’s jails, where thousands of inmates with mental illness are being kept.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is serious reform needed in Virginia, because the events that happened to Mr. Otieno resulted in his death, and it got a lot of media attention. But people with mental illness are encountering these issues every single day in Virginia, and we need to do something about it,” Miller told the panel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otieno, a 28-year-old man with a history of mental health challenges, died on March 6, 2023, after being transported from the Henrico County Jail to Central State Hospital. The dLCV confirmed that sheriff’s deputies and hospital staff’s use of prone restraint — a technique where an individual is held face down — was a key factor in Otieno’s death. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The thing that led to his death, the prone restraint, is prohibited in our state facilities, and yet at Central State Hospital he was placed face down, people piled on top of him, and it killed him. So we really need to think about how to eliminate the prone restraint,” Miller said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ten Henrico County deputies and hospital workers were </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/irvo-otieno-killed-deputies-charged-virginia-hospital-ed9d227abea1bfa6946aa7cade5ced8b" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">initially charged</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with second-degree murder in Otieno’s death, which was captured on video. But prosecutors later asked a Dinwiddie Circuit Court judge </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/irvo-otieno-hospital-death-criminal-charges-dropped-b1b6cf44a3c6a33a37a69e657cc821c8" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to dismiss</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the charges against seven of the accused. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investigation by the dLCV, a non-profit designated by the federal government as the protection and advocacy organization for people with disabilities in Virginia, also found that while jailed in Henrico’s Regional Jail West for three days after suffering a mental health episode, Otieno was subjected to hours — possibly days — in an emergency restraint chair, and the jail failed to provide him with any psychiatric treatment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A restraint chair all by itself can be very dangerous, you are kind of caved in on yourself while you are in that chair, making it difficult to breathe. The correctional restraints require that someone be restrained only as long as necessary, while they are acting out,” Miller said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From Otieno’s initial encounter with police and the hospital emergency room to his incarceration and transfer to Central State Hospital, the </span><a href="https://www.dlcv.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IO-Public-Report-8.19.24-Near-Final.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">27-page report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> details “a complete breakdown of Virginia’s mental health crisis system, compounded by a culture of criminalizing individuals with mental illness, particularly communities of color.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The system that was supposed to help Otieno “utterly and completely failed him,” the investigation concluded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Mark Sickles, D-Fairfax, the committee’s vice chair, called the report “disturbing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve been trying to work on this area, and law enforcement is getting training in many places,” Sickles said. “Maybe it’s not uniform, I don’t know what happened in Henrico, but they are training law enforcement every day in dealing with people who have serious mental illness, and they need the appropriate training.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sickles emphasized the ongoing struggle to fill positions for mental health workers in Virginia, despite the legislature’s approval of additional funding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don’t have professional staffers, we are trying to fund psychiatric residencies, there is a shortage of all these mental health workers. We would hire them, we have openings,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sickles also pointed to housing shortages as a significant barrier, noting that many patients remain in hospitals longer than necessary due to a lack of community housing options. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They shouldn’t be in these situations, and we are working on this,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Rodney Willett, D-Henrico, called Otieno’s death a “tragedy on every level.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Willett is the sponsor of </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB1242" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 1242</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, also dubbed Irvo’s Law, that the General Assembly passed earlier this year. The measure allows family members and caregivers to access loved ones who are in crisis during their emergency room evaluations, unless the presence of a family member would create a medical or safety risk or if the patient objects to their presence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Irvo’s mom never got the chance to provide that information,” Willett said. “It’s such an unfortunate situation, and it’s also unfortunate that we need to have these terrible situations to inspire action. But we already took action before Irvo’s terrible death, and we are certainly going to take more.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislature this year also backed Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2023/december/name-1018721-en.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right help, right now”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> initiative, which marked a major investment in building emergency room alternatives to care for patients experiencing a behavioral health crisis, among other measures to address mental health challenges in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Del. Delores McQuinn, D-Richmond, said that Virginia’s jails, police and sheriff’s departments still are not equipped to deal with situations involving mental health episodes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I talk often to my sheriffs in Richmond and Henrico County about these issues, and they are overloaded with individuals who have mental health challenges, and they really don’t have a clue of what to do with them,” McQuinn said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is something that all of us must get to the table and bring some greater resolution to this, and I don’t think it’s going to happen swiftly, it’s going to be some years to get where we are trying to go.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The timeline of the dLCV’s investigation shows the importance of removing law enforcement from mental health treatment, said Miller, the group’s executive director. “Everything that law enforcement is trained to do is contrary to what is necessary for a mental health response. They are trained to be intimidating, to be tough, to never retreat.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers and stakeholders “should do some hard thinking” about how to protect people and help them get the treatment that they need,” Miller concluded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have seen different places throughout the timeline where Mr. Otieno was determined to need medical and mental health care and was prevented from getting that, time and time again.” </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A years-long legal battle has entered a new chapter as residents of Brown Grove, a </span><a href="https://www.dhr.virginia.gov/historic-registers/042-5802/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">historically</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Black neighborhood in Hanover County, and a neighboring subdivision, have filed their response as part of the appeal in their case against the county’s board of supervisors and Wegmans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the national grocery chain was granted approval by the county’s board four years ago to build a large distribution center, it’s been beset by legal challenges ever since. The residents’ initial lawsuit was dismissed by Hanover Circuit Court; it has now landed in the Court of Appeals of Virginia. This is because last year, the Supreme Court of Virginia reversed the circuit court’s decision and deemed the residents had the right to challenge the supervisors’ decision.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="xaMFx3hOaR"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/05/12/supreme-court-of-virginia-says-it-wont-reconsider-wegmans-decision/">Supreme Court of Virginia says it won’t reconsider Wegmans decision</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Supreme Court of Virginia says it won’t reconsider Wegmans decision&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/05/12/supreme-court-of-virginia-says-it-wont-reconsider-wegmans-decision/embed/#?secret=NlHaUQUZQv#?secret=xaMFx3hOaR" data-secret="xaMFx3hOaR" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In their suit, a group of local residents ask the court to declare the permissions for the project void based on claims that county officials violated state and local laws when granting Wegmans a special permit and an exception to local zoning ordinances that allowed the development of a 1.1 million square foot distribution center to proceed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though advance notice was published in a local newspaper ahead of the planned vote, the residents’ indicate that there was no specification about a cap on public comment registrations and restrictions on how many people could have physical access to the board room to observe the proceedings. They also challenge that the Wegman’s project was not an “essential” government function — as outlined in a local ordinance established for continuity of governance during that early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, by the time the limited public hearing took place, new proffers related to the project  were put up for discussion, rather than the documents that some residents had been able to provide virtual commentary on beforehand, the suit states. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title15.2/chapter22/article7/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">State law outlines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> how zoning changes — which is what an earlier part of the project needed to continue —  must give adjoining property owners written notice of the request for modification, and an opportunity to respond to the request within 21 days of the date of the notice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It wasn’t ‘in the dark of night’ with it happening at around 2:00 p.m., but it was effectively in the dark of night,” said Rod Morgan, a plaintiff in the case. “When you combine proffers submitted illegally with lack of access for the public, that’s a real issue.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as Morgan and his neighbors have filed a brief, other groups have filed an amicus brief in response to the case as well. The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Chamber of Commerce, Virginia Economic Developers Association, Associated General Contractors of Virginia and others jointly filed a brief defending Wegman’s and Hanover’s board. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That brief said that Wegman’s proffer was submitted before the 21-day deadline, but that the company continued to work with local government on refinements that led to the new proffer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As is customary with these types of applications, Wegmans continued to work with the Board, County officials, and the public to address their comments and further revise </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the proffers,” the brief read. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also notes another part of state code regarding zoning changes that allow for amended proffers to be accepted once a public hearing has already begun should the amendments “not materially affect the overall proposal.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In defense of the county and Wegmans, the brief also said that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">if the court doesn’t side with Hanover County’s board, it “will create disastrous results for localities throughout the Commonwealth and significantly impede economic development in Virginia.”</span></p>
<p>Wegmans and the Hanover County Board of Supervisors did not respond to request for comment on this article.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">History and the present</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than a local land use dispute, the placement of the development and pushback it garnered recalls the industrial encroachment or diminishment of historically Black neighborhoods in previous years, when Black people were disenfranchised in society.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other examples exist in Virginia, such as how</span><a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/charlottesville-officially-apologizes-for-razing-vinegar-hill/article_83b8aed4-2f4a-5ee2-baaa-2e7c9d43c2b0.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Charlottesville’s city council voted to raze Vinegar Hill in the 1960s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or how </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-03-07/reconnect-jackson-ward-interstate-95-cap-grant" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I-95 cut through Richmond’s Jackson Ward</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — a “</span><a href="https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/jackson-ward-and-its-black-wall-street.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Wall Street</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” in the south. I-95 also halved Brown Grove around that time as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now the once-contiguous community is sprinkled with a municipal airport, an industrial park, a landfill, concrete plants, and an I-95 truck stop. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown Grove first took shape from formerly enslaved people following the Civil War — just miles away from Richmond, Virginia’s state capital and the former capital of the Confederacy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flash forward to present day, and Brown Grove native Renada Harris lives near several of her family members as land has passed from generation to generation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s what makes our community unique,” she said. “You don’t see a lot of communities (of color) like this still intact.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said that communities that have historically been oppressed “are seen as not as likely to fight.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She and others founded the Brown Grove Preservation Group a few years ago. Through learning more about local and state laws, she said, neighbors were more equipped to advocate for themselves. The group also had support from the NAACP, Virginia’s chapter of the Sierra Club, and the Virginia Poverty Law Center. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to organizing efforts, Harris said there had been a defeatist attitude among some of her neighbors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They said ‘Those white people in Hanover are going to do what they want to do anywhere,’” Harris said both her Black and white neighbors would communicate.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as the mostly-white neighbors in the subdivision nearby Brow Grove began to be frustrated with Hanover County’s handling of the Wegmans development, deeper neighborhood alliances were formed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Harris is not one of the plaintiffs, she said the lawsuit is important. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m glad it’s out of Hanover County’s hands at this point,” she said. “Because I don’t think it would get a fair trial.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brian Buniva, the residents’ attorney who somewhat came out of retirement for this case four years ago, didn’t think at 73 years old, he’d still be defending it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In all these years my clients have not been able to be heard in court on merits, it’s all been through demurrers and motions to dismiss and delays and so on,” he said. “Well, we’re not going away.”</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin announces an initiative to support formerly incarcerated people as they re-enter society in Richmond on Aug. 15, 2024. Charlotte Rene Woods / Virginia Mercury</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin formally announced a cross-agency strategy to support formerly incarcerated people after their release. <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/eo/EO-36-Establishing-The-Stand-Tall---Stay-Strong---Succeed-Together-Reenetry-Initiative---FINAL.pdf" target="_blank">Executive Order 36</a> directs several state departments to coordinate with each other on data sharing and programming and to bolster partnerships with organizations for programming. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s no magic wand,” Youngkin said of a single method to improve post-incarceration experiences. “It’s a comprehensive collection of initiatives and relationships.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was joined by cabinet members, his wife Suzanne, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, Attorney General Jason Miyares and formerly incarcerated people who shared stories of getting back on their feet. The goal, they said of the initiative, is to help people become less likely to commit a crime and instead find success in the workplace and their home lives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin said that when people who have been released from jail or prison end up back in prison, “it reminds us that we must do better.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin said the initiative can help people with employment, healthcare access, mental health resources and substance abuse treatment, and “appropriate supervision levels.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Measures also include implementing a statewide partnership between the Department of Corrections and Virgnia’s Community College System and exploring increased opportunities to utilize Pell Grants for people behind bars to earn degrees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The expansion of access to Virginia’s Community Colleges and intentional efforts to stimulate workforce readiness are hallmarks of striving to build systems of restorative justice,” Rev. Linwood Blizzard said in a statement. The reverend is a board member with the Virginia Interfaith Center for Public Policy, which has praised government efforts to support incarcerated people and their families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While calling Youngkin’s re-entry strategy “a good first step,” Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, criticized the governor for rescinding previous administrations’ automatic restoration of voting rights. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around the time Youngkin said his administration began testing out the efforts outlined in the new executive order — April 2023 — he’d also adjusted the restoration of rights process. Once an automatic process upon completing a sentence, people now must apply with little knowledge of criteria for being granted or denied. </span><a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/local/virginia/virginians-whose-rights-have-been-restored-drops-in-second-year-of-youngkin-administration-reports-show/291-fbe59fc9-c488-4449-be3e-ad4c0ba1c374" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Restoration numbers have dropped</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during Youngkin’s tenure compared to three previous governors that had streamlined the process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His administration has also pushed back over laws to expand earned sentence tax credits, which incarcerated people can earn through good behavior and completing programs to shorten their time behind bars. The state’s new budget allowed the credits to be </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/10/groups-and-families-celebrate-implementation-of-law-allowing-early-release-for-certain-inmates/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully implemented</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The state’s supreme court also ruled in favor of a man who’d served longer time despite earning credits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Supreme Court this past year was very clear on the current sentence credits, and so we&#8217;re fully complying,” Youngkin said Thursday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, he reported that efforts already underway from his initiative have helped 3,000 formerly incarcerated people find work and helped 7,000 people get health insurance. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frank Carillo, a 66-year-old from Winchester, was arrested last week at his home after authorities said they traced a series of posts on the conservative-leaning social media site Gettr back to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris, who is now the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, was mentioned 19 times in the posts allegedly written by Carillo under the username “joemadarats1.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Harris is going to regret ever trying to become president because if that ever happened I will personally pluck out her eyes with a pair of pliers but first I will shoot and kill everyone that gets in my way that is a f****** promise,” read one of thousands of posts from the account that targeted public officials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another post said “I HAVE MY AR-15 LOCKED AND LOADED.” Authorities said they seized an AR-15 rifle, a pistol and “thousands of rounds of ammunition” from Carillo’s home during a search carried out Aug. 2.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carillo told federal authorities he had purchased the rifle in February. He also indicated during the search that he was the one who had made the online comments that had drawn the attention of the Secret Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, according to federal court documents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal law makes it a crime to threaten the president or anyone in the line of succession to the presidency. The offense is punishable by up to five years in prison.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Open political discourse is a cornerstone of our American experience. We can disagree. We can argue and we can debate. However, when those disagreements cross the line to threats of violence, law enforcement must step in,” Western District U.S. Attorney Christopher R. Kavanaugh said in a news release announcing the case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Threats of violence against political figures have been a heightened concern this summer following the July 13 assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump, who is now competing against Harris after President Joe Biden abandoned his bid for a second presidential term.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several of the alarming posts from the Gettr account linked to Carillo were made on July 27, almost one week after Biden dropped out of the race.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carillo made an initial court appearance Monday and remains in federal custody, court documents show. Another hearing in the case is scheduled for Thursday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Efforts to reach Carillo’s court-appointed attorney were unsuccessful Monday.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The case dealing with asset forfeiture laws centers on the legal hoops Virginians have to jump through in court to argue they should get their money back after law enforcement officials take it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State law allows authorities to seize money and other assets suspected of being connected to drug trafficking or other criminal activity, but gives people who had their assets taken a chance to argue those suspicions are unfounded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dispute over the ruling in Chesterfield was largely about a procedural technicality, but it highlights the hurdles people can face when trying to argue the government wrongfully took their money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of a drug operation in 2020, Chesterfield authorities seized money from an auto shop owned by Roger McMillian. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A small amount of drugs was found on the second floor of the business where McMillian lived, court records show, and he was ultimately convicted of a drug possession offense. Another man arrested in connection to the case at a different location pleaded guilty to a drug distribution charge, according to court documents. But McMillian argued the cash police took from the business was legitimate and had no connection to drug dealing, money laundering or other crimes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though state law gave McMillian the right to fight the asset seizure in court, a Chesterfield judge ruled that his six legal filings were insufficient and dismissed his effort to reclaim the money without holding a trial. The court’s order in February of 2023 allowed local officials to keep the cash and said Chesterfield police could use it for “law enforcement purposes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his filing arguing the money should be returned, McMilllian said about $31,000 came from the sales of several vintage vehicles, two carports, a shed and an above-ground pool. The rest of it, he contended, came from customers of the auto body shop who paid in cash.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, the Chesterfield commonwealth’s attorney’s office claimed all McMillian’s responses were faulty because they didn’t include concrete evidence of those transactions apart from McMillian’s sworn statements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chesterfield Circuit Court Judge Edward A. Robbins Jr. agreed, ruling last year that McMillian had failed to make a legally proper claim to the money. The court issued a default judgment allowing the government to keep the cash, but McMillian appealed that decision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The appellate court decided McMillian was right, ruling the Chesterfield judge had incorrectly sided with prosecutors who insisted state law didn’t allow McMillian to fight the asset seizure unless his initial court filing included harder evidence like a bank statement, bill of sale or check register.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The examples of evidence listed by the circuit court all constitute exhibits, but exhibits are only one type of evidence that a litigant may use to ultimately prove his case at trial,” Judge Randolph A. Beales wrote in the appellate opinion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McMillian’s sworn statement about the money’s origins, Beales wrote, should have been enough to prevent the lower court from ruling against him without a trial to examine the case further.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The appellate court sent the case back to the Chesterfield court “to hold a trial on the merits of the forfeiture of these assets if the Commonwealth wishes to so proceed to a trial.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final outcome of the case is unclear. The lack of a trial also meant Chesterfield authorities didn’t have to put forward all evidence they might have disputing McMillian’s explanation of where the money came from.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McMillian’s attorney, John Mann, said his client was “pleased with the ruling.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It tells the circuit courts what is required of a person who’s contesting the order,” Mann said. “You don’t have to attach documents and things like that. You can make a good faith statement.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chesterfield commonwealth’s attorney’s office, which pushed for the default judgment against McMillian, said it could not comment on the ruling Wednesday because the prosecutor who handled the case was tied up with other business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Juli M. Porto, an attorney with the Blankingship &amp; Keith law firm who follows appellate decisions, said the ruling could result in fewer asset forfeitures in cases where the accused has a “meritorious defense.” A clearer standard for what counts as a sufficient response to an asset forfeiture, she said, means more cases could be decided on the merits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A clear standard is good for all involved — defendants, the Commonwealth, and trial courts — because there is less room for confusion and disparate decisions on the same issue,” Porto said in an email. “Consistent rulings are in everyone’s best interests.”</span></p>

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)</p><p>A federal appellate court has upheld blocking central parts of new Title IX rules from the Biden administration and granted an expedited hearing in October.</p>
<p>A three-judge panel of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals <a href="https://www.ag.ky.gov/Press%20Release%20Attachments/DN%2041%20Order%20Denying%20Partial%20Stay.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agreed Wednesday </a>to block the rules from taking effect Aug. 1, shortly before most schools begin their academic year. The rules, created by the U.S. Department of Education, were aimed at protecting students from discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation.</p>
<p>Chief Judge Jeffrey Sutton wrote in the majority opinion that all judges on the panel agreed the central parts of the rules should not take effect on Aug. 1.</p>
<p>“It is hard to see how all of the schools covered by Title IX could comply with this wide swath of new obligations if the Rule’s definition of sex discrimination remains enjoined,” Sutton said. “Harder still, we question how the schools could properly train their teachers on compliance in this unusual setting with so little time before the start of the new school year.”</p>
<p>Judge Andre Mathis wrote in a dissenting opinion that he would grant a partial stay, as requested by the Department of Education. “I am cognizant of Plaintiffs’ argument that the benefits of enacting the Rule’s unchallenged provisions are outweighed by the expense or confusion of phased implementation,” Mathis wrote. “But most of the expense is attributable to provisions that Plaintiffs neither directly challenge nor cite as a source of harm.”</p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed by Republican attorneys general in six states — Kentucky, Virginia, Indiana, Ohio, Tennessee and West Virginia.</p>
<p>Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman said in a statement that Title IX, which was established more than 50 years ago, “created equal opportunities for women and young girls in the classroom and on the field.” The Sixth Circuit ruling, he added, made it the first appellate court “to stop President Biden’s blatant assault on these fundamental protections.”</p>
<p>“This ruling is a victory for common sense itself, and it’s a major relief for Kentucky families,” Coleman said. “As Attorney General and as a Dad, we’ll keep up the fight for my girls and for women across Kentucky so they can continue to fulfill their potential for the next 50 years and beyond.”</p>
<p>In June, <a href="https://kentuckylantern.com/2024/06/17/us-judge-in-kentucky-blocks-biden-title-ix-rules-says-sex-gender-identity-not-the-same-thing/" target="_blank">Chief Judge Danny Reeves</a> of the U.S. District Court in Eastern Kentucky sided with Coleman and the other five GOP attorneys general. The judge said the Department of Education “seeks to derail deeply rooted law” with its proposed Title IX rules.</p>
<p>“At bottom, the Department would turn Title IX on its head by redefining ‘sex’ to include ‘gender identity.’ But ‘sex’ and ‘gender identity’ do not mean the same thing,” Reeves wrote. “The Department’s interpretation conflicts with the plain language of Title IX and therefore exceeds its authority to promulgate regulations under that statute.”</p>
<p>Established in 1972, <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/tix_dis.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Title IX</a> was created to prevent “discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities that receive federal financial assistance,” according to the Department of Education.</p>
<p>The Biden administration introduced the rules to “build on the legacy of Title IX by clarifying that all our nation’s students can access schools that are safe, welcoming, and respect their rights,” U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona previously said in a statement. The rules also <a href="https://kentuckylantern.com/2024/04/19/biden-administration-to-roll-back-the-betsy-devos-title-ix-rules/" target="_blank">would have rolled back Trump administration changes</a> that narrowly defined sexual harassment and directed schools to conduct live hearings, allowing those who were accused of sexual harassment or assault to cross-examine their accusers.</p>
<p>The Lantern has sought comment from the U.S. Department of Education on the latest ruling.</p>

Charlotte Rene Woods / Virginia Mercury</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Santia Nance and Quadaire Patterson’s love story is entering a new chapter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A law took effect last week that allowed certain incarcerated people to be released from prison for acquiring earned sentence credits. Patterson is now also earning good fiance points by “doing every dish” in the house since he moved out of prison and in with Nance. The couple’s long-fought-for chapter entailed years of political advocacy and maintaining hope. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Opportunity is nothing without hope,” Patterson said as one of the featured speakers during a press conference at Virginia’s Capitol on Tuesday. “I relish the opportunity to be able to represent the incarcerated and all of my reentering brothers.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He and Nance had gathered at Virginia’s Capitol on Tuesday with various prison reform advocacy organizations and Democratic lawmakers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patterson was among people to be released last week. July 1 is when new laws typically take effect each year, but in this case, a four-year-old law was finally able to be implemented. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earned sentence credits are applied to shorten inmates’ time behind bars. Incarcerated people can achieve them through things like good behavior, participation in programs and seeking educational advancements. Prison reform advocates stress that earned sentence credits help incentivize rehabilitation so that families can be reunited sooner. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s legislature passed a law in 2020 that increased the number of credits inmates could earn and expanded it to people serving time for both violent and nonviolent offenses. It had a delayed start date for 2022, but that year Gov. Glenn Youngkin blocked its implementation through the state budget. It’s a law that Nance, through her work co-founding a group called Sistas iIn Prison Reform, has hoped for. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organizations like Sistas in Prison Reform continued to advocate for its implementation. Before his release Patterson kept his fellow inmates in the loop on legislative processes, and he was also able to connect with Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Alexandria. </span></p>

Charlotte Rene Woods / Virginia Mercury</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boysko carried the Senate version of the bill in 2020. Del. Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, had the House version — and his own lived experience as a formerly incarcerated person who has since gone on to become Virginia&#8217;s first Black Speaker of the House.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the Democratic-controlled legislature was able to get the earned sentence credits through this year’s budget with Youngkin’s signature, Republican resistance remains. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ahead of the celebratory gathering, Attorney General Jason Miyares issued a statement calling earned sentence credits a public safety risk. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe in redemption and am a strong proponent for helping our returning citizens re-enter society to live productive lives. However, aggressive retroactive sentence reductions for violent criminals with a high risk of recidivism undermines our justice system and disregards victims,” Miyares wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares also wrote a letter earlier this year to lawmakers urging them to keep Youngkin’s budget language in place that would have blocked implementation of the 2020 law. He has used the influence of his office to advocate against various other criminal justice reform efforts in the state’s legislature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boysko bucked Miyares’ characterization of the legislation at Tuesday’s event, saying he and some other Republicans want to “get everybody worked up into a frenzy” ahead of next year’s state legislative elections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Data shows that earned sentence credits help reduce recidivism, no matter what he says,” Boysko said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next year, all 100 seats in Virginia’s House of Delegates will be up for election and Virginians will elect a new governor. With criminal justice reform often a Democratic-led issue, partisan control of the House or governorship could determine what future bills might succeed or fail. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until then,  recently released Virginians will be settling back into their unincarcerated lives. Patterson will continue his education with the hope of eventually becoming a lawyer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wedding plans are also on the horizon. Nance is ecstatic about having Patterson home with her and how their shared passion for advocacy is intrinsic to their love story. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It really is a full circle moment to be standing here with him,” she said.</span></p>

Charlotte Rene Woods / Virginia Mercury</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Darryl Byers-Robinson choked up as he stood before a crowd of about 30 at Virginia&#8217;s Department of Corrections headquarters in Richmond on Monday with various advocacy groups and members of Virginia’s DOC. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The groups had gathered to celebrate the first year since the full reestablishment of eligibility for incarcerated people to receive Pell Grants. The grants, a federal subsidy for some qualifying undergraduate students, have not been applicable to incarcerated people for much of the past 30 years. That’s because the passage of the 1994 Violent Crime Bill made incarceration a disqualifier for Pell Grants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Byers-Robinson attributes his participation in a pilot program that allowed him to receive his associates degree as an example of how higher education can change someone’s life. His voice cracked and eyes watered as he recalled beginning his post-incarceration journey. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I remember the day when I got released — one of the things I held on tightly to in my folder was my degree,” Byers-Robinson said. “I knew it was going to give me an opportunity to do something powerful.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He has since gone on to serve as a pastor and public speaker. He’s also currently involved as an organizer with Virginia Interfaith Center for Public Policy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Byers-Robinson earned his degree by participating in the pilot program while incarcerated in New York through Bard College. Around that time in 2015, there were also four colleges in Virginia that had been part of a national Pell pilot program  through the U.S. Department of Education. Flash forward to July 2023, and Pell became fully accessible to people behind bars. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are currently 10 correctional facilities in Virginia that have established partnerships with community colleges for inmates to pursue associates or career technical education degrees with Pell Grants, as of July 1, 2024. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of colleges is expected to grow;  Virginia Wesleyan and Brightpoint Community College are currently going through the application process to partner with correctional facilities, officials said Monday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Rev. Kieth Jones, a Virginia Interfaith Center board member, and Virginia DOC director Chadwick Dotson noted the role that education plays in reducing recidivism.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The more education we can provide, the better outcomes are,” Dotson said of people being more prepared to find work and less likely to reoffend. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A January 2023 national study</span><a href="https://www.mackinac.org/30588" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that prison education programs reduced recidivism by about 15% while rates of employment for ex-offenders had increased about 7%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there’s still more work to be done, Dotson said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of that entails expanding high speed internet access for incarcerated students to be able to take advantage of virtual learning options through their colleges. Currently, students are limited to on-site classroom locations in their prisons. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allison Kroboth, a software engineer, Resilient Professional Community Manager  and former Fluvanna Correctional Center For Women inmate, recalled at Monday’s event the roundabout ways she had to retrieve research materials for coursework while earning her associates degree in 2013. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She had to fill out a form through her prison and then volunteers with Piedmont Virginia Community College would research the requested subjects that Kroboth would then have to pay 10 cents per page to get her hands on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That was a long process,” she said. “So we had to go about our assignments way in advance to make sure there was time for someone to get our research to us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dotson said that’s where investing in some on-site technology like tablets could help students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are there any legislators that want to toss us some money? We’ll use it for education, I promise,” Dotson said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, like Byers-Robinson, Kroboth used her degree to go into advocacy work for people with similar lived experiences to her. In addition to being a website engineer for Resilience Education, she is a mentorship program coordinator for the nonprofit that connects formerly incarcerated people seeking to use their degrees and reestablish their lives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a chance for these people “to come together and learn from each other,” Kroboth said of the mentorship programs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The significance of the moment wasn’t lost on Byers-Robinson, who was a featured speaker Monday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am standing here as an example for all of the people in prison,” he said.</span></p>

<p>States continued to diverge on gun policy this year, with especially intense debate in the swing states that will decide November’s election.</p>
<p>In Michigan, legislators are considering at least half a dozen gun bills that would create storage requirements and establish gun-free zones. In Pennsylvania, lawmakers are still debating measures that would ban sales of untraceable guns and gun parts, prohibit bump stocks and make some procedural changes related to gun purchases. Meanwhile, Republican legislators in Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina have sought to make it easier for people to procure guns and to carry them in more places.</p>
<p>This past week offered reminders of the continuing salience of guns in American life.</p>
<p>On June 14, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a 2018 rule — issued by the Trump administration — that banned bump stocks, which are attachments that transform semiautomatic rifles into weapons that can shoot hundreds of rounds per minute. The administration issued the rule after a gunman used semiautomatic rifles equipped with a bump stock device to kill 60 people and injure more than 500 others at a Las Vegas music festival.</p>
<p>And on Saturday, a gunman opened fire at a splash park in Rochester Hills, Michigan, injuring nine people — including two children. The violence came three years after a student opened fire at Oxford High School in the same county, killing four people and injuring seven.</p>
<p>Mass shootings that occur close to election seasons typically have a significant effect on the country’s perception of guns, according to experts.</p>
<p>“If there are any particularly horrendous shootings in the months to come, that has a way of pushing the issue back to the forefront of the agenda,” Robert Spitzer, a gun policy expert who has written six books and over 100 articles on gun policy, told Stateline.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and GOP candidates nationwide have made crime and public disorder main themes of their campaigns — even though most crime measurements are trending downward.</p>
<p>Gun policy has been a topic of debate for decades, but has become especially prominent as the number of gun-related deaths and mass shootings has <a href="https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/" target="_blank">grown almost every year</a> since 2014, according to the Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit group that tracks gun violence in the United States.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/513623/majority-continues-favor-stricter-gun-laws.aspx" target="_blank">Gallup poll</a> from October 2023 found that the majority of U.S. adults, or 56%, support stricter gun laws, while 31% think they should remain as they are and 12% prefer less strict laws. Meanwhile, a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/09/13/key-facts-about-americans-and-guns/" target="_blank">Pew Research Center survey</a> from June 2023 found that 60% of U.S. adults say gun violence is a major problem in this country.</p>
<p>Other states — including Colorado, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Ohio, Oregon, Virginia, Washington and West Virginia — also considered gun-related legislation this year.</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Electoral impact</h4>

	</h4>
<p>Voters who support gun rights are often highly mobilized and consistently turn out at the polls because of their strong personal connections to firearms, according to politics and gun policy experts.</p>
<p>In contrast, voters who support gun safety measures are harder to mobilize because they are more likely to prioritize other issues, such as the economy or foreign policy.</p>
<p>“A small but highly motivated minority can often win the day politically over a large but fairly apathetic majority,” said Spitzer, an emeritus professor of political science at the State University of New York at Cortland and an adjunct at the William &amp; Mary Law School. “That’s kind of the short version of how you explain what’s been going on in gun politics in America.”</p>
<p>Extensive academic research and numerous studies can support either side of the gun policy debate. Politicians will use whatever data or studies that best support their platforms, according to political communications experts.</p>
<p>For example, left-leaning Democratic politicians often cite studies suggesting a correlation between stricter gun policies and lower crime rates, according to Jacob Neiheisel, a political science professor at the University at Buffalo.</p>
<p>But gun rights think tanks and organizations also produce research supporting their position, including the claim that crime rates drop when more people carry guns, Neiheisel added.</p>
<p>Experts stress that, regardless of party or position on gun policy, it’s important for people to understand how the data was collected and to be aware of potential biases.</p>
<p>For example, politicians <a href="https://stateline.org/2023/10/27/politicians-love-to-cite-crime-data-its-often-wrong/" target="_blank">often rely</a> on annual national crime and victimization data produced by the FBI, but these datasets measure crime differently — a fact that is not always well understood by politicians or voters.</p>
<p>This allows some politicians to lean on the sources that best support their arguments on gun policy, said Alex Piquero, a criminology professor at the University of Miami and former director of the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics.</p>
<p>“It’s not that the data are wrong. It’s not that the data lie. It’s just that there are different data measuring different things,” Piquero said. “But if the average person doesn’t know that or doesn’t take the time to understand … then they are an ill-educated voting populace.”</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Campuses and polling places</h4>

	</h4>
<p>In Michigan, legislators are considering at least half a dozen gun bills, including measures that would establish firearm storage requirements and prohibit guns in certain state-owned buildings and within 100 feet of polling places, drop boxes, early voting sites and absentee ballot counting boards.</p>
<p>“Being that we don’t want firearms at polls or counting boards is very reasonable and very much needed in the spirit of promoting democracy — allowing people to cast their votes without fear of intimidation,” said Democratic state Rep. Penelope Tsernoglou, one of the sponsors of the elections-related gun bills, in an interview with Stateline.</p>
<p>Tsernoglou said she expects both bills to pass this session. While they have already cleared the House and Senate, the bills await another vote in the House before advancing further. The legislature adjourns in December.</p>
<p>The Wisconsin state legislature, now adjourned, considered a handful of gun bills during its session. One <a href="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2023/proposals/sb466" target="_blank">bill</a> sought to prohibit credit card companies from mandating specific merchant category codes for firearms retailers and prevent governmental entities from compiling lists of firearm owners based on background checks. This bill passed the legislature, but was <a href="https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/WIGOV/2024/03/29/file_attachments/2831164/SB%20466%20Veto%20Message%20for%20Signature.pdf" target="_blank">vetoed</a> by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers in March.</p>
<p>Another proposed <a href="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2023/proposals/sb982" target="_blank">bill</a> in Wisconsin sought to ban firearms in buildings or on the grounds of publicly or privately owned colleges and universities in the state. This bill did not advance in the legislature, but Democratic state Sen. Kelda Roys, the bill’s lead sponsor, plans to reintroduce it during the next legislative session.</p>
<p>“We have now a whole generation of young people that have grown up with this horrible specter of gun violence following them through their education,” Roys said.</p>
<p>In Georgia, a <a href="https://www.legis.ga.gov/legislation/66265" target="_blank">measure</a> that bans firearm purchase tracking was signed into law in April and will go into effect in July.</p>
<p>A proposed <a href="https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/56leg/2R/bills/SB1198S.htm" target="_blank">bill</a> in Arizona would have allowed people with valid concealed carry permits to carry firearms on university and college campuses.</p>
<p>Another Arizona <a href="https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/56leg/2R/bills/SB1189S.htm" target="_blank">bill</a> under consideration would have prohibited local governments from restricting or banning gun shows within their respective jurisdictions. The Arizona legislature has adjourned, and neither bill advanced.</p>
<p>State legislators in Pennsylvania are still considering at least six gun bills, all of which would further restrict gun purchases and ownership. Some of these bills would <a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/billinfo.cfm?syear=2023&amp;sInd=0&amp;body=H&amp;type=B&amp;bn=336" target="_blank">ban</a> future sales of assault weapons, <a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/BillInfo.cfm?syear=2023&amp;sind=0&amp;body=H&amp;type=B&amp;bn=777" target="_blank">outlaw</a> the purchase, sale and production of untraceable guns and gun parts, and <a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/BillInfo.cfm?syear=2023&amp;sind=0&amp;body=H&amp;type=B&amp;bn=1157" target="_blank">reduce</a> the time judges have to notify the state police about people with mental health records from a week to about four days for background checks.</p>
<p>While some of these bills have <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/gun-violence/gun-safety-bills-fail-in-pa-house-by-razor-thin-margin/" target="_blank">failed</a> in the House, the Pennsylvania legislature adjourns at the end of November, so there may be more activity closer to the upcoming election.</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Permitless carry</h4>

	</h4>
<p>State legislators in North Carolina may consider at least two gun-related bills this session, with sponsors planning to reintroduce and garner support for their proposals.</p>
<p>One <a href="https://www.ncleg.gov/BillLookUp/2023/H189" target="_blank">bill</a> would make North Carolina the 30th state to allow permitless concealed carry or “constitutional carry,” meaning it would be legal to carry a concealed firearm without a permit.</p>
<p>The bill’s supporters point to FBI data in arguing for the measure.</p>
<p>“Crime rates go down when you have armed citizens. There’s no doubt about that. The FBI holds that up time and time again,” said Republican state Rep. Keith Kidwell, one of the bill’s sponsors, in an interview with Stateline.</p>
<p>The gun rights group Grass Roots North Carolina is pushing for the supermajority Republican legislature to pass the bill, arguing that there has been no increase in violent crime in any of the states that have adopted constitutional carry.</p>
<p>In North Carolina, people are no longer required to apply for a pistol purchase permit from a sheriff, but they must still go through the sheriff for a concealed carry license. Grass Roots North Carolina would like to see the state enact a constitutional carry bill to remove this requirement.</p>
<p>“We are particularly interested in passing [the bill] to make sure that we can keep some of these urban sheriffs from obstructing people from carrying concealed firearms for self-protection,” said Paul Valone, the group’s president, in an interview with Stateline.</p>
<p>The other <a href="https://www.ncleg.gov/BillLookup/2023/H281" target="_blank">bill</a> would establish a so-called red flag law in North Carolina. At least 21 other states and the District of Columbia have similar laws, which typically allow a judge to take someone’s firearms away if they are deemed to be a harm to themselves or others.</p>
<p>Many gun rights groups argue that red flag laws infringe on Second Amendment rights and the right to due process.</p>
<p>“I don’t care which right it is, you don’t take away people’s rights without the due process of law,” Kidwell said, adding that he will work to prevent the bill from advancing.</p>
<p>Democratic state Rep. Marcia Morey, a former judge and the bill’s lead sponsor, told Stateline in an interview that the bill includes specific protections to prevent any infringement on due process rights.</p>
<p>“It’s just about keeping people safe, and the safety, I think, preempts any right to possess a gun,” she said.</p>

<p>This type of act – a form of fraud that can be illegal – is <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/prolific-ads-featuring-wing-icons-push-questionable-claims/story?id=85365286" target="_blank">rare nationwide but common in some places</a>, local and federal officials have said.</p>
<p>For instance, in 2023, a New Mexico man allegedly <a href="https://www.abqjournal.com/news/local/paper-terrorism-what-is-it-and-why-is-a-man-named-trapper-killsmany-behind-bars/article_c52b78e6-4d3a-5dc0-8f22-1f436cf1d069.html" target="_blank">filed a US$20 million lien against property</a> owned by federal employees he believed were connected with the termination of his Social Security benefits. All told, he has <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/66897081/14/united-states-v-killsmany/" target="_blank">allegedly filed $1 billion in false liens</a> against federal employees.</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors have charged him with <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/66897081/united-states-v-killsmany/" target="_blank">retaliating against a federal employee by making a false claim</a>. Court documents identify the man as a sovereign citizen who describes himself as a “<a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/66897081/14/united-states-v-killsmany/" target="_blank">private attorney general</a>.” He is awaiting trial.</p>
<h2>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">More violent threats</h4>

<p>The FBI considers sovereign citizens a <a href="https://leb.fbi.gov/articles/featured-articles/sovereign-citizens-a-growing-domestic-threat-to-law-enforcement" target="_blank">domestic terrorism threat</a>.</p>
<p>In April 2024, a Utah man was <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/68455519/1/united-states-v-bracken/" target="_blank">charged in federal court with stalking</a> after allegedly telling staff at the Salt Lake County Recorder’s Office that they had committed treason and the penalty was death.</p>
<p>Court documents show that the man has identified himself as a “sovereign citizen” and made quasi-legal claims that <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/68455519/united-states-v-bracken/" target="_blank">prosecutors characterize as arguments commonly used by sovereign citizens</a> – claims that were dismissed by a judge as “<a href="https://sovereigncitizenwatch.com/2024/06/07/sovereign-citizen-stalking-case-unsealed/" target="_blank">frivolous and without merit</a>.” Trial is set to begin July 1, 2024.</p>

<p>Sovereign citizens have <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/77328/sovereign-citizens-more-than-paper-terrorists/" target="_blank">killed</a> police officers and <a href="https://lawandcrime.com/live-trials/live-trials-current/waukesha-parade-tragedy/after-trial-marred-by-constant-outbursts-jury-finds-darrell-brooks-guilty-of-murdering-six-people-in-waukesha-parade-attack/" target="_blank">civilians</a>. <a href="https://www.wpr.org/justice/darrell-brooks-found-guilty-all-charges-waukesha-parade-tragedy" target="_blank">Darrell Brooks</a>, who represented himself in court as a sovereign citizen, was found guilty in October 2022 of killing six people when he drove an SUV through a Christmas parade.</p>
<p>Dejaune Anderson, a <a href="https://www.whas11.com/article/news/crime/dejaune-anderson-cairo-jordan-boy-suitcase-body-indiana/417-d191ddac-b414-42d3-a2c0-11caaadd61d7" target="_blank">self-declared sovereign citizen</a>, is accused of neglecting her 5-year-old son so badly that he died of dehydration. Her <a href="https://www.whas11.com/article/news/local/indiana/dejaune-anderson-cairo-jordan-indiana-suitcase-boy-dead-court-new-motions/417-418f600e-130f-4bed-b480-22a1b1a458d0" target="_blank">trial is pending</a>.</p>
<p>Traffic stops <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.avb.2020.101509" target="_blank">can be especially dangerous for police</a> because sovereign citizens often will not comply with officers’ basic commands. At times, this tendency can lead to violence.</p>
<p>In April 2024, two police officers in Florida investigated a report of a man in a vehicle in a public park after the park’s closing time. The person identified himself as a “Moorish sovereign citizen,” a type of sovereign citizen who claims that <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/moorish-sovereign-citizens" target="_blank">people of African American descent are not subject to U.S. law</a> because of a <a href="https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-10-02-0292" target="_blank">1787 treaty between the U.S. and Morocco</a>, which says nothing of the sort.</p>
<p>During the confrontation that ensued, the man allegedly <a href="https://www.police1.com/sovereign-citizens/sovereign-citizen-shoots-wounds-2-fla-deputies-before-fatal-ois" target="_blank">shot and wounded the officers</a> before being killed by police.</p>
<h2>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A new subgroup</h4>

	</h2>
<p>Over the past several years, a new variation of sovereign citizens has emerged, known as <a href="https://www.police1.com/sovereign-citizens/american-state-nationals-the-newest-group-of-sovereign-citizens" target="_blank">American State Nationals</a>. <a href="https://doi.org/10.54208/1000/0006/006" target="_blank">In my research</a>, I learned that they have been congregating on social media and gathering at seminars. Their leaders teach traditional sovereign citizen ideology along with new methods that supposedly let them live outside the law.</p>
<p>For instance, leaders teach their followers that driver’s licenses, marriage licenses, Social Security cards, car registrations and voter registrations are “contracts with the government,” which to them form the basis for requirements that they obey laws.</p>
<p>American State Nationals are urged to cancel or rescind these documents by filling out a set of forms, which are sold by the seminar leaders for about $250, in addition to the $150 seminar fee. Then they are told to submit the documents to <a href="https://azcir.org/news/2023/09/11/sovereign-citizen-paperwork-pima-county/" target="_blank">county recorders</a> and even the U.S. State Department. They are told that doing so will remove them from the reach of the U.S. government.</p>

<p>Paul Grice, the fifth member of God’s Misfits to be arrested in that Oklahoma kidnapping and murder case, reportedly sent his <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2024/05/05/a-fifth-misfit-is-accused-of-murdering-two-kansas-women-last-year-he-declared-extremist-beliefs/" target="_blank">packet of paperwork</a> by certified mail to Antony Blinken, the U.S. secretary of state.</p>
<p>Perhaps paradoxically, American State Nationals are also told to acquire a federal document that group members call a “noncitizen national passport.” They believe this document gives them <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wMlUaoyoa_Ifn1H3ISHynp_WeNm4L2AV/view" target="_blank">many special privileges</a>, including no longer being a U.S. citizen and having immunity from U.S. laws. They believe this even though U.S. law applies to <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI-S8-C18-8-7-2/ALDE_00001262/" target="_blank">everyone within the borders of the U.S</a>.</p>
<p>In reality, this document does none of what they think it does. The document, officially called a “<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/us-citizenship/Certificates-Non-Citizen-Nationality.html" target="_blank">Certificate of Non Citizen Nationality</a>,” is really for use by people born in one of several U.S. possessions, such as American Samoa. Directly contrary to what sovereign citizens think, the document certifies that its bearer does “<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/us-citizenship/Certificates-Non-Citizen-Nationality.html" target="_blank">owe permanent allegiance to the United States</a>.”</p>
<p>Sovereign citizens’ beliefs have yet to hold up in any <a href="https://assets2.pacermonitor.com/gpo/USCOURTS-txsd-6_23-cv-00056/USCOURTS-txsd-6_23-cv-00056-0.pdf" target="_blank">court of law in the U.S.</a> or overseas. As an Australian law school lecturer said of a case involving a sovereign citizen in Australia, “<a href="https://www.sbs.com.au/news/the-feed/article/the-rise-of-sovereign-people-and-why-they-argue-laws-dont-apply-to-them/i2g9jij7g" target="_blank">No court in Australia, no court in the U.S., Canada, anywhere that I’ve seen</a>, has ever accepted the legal arguments raised by sovereign citizens.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While expansions to the program stemmed from a 2020 law, it had a delayed start date in 2022 that was later blocked by Gov. Glenn Youngkin through language in a previous state budget. A renewed attempt by the Youngkin administration to block the expansions this year did not make it through final negotiations in the budget that the governor and lawmakers agreed on this week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earned sentence credits allow incarcerated people to trim the length of time they serve behind bars; they earn the credits by completing various educational and training programs. The </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2020/10/26/thousands-of-virginia-prisoners-could-be-released-early-under-new-earned-sentence-credit-program/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expanded program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allows certain inmates to earn 15 days of credits for every 30 days served. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thanks to the new biennial budget, thousands of people will finally receive the credits they have worked for years to earn while in prison,” Chris Kaiser, a policy director at Virginia’s chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the governor’s attempts to block the expanded program, Republican lawmakers also previously sought to repeal the expansions unsuccessfully over the years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s ACLU </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/08/16/aclu-of-virginia-sues-department-of-corrections-over-earned-sentence-credits/#:~:text=Under%20a%202020%20law%20backed,for%20every%2030%20days%20served."><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sued the Department of Corrections </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">on behalf of inmates who had been expected to be among the first wave of people released in 2022, prior to Youngkin’s budget language that impeded the program. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin again </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+amd+HB30AG" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">included the language</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the budget for this year. His efforts were bolstered by Attorney General Jason Miyares, who wrote a </span><a href="https://www.oag.state.va.us/media-center/news-releases/2695-february-27-2024-attorney-general-miyares-urges-general-assembly-to-keep-limits-on-enhanced-earned-sentence-credits-citing-alarming-recidivism-data" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to lawmakers in support of keeping the limits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In it, Miyares argued that expanding the credit system “disregards past and future victims.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Allowing such a practice is not justice, and it’s not safe,” he wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advocates for the credits argue otherwise. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia is safer because we give incarcerated people an incentive to rehabilitate themselves,” Kaiser said in his recent statement following the budget passage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former ACLU policy strategist Shawn Weneta echoed Kaiser. He added that he and members of criminal justice reform organizations are pleased the 2020 law can take effect this July. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not the only change in state law that incarcerated people and their families might look forward to. Weneta and others worked with lawmakers in both parties to adjust Virginia’s parole board operations. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">More parole board transparency</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the earned sentence credit program can help eligible inmates reduce time spent behind bars, a limited scope of people can seek parole through approval by the state’s parole board. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If granted, people can serve the remainder of their sentences outside of prison as long as they meet with their parole officer and do not reoffend. Since Virginia </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/youngkin-parole-virginia-miyares/article_58778966-3d27-11ee-a7cb-a74460038cac.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">eliminated most parole in 1995, a limited number of people qualify </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">— such as elderly inmates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Virginia has had one of the lowest rates of </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/youngkin-parole-virginia-miyares/article_58778966-3d27-11ee-a7cb-a74460038cac.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">granting parole</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the country. In recent years the board has also had vacancies and lacked the quorum needed to grant certain parole petitions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Youngkin has not been quick to appoint people nor has the General Assembly been receptive to Youngkin’s appointments,” Weneta said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, new parole board chair Patricia West, a Youngkin appointee, had </span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/politics/capitol-connection/virginia-democrats-back-youngkins-parole-board-chair-after-moving-to-block-confirmation/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">originally been blocked </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">by a Senate committee earlier this year before the full Senate approved her appointment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, two laws will take effect on July 1 that could help the board operate amid future vacancies and allow increased public insight into its operations.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB913" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 913</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Del. Irene Shin, D-Fairfax, allows for the board to still vote to grant parole to petitioners if at least three of the four necessary members are present to do so. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1361#:~:text=The%20bill%20requires%20that%20parole,not%20received%20a%20live%20interview" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 1361</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Sen. Bryce Reeves, R-Spotsylvania and former Sen. Joe Morrissey, D-Richmond, will require the board to meet with petitioners in order to vote. Previously, inmates have not been present but now the board will vote on granting their petition or not through an in-person or virtual meeting. The law passed the legislature last year but had a delayed start date of July 1, 2024. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weneta said the new law can give petitioners and their families some peace of mind going through the process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, the law increases transparency by requiring the board to hold public hearings and publish more frequent and detailed reports on its decisions. </span></p>
<p>Reeves said he was first inspired to collaborate with Morrissey on the bill to increase transparency following a spike in parole releases at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. A <a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/miyares-says-it-is-too-late-to-prosecute-former-parole-board-chief/article_90e94a12-9ccf-11ed-ac74-cf26b9c98dc2.html" target="_blank">2023 report from Miyares&#8217; office</a> asserted that the Gov. Ralph Northam-era board had violated policy when releasing more people in that time, but that the statute of limitations had passed and the former chair of the board, Adrienne Bennett, could not be prosecuted.</p>
<p>Reeves said that he figured more insight into the board&#8217;s operations and decisions could benefit everyone, from parole petitioners, to victims of crime.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think transparency and daylight is probably the best thing we can do,&#8221; Reeves said.</p>
<p>He added that working on the bill in a bipartisan manner was a way to subdue the partisanship that has surrounded the parole board in recent years.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s I think what we did,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And I think that&#8217;s why it passed and I think that&#8217;s why people are comfortable with it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the 4,652 adults released from state prisons in 2022, the study shows 85% were enrolled in Medicaid within one month of their release. While 13%, or 514 of these adults had a diagnosis of opioid use disorder, only a quarter received medication treatment through Medicaid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By comparison, 78% of all Medicaid members with an opioid use disorder in state fiscal year 2021 received treatment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Based on national statistics, we expected more people to receive a diagnosis and treatment for opioid addiction,” said Dr. Peter Cunningham, the lead study researcher and interim chair of the Department of Health Policy at VCU’s School of Population Health. “This is concerning because having an undiagnosed, untreated opioid use disorder greatly increases the risk of overdose.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study is part of an ongoing evaluation with the Department of Medical Assistance Services to review the addiction recovery and treatment services program, a comprehensive benefit designed to provide substance use disorder treatment services to Medicaid members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Virginia expanded Medicaid in 2019, Cunningham said most adults being released from jails or prisons in the commonwealth qualify for coverage. However, delays in setting up a treatment plan and complications transitioning back to community living pose several barriers to accessing healthcare needs. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Barriers to care</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While incarcerated individuals are able to apply for Medicaid, their benefits — including substance use disorder treatment services — are unavailable to them until after their release. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That system, said Libby Jones, program director at the Overdose Prevention Initiative, is by design through the federal Medicaid inmate exclusion policy in the Social Security Act of 1965. As a result, the burden of inmate healthcare expenses falls to the local jurisdiction where jails and prisons are located. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That is a problem in the sense that oftentimes folks are only getting the bare minimum of their healthcare addressed,” Jones said. “What’s not being addressed are the underlying issues.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cunningham emphasized that there needs to be a focus on identifying and getting people into treatment before they’re released, as opioid addictions can still be fueled while incarcerated. However, he said facilities may express hesitancy offering medication assisted treatment because some are classified as controlled substances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Utilizing Medicaid benefits upon release can also be challenging, Cunningham said. When a person enrolls in Medicaid, he said they start out in the “fee-for-service” system where they don’t have a particular network of providers, meaning “you’re kind of on your own to figure out …  where you’re going to go.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some individuals have to wait up to a month after their release to be assigned a specific health plan to help navigate their benefits and find providers, a time frame Jones said is crucial for accessing treatment. According to a 2018 North Carolina </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6085027/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, formerly incarcerated individuals are 40 times more likely to overdose within the first two weeks after their release. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s not only a concern in terms of the increased risk of overdose and death, but it’s also if their addiction isn’t managed, that’s going to affect their transition into the community,” Cunningham said. “It’s going to affect their ability to find work and stable housing and it’s potentially going to lead to reincarceration.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many formerly incarcerated individuals face additional barriers to treatment upon their release, said Cunningham, like lacking a stable home or transportation, as well as being unaware of their options to get help. That transition period, he said, can be very unstable and uncertain and getting treatment may not be a priority for some. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of them are kind of just falling through the cracks,” Cunningham said. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Solutions moving forward</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jones said treatment programs within jails and prisons have been shown to have a great impact on reducing overdoses, recidivism rates and lowering costs for the facilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, Chesterfield County Jail has a program, funded primarily by grants and the county itself, that provides access to both medication for opioid disorder treatment and therapy. The re-arrest rate for people in the program, Jones said, was almost half for people who were released from jail who hadn’t been in the program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the Chesterfield jail program’s success, the Fairfax County Adult Detention Center is the only other jail in the commonwealth to utilize it. Members of Congress, including U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Prince William, visited the facility this January to hear from inmates participating in the program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inmates “feel hope for their life post-release because they are finally stable, they’re able to learn skills that will help them gain employment,” Jones said. “None of this would have been possible had they not received treatment.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investing in similar programs has been shown to also save money for prisons and jails. A 2022 Kentucky criminal justice treatment outcome </span><a href="https://corrections.ky.gov/Divisions/ask/Documents/CJKTOS_FY2021%20Report_FINAL_2022-02-02.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showed that for every $1 spent on the state’s correction-based substance use disorder treatment, there is a $4.54 cost offset. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jones said having Medicaid services provided during incarceration would “dramatically” help address treatment accessibility by covering some of the costs typically paid for by localities and could bring about similar programs in other jails and prisons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not only would it pay for the medications, it would also establish … standards of care. … If you are a Medicaid beneficiary, there are certain standards of care that you are entitled to,” Jones said. “So having those standards of care all put into place in the carceral system would also improve healthcare.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is why Jones is advocating for Congress to pass two bills, the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3074/cosponsors" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due Process of Continuity of Care Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/2400/all-info" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reentry Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, both of which are bipartisan and backed by U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond. The former would allow inmates to retain their Medicaid benefits while incarcerated and the latter, also backed by U.S. Reps. Gerald Connolly, D-Fairfax, and Spanberger, would restart the inmate’s benefits 30 days prior to their release to prevent gaps in coverage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some might disagree with the concept of investing in inmates or formerly incarcerated individuals, Cunningham emphasized that most people in prisons and jails are going to be released at some point and should be given the opportunity to succeed in life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whatever your view on people with criminal records or people in prisons is, I think it’s in everybody’s best interest to make sure that when they are released, we give them the best chance to reintegrate into the community,” Cunningham said.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr">RICHMOND, Va. &#8212; Karlee Clements was six months pregnant, “full on into addiction” and begging to go to jail because she was afraid she would kill her child.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Soon after, she was incarcerated at Riverside Regional Jail for a violation. Because of her baby’s low heart rate, she was sent to Chippenham Hospital, where she spent the remainder of her pregnancy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Zip-tied to a hospital bed, with a Riverside officer next to her, Clements gave birth to a baby girl and spent three days with her, per <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title53.1/chapter2/article2.2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title53.1/chapter2/article2.2/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1714647947920000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2wZzGlg_O38v3I_h2zdX9c">Virginia law</a>.

<p dir="ltr">Clements went back to jail, and her baby experienced withdrawal for 30 days. Once she was released, Clements gave her baby up for adoption and started using drugs again.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It became a way of living,” Clements said. “That’s the way I got through life.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">She went to rehab, stopped using heroin, but began using methadone, a synthetic opioid often prescribed as part of recovery treatment and to combat withdrawal symptoms.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Even though I love that baby, and I don’t want to hurt that baby, there’s just something inside of me where I can’t stop using,” Clements said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The number of jailed pregnant women fighting addiction has increased amid the skyrocketing opioid use in the past decade that led Virginia to <a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/commissioner/declaration-of-public-health-emergency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/commissioner/declaration-of-public-health-emergency/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1714647947920000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3Bk7tfBaphvGmOddAnqlhw">declare</a> a public health emergency in 2016. While the state has started to fund more recovery and treatment efforts, incarcerated mothers have fewer resources. Women in jail say facing motherhood and addiction is a specific struggle that needs more attention, in addition to more uniform prenatal care.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There is no official census of how many pregnant women are incarcerated, or their overall maternal health, a data gap the U.S. Department of Justice <a href="https://bjs.ojp.gov/document/dmhpopj.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bjs.ojp.gov/document/dmhpopj.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1714647947920000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1bC7RKcLBSEXRZ4TB-3EZ5">acknowledges</a> and is addressing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Approximately 3% of women admitted to U.S. jails are pregnant, according to a 2020 peer-reviewed study published in the Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology journal. If that number was applied to the national jail population, there could be an estimated <a href="https://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/abstract/2020/05000/pregnancy_prevalence_and_outcomes_in_u_s__jails.24.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/abstract/2020/05000/pregnancy_prevalence_and_outcomes_in_u_s__jails.24.aspx&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1714647947920000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0AY5BMpowbGWSuWiEa1PTY">55,000</a> pregnant women in jail.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Clements is now incarcerated at Chesterfield County Jail and involved in its recovery program, Helping Addicts Recover Progressively. She said security is the most beneficial thing she’s gotten out of HARP.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Finding Recovery Behind Bars</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Chesterfield County Sheriff Karl Leonard started the HARP program after annual overdose deaths in the county hit double digits on March 8, 2016.</p>
<p dir="ltr">People would get clean and sober in jail and then go back to the community. In reality, nothing was being done to help them, Leonard said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We wanted to start releasing recovered addicts back into the community with the tools, the knowledge, the equipment to be able to deal with all those issues that led them to use drugs before they got into the jail,” Leonard said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">HARP currently does not offer programs geared towards pregnant women, but does offer parenting classes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Chesterfield jail does not provide prenatal care, so pregnant inmates are sent to Riverside in Prince George County. Riverside had 475 pregnant inmates in a little over eight years, according to the jail.</p>
<p dir="ltr">HARP predates the Opioid Abatement Authority, an organization created by the General Assembly in 2021 to handle incoming opioid lawsuit settlement money. Virginia is beginning to receive millions of what will be an estimated $1.1 billion, according to the OAA.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“One of the rules for the use of the funds, which we disagree with very much, is that the funds cannot be used for any existing programs,” Leonard said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A locality <a href="https://www.oaa.virginia.gov/about/#:~:text=Cities%20and%20counties%20can%20expand,no%20indirect%20costs%20are%20allowed.&amp;text=Each%20city%20and%20county%20in,accordance%20with%20the%20statewide%20MOU." target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.oaa.virginia.gov/about/%23:~:text%3DCities%2520and%2520counties%2520can%2520expand,no%2520indirect%2520costs%2520are%2520allowed.%26text%3DEach%2520city%2520and%2520county%2520in,accordance%2520with%2520the%2520statewide%2520MOU.&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1714647947920000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3ITJN7ZZy_h6hjmExC0glU">cannot</a> use OAA money to supplant existing expenditures but can receive funding if they expand existing programs or implement new programs, according to its website.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Support for Incarcerated Pregnant Women</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Many women do not even know they are pregnant when they enter jail, according to Henrico County West Jail Capt. Pamela Dismuke. Female inmates are <a href="https://vadoc.virginia.gov/files/operating-procedures/700/vadoc-op-720-2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://vadoc.virginia.gov/files/operating-procedures/700/vadoc-op-720-2.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1714647947920000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0AYL_wVgWdVATkZsnXq4Yp">required</a> to take a pregnancy test when they enter.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I like to say a lot of the time jail kinda saved them, because had she not known she was pregnant she’d probably still be doing drugs and hurting the baby even more,” Dismuke said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Dismuke started a program for pregnant inmates two years ago. She contacted someone who works for the Department of Corrections and is a doula, or a person who provides guidance and support to a pregnant woman during labor.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Incarcerated pregnant women need specific food, supplements, exercise and even postpartum help that is not common practice throughout the system.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Special: The VA opioid epidemic and how services are helping incarcerated mothers" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_lGZ5DciPJE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p dir="ltr">The nonprofit Virginia Prison Birth Project pairs pregnant women in the Henrico jail with a doula and also shares nutritional food and information on a baby’s development and care, in addition to a weekly yoga class. Doulas also offer support by delivering breastmilk to the baby’s caretaker.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The organization provided the first doula-supported birth for a pregnant inmate in Virginia in 2019, according to its <a href="https://virginiaprisonbirthproject.org/what-we-do#:~:text=In%202019%20we%20provided%20the,have%20an%20established%20referral%20system." target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://virginiaprisonbirthproject.org/what-we-do%23:~:text%3DIn%25202019%2520we%2520provided%2520the,have%2520an%2520established%2520referral%2520system.&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1714647947920000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1DjXg7BTgOImsLnsDqb_ff">website</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Many women learn through the program how drugs hurt their babies, and it helps them take better care of themselves, Dismuke said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bobbie Jo Lashway, a pregnant inmate at Henrico County West Jail, said there are few programs aimed at her subgroup, despite large numbers of incarcerated pregnant women.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lashway enjoys the yoga program and is thankful people take time out of their day to share experiences.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It’s good on a human connection level that we don’t get in here,” Lashway said.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Funding Efforts to Combat the Epidemic</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The OAA <a href="https://www.oaa.virginia.gov/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.oaa.virginia.gov/about/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1714647947920000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1dv6wXSm6PwH9eEU49W2kL">distributes</a> 55% of incoming settlement funds to state agencies and localities that apply for funding, according to OAA director of finance Adam Rosatelli. A grants committee decides how to distribute the funds, in line with opioid abatement efforts and <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/authorities/opioid-abatement-authority/#:~:text=%C2%A7%202.2%2D2366.&amp;text=The%20purpose%20of%20the%20Authority,of%20opioids%20in%20the%20Commonwealth." target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://law.lis.virginia.gov/authorities/opioid-abatement-authority/%23:~:text%3D%25C2%25A7%25202.2%252D2366.%26text%3DThe%2520purpose%2520of%2520the%2520Authority,of%2520opioids%2520in%2520the%2520Commonwealth.&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1714647947920000&amp;usg=AOvVaw22WB8C1OLayllGM6QXOYkw">Virginia code</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The OAA has not funded any programs related to incarcerated pregnant or parenting women, but has funded jail programs, according to Rosatelli.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It was a pretty powerful thing to observe about the work we do and it being put into action,” Rosatelli said, about a visit last year to an OAA-funded recovery center for women in Washington County.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The OAA has distributed about $34 million, which has been used for initiatives such as recovery homes, education and prevention efforts and marketing campaigns, according to Rosatelli.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Clements has traveled a long road since she first stole pain pills from her mother. Now, she works through HARP to confront and heal the trauma that pushed her toward substance use. The program is helping her build back her self-esteem to face continued challenges.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This is literally the first time I’ve ever even said that story, but I’m able to say that without crying and feeling bad and feeling like it is my fault,” Clements said.</p>

Or</span><a href="https://www.dailypress.com/1998/01/18/an-innocent-bystander/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Gary Roberson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, whom I once interviewed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of these individuals were “third parties” – innocent pedestrians, drivers or their passengers who got in the way of speeding criminal suspects or pursuing law enforcement officials around the state. They died or were horribly injured during high-speed police pursuits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m mentioning them following a</span><a href="https://stateline.org/2024/04/12/in-reversal-more-areas-allow-high-speed-police-chases/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">recent report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that several states and municipalities around the country have reversed policies about high-speed chases. They’re allowing police more latitude to speed to catch suspects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a dangerous trend that should end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In previous years, many departments had limited high-speed pursuits. But</span><a href="https://stateline.org/2024/04/12/in-reversal-more-areas-allow-high-speed-police-chases/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Stateline</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> notes legislators and some police agencies, citing concerns about crime, have since eased restrictions. (Stateline is a sister publication of the Virginia Mercury.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is happening despite data that reveal major </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">decreases </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in violent and property crime rates since the early 1990s, according to the</span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/04/24/what-the-data-says-about-crime-in-the-us/#:~:text=Property%20crime%20in%20the%20U.S.,violent%20crimes%20per%20100%2C000%20people." target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Pew Research Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s as if tough-on-crime politicians aren’t paying attention to the data. They’re letting perceptions of crime outweigh the actual facts, while glossing over the inherent dangers of such police chases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Florida, Washington state, the District of Columbia and San Francisco are among the places that have rolled back restrictions over the past year. That decision is alarming, especially given the possibility for deaths and injuries to unsuspecting civilians and the officers themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several law enforcement agencies I canvassed around Virginia still have strict guidelines and parameters regarding police chases. They weigh the seriousness of the crimes a suspect is accused of versus the possible threat to others on the roadways.</span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/crime-courts/virginia-police-high-speed-chases/article_f689973e-3c69-11ee-9bdf-334d53ee7361.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The Richmond Times-Dispatch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found similar results last year when reporting on a handful of agencies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fairfax County Police Department, the largest among localities in the state with nearly 1,500 sworn officers,</span><a href="https://d.docs.live.net/d016fe375902de20/Documents/GO-504.pdf%20(fairfaxcounty.gov)" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">has a pursuit policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mandating officers have a reasonable suspicion that fleeing motorists or their passengers have committed or tried to commit a violent felony, or possibly violated any felony or misdemeanor involving the display, threat or firing of a gun or explosive device.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The county’s latest policy began in 2021 and was updated in March. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The revised pursuit policy aligned FCPD with best practices regionally and across the country,” a police department spokesman told me by email. “This policy balances the need to pursue criminals while maintaining safety for all within our community.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Chesapeake, among the circumstances that police officers must consider are the “severity of crime for which the offending driver is a suspect” and that person’s “vehicle speeds and driving behavior,” according to the department’s 11-page pursuit policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The decision to continue the pursuit should be based on the officer’s reasonable belief that the necessity for immediate apprehension outweighs the level of danger created by the pursuit,” it emphasizes. Pursuits are to be ended immediately in a number of situations, including when a suspect “begins to drive in the opposite lane against oncoming traffic.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of those steps seem smart. Yet, according to one</span><a href="https://courtroomproven.com/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">study by a Las Vegas law firm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Virginia ranks second among the states where a deadly crash following a police pursuit is most likely. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The January news release by H&amp;P Law said it analyzed the percentage of fatal crashes involving a police pursuit in each state. The firm, known for personal injury litigation, studied crashes from 2017 to 2021 reported by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s percentage of fatal crashes involving a police pursuit was 2.03%, only behind Georgia at 2.09%. Some 82 deadly motor accidents occurred during police chases over the five years that were studied, the law firm said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Virginia State Police spokeswoman, at my request, provided statistics on police pursuits from 2020 through 2023. The department patrols interstates, highways and rural roads in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relatively few people were injured or killed in those 2,222 police chases. Most of those harmed were criminal suspects or law enforcement officials. Last year, though, 28 third-party individuals were injured during 716 State Police chases. In 2021, one uninvolved person and nine suspects died during 492 pursuits.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to pursuits, police officers and their supervisors should prioritize “safety above all else,” Tim Goler, assistant professor of sociology and urban affairs at Norfolk State University, told me.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“A balanced approach is crucial.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such pursuits should occur only when violent felons are the targets, for example, instead of someone suspected of something as minor as an expired license plate, he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goler also advocated for serious evaluations of such incidents afterward, something he questioned is happening now in most police chases. “Departments should have rigorous review policies in place for every pursuit,” he continued.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police agencies don’t want to let suspects in murders, rapes or robberies run free, obviously. But they have to ask themselves questions, too: Can they arrest a suspect later? Do they know where the person is headed, such as home or a workplace? Is that person an immediate threat to others in the community?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relatives of those killed during police pursuits, especially people who weren’t the target, are left asking: “Why my loved one? Was the chase even necessary?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last July 29,</span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/crime/hopewell-police-chase-ends-in-fatal-collision/article_930cca2c-2fa4-11ee-a81e-ab264077972e.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a high-speed chase in Hopewell</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ended when the driver of a pickup truck sought by Prince George County Police ran a red light. The truck struck a car, and the car’s driver, 45-year-old Andre Bassett Jr. of Jacksonville, Fla., was fatally injured. Police said they had tried to stop the pickup truck because its driver was traveling 67 mph in a 45 mph zone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Aug. 7,</span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/crime/1-dead-in-carjacking-and-police-chase-in-henrico/article_14088abc-361c-11ee-a6e0-47803b6f3a23.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a high-speed chase occurred in Henrico County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as county police pursued a carjacking suspect. The suspect’s car crashed into a boy riding his bike, killing Geormond “Geo” Morton, 17, of Henrico.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nor are such incidents new.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than a quarter century ago, while reporting at the (Newport News) Daily Press, I met Gary Roberson. While walking to a convenience store in 1997 in Newport News, he was struck by a car fleeing police when it ran up onto the sidewalk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roberson suffered a broken lower back, damaged nerves in his spine, a broken leg, fractured collarbone and paralysis below the waist for a few months – among other injuries. He eventually endured more than half-dozen operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The suspect who struck Roberson, police said at the time, had earlier arrests or convictions for speeding, cocaine possession, brandishing a firearm and assault. A lawsuit filed by Roberson claimed police officers should have prevented the suspect from even entering his car the day of the chase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police officers can’t have a blanket “no chase ever” policy. Violent suspects would speed away every time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, we know fleeing suspects on our roads won’t be responsible. That’s why police officers must be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officers have an extra duty not just to make an arrest, but also to prevent harm against innocents. It’s an unfortunate – though necessary – burden.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Erring on the side of restraint may allow nonviolent offenders and low-level criminals freedom – at least immediately. Yet it will also keep third parties alive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s a goal police officers should accept. Municipalities and departments bucking that philosophy are placing their desire for arrests over public safety.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin speaks during a press conference near the end of the 2024 legislative session.  (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin handed down several vetoes, amendments and signatures on a number of gun and public safety bills the Democratic-controlled legislature </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/18/virginia-lawmakers-send-more-than-30-gun-bills-to-skeptical-governor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pushed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for this session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the measures Youngkin signed into law are ones that would create a felony charge for parents or guardians who allow a child under 18 to access a firearm despite knowing the child has a history of violent or threatening behavior.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other bills Youngkin signed make it illegal to make and use auto sears, small plastic or metal devices that convert firearms into automatic weapons by enabling them to empty an entire clip with one trigger pull.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ECogvRwQWJ"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/18/virginia-lawmakers-send-more-than-30-gun-bills-to-skeptical-governor/">Virginia lawmakers send more than 30 gun bills to skeptical governor</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia lawmakers send more than 30 gun bills to skeptical governor&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/18/virginia-lawmakers-send-more-than-30-gun-bills-to-skeptical-governor/embed/#?secret=WjupQMRnFm#?secret=ECogvRwQWJ" data-secret="ECogvRwQWJ" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin, in a statement, said those bills were “commonsense reforms with significant bipartisan support from the General Assembly,” and noted that they will “make it harder for criminals to use guns in the commission of a violent act.” Youngkin also reiterated his commitment to protect “the right of law-abiding Virginias to keep and bear arms.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation creating the felony charge for parents came from Del. Rodney Willet, D-Henrico, and Sen. Schuyler T. VanValkenburg</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, D-Richmond, who introduced the bills after 13-year-old </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/owner-of-gun-that-authorities-say-a-14-year-old-boy-allegedly-used-to-kill/article_9028c495-790d-511b-bbd6-92c705f3bc92.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucia Bremer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Henrico County was shot to death on her walk home allegedly by a fellow student who had access to his guardian’s firearm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lucia was a bright light in the Henrico community,” VanValkenburg said in a statement. “This new law, named in her honor, represents a monumental bipartisan victory, further underscoring the Commonwealth’s commitment to keeping Virginia’s children safe in their communities and classrooms.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to the bills’ signing, Henrico Commonwealth’s Attorney Shannon Taylor, who testified in support of the bill, said in a statement, “no adolescent, no child should have unsupervised access to a weapon, especially when they have already exhibited warning signs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the law banning auto sears, Del. Mike Jones, D-Richmond, who carried the legislation, said in a statement the measure “is a critically important step in our ongoing efforts to prevent senseless tragedies.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These devices are exacerbating the already acute gun violent crisis communities like mine are facing,” Jones said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin also issued several proposed changes to bills.  One would specify a ban on firearms in public or private hospitals to prevent them from winding up in the hands of people receiving mental health treatment at hospitals. Another would add federal definitions of serial numbers to a bill that creates a penalty for “knowingly” possessing a gun with a scratched off serial number. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other amendments would create a knowledge standard for making, selling, importing or possessing  “ghost guns,” which can be created at home with 3D printers, and establish a mandatory minimum sentence for using them while committing  a felony. Another would reframe a bill to set up a workgroup that would create a list of parental rights and responsibilities of safely storing guns in the home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/Veto-List-March-26.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 30 bills, including ones to restrict assault weapons access, impose waiting periods to receive a gun after purchasing one, expand the definition of people convicted of domestic abuse who are prevented from having a gun to include intimate partners, ban guns in more public places and conduct a study on the effects of gun violence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other proposals Youngkin vetoed included measures that would make it possible to sue the gun industry, and another that would prevent home-based gun dealers from being located within one and a half miles of elementary and middle schools. Bills that also met Youngkin’s veto pen included one that mandated a waiting period before purchasing firearms, another that outlined safe storage standards for firearms in homes where a minor is present, another that would prevent people from leaving visible firearms in vehicles, as well as a measure that would create program to train law enforcement agencies statewide on the appropriate use of the state’s substantial risk order law, better known as red flag laws, which allow guns to be seized from people who may put themselves or others in danger. Proponents say red flag laws can help prevent violence, especially mass shootings, while opponents counter that they may enable guns to be seized from people who haven’t been charged with a crime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Minority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, who carried the proposal to clarify when red flag laws can be used, took to the social media platform </span><a href="https://twitter.com/ssurovell/status/1772720826803998997" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">X</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to criticize Youngkin’s actions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Public safety is about more than mandatory minimums &amp; locking people up longer,” Surovell posted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislature is scheduled to reconvene on April 17 to take action on Youngkin’s amendments and to review his vetoes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agency argues its policies, which permit the firing of an employee if they don’t agree to a strip search when a body scan shows an “anomaly” in an individual’s body cavity, are “gender-neutral,” allowing “consensual strip searches of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">any</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> employee, regardless of gender.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, the department says, the three women have offered “no statistical data demonstrating that women are treated less favorably under the facially neutral policy than men.” </span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="2x7ABZInwG"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/07/female-workers-sue-virginia-prison-agency-claiming-body-searches-discriminate-against-women/">Female workers sue Virginia prison agency, claiming body searches discriminate against women</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Female workers sue Virginia prison agency, claiming body searches discriminate against women&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/07/female-workers-sue-virginia-prison-agency-claiming-body-searches-discriminate-against-women/embed/#?secret=sKI5BcqaTg#?secret=2x7ABZInwG" data-secret="2x7ABZInwG" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to questions from the Mercury about how many strip searches VDOC conducted over the past five years and what percentages of those searches were on biological women and biological men, the agency’s FOIA officer, Colleen Maxwell, said in an email that the department “does not have any records responsive to your request because the records do not exist.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Pursuant to § 2.2-3704(D) of the Code of Virginia, ‘no public body shall be required to create a new record if the record does not already exist,’” Maxwell wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit brought by Mallory Patterson and Emily Comer, two former VDOC employees, and current employee Carla McDowney contends that women are disproportionately impacted by the agency’s body scanning procedures, which authorize a strip search of an employee if the scanner shows the employee has an object in his or her body. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If an employee refuses to undergo such a search, the [standard operating procedure] permits VDOC to bar the person from the correctional facility or to terminate their employment,” three attorneys from Williams Mullen law firm, who are representing the corrections department, wrote in their most recent filing in the case with the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patterson, Comer and McDowney say that because the body-scanning technology used by the department cannot distinguish between contraband like drugs and menstrual products such as tampons, menstrual cups and intrauterine devices, multiple women have been strip searched and in some cases terminated for using menstrual or birth control products. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No one should have their job threatened, be subjected to a strip search, or have their employment terminated simply because they are menstruating, using a feminine hygiene product, or using a contraceptive device at work,” they argued in their lawsuit. “Such conduct is sex discrimination in violation of federal law.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patterson, a former therapeutic counselor at Indian Creek Correctional Center in Chesapeake, was strip searched after a body scanner flagged her menstrual cup. She later resigned as a result of the experience. McDowney, a correctional officer in training at Haynesville Correctional Center in Richmond County, was strip searched after the scanner flagged her tampon and sanitary pad. And Comer, a former licensed practical nurse at State Farm Correctional Center in Goochland County, was flagged by a body scanner while wearing an IUD and three days later was terminated “due to suspicious body scans.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three women are also seeking to open a class action lawsuit against the Virginia Department of Corrections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The department, however, says there is no evidence of intentional sex discrimination or a pattern of “less favorable treatment towards women” compared to men, none of the women’s allegations “demonstrate sufficiently severe or pervasive conduct that altered the terms of conditions of their employment” such that they could claim they experienced a “hostile work environment,” and the body scanner policy serves the state’s “well-established and legitimate interest” in keeping drugs out of prisons. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The standard operating procedure for use of the body scanners “applies equally to all sexes and genders,” the department wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Plaintiffs were searched or terminated from their facility not because of their sex, but because a body scanner detected an unknown or anomalous object. Gender played no part in their experiences,” attorneys wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nor, they contend, did the strip searches of Patterson and McDowney rise to the level of an “adverse employment action” — an act that “adversely affect[s] the terms, conditions, or benefits of the plaintiff’s employment” — needed to make a discrimination claim under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These searches did not affect Plaintiffs’ employment conditions in a manner equivalent to hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a significant change in benefits,” said VDOC in its filing. While “the strip searches were conducted pursuant to the [standard operating procedure], and although they were likely unpleasant and uncomfortable, they do not constitute an adverse employment action as a matter of law.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, the department said, the body scans and the strip searches authorized in the case of anomalies are justified because of the important role they play in reducing the flow of drugs into prisons. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is “the unfortunate truth that illegal material is sometimes smuggled in by a prison’s own employees,” said VDOC, noting a Jan. 3, 2024 attempt by a female employee to smuggle tobacco into the Indian Creek Correctional Center by “secreting it in her groin area.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What is inappropriate in one environment may be appropriate — or even necessary — in another,” the department wrote in a March 14 filing. “Here, Plaintiffs do not work in a corporate office building. They worked at a prison where the risk of contraband smuggling is all too real and all too dangerous. … The use of body scans and strip searches may seem invasive, but they are necessary precautions to protect staff, prisoners, and the public from the flow of drugs, weapons, and other contraband into the prison system.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The Flores case</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patterson, Comer and McDowney, however, say a September 2022 ruling by a jury that </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/09/20/virginia-prison-agency-discriminated-against-female-employee-in-tampon-case-jury-rules/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VDOC had discriminated against dental hygienist Joyce Flores</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when it fired her after a body scanner at Augusta Correctional Center detected a tampon she was wearing clearly establish “discrimination in employment on the basis of menstruation and related conditions is sex discrimination in violation of federal law.” </span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ppXg3X8GQ6"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/09/20/virginia-prison-agency-discriminated-against-female-employee-in-tampon-case-jury-rules/">Virginia prison agency discriminated against female employee in tampon case, jury rules</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia prison agency discriminated against female employee in tampon case, jury rules&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/09/20/virginia-prison-agency-discriminated-against-female-employee-in-tampon-case-jury-rules/embed/#?secret=QJtAkTUfIp#?secret=ppXg3X8GQ6" data-secret="ppXg3X8GQ6" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To discriminate against an employee because of a sex-linked trait is to discriminate against an employee because of sex in contravention of Title VII,” wrote Paul Falabella, an attorney for the three women who also represented Flores in the prior case, in a March 8 filing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He pointed in particular to the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2020 ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County — a landmark case in which an employee of Clayton County, Georgia, was fired from his job after promoting a gay softball league he had joined — that found that when determining whether sex discrimination occurred, “it doesn’t matter if the employer treated women as a group the same when compared to men as a group.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If the employer intentionally relies in part on an individual employee’s sex when deciding to discharge the employee — put differently, if changing the employee’s sex would have yielded a different choice by the employer — a statutory violation has occurred,” </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/17-1618_hfci.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote Justice Neil Gorsuch in the 6-3 opinion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his most recent filing, Falabella said that under that standard, “if we changed Plaintiffs’ sex to male, the result here would change because a male employee does not menstruate, use feminine hygiene products, or use internal contraceptive devices and therefore would not be discriminated against for same.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VDOC says that’s an incorrect understanding of the Bostock ruling, and that the Flores case is different from the current one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Using the Bostock test, if we changed Plaintiffs’ sex to male, and an anomaly or unknown object was detected by the body scanner, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the exact same result would occur</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” the agency wrote in a March 14 filing. “They would be subject to search. … There is simply no causal connection between the alleged strip searches of Patterson and McDowney and their gender.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, the department said, the court should follow a federal court ruling out of Georgia in Coleman v. Bobby Dodd Institute. In that case, a woman claimed she had suffered sex discrimination when she was fired from a 911 call center job by the Bobby Dodd Institute, an employment agency, after heavy periods linked to menopause caused her to leak blood onto a company chair and onto a carpet on the way to the bathroom. The Georgia-based court dismissed her suit, finding she hadn’t adequately proved sex discrimination. Coleman </span><a href="https://www.acluga.org/sites/default/files/appeal_brief.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">appealed the ruling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the two parties </span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/woman-settles-with-employer-she-says-fired-her-for-getting-period-work/afsPqA1kEa6mz0erIGMNaO/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">later reached a confidential settlement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falabella also argued that the choice presented to Patterson and McDowney did constitute an adverse employment action that met federal standards for a sex discrimination claim.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The context of the threats of termination is about as unique, humiliating, and dire as could occur in a place of employment — Patterson and McDowney had to either strip naked in the workplace in front of corrections officers, remove soiled feminine hygiene products from their vaginas while menstruating or be subject to termination from employment (and possible criminal investigation),” he wrote.</span></p>

While the </span></i><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodepopularnames/virginia-freedom-of-information-act/" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Freedom of Information Act</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> presumes all government business is by default public and requires officials to justify why exceptions should be made, too many Virginia leaders in practice take the opposite stance, acting as if records are by default private and the public must prove they should be handled otherwise.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this feature, we aim to highlight the frequency with which officials around Virginia are resisting public access to records on issues large and small — and note instances when the release of information under FOIA gave the public insight into how government bodies are operating. </span></i></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Police try to conceal video of shooting that killed man in mental health crisis</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The parents of Charles Byers, a man who was fatally shot by Chesterfield County Police officers last year during a mental health crisis, are criticizing the police department for trying to block the release of records showing what happened to their son, </span><a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/police-want-to-prevent-release-of-charles-byers-body-camera-video-march-20-2024" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to Richmond TV station WTVR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Byers had been hospitalized for mental health treatment and was under a 72-hour temporary detention order but was arrested after an alleged scuffle at the hospital. After a brief stint at the Richmond jail, he was released and was fatally shot 36 hours later in a second encounter with police.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chesterfield police department has denied FOIA requests for body camera footage filed by WTVR and the Richmond police officer who arrested Byers at the mental health hospital. A lawyer for the Richmond officer is seeking the footage and other Chesterfield investigative files to help defend his client in a civil lawsuit filed by Byers’ family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After denying the attorney’s FOIA request, the agency said it would take a court subpoena to access the records. The attorney filed a motion for a subpoena. Chesterfield police are attempting to block that too, arguing its files are irrelevant to the litigation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I just don’t understand what’s taking so long,&#8221; said Byers’ mother Peggy Byers. &#8220;My son is dead, and I want answers. We all want answers.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Hopewell chemical plant claims its pollution is confidential</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The AdvanSix chemical plant in Hopewell, which the </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/advansix-hopewell-chemical-plant-permit-deq-kepone/article_37bbb50c-e20f-11ee-a833-8fab48b90264.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond Times-Dispatch reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has a “long history of leaking harmful chemicals,” didn’t disclose its pollution calculations in its application for a state permit, claiming the estimates are confidential business information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental groups and the local NAACP chapter are pushing back, arguing the lack of information about pollution makes it impossible for the nearby community to fully understand the risks of the plant and weigh in on the permit. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s unclear if state environmental regulators are going to insist on making that information public or go along with the plant’s request to shield it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The whole point of a permit like this is to ensure that they’re in compliance,”  Southern Environmental Law Center attorney Mark Sabath told the newspaper. “Some of these steps are not much better than nothing at all.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Judge backtracks on release of closed meeting recording</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A retired judge who ordered Augusta County officials to release a recording of an improperly closed meeting of the county Board of Supervisors is apparently having second thoughts, </span><a href="https://augustafreepress.com/news/judge-curiously-overturns-his-decision-in-augusta-county-foia-case/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to the Augusta Free Press</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite ruling in January that the recording should be made public, the judge reversed his own decision late last week after listening to the audio and concluding it “contains information and statements that at times specifically identified county employees.” Those employees, the judge ruled, have an “expectation of privacy” even if the board didn’t follow the law while closing its meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the meeting, the board was discussing the resignation of one of its members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &lt;infobox&gt;The Mercury’s efforts to track FOIA and other transparency cases in Virginia are indebted to the work of the </span><a href="https://www.opengovva.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Coalition for Open Government</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a nonprofit alliance dedicated to expanding access to government records, meetings and other state and local proceedings.&lt;/endbox&gt;</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A FOIA fix for erroneous voter purges?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not often that state lawmakers require the government to create new records that are explicitly public under FOIA, but that’s part of the General Assembly’s response to last year’s </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/01/voting-rights-advocates-blast-youngkin-admin-over-error-affecting-3400/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">erroneous purges of the state’s voter rolls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After it became clear last fall an unknown number of eligible voters with past felony convictions had been wrongly removed from the rolls, voting rights groups and media outlets spent weeks trying to get more information from the state about how many voters might have been impacted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State officials ultimately revealed that roughly 3,400 voters had been impacted, but advocates blasted Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration for failing to be transparent and forthcoming about the problem.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB904" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently sent to Youngkin’s desk meant to prevent a repeat of the faulty voter removals includes a FOIA-specific provision requiring election officials to create a record every time a voter’s registration is canceled that includes the reason for the cancellation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pending law says those records, which must be kept for at least four years, are open to public inspection and copying under FOIA, giving outside groups and voters themselves more power to check the work of election officials when they believe a mistake has occurred.</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a case involving a flea infestation of an Alexandria rental, the Virginia Court of Appeals ruled Tuesday that lease agreements can’t override state law requiring that landlords keep their properties “in a fit and habitable condition.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the Virginia Residential Landlord Tenant Act, tenants must “take an active role in keeping the dwelling unit free from pests by prompt notifying the landlord of any infestations,” wrote Judge Doris Henderson Causey in </span><a href="https://www.vacourts.gov/opinions/opncavwp/1687224.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a unanimous decision by a three-judge panel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, she concluded, the law makes it clear that “it is ultimately the landlord’s duty to keep the premises habitable.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuesday’s ruling stems from a conflict over a lease for a single-family home in Alexandria that Mikeya Vance rented from landlord Christopher Parrish in September 2021. According to court records, Vance moved into the property Oct. 15, 2021 and immediately observed fleas in her bed. She then left the property Oct. 25 and notified Parrish of the infestation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The account of events provided by the appeals court outlines a string of extermination attempts undertaken by both Vance and Parrish. Vance first asked to end her lease Nov. 17, but Parrish refused. On Jan. 5, 2022, she filed a complaint against her landlord in Fairfax County General District Court seeking to terminate her lease and recover the rent she had paid during the infestation. While the district court ruled against her, the county circuit court later ruled in her favor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In appealing that decision, Parrish argued that Vance was responsible for dealing with the infestation, since the lease the two had signed stated the tenant would have the responsibility of “controlling and eliminating household pests including but not limited to fleas, ticks, bed bugs, roaches, silverfish, ants, crickets, and rodents during occupancy” and would be on the hook for “costs of the elimination of all such pests and vermin.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vance in turn contended that Virginia’s Residential Landlord Tenant Act requires landlords to keep properties habitable and forbids that responsibility from being transferred to tenants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The appeals court agreed. “When a lease provision purports to waive [a] tenant’s rights or remedies required by law, the law controls and the lease provision is unenforceable,” Causey wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the duties of a landlord that can’t be waived are the duty to “keep the premises in a fit and habitable condition,” she concluded. The presence of fleas, she found, “certainly can render the premises uninhabitable” because of the diseases they can carry.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Here, the lease agreement between Parrish and Vance attempted to shift the burden to deal with insect infestations to Vance,” Causey wrote. “However, the lease could not do so because Vance did not waive the warranty of habitability by signing the lease agreement.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The appeals court also rejected another argument by Parrish that the circuit court hadn’t had sufficient evidence to determine the fleas had been there prior to Vance moving in. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a hearing on the case this past September, Vance’s attorney, Karen Leiser, argued that the circuit court hadn’t been unreasonable in its ruling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If the tenant had somehow brought the fleas with her or had caused an infestation in some way, it is possible that that burden would shift to her to remediate the problem, but that is not what the trial court found,” Leiser told the appeals court. “The trial court found that the fleas must have already been there, and therefore it was the landlord’s obligation under the statute to remedy that problem.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Causey concluded that even though Parrish “asserts that Vance caused the flea infestation, the circuit court was entitled to credit” other testimony “that the flea activity had been ongoing for months, even before Vance took possession of the property.”</span></p>

(Photo courtesy of Virginia State Police)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin took to social media Monday morning to denounce a pro-Palestine protest that blocked highway traffic in the Richmond region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is unacceptable to block interstates, endanger the lives of Virginians and cause mayhem on our roads,” Youngkin said on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, while reposting a photo of a heavy Virginia State Police response to the protest that took place on Interstate 95 near the exit for Arthur Ashe Boulevard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nine people were arrested in the incident, according to the Virginia State Police, which clogged southbound traffic for several hours and led to traffic backups extending more than 3 miles. No protesters or law enforcement personnel were hurt, according to officials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mostly young people from the Richmond area, those arrested were charged with stopping another person’s vehicle, obstructing the free passage of others, unlawful assembly and being a pedestrian on the interstate. The first three charges are misdemeanors, and the latter is considered a traffic offense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An anonymous news release sent to the media shortly after the protest began said the demonstration was carried out “in solidarity with the Palestinian Liberation Movement” and meant to cause “major gridlock.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Demonstrators say that they are putting their bodies on the line to disrupt the flow of ‘business as usual’ in the heart of the Commonwealth, demanding that the U.S. empire cease all funding for the genocidal, Israeli occupation of Palestine at once,” the release said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Police said they first started receiving calls from blocked drivers around 6:54 a.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After arriving at the scene, State Police said they found “nine individuals lying in the southbound lanes” who had “linked themselves together using two ladders, a large metal chain and ‘sleeping dragon’ devices.” After police declared an unlawful assembly, three protesters “voluntarily gave up almost immediately,” according to police.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Specially-trained troopers arrived on scene to safely extricate the remaining six protesters from the sleeping dragon devices, which turned out to be large PVC piping wrapped in chicken wire and connected via a large metal chain,” said State Police Sgt. Jessica Shehan. “The six were then taken into custody without further incident and transported off the interstate.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scene wasn’t fully cleared until 10:30 a.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican lawmakers in Virginia have occasionally introduced legislation to create tougher criminal penalties for disruptive protests, but those efforts have largely failed in the General Assembly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some proposals have been aimed squarely at creating steep consequences for blocking roads and highways. In debate over one such bill in 2022, Democratic lawmakers stressed that it’s already a class 1 misdemeanor, an offense punishable by up to a year in jail and up to $2,500 in fines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If convicted on a charge of stopping the vehicle of another, violators can also have their driver’s license suspended for up to one year.</span></p>

This, however, is precisely how the present system works. It must be changed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m proud to have been on the editorial board that wrote the opinion piece in 2001.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less so the fact the high cost for families is still an issue in the commonwealth. Many relatives of those behind bars are poor. Exorbitant phone fees place an extra, unnecessary burden on them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inmate advocacy and re-entry groups, as well as equity-minded state legislators, have worked to change the past parasitic formula. The current rate is a little more than 4 cents a minute; the department reduced it to that amount in 2015, the</span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/bill-headed-to-governor-aims-to-cut-prison-phone-costs/article_80c19932-d739-11ee-90b9-1f51c7b402f2.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond Times-Dispatch reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Before then, the rate had been 33 cents a minute for prepaid calls, and the department had collected commissions between 35% and 41%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke, sponsored a bill this General Assembly session requiring state prisons to use pay phone and debit-card calling services at the lowest possible rate.</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb801" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">HB801</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> passed both chambers easily after Rasoul’s bid to offer free calls in corrections facilities was amended.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Staying in touch with family motivates incarcerated people to engage in prosocial behavior and rehabilitation while serving their sentence and is critical to their successful re-entry into society upon release,”</span><a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2022/RD500/PDF" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">noted a 2022 report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by a work group studying phone fees, among others, in Virginia correctional facilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The increased contact with relatives benefits prisoners, their families and the public, the report added.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="u0qwu3cXov"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/02/13/va-house-panel-rejects-bills-to-boost-prison-oversight-give-inmates-free-phone-calls/">Va.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other states even decrease the cost for these services. The report cited Illinois, which has a prison population similar to Virginia’s, for charging families roughly a penny per minute per call.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s true the situation regarding prison communication costs is better today than the unseemly treatment families in Virginia faced at the start of the 21</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century. Back then, WorldCom Inc. –</span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/worldcom.asp" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">which later became synonymous with accounting fraud</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – imposed a $2.25 surcharge and up to 37 cents per minute per call.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gordon-gekko.asp" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gordon Gekko</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would have been proud.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state also got a 40% commission for the punitive practice. The lucrative deal made officials slow to change the status quo. Department of Corrections bigwigs even rejected a WorldCom proposal to lower rates, The Pilot’s 2001 editorial noted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So much for compassion for the families. They pay the overwhelming amount of such costs because prisoners are limited in how much they collect for their labor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thankfully, the state no longer gets a commission on calls. It receives some money on a separate contract to provide tablets with products and services. Global-Tel Link now provides prison phone services in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rasoul’s legislation now heads to Gov. Glenn Youngkin. A spokesman told me by email the governor is reviewing all bills that reach his desk – a typical non-indicator from this administration of which way the guv is leaning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we want people leaving jails and prisons to reintegrate into society successfully, everyone should support policies that connect people to their families. After all, many incarcerated individuals are freed each year in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nonprofit</span><a href="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/profiles/VA.html#:~:text=Virginia%20has%20an%20incarceration%20rate,incarcerated%20in%20Virginia%20and%20why." target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Prison Policy Initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for example, reported that nearly 300,000 people are released from state jails and prisons annually in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 95% of people incarcerated eventually return to the community at some point, Sheba Williams, founder and executive director of Richmond-based nonprofit Nolef Turns, told me in an interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a benefit for the community” to maintain those familial ties, added Williams, who was part of the state work group that studied onerous prison fees. “There are vendors that will provide lower costs than what the Department of Corrections has contracted for.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rasoul’s bill “is a step in the right direction,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sandra Brandt is the longtime executive director of Norfolk-based STEP-UP Inc., which fights recidivism among former prisoners. “The rates used to be outlandish,” Brandt told me, recalling one woman who racked up a phone bill of $1,000 while contacting a relative behind bars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rasoul’s legislation “will be a blessing for a lot of families,” Brandt continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This bill should be an easy choice for Youngkin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can be tough on crime while also fighting recidivism. Reducing the cost of communications is one way to do just that.</span></p>

Xylazine, a powerful animal sedative that's moving through the illicit drug supply is complicating the U.S. response to the opioid crisis, causing gruesome skin wounds and scrambling longstanding methods for treating addiction and reversing overdoses.  (Matt Rourke/Associated Press)</p><p>Legislators in a handful of states are offering bills to address the rise in the misuse of xylazine, a cheap animal sedative not intended for human consumption.</p>
<p>Xylazine, or “tranq,” can induce blackouts and cause lesions that sometimes result in severe infections or amputations, and it can even lead to death. The opioid overdose-reversal drug naloxone does not work on xylazine, which drug dealers often find through the dark web and other illicit channels, rather than getting it from veterinary offices. Although xylazine isn’t classified by the federal government as a controlled substance, it also isn’t approved for human use.</p>
<p>Several states — including Indiana, New York, South Carolina, South Dakota, Virginia and Wisconsin — are considering bills. The legislation ranges from classifying xylazine as a controlled substance to stiffening criminal penalties for possession and distribution, as well as legalizing testing strips so people who intend to take drugs can make sure they aren’t tainted by xylazine.</p>
<p>Other states — Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia — have already added xylazine to their lists of controlled substances, which adds tighter controls to the storage and movement of the drug for veterinary use.</p>
<p>The accessibility and affordability of xylazine, which can be bought online from Chinese suppliers for $6 to $20 per kilogram, make it an attractive option for drug traffickers, according to the <a href="https://www.dea.gov/sites/default/files/2022-12/The%20Growing%20Threat%20of%20Xylazine%20and%20its%20Mixture%20with%20Illicit%20Drugs.pdf" target="_blank">federal Drug Enforcement Administration</a>. Xylazine is frequently used as an adulterant to enhance the psychoactive effects of other drugs, such as fentanyl. Yet many people who use such drugs don’t realize that xylazine has been mixed in.</p>
<p>Public health experts and harm reduction advocates, who work with people who use drugs to help them avoid the worst outcomes, warn that criminalizing xylazine or categorizing it as a controlled substance will just exacerbate the fear and stigma associated with the drug, isolating people who use it and discouraging them from seeking treatment.</p>
<p>“Scheduling drugs and making things illegal has never had any meaningful effect … on people actually ingesting drugs or the amount of drugs showing up in the drug supply,” said Colin Miller, the community liaison and social/clinical research specialist at the University of North Carolina Street Drug Analysis Lab. “Xylazine is just like the latest in a long line of these examples.”</p>
<p>Danielle German, an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, agreed that ratcheting up penalties will do more harm than good, “even if the legislation is coming from a place of good and wanting to help.”</p>
<p>“That increased perception of penalty — we’ve seen over and over and over again that that’s what pushes people away from the resources that we most want them to be able to access,” German said.</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">State action</h4>

	</h4>
<p>Nevertheless, several states are embracing a get-tough approach.</p>
<p>In South Dakota, Republican Gov. Kristi Noem in February signed <a href="https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/24718" target="_blank">legislation</a> classifying xylazine as a controlled substance, with fines and penalties of up to two years in prison for using, manufacturing and distributing the drug, while still allowing for veterinary use.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.scstatehouse.gov/billsearch.php?billnumbers=4617&amp;session=125&amp;summary=B&amp;headerfooter=1" target="_blank">similar bill</a> is pending in South Carolina, where manufacturing or distributing the drug for other than veterinary use would bring a felony charge and up to 10 years imprisonment. Virginia lawmakers are considering <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+ful+HB1187H1" target="_blank">legislation</a> with similar penalties.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="BGY8ACDUwf"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/01/three-interesting-bills-xylazine-penalties-custodial-death-reports-and-aliens-in-state-code/">Three interesting bills: xylazine penalties, custodial death reports and &#8216;aliens&#8217; in state code</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Three interesting bills: xylazine penalties, custodial death reports and &#8216;aliens&#8217; in state code&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/01/three-interesting-bills-xylazine-penalties-custodial-death-reports-and-aliens-in-state-code/embed/#?secret=XvC8zmo3Zd#?secret=BGY8ACDUwf" data-secret="BGY8ACDUwf" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>In New York state, <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/node/12031610" target="_blank">legislation</a> would place xylazine in the category of the most dangerous controlled substances, which would carry stiffer criminal penalties for both possession and distribution.</p>
<p>In Indiana, a bill making its way through the legislature would criminalize the possession and distribution of xylazine, with potential punishment of jail time. It would add steeper penalties for repeat offenders. The bill exempts use and distribution for veterinary purposes.</p>
<p>“I fully support other harm reduction avenues, such as [the opioid overdose-reversal drug] Narcan and test strips,” said Indiana Republican state Rep. Jennifer Meltzer, the bill’s author. “I just believe that we also need to go after the bad actors. … Having a criminal effect will hopefully deter individuals that are dealing or maybe even individuals who are now only seeking out xylazine, to get the help that they need.”</p>
<p>Another bill in Indiana would have <a href="https://iga.in.gov/legislative/2024/bills/house/1053/details" target="_blank">legalized</a> testing strips for all controlled substances, including xylazine, but it died in the Senate. Meltzer, one of the bill’s co-authors, plans to work with the Democratic lead author of that bill to get it passed during the next legislative session.</p>
<p>But in Wisconsin, <a href="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2023/proposals/ab950" target="_blank">legislation</a> to legalize xylazine testing strips is awaiting the governor’s signature.</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Xylazine’s spread</h4>

	</h4>
<p>Xylazine was first detected in other drugs in Puerto Rico in the early 2000s, according to the <a href="https://www.dea.gov/sites/default/files/2022-12/The%20Growing%20Threat%20of%20Xylazine%20and%20its%20Mixture%20with%20Illicit%20Drugs.pdf" target="_blank">DEA</a>. Now, the drug can be found across the states, though <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2813606" target="_blank">available research</a> suggests that xylazine-involved overdose deaths are primarily concentrated in the eastern United States, especially in the Northeast.</p>
<p>The University of North Carolina Street Drug Analysis Lab tests drug samples sent by over 150 harm reduction and syringe exchange programs across 35 states and publishes those results publicly. Between January 2021 and February 2024, the lab found xylazine in lab-confirmed fentanyl samples from 15 states. Some of the samples analyzed were submitted to the lab because people suspected the presence of xylazine, Miller wrote in an email to Stateline.</p>
<p>The states with the highest number of fentanyl samples that tested positive for xylazine are North Carolina, 148; New York, 148; Michigan, 66; Pennsylvania, 38; and Washington, 20.</p>

<p>But some harm reduction advocates and public health experts argue that focusing too heavily on xylazine could inadvertently facilitate the entry of other, potentially stronger and more harmful drugs into the illicit drug supply. They warn that what states are doing now to curb xylazine use repeats a strategy that has had limited success with substances such as fentanyl.</p>
<p>“Because we hyper-focused on fentanyl for so long, the criminal drug market responded with a more lethal and potent substance to adulterate and then dominate the supply,” said Sarah Laurel, the founder and executive director of Savage Sisters Recovery, a Philadelphia nonprofit that offers free services to people experiencing homelessness and substance use.</p>
<p>Philadelphia is one of the cities that has been hit hardest by the surge in xylazine use. In 2022, the <a href="https://www.phila.gov/media/20231002090544/CHARTv8e3.pdf" target="_blank">Philadelphia Department of Public Health</a> found that xylazine was involved in 480, or more than a third, of the 1,413 unintentional overdose deaths. Almost every death in which xylazine was found also involved fentanyl, <a href="https://www.phila.gov/2023-10-02-philadelphia-records-more-than-1400-overdose-deaths-in-2022-deaths-among-black-residents-rose-nearly-20/" target="_blank">according</a> to the agency.</p>
<p>“The same thing will happen if we have a new focus on xylazine. They are just going to find a new substance that is going to satisfy the demand,” Laurel said.</p>
<p>Instead, some advocates say states should focus more on expanding access to substance use treatment services and mobile drug-checking equipment, such as mass spectrometers that can analyze ingredients within a drug mixture.</p>
<p>“You can’t say that you want people to stop using drugs and then every time I call for a detox bed, there’s not a bed,” said Alixe Dittmore, the housing and shelter capacity building coordinator with the National Harm Reduction Coalition.</p>
<p>“We have incredibly punitive and prohibitive services,” Dittmore said. “You really have to holistically look at it when you’re worried about how many folks are passing away.”</p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former President Donald Trump made a campaign stop in Richmond Saturday ahead of Super Tuesday, a day of primary voting that is expected to seal his bid to be the Republican nominee for president in November.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With your help, we will win big on Super Tuesday,” Trump told the crowd of a few thousand at the Richmond Convention Center. “This November, Virginia is going to tell crooked Joe Biden, you’re fired, you’re fired, get out of here, get out of the White House.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent national </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/02/us/politics/biden-trump-times-siena-poll.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conducted by The New York Times and Siena College found Trump has a 5 point lead over Biden. But those results may not be mirrored in Virginia: In their last matchup in 2020, Biden beat Trump in Virginia by 10 percentage points. The results of a separate poll from the </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/03/01/despite-low-approval-rating-biden-leads-trump-by-four-points-among-virginia-voters-roanoke-college-poll-says/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Institute for Policy and Opinion Research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Roanoke College released Friday found Biden had a 4 percentage point lead over Trump among Virginians. That poll also found that if Trump challenger Nikki Haley, a former South Carolina governor, were the Republican nominee, she would beat Biden in Virginia by a solid 9 points.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calling himself a “political dissident” Saturday evening, Trump’s speech in Richmond largely focused on immigration and crime. He specifically cited the recent death of Laken Riley, a 22-year-old University of Georgia nursing student whom authorities say was beaten to death by a Venezuelan migrant, and the shooting death of a 2-year-old in </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/02/28/toddler-shooting-suspect-immigration-detainer/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Montgomery County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Maryland. Law enforcement has arrested five suspects in the latter case, one of whom is a Salvador national who was slated for deportation last year but was later released by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We now have a new category of crime, you know what it&#8217;s called? It&#8217;s called migrant crime. And this category is turning out to be worse than any crime we&#8217;ve ever had in our country,” Trump said. “I was going to call it Biden migrant crime. But if you do that it&#8217;s too long. It doesn&#8217;t work.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump pledged that if elected, he would “terminate every open border policy of the Biden administration” on his first day in office. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We will begin the largest domestic deportation operation in American history,” he said. “We have no choice. This is not sustainable by any country.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immigration, he warned the audience, was also affecting schools: “In New York, they have pupils from foreign countries, from countries where they don&#8217;t even know what the language is. We have nobody that even teaches it,” Trump said. “These are languages that nobody ever heard of. They&#8217;re sitting in the school chairs of people, of kids, that were there, and those kids aren&#8217;t able to go to school any longer. There&#8217;s no place they can go. They&#8217;re taking the school, and they don&#8217;t speak a word of English.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond resident Joe Wilson, 27, who said he attended the rally not to support Trump but to witness the movement behind him, said “it’s kind of fascinating the amount of pandemonium he can cause. I just can’t wrap my head around it.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his speech, Trump touted himself as “the first president in decades who started no new wars” and claimed that had he been in office in October, Hamas wouldn’t have “thought” of attacking Israel. Dealing with adversaries like China, Russia and North Korea, he said, was easier than “dealing with radical-left lunatics in the United States.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump’s stance on the U.S.’ global position resonated with attendee Brad Slaybaugh, 58, of Colonial Heights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Where do you want me to start — you want to talk about China, you want to talk about Russia, you want to talk about Israel, you want to talk about Ukraine, you want to talk about the border, you talk about the economy, talk about fossil fuels?” Slaybaugh said in response to a question about what appealed to him about Trump. “Our status in the world’s fallen. The world is chaos, because we’re not strong and they know it.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump also struck many familiar themes on domestic issues Saturday: He urged oil producers to “drill, baby, drill” in order to secure U.S. energy independence, touted tax and regulatory cuts passed during his term and decried recent nationwide inflation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chesterfield residents Thomas and Debra Tubbs, 64 and 65, said cost of living was one of their reasons for supporting Trump.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of medicine because of him came down in price, especially senior citizens in particular,” said Debra Tubbs. “We go to the store and spend $250, we come out of there with nearly nothing. It’s really affecting everything.”</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump made no mention of Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who was long rumored to be toying with a presidential bid of his own. Youngkin’s rise to power in the increasingly blue-leaning Virginia — a feat he accomplished by keeping a careful distance from Trump but avoiding any overt criticism of the former president that could alienate supporters — was seen by many as offering a new playbook for Republicans in less deep-red states. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin, whom Trump took a swipe at in a bizarre </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/11/11/youngkin-avoids-criticizing-trump-after-chinese-swipe-by-former-president/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">social media post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in November 2022, did not attend the rally. He told the Richmond Times-Dispatch he had a previously scheduled family commitment. Youngkin’s name was also not included on a list of 40 Republican leaders endorsing Trump that his campaign released </span><a href="https://twitter.com/NickWTOP/status/1763696198295138810?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1763696198295138810%7Ctwgr%5E2cc24961211a6a2ade9301c61023c9dcf5cb022e%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwtop.com%2Fvirginia%2F2024%2F03%2Ftrumps-rally-in-richmond-concludes-ahead-of-super-tuesday-without-gov-youngkin%2F" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Nor were Republicans Lieutenant Governor Winsome Earle-Sears, </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/11/10/virginia-winsome-sears-trump/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">who has called Trump a “liability to the mission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” Attorney General Jason Miyares or Congresswoman Jen Kiggans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to Del. Wren Williams, R-Patrick, who addressed the crowd before Trump took the stage, in attendance for the event were U.S. Rep. Bob Good (R-Campbell), and state Sen. John McGuire (R-Goochland). Good and McGuire are locked in a heated battle to represent Virginia’s 5th Congressional District. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tubbs said they thought former Ambassador and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley would be a good pick for Trump’s vice president as a way to win over female voters. Haley stopped in </span><a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/nikki-haley-richmond-virginia-visit-feb-29-2024" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">western Henrico</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Thursday for a rally of her own ahead of Super Tuesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She’s got a lot of good ideas,” said Debra Tubbs. Thomas Tubbs quickly added, “He’s got the balls to carry it out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier in the day, Democrats held a counter rally in Richmond featuring U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan (D-Richmond), who focused on the threat Trump could pose to reproductive rights if elected to a second term. Most recently, </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/16/us/politics/trump-abortion-ban.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump has floated the idea of a 15- or 16-week ban on the procedure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even though Virginians stopped MAGA Republicans’ attempts to pass an extreme abortion ban here in Virginia by voting at the ballot box this past November, the stakes could not be higher for reproductive freedom this November,” McClellan said.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_38005" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/trump-protestor-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-38005" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/trump-protestor-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/trump-protestor-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/trump-protestor-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/trump-protestor-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/trump-protestor-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/trump-protestor-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/trump-protestor-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A man holds up a sign stating former President Trump is a dictator. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While other Trump rallies have drawn sharp counter protests, Saturday’s event sparked little organized activity from opponents. A truck playing a video in support of Haley’s bid drove around the rally site before it began, and a few people held up signs, one of which called Trump a dictator.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your Fellow AMERICANS are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">NOT</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Enemy,” read the other.</span></p>

She&#8217;d left her home country and traveled to Virginia at the behest of a man who said he loved her and wanted to create a life with her. Instead, she found herself physically and emotionally trapped in his home, forced to cook, clean and have sex with him on demand — or face the consequences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He told her he&#8217;d go to the authorities about her being here illegally,” said Teresa Christin, executive director of the Avalon Center, an organization that serves 11 localities in greater Williamsburg and the Middle Peninsula, offering emergency shelter and resources to domestic violence and sexual assault survivors. “She couldn&#8217;t speak English, only Spanish, and was totally unfamiliar with the legal system here. She was completely at the mercy of someone who was exploiting her every day.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The woman sheltered at Avalon, where staff are also trained to identify and assist sex and labor trafficking victims, for about six months before returning to her country. Her experience unfortunately wasn’t rare: Although Christin doesn’t think Williamsburg and the surrounding region is a hotbed for sex trafficking, labor trafficking has been a big problem there. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, authorities uncovered the largest labor trafficking case in Virginia history, criminally charging the leaders of a cleaning business that forced 100 Salvadoran immigrants — all of them just 14 to 25 years old — to live and work in a Williamsburg warehouse. One teen </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“often worked 11-hour overnight shifts before going to school in the morning,” reported </span><a href="https://www.wavy.com/news/local-news/3-sentenced-in-williamsburg-human-trafficking-case/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WAVY</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Human trafficking, a modern form of slavery in which perpetrators force victims to perform labor or sex acts, is a growing problem across the country, including in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s hard to pinpoint how many children and adults have been trafficked in Virginia, because data to inform the answer is spread across several local, state and federal agencies. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+SB1669" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bipartisan</span></a> <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+HB2576" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the 2019 General Assembly created a statewide sex trafficking response coordinator position to study, track and report annually on human trafficking prevalence in Virginia. The role was also tasked with making recommendations to eradicate trafficking and working with relevant state agencies, health care providers and social service organizations to develop anti-trafficking standards and training. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the coordinator’s most recent </span><a href="https://www.dcjs.virginia.gov/sites/dcjs.virginia.gov/files/publications/victims/trafficking-response-coordinator-annual-report-2022.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 6,420 adults and minors were arrested between 2012 and June 2022 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“for assisting or promoting prostitution, for prostitution, and for human trafficking—commercial sex acts.” Other data sources tally the human cost: From 2007 to 2021, the National Human Trafficking Hotline </span><a href="https://humantraffickinghotline.org/en/statistics/virginia" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">identified</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 3,573 victims (children and adults) involved in 1,689 cases of human trafficking in Virginia. The most common venues for sex trafficking in the commonwealth, the Hotline found, are businesses that front as massage parlors or spas, while labor trafficking often occurs in domestic settings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sadly, these figures and details don’t show the full scale of the problem, because not every trafficking incident is reported or prosecuted. Nor does the arrest and prosecution of perpetrators end the suffering: Trafficking survivors may be plagued by fear and insecurity, and be left with lasting mental and emotional damage.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s alarming to know that while there is no set profile or characteristics of trafficking victims, the people most often exploited are from already marginalized communities or in vulnerable positions. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.transitionsfvs.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transitions Family Violence Services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, based in Hampton, was the lead victim service agency that helped the survivors in the Williamsburg labor trafficking case by working in tandem with the </span><a href="https://www.oag.state.va.us/programs-outreach/human-trafficking/hampton-roads-human-trafficking-task-force" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hampton Roads Human Trafficking Task Force</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://samaritanhouseva.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Samaritan House</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Transitions’ Executive Director Sanu Dieng noted by email that in addition to the Williamsburg case, the organization </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">has served 23 survivors of trafficking since 2020. They were a mix of men and women whose ethnicities varied from Asian to Caucasian to Black to Latino.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.justice.gov/humantrafficking/what-is-human-trafficking" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traffickers target </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">youth who are homeless or habitual runaways, or who have been involved in the juvenile justice or child welfare system, the U.S. Department of Justice notes. People lacking legal immigration status, Black people and others of color, LGBTQ+ individuals, migrant workers and people with disabilities or substance use disorders are also frequently ensnared. People who fall into two or more of these categories are at even greater risk. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But even if you aren’t in any of those categories, you could still become a victim, or someone you love could. Nor does it matter if trafficking victims are here illegally, because whatever their citizenship status, all people have a right to safety, shelter and freedom from attacks on their wellbeing. Trafficking is not an issue any of us should shut our eyes against; the suffering of some should be an incentive to action for all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To our lawmakers’ credit, Virginia’s legislative response to human trafficking has been robust in recent years. The state funded the development of the Virginia Analytics System for Trafficking (VAST), a platform that collects data from multiple agencies to determine where, when and how often trafficking is happening here. This information allows a more streamlined response to the problem, but VAST requires additional funding and technical development before it can be used more widely. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">S</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">everal measures in this year’s legislative session attempt to further efforts to uncover, prevent and correct the serious harms of human trafficking.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB581" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 581 </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">would require commonwealth’s attorneys to create multidisciplinary response teams to determine how communities deal with sex and labor trafficking and review best practices for trauma-informed care that centers victims during the evidence gathering process</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB203" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another measure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> likely heading to the governor’s desk would require private security company employees to undergo training to recognize and report signs of human trafficking. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB633" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 633</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> enacts stiff criminal penalties for labor traffickers, adds labor trafficking to anti-racketeering rules in state code and defines labor trafficking as a barrier crime that precludes offenders from working as caregivers to children, senior citizens or disabled people. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These bills and authorities’ efforts to curb human trafficking are laudable, but it also takes the vigilance of everyday citizens to make a lasting impact. If you see something, say something: Send human trafficking tips to Virginia State Police by texting </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">847411 (type VSP and then your tip). You can also contact your local social services office, or</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> call the National Human Trafficking Hotline at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">1-888-373-7888 or text HELP to 233733. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While legislators do their part, a simple text or phone call from the rest of us could prevent many men, women and children from being abused and exploited in Virginia. </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An admissions policy adopted by the Fairfax County School Board in 2020 to promote greater diversity at the elite Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology will remain in place after the U.S. Supreme Court opted not to take up a case challenging it brought forward by a coalition of parents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court did not offer a reason for not hearing the appeal of a May 2023 ruling by the Richmond-based U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals. But the decision sparked a dissent from Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas, who </span><a href="https://pacificlegal.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/022024zor_7647-copy.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tuesday that the high court should “wipe” the appeals court ruling “off the books.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Fourth Circuit’s reasoning is a virus that may not spread if promptly eliminated,” said the justices, who accused other schools of using Thomas Jefferson’s admissions model as a “blueprint for evading” the Equal Protection Clause.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to December 2020, Thomas Jefferson’s admissions process relied on a student’s performance on standardized tests, grade point average, writing samples and teacher recommendations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, Asian American students made up an increasing proportion of the school’s student body, while percentages of Black and Hispanic students remained persistently low. In 2019, the 4th Circuit noted, 71.5% of Thomas Jefferson students were Asian American, and 19.5% white. In 2020, “data indicated that the number of Black students admitted to TJ’s incoming freshman class was ‘too small for reporting’ — a designation meaning that ‘10 or fewer’ Black students had been extended offers of admission.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As public anger over the killing of George Floyd grew in 2020, the Fairfax County School Board adopted a series of changes to the school’s admissions process intended to increase the numbers of underrepresented students, particularly Black and Hispanic students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new policy eliminated the previous use of standardized tests to cull the ranks of applicants. Instead, a certain number of slots were allocated to each of the 28 middle schools that feed into Thomas Jefferson. Applicants were then considered based on their grade point average, which had to be 3.5 at a minimum, a “portrait sheet” describing their skills, a problem-solving essay, and four experience factors — eligibility for free or reduced price meals, status as an English language learner, eligibility for special education services, and attendance at a historically underrepresented public middle school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the admissions policy was instituted, the 4th Circuit noted applications for the Class of 2025 rose by almost 1,000. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The mean grade point average among those applicants was higher than it had been in five years and, in terms of demographics, the class of 2025 included markedly more low-income students, English-language learners, and girls than had prior classes at TJ,” the appeals court noted. “Notably, for the first time in more than a decade, all 28 middle schools in Fairfax County sent students to TJ in 2021. By contrast, in 2020, eight of the County’s middle schools had received zero offers of admission to TJ.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the changes also produced steep declines in Asian American students, who received only 54% of admissions offers for the Class of 2025. White students received 22% of offers, Hispanic students 11% and Black students 8%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Coalition for TJ, an advocacy group of Fairfax County public school parents, has repeatedly challenged the admissions changes, arguing that the changes in admissions were unconstitutional because they discriminated against Asian American students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February 2022, the coalition won its case in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, which ruled the new policy unfairly impacted Asian American applicants. But the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned that decision </span><a href="https://pacificlegal.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-05-23-circuit-opinion-coalitition-for-tj-v-fairfax-county-school-board.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in May</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Coalition subsequently appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Since June 2020, we&#8217;ve poured our hearts and souls into this fight, and it&#8217;s profoundly disappointing to see the justices end our legal battle,” the coalition stated.</p>
<p>Alito and Thomas&#8217; dissent &#8220;serves as a rallying cry, reminding us of the importance of our cause and urging continued vigilance in combating proxy discrimination,” the coalition said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fairfax County School Board praised the decision. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have long believed that the new admissions process is both constitutional and in the best interest of all of our students. It guarantees that all qualified students from all neighborhoods in Fairfax County have a fair shot at attending this exceptional high school,” said board Chair Karl Frisch in a </span><a href="https://www.fcps.edu/news/fcps-statement-supreme-courts-decision-regarding-tjhsst" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statement</span></a></p>

<p>Motor vehicle thefts increased by 29% in 2023 compared with the previous year, while carjackings slightly decreased by 5% in nearly 40 American cities, according to the Council on Criminal Justice’s most recent <a href="https://counciloncj.org/year-end-2023-crime-trends/#offense-reports" target="_blank">crime trends report</a>.

	</div>
<p>The five cities with the highest year-over-year increases in motor vehicle theft between 2022 and 2023 were Rochester, New York; Baltimore; Buffalo, New York; Charlotte, North Carolina; and Cincinnati. The cities with the highest carjacking rates per 100,000 residents in 2023 were the District of Columbia; Baltimore; Memphis, Tennessee; Chicago; and Denver.</p>
<p>Many have blamed the surge in auto theft on a social media trend among teenagers that exposes vulnerabilities in certain kinds of cars, especially Kia and Hyundai models. But the varying reliability of motor vehicle theft data at different law enforcement levels and the scarcity of national carjacking data make it hard to determine what — or who — is responsible for the spikes.</p>
<p>As with many other crimes, there is limited FBI data on carjackings and motor vehicle thefts because law enforcement agencies differ in how they collect and submit their data. The federal Bureau of Justice Statistics also has not released any updated statistics on carjackings since October 2022, which tracked crimes committed through 2021. That poses a significant challenge for policymakers trying to allocate police resources to the communities that need them most.</p>
<p>“We certainly don&#8217;t want people flying blind making decisions with respect to public safety,” said Alex Piquero, a criminology professor at the University of Miami and the former director of the Bureau of Justice Statistics.</p>
<p>Anecdotal evidence on social media can heavily shape public perceptions of safety and crime, Ernesto Lopez, a research specialist at the Council on Criminal Justice, wrote in an email to Stateline.</p>
<p>Josh Rovner, the director of youth justice at The Sentencing Project, agreed that “the scraps of information that we have about youth involvement is very easy to overstate and misunderstand.”</p>

<p>Carjacking data, especially at the national level, is hard to come by. And despite the greater availability of motor vehicle theft data, its reliability varies across different law enforcement levels, with some local departments failing to submit their data to federal agencies and others not collecting the information at all.</p>
<p>“We need more local law enforcement agencies to produce that data — not just internally for their own community to report out to the community, but also for policy action,” Piquero said.</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What the data says</h4>

	</h4>
<p>Since reaching its peak in the 1990s, overall crime in the United States has declined. In 2022, the most recent year with available data, there were 23.5 violent crimes for every 1,000 Americans aged 12 and older, according to the <a href="https://bjs.ojp.gov/document/cv22.pdf" target="_blank">National Crime Victimization Survey</a>.</p>
<p>The violent victimization rate increased by 42% in 2022 compared with 2021, but the past three decades have seen an overall decline.</p>

<p>Carjackings and motor vehicle thefts, however, are up compared with before the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. It’s hard to say exactly what’s behind the surge, but some crime experts suggest that the economic turmoil during the pandemic, coupled with the relative ease of stealing cars or parts for financial gain, increased the attractiveness of car-related crime.</p>
<p>Carjackings are less common than auto thefts but more violent. In a carjacking the perpetrator directly confronts the vehicle&#8217;s owner, while auto theft typically occurs when a car is unoccupied. Motor vehicle theft includes stealing entire cars or specific parts such as tires, rims or catalytic converters. The difference between the two offenses is whether force is used to steal a car.</p>
<p>In the District of Columbia, the city&#8217;s police department recorded 958 carjackings last year but only made 173 arrests, according to the <a href="https://mpdc.dc.gov/page/carjacking" target="_blank">Metropolitan Police Department’s carjacking dashboard</a>. Sixty-two percent of those suspects were under the age of 18.</p>
<p>Juveniles might be overrepresented in D.C.’s arrest numbers because they are easier to apprehend, or because they tend to commit crimes together, said Rovner, of The Sentencing Project.</p>
<p>Nationwide, the number of adults and juveniles arrested for motor vehicle theft has consistently declined since the 1980s, according to data from the federal Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the juvenile arrest rate was about four times higher than adults, an analysis of federal data by the Council on Criminal Justice found. By 2020, the rates for both adults and juveniles were about the same.</p>

	</div>
<p>Misconceptions such as an overemphasis on the role juveniles play in carjackings and auto thefts can lead to misguided policies that may not enhance public safety and, in some cases, may exacerbate the situation, according to Josh Weber, deputy director in the corrections and reentry division of the Council of State Governments Justice Center, a think tank focused on breaking the cycle of incarceration.</p>
<p>“[These misconceptions] tend to lead to more reactionary and punitive policies rather than policies that are necessarily grounded in research and data,” said Weber, who also directs the center’s juvenile justice program.</p>
<p>“Research has consistently shown that detaining more kids, incarcerating more kids, pushing more kids into the juvenile justice system is a bad public safety strategy,” Weber added. “It actually increases the likelihood that kids will reoffend.”</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Addressing the surge in vehicular crime</h4>

	</h4>
<p>The “super predator” mindset of the 1990s, fueled by fears of a generation of remorseless and violent young offenders, significantly shaped criminal justice policies for decades. This crime theory led to harsher penalties, higher juvenile incarceration rates and a focus on punitive measures rather than rehabilitation.</p>
<p>“We are always at risk when people are afraid of crime and instinctually just up penalties. We’ve been here before,” Rovner said. “One of the responses that comes up is the idea that a serious response is about sending kids to adult courts or adult jails or adult prisons, and that is absolutely the worst response when it comes to public safety.”</p>
<p>Instead, some experts say shifting toward evidence-based approaches that not only address crime but also provide support for youth, such as investing in behavioral health services and community-based initiatives aimed at reducing and preventing violence, would be more effective.</p>
<p>“Despite the rhetoric, despite the media stories — it’s really focusing on data- and research-driven policies and not just things that sound good,” said Weber, of the Council of State Governments Justice Center.</p>
<p>“This shouldn&#8217;t be a partisan issue,” Weber said. “Having data-driven and research-based practices is something that should appeal to both sides of the aisle.”</p>
<p>Crime experts say vehicle owners also can take simple yet crucial precautions, such as avoiding leaving cars unlocked or running unattended, to significantly reduce the risk of theft. And policymakers at all levels of government are increasingly urging car manufacturers to be held accountable for the design of vehicles that might be vulnerable to break-ins.</p>
<p>“It’s important to recognize that the data can certainly guide us,” Rovner said. “Regardless of whether arrests go up or arrests go down, what we should be interested in is what&#8217;s best for kids and what&#8217;s best for public safety.”</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three former and current female employees of the Virginia Department of Corrections are pursuing a class-action lawsuit against the agency, saying its policies on body scanners discriminate against women.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The inability of the state’s body-scanner technology to distinguish between contraband like drugs and menstrual products such as tampons, menstrual cups and intrauterine devices has led to multiple women being strip searched and in some cases terminated for using menstrual products, allege Mallory Patterson, Emily Comer and Carla McDowney. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No one should have their job threatened, be subjected to a strip search, or have their employment terminated simply because they are menstruating, using a feminine hygiene product, or using a contraceptive device at work,” states the women’s lawsuit, which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia this November. “Such conduct is sex discrimination in violation of federal law.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patterson and Comer, two former employees of VADOC, and McDowney, a correctional officer in training, are suing the agency and Director Chadwick Dotson over treatment they say they experienced, as well as seeking the court’s approval to open a class-action case. Dotson took over the Virginia Department of Corrections’ top post in September 2023. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roughly 46% of the agency’s 13,000 employees are female, the suit notes. The department also employs about 1,000 more people through staffing companies. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In September 2022, a federal jury found </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/09/20/virginia-prison-agency-discriminated-against-female-employee-in-tampon-case-jury-rules/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VADOC had discriminated against dental hygienist Joyce Flores</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when it fired her after a body scanner at Augusta Correctional Center detected a tampon she was wearing and officials suspected she was trying to bring contraband into the prison. U.S. District Judge Elizabeth K. Dillon later awarded Flores, who was also strip searched, around $287,000 in damages, costs and attorney’s fees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The search “was one of the worst things I ever had to do in my life,” Flores told the Mercury this January. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I couldn’t believe I was going through this process,” she said. “And I couldn’t believe in a state facility that it would be permitted to have things like this go on.”  </span></p>
<p>Patterson, Comer and McDowney are being represented by Paul Falabella of Butler Curwood, PLC, which also represented Flores.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to several questions about the most recent suit and whether VADOC had changed its policy on body scanners after the Flores ruling, agency spokesperson Kyle Gibson said only that “VADOC does not routinely comment on active or pending litigation.” After receiving an extension from the courts, the agency has until Feb. 24 to file a response to the suit. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Employees describe strip searches and terminations</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two of the women bringing the lawsuit allege that after body scanners detected their menstrual products, prison officials gave them the choice of being strip searched or being terminated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the suit, Patterson, who was employed through a contractor as a therapeutic counselor at Indian Creek Correctional Center in Chesapeake, was flagged as suspicious after going through a body scanner on Nov. 10, 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she told an investigator she was wearing a menstrual cup, the lawsuit says the investigator told her she had two options: “Comply with a strip search or leave and be separated from employment, pending potential criminal charges.” The suit says she agreed to the search because she felt it was the only way “to keep her job, prove her innocence, and avoid criminal charges.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she wept while signing the strip search consent form, the suit says a corrections official told her, “This happens to some staff every year and each one of them feels just like you do right now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the court filing, three officers then took Patterson “into the bathroom and proceeded to instruct her to take every piece of clothing off until she was standing naked on the dirty bathroom floor. Patterson was then instructed to remove and show her menstrual cup to the officers, which she did. Patterson was crying the entire time.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next month, she resigned because she “felt she could not continue to work in the environment at” Indian Creek Correctional. </span></p>

	</div>
	</div>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McDowney, who began working as a correctional officer in training at Haynesville Correctional Center in Richmond County in August 2023, says in the lawsuit that she was wearing a tampon and sanitary pad when she was stopped at the facility’s body scanner on Oct. 27, 2023. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the warden asked if McDowney consented to a strip search, “McDowney asked ‘and if I don’t?’ The Warden replied then ‘you don’t have a job,’” the suit says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After she agreed to the search, McDowney was taken into a bathroom, where VADOC officials “searched each clothing item as she removed them until she was standing barefoot and completely naked on the dirty bathroom floor,” the court filing says. “She was then instructed to remove her tampon and sanitary pad, which she did.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After re-dressing, the suit says that McDowney asked the warden, “‘If I go through this machine again next month and I am on my period again, am I going to have to go through something like this again?’ The Warden shrugged his shoulders and made a facial expression that indicated ‘maybe.’”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comer was employed through a staffing agency as a licensed practical nurse at State Farm Correctional Center in Goochland between April 2020 and April 2022. On April 4, 2022, the lawsuit says, she was stopped at the body scanner. Although she was not menstruating, she had an IUD, a device implanted in the uterus that prevents conception. On April 7, she was informed that the warden had decided she wasn’t allowed back into the facility “due to suspicious body scans.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flores told the Mercury that before her own strip search in December 2019, “I had heard that there were a couple of women that were dismissed and that one of them had been accused of bringing in contraband in her vagina. But I didn’t know the specifics. I had heard from other women that if you are on your period, just be careful coming in.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some women, she said, told her “that in order to get through the day, they’d push their limits with the feminine products so they wouldn’t have to change them while they were there.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Agency policy</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than isolated incidents, both Flores’ lawsuit and the action brought by Patterson, McDowney and Comer contend their searches were the product of agency policy that is inherently discriminatory toward women because it results in strip searches or firings that are not imposed on men, who do not menstruate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both federal Judge Thomas Cullen and a jury agreed with that claim in Flores’ suit, with Cullen </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-prison-staffer-says-she-was-fired-on-suspicion-of-smuggling-after-body-scan-detected-tampon/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ruling in February 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that “but for Flores’s menstruation and use of a tampon — conditions inextricable from her sex and her child-bearing capacity — she would not have been discharged.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most recent lawsuit says the Virginia Department of Corrections’ standard operating procedures require all people entering a correctional facility, including employees, to go through the body scanner. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While VADOC does not make its </span><a href="https://vadoc.virginia.gov/general-public/operating-procedures/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">operating procedures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for searches of inmates and other persons publicly available on its website, a copy of the procedures filed in the Flores case states that “when an unknown object is detected on an employee, intern, volunteer, or official visitor, the Facility Unit Head or Administrative Duty Officer may authorize a strip search.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, it declares that “all facility employees are subject to search as a condition of employment,” and “employee refusal to submit to a search … is justification for barring the individual from the facility and possible termination.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The document containing those procedures was filed with the court in February 2022 but may have been updated since then. However, the Department of Corrections said it was unable to fulfill a Freedom of Information Act request for a copy of “t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he agency&#8217;s SOPs for screenings and searches of persons” within five working days and would require an additional seven. An agency spokesperson also did not provide an answer to a question about whether the department had changed its operating procedures after the Flores case. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VADOC has previously argued the scanners are necessary to crack down on contraband flowing into prisons. Some of the illegal material smuggled into facilities comes from employees: During the COVID-19 pandemic, with all visitation halted, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2021/05/24/drugs-continued-to-flow-into-virginia-prisons-amid-pandemic-raising-concerns-about-corrupt-staff/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">positive drug tests for inmates rose</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and drug seizures and overdoses fell only slightly. On Jan. 3, the agency announced </span><a href="https://vadoc.virginia.gov/news-press-releases/2024/vadoc-finds-contraband-on-female-contractor-after-body-scan-at-indian-creek-correctional-center/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a staffer had attempted to smuggle tobacco</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into Indian Creek Correctional Center by concealing it in her groin area. In October, </span><a href="https://vadoc.virginia.gov/news-press-releases/2023/vadoc-employee-arrested-after-intelligence-leads-to-contraband-search/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an employee at Sussex I State Prison was arrested</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after a search of their vehicle found nine cell phones and other cell phone equipment, five packages of tobacco and tobacco wrapping papers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flores said during her own strip search, officials showed “absolutely no sympathy.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In their mind, they knew that I had something in my body that resembled more to them to be like contraband than to be like a tampon,” she said. “They were very matter of fact. They were cold.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VADOC officials have repeatedly said their scanners are unable to tell the difference between menstrual products and contraband. Internal agency memos have said that the state’s body scanner technology “is not perfect and it is not able to distinguish tampons from contraband” and “body scanners cannot differentiate between tampons/menstrual cups or other contraband in a body cavity.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/blog-va/prison-officials-say-theyre-still-blocking-women-wearing-tampons-from-full-visitation-privileges-over-contraband-concerns/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an agency employee told the General Assembly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “We can’t tell what’s in someone as they go through a body scanner. We just can’t tell if it’s drugs or a tampon. It just shows if there’s something wrong.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The statement followed public outcry over an earlier policy that </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-prison-bans-female-visitors-from-wearing-tampons/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">banned women from wearing tampons while visiting prisons</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. After the furor, then-Virginia Secretary of Public Safety and Homeland Security Brian Moran suspended the policy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flores said her time with the agency frequently “felt like I was experiencing remnants of sexism.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was acutely aware that other women were having trouble feeling comfortable while they were menstruating,” she said. After her own search and termination, she said she realized “that there were likely other women who had gone through what I had been put through.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I knew what happened to me could never happen to a man biologically,” she said.  </span></p>

The state of Ohio is one of the few states that still uses the electric chair, and it gives death row inmates a choice between death by the electric chair or by lethal injection. John W. Byrd, who will be executed on September 12, 2001, has stated that he will choose the electric chair.

It is, after all, about the most profound and irreversible thing a government can do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet this year, not three years after Virginia banned capital punishment, freshman Del. Tim Griffin, R-Bedford, submitted a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+fuh+HB394+700608" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to reinstate it. Mercifully, it was doomed from the outset in the Democratic-ruled House of Delegates. With all due allowances for naïveté, political posturing or whatever Griffin’s motivation, the death penalty isn’t a light switch you flip on and off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It took Virginia more than 400 years to end capital punishment. When the General Assembly finally did it in 2021, there was even miniscule Republican buy-in on</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+vot+SV0269HB2263+HB2263" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">final</span></a><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+vot+HC1505+HB2263" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">votes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that made Virginia the only former Confederate state to dismantle death row in favor of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for the most heinous offenses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ours is among 23 states that have abolished the death penalty. Six others have halted executions by governors’ orders. Only five states executed people last year, and death sentences were imposed in just seven states,</span><a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/facts-and-research/dpic-reports/dpic-year-end-reports/the-death-penalty-in-2023-year-end-report" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">according to</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Things were once quite different. Until this century, Virginia was an enthusiastic death penalty backer and practitioner. Since Jamestown, Virginia has executed an estimated</span><a href="https://www.vadp.org/dp-info/virginias-execution-history/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">1,300</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Supreme Court halted capital punishment in the latter third of the 20th century after it found its disparate implementation unconstitutionally “cruel and unusual.” After the court reinstated it in 1976, Virginia executed 113 inmates, according to the DPIC. That ranks third behind Texas (586) and Oklahoma (123) — body counts that will soon grow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just the suggestion that a candidate </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">might not</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> support killing people to prove that killing people is wrong was politically disqualifying. It was a common Republican tactic to force Democratic candidates in statewide general elections to pledge support for the death penalty, putting them at odds with many in their own base to remain viable with the broader electorate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this century, Republicans failed to notice that Virginia’s appetite for state-sanctioned killings was waning and had been for some time. Part of that is because of demographic changes, especially in the moderate, educated, affluent and fast-growing suburbs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another factor was a by-product of a hugely successful Republican initiative that George Allen brought to the governor’s office from his 1993 election landslide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the General Assembly overwhelmingly enacted Allen’s abolition of parole in 1994, it meant that an inmate sentenced to life in prison would actually spend the rest of his life </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in prison</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For jurors, that assurance eased the moral crisis they felt when deciding whether to prescribe death for a person sitting steps away from them. Assured that the convict could never walk free again, jurors increasingly eschewed death sentences and the haunting knowledge that they played a role in taking someone’s life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The numbers tell the story. After the court-ordered hiatus, it took a few years for new death penalty convictions to exhaust their federal and state appeals. Executions resumed in Virginia in 1982. For the rest of that decade, eight people perished in the state’s death chamber. During the 1990s, however, the decade parole was abolished, the total soared to 58. From 2000 through 2009, the total was cut in half, to just 28. And from 2010 through 2017, the year William Morva became the last convict executed in Virginia, it dropped to eight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ’90s were also the most robust decade for executions nationally, peaking with 98 in 1999,</span><a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/facts-and-research/dpic-reports/dpic-year-end-reports/the-death-penalty-in-2023-year-end-report#public-opinion" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">according to the DPIC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Death penalty politics reached a significant political flashpoint in Virginia’s 2005 gubernatorial race between Democrat Tim Kaine, the lieutenant governor at the time and now a U.S. senator, and Republican Jerry Kilgore, who had been the state’s attorney general. In a</span><a href="https://youtu.be/o9x60sCHs5Q" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Kilgore campaign ad</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the grieving father of a murder victim claimed that Kaine, a lawyer who had defended a death penalty client and a Roman Catholic with a faith-based objection to the death penalty, would have spared Adolf Hitler from execution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ad was widely panned as a gratuitous, tone-deaf overreach, and it boomeranged on Kilgore’s campaign as it was already imploding. Kaine quickly aired</span><a href="https://youtu.be/Ec5o6qOoKdY?si=1Uck1qTSw0Wabz5S" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a rebuttal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in which he spoke directly into the camera and said that he would “carry out death sentences imposed by Virginia juries because that’s the law.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And he did — 11 times from the day he took office in January 2006 through the end of his term four years later. The last to be executed under Kaine’s watch was</span><a href="https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&amp;&amp;p=0f55834a5ebf2957JmltdHM9MTcwNjY1OTIwMCZpZ3VpZD0wYTcxMmYwZi03NzdjLTY5YzItMzYxOS0zYzhjNzZjYjY4MDgmaW5zaWQ9NTU1NQ&amp;ptn=3&amp;ver=2&amp;hsh=3&amp;fclid=0a712f0f-777c-69c2-3619-3c8c76cb6808&amp;psq=death+penalty+from+the+d.c.+snipers+2002&amp;u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaGlzdG9yeS5jb20vdGhpcy1kYXktaW4taGlzdG9yeS93YXNoaW5ndG9uLWQtYy1zbmlwZXItam9obi1tdWhhbW1hZC1jb252aWN0ZWQjOn46dGV4dD1Kb2huJTIwTXVoYW1tYWQlMjB3YXMlMjBzZW50ZW5jZWQlMjB0byUyMGRlYXRoJTIwb24lMjBNYXJjaCxsaWZlJTIwaW4lMjBwcmlzb24lMjB3aXRob3V0JTIwdGhlJTIwcG9zc2liaWxpdHklMjBvZiUyMHBhcm9sZS4&amp;ntb=1" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">John Allan Muhammad</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, convicted as one of the two snipers who terrorized Virginia, the District of Columbia and Maryland in 2002, shooting 10 people dead and injuring three.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capital punishment is an emotional issue that almost evenly divides the nation. A</span><a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/news/poll-for-the-first-time-more-americans-believe-the-death-penalty-is-applied-unfairly-in-the-united-states" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">2023 Gallup poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showed that 50% of those surveyed said they felt the death penalty is unfairly applied compared to 47% who felt it was fairly applied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider the obvious: Very few people of means go to death row. It’s a different story if you’re Black or poor. Of the</span><a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/states-landing" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">113 executed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Virginia inmates, 52 of them — 46% — were Black, a ratio more than double the state’s Black population of 20%. For defendants who can’t afford skilled, experienced death-penalty litigators, the odds are even worse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is our criminal justice system so infallible that it should green-light actions as irrevocable as taking another person’s life? Hardly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the DPIC, 196 people sentenced to death nationally since 1973 have been exonerated, including Virginia’s</span><a href="https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/casedetail.aspx?caseid=3721" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Earl Washington</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Jr., who was poor </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Black. Washington, with an IQ of 69, spent 16 years incarcerated — nine on death row, once within days of being executed — because of false and misleading forensic evidence, woeful trial counsel and his own coerced confession. Gov. Doug Wilder commuted his sentence to life imprisonment in 1993. Gov. Jim Gilmore pardoned Washington in 2000 after DNA testing, not available at the time of his trial in 1984, exonerated him from the murder and rape for which he was convicted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griffin’s misbegotten bid to restore capital punishment foundered just before an Alabama execution underscored misgivings Americans increasingly harbor about terminal punishment more suited to despotic regimes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like many states unable to procure the drugs necessary to execute people by lethal injection, Alabama tested a novel way to kill: subjecting the condemned – strapped to a gurney – to pure nitrogen, depriving him of oxygen. Alabama’s attorney general called it “a textbook execution,” promised further hypoxia executions in Alabama and offered to tutor other states in its use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Associated Press writer Kim Chandler, a witness to the execution, described something much more unnerving. For about two minutes, according to</span><a href="https://d.docs.live.net/2812febced1923cf/Documents/Custom%20Office%20Templates/shake%20and%20writhe%20violently,%20in%20thrashing%20spasms%20and%20seizure-like%20movements,%20at%20about%207:58%20p.m.%20The%20force%20of%20his%20movements%20caused%20the%20gurney%20to%20visibly%20move%20at%20least%20once." target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">AP’s first-person account</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, condemned murderer Kenneth Eugene Smith shook and writhed violently, “in thrashing spasms and seizure-like movements,” the force of which “caused the gurney to visibly move at least once.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no way to inflict death on a confined, terrified human being that doesn’t horrify an ordinary person. That’s because no matter the method — an intravenous drip of lethal drugs, electrical voltage, a noose, a firing squad or nitrogen gas — the end result is a fresh corpse. Each is just as final, its victims just as eternally dead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If those methods knot your stomach, then maybe our conversations should be about whether governments should execute people, not how.</span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s assertion this month that the state’s gun laws are already strong enough for his liking isn’t deterring Democrats from moving forward with major proposals limiting access to firearms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Policymaking committees in both chambers of the General Assembly have started to advance significant gun control bills while defeating Republican efforts to repeal existing gun restrictions and make guns legal to carry in more places.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On both sides of the legislature, bills to prohibit future sales of assault-style weapons and high-capacity magazines have passed out of committee on party-line votes. So have bills to ban so-called “ghost guns,” untraceable firearms assembled at home often with do-it-yourself kits that can be purchased online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other bills have been introduced to impose a five-day waiting period for all firearm purchases, require buyers to prove competency through gun safety courses, create a $500 civil penalty for leaving a handgun visible in an unattended vehicle, remove gun rights from anyone who gets two DUI convictions within five years, prohibit existing assault weapons from being carried in public and require state-issued permits prior to any gun purchase. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of that legislation has not yet been heard in committee. But regardless of how Democratic legislators fine-tune the details, few gun control proposals are expected to win the favor of the Republican governor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, Youngkin spokesman Christian Martinez said the governor will review all legislation but reiterated a line from Youngkin’s recent State of the Commonwealth speech calling Virginia’s gun laws “already among the toughest in the nation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He’s asking the General Assembly members to hold accountable those criminals that commit crimes with guns by lengthening and making more severe the penalties in order to keep criminals off the streets,” Martinez said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That echoes much of the criticism raised by GOP lawmakers and gun rights groups in committee hearings, where opponents have characterized the proposals as misguided and potentially unconstitutional due to the U.S. Supreme Court’s </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/23/us/supreme-court-ny-open-carry-gun-law.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">newly expanded view</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the right to carry firearms outside the home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But proponents of tougher gun laws appear unswayed, pitching the new bills as common-sense attempts to stop gun violence before it happens rather than doubling down on efforts to pursue lawbreakers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We expect the governor to support these measures and to save lives in the commonwealth,” said Lori Haas, a longtime gun violence prevention activist whose daughter was wounded in the 2007 mass shooting at Virginia Tech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most votes on gun bills this session have broken down predictably along party lines, with occasionally contentious debate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a House of Delegates subcommittee hearing last week on the assault weapon bill, Del. A.C. Cordoza, R-Hampton, one of the few Black Republicans in state politics, pointedly noted that rifles of any kind are rarely used in gun homicides or suicides. Most gun murders, he said, involve handguns being used against Black men.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why do you not have a bill that’s going to stop this violence against African Americans?” Cordoza said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, the patron of the assault weapon bill, said Democrats have filed numerous pieces of legislation aimed at stopping more common forms of gun violence.</span></p>
<p>https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/northam-signs-landmark-gun-control-bills-recommends-tweaks-to-two-others/</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I find it deeply disturbing that the delegate has no interest in stopping 5% of the murders in the commonwealth,” Helmer said. “Because I think 5% is too much.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Marcus Simon, D-Fairfax, also jumped in, saying he would be happy to debate Cordoza at any time about which party has a better record of trying to prevent gun violence in communities of color.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is not an either-or situation,” said Simon, who chairs the House Public Safety Committee. “I can’t let that suggestion lay there. I can’t let that go.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The assault weapon bill cleared the House Public Safety Committee last week in an 11-9 vote. Its counterpart in the other chamber got a green light in the Senate Courts of Justice Committee Monday in a 9-6 vote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defining what assault weapons are has been a challenge for lawmakers in the past. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+ful+SB2+pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> under consideration this year defines them as weapons capable of being used with high-capacity magazines and other modifications like stocks, grips and suppressors. The proposal excludes such weapons made prior to July 1, a concession that allows assault weapon owners to keep firearms they already purchased legally. The restrictions would only apply to assault weapons manufactured after the ban were to take effect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate committee rejected an effort to repeal Virginia’s so-called red flag law, which was part of a major gun control package Democrats approved in 2020 and allows authorities to temporarily take firearms from people deemed a threat to others or themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Glen Sturtevant, R-Chesterfield, made a lawyerly case for the bill’s repeal, indicating he sees it more as a question of due process rights and limitations on government seizures of property. But Democrats on the panel reminded Sturtevant — who lost a swing seat in 2019 and returned this year after unseating former GOP Sen. Amanda Chase in a redder district — that he previously thought red flag laws were a promising idea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You voted for it in 2019,” said Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville. “Now you want to take it off the books. How come?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sturtevant said the bill that passed in 2020 wasn’t identical to the one he voted for in 2019. The law’s problems, he said, have become more apparent over time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats on the panel disputed that notion, saying the law has now been used more than 1,000 times without any serious legal challenges poking holes in its due process provisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Youngkin is widely expected to veto the most sweeping gun bills Democrats send to him, more modest proposals could be more difficult for the governor to flatly reject.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats have been pushing to toughen the state’s laws on safe gun storage via bills that would make gun owners liable if a minor gets ahold of a firearm and uses it to commit a crime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presenting a bill to allow fines for gun owners who leave handguns visible to passersby in an unattended vehicle, Sen. Dave Marsden, D-Fairfax, said he hopes the governor can support his proposal to reduce what he described as rampant gun thefts from cars. The bill doesn’t come with criminal penalties, he noted, and he specifically excluded long guns to avoid impacting hunters and others who might have a gun rack in the cab of a truck.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a minimalist approach to dealing with a huge problem,” Marsden said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gun rights supporters said the proposal effectively fines someone for being the victim of a crime and authorities should instead focus their efforts on catching and prosecuting those who steal guns out of cars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Punish them,” said Sen. Mark Peake, R-Lynchburg. “Send a message.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One proposal has picked up some bipartisan support in early committee votes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With backing from the Richmond Police Department, freshman Del. Mike Jones, D-Richmond, is sponsoring a bill to ban auto sears, which are small plastic or metal devices that can be used to turn semi-automatic guns into automatics by rapidly emptying all ammunition with a single trigger pull. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That proposal has gotten unanimous support in House committee votes so far, and gun rights groups have said they’re neutral on the matter because the bill largely aligns with federal law that already restricts use of the devices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Senate Republicans, however, raised concerns that the proposal might be overbroad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You want these things to be illegal, period, so that criminals can’t get them to harm people with,” said Sen. Richard Stuart, R-Westmoreland, who voted to advance the bill as four of his GOP colleagues opposed it.  “You wouldn’t have an objection to somebody shooting a watermelon in a field? You’ve got 1,500 acres and you’re in a 300-acre field of corn and they want to do it for fun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Russet Perry, D-Loudoun, said the bill she’s sponsoring is an effort to address a public safety issue posed by widely available devices that help guns spray more bullets with less control.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you’re trying to kill a watermelon,” added gun violence prevention activist Andrew Goddard, “you probably wouldn’t want the gun flailing all over the place anyway.”</span></p>

(Danielle Gaines / Maryland Matters) </p><p>A Howard County, Maryland man was sentenced to two years in prison Thursday after pleading guilty last year to threatening Virginia and Maryland state lawmakers and a group that advocates for LGBTQI+ people.</p>
<p>Adam Michael Nettina, 34, of West Friendship, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge George L. Russell III. After his release from prison, he must also serve three years of supervised release.</p>
<p>“You have the right to your own opinions, but you don’t have the right to threaten the lives of those who disagree with you. As this case demonstrates, free speech does not include violent threats against others,” U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Erek L. Barron said in a statement. “We’ll continue prosecuting these threats to the fullest extent of the law.”</p>

<p>According to the U.S. Attorney’s Office, Nettina left multiple voicemails on the night of March 28, 2023, at the Human Rights Campaign, a Washington, D.C.-based advocacy organization.<br />
In the expletive-laced messages, Nettina made multiple threats, including, “We’ll cut your throats. We’ll put a bullet in your head.”</p>
<p>In August, prosecutors added additional charges of making threats to two state lawmakers.</p>
<p>Messages to a Virginia delegate were sent in October 2022, according to the plea agreement. A spokesperson for former Del. Elizabeth Guzman (D-Prince William) previously confirmed she is the Virginia delegate listed in the documents.</p>
<p>On Oct. 15, 2022, Nettina sent an email to Guzman&#8217;s press email account, stating: “The delegate is a terrorist. You are a terrorist. You deserve to be shot and hung in the streets. You want to come after people? Let’s go b**ch.” Nettina also sent a similar message to another email address of the delegate two minutes later, according to prosecutors.</p>
<p>The plea states that the emails were sent two days after a news story that included an interview with Guzman “in which she advocated for the prevention of abuse towards transgender children.”</p>
<p>Other threats were sent to Maryland Del. Nick Allen (D-Baltimore County). Allen was threatened in March 2022 when he was a candidate for office and posted a message of support on social media in honor of the Trans Day of Visibility. He received additional threats in November.</p>
<p>On election night, when Allen won his race, Nettina sent a series of Facebook messages calling the delegate-elect a “Baby killing terrorist” and wishing death on the candidate and his wife.</p>
<p>“Enjoy hell You’re going sooner than you think,” the messages stated, according to prosecutors.</p>
<p>Allen, who was not publicly named in the plea agreement, said in August that he and Nettina were former classmates.</p>
<p>“It’s clear that we have a mental health crisis in this country. And we have a hate crisis in this country. And those things tend to overlap in violent ways,” Allen said in the August interview. “I hope we will begin to see less of these kinds of things and less violence and less violent rhetoric.”</p>
<p>In case filings, Nettina’s attorneys sought his release to an inpatient treatment program and argued that while he was accused of making threats, there was no evidence that he had made any effort to act on them.</p>
<p>“His words were offensive and harmful, but Mr. Nettina is not an individual who has acted on, or sought to act on, the threat,” his attorney, Joseph Murtha, wrote in April.</p>

																						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1024" height="683" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Getty_gavel.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="" style="margin-bottom: 10px;" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Getty_gavel.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Getty_gavel-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Getty_gavel-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p style="font-size:12px;">(Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a reversal of an earlier decision, the Virginia Court of Appeals ruled Tuesday that an officer’s stop of two Black men in a Waynesboro neighborhood on suspicion of involvement in a home invasion that had just occurred had not violated one man&#8217;s rights against unreasonable seizure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In <a href="https://www.vacourts.gov/opinions/opncavwp/0868213.pdf" target="_blank">a majority opinion</a>, Judge Lisa Lorish wrote that the officer “possessed a reasonable, articulable suspicion of criminal activity to briefly detain” one of the men until other officers arrived within several minutes to provide additional information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judges Dominique Callins and Vernida Chaney both dissented, with Chaney writing in a sharply worded opinion that “today, while purporting to ‘make no new law,’ the majority grants police license to seize a Black man at gunpoint for merely walking late at night within the wide general area of a recent crime and ‘matching’ the race and gender of the suspects.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The case stems from a home invasion and pistol-whipping in Waynesboro that was reported by the victims around 11 p.m on a night in February 2020. After police responded to the home, officers issued a “be on the lookout” dispatch for three armed Black men “wearing black sweatshirts.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dispatch was heard by Augusta County Sheriff’s Deputy C. Stroop, who went by the house, spoke to officers there and then began to drive around the neighborhood to look for the perpetrators. Within what the court later determined were six to 10 blocks from the crime scene, he saw two Black men, Arun Rashid Turay and Justice Ahmed Carr, walking and stopped them at gunpoint. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roughly one and a half to two minutes later, other Waynesboro officers arrived. One of the responding officers confirmed Turay’s clothing matched security video footage but said Carr’s did not. When the men were searched, officers found credit cards belonging to one of the victims in Carr’s pocket and a victim’s keys and bloody clothes and shoes in a bookbag on Turay. Both men were arrested and later pled guilty to armed burglary and other charges after the court decided that the evidence found as a result of Stroop’s stop could be considered in the case. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In different cases, Turay and Carr each appealed the Waynesboro judge’s decision not to suppress that evidence. Turay’s challenges have sparked a string of different rulings from the Virginia Court of Appeals, which has flip-flopped on whether the stop was constitutional, ruling first against Turay, then in his favor and, most recently, against him once more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turay had argued that the evidence from the searches shouldn’t be allowed to be used because Stroop’s stop was an unconstitutional seizure not supported by “reasonable suspicion” that he was involved in the robbery. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. and Virginia courts have dealt at length with the thorny question of what constitutes reasonable suspicion. In Virginia, the courts have assessed, among other tests, whether an officer’s reasonable suspicion is based on “specific and articulable facts” as well as “an assessment of the totality of the circumstances.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the case of a stop related to a specific crime, the appeals court on Tuesday wrote that an officer could consider factors such as a person’s distance from where a crime is committed, the amount of time that has elapsed between the crime and the stop, the degree to which a person matches a description of a suspect, the suspect’s behavior and how many other people matching a description might be present. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her opinion, Lorish conceded that the vague description of the suspects in the be-on-the-lookout dispatch “was too general to give rise to reasonable suspicion to detain any person.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Without more, this vague description could not allow police to reasonably detain any Black male wearing dark clothing as a suspect in the crime,” she wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, she continued, other circumstances were relevant: Turay and Carr were seen within 10 blocks of the crime scene and within roughly 30 minutes of the police report. They were on foot. And they were the only people walking in the neighborhood late on a cold February night. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These factors all increase the relevance of Turay matching what would otherwise be a vague or general description,” the court found. Ultimately, it determined, “we cannot say Deputy Stroop lacked reasonable suspicion under the totality of the circumstances.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dissenting judges, however, argued the ruling “disregards the well-established protections of the Fourth Amendment and, in effect, authorizes race-based seizures of persons who appear to be engaged in innocent, lawful activity.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chaney contended that “at the time of the seizure, there was no particularized, objective basis for suspecting Turay of criminal activity.” Instead of the black sweatshirt described in the be-on-the-lookout announcement, she noted, Turay was wearing “a long-sleeved black top with a wide red stripe down each sleeve and a wide blue panel on each side,” while Carr was wearing a “long-sleeved white top.” Neither appeared to be armed. Only two men were walking, rather than the three described in the dispatch. And, the judge maintained, the deputy only testified that “not a lot” of people were around rather than saying definitively he had seen no one else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The totality of the facts and circumstances known at the time of the seizure does not give rise to reasonable, articulable suspicion that Turay participated in the robbery even if no other people were observed out on the street when the deputy first observed Turay,” she wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, Callins said the majority ruling “would be akin to holding that, when a Black man commits a crime and flees, any Black man in the vicinity is inherently a suspect.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Racially motivated stops are a pervasive problem in our society, and we must examine whether a stop could be justified by any information available to the officer before determining that the stop was illegal,” she wrote. “But I cannot say, given the totality of the circumstances, that this stop justified as particularized.”</span></p>

(JW Caterine / For Virginia Mercury</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Corrections will close four prisons and take control of the state’s only privately operated prison this summer, officials said Friday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Augusta Correctional Center, Sussex II State Prison, Haynesville Correctional Unit #17 and Stafford Community Corrections Alternative Program will close July 1, 2024. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The department said the closures are intended “to enhance employee, inmate, and probationer safety, to address longstanding staffing challenges, and in consideration of significant ongoing maintenance costs.” </span></p>

<p>According to the most recent Virginia Department of Corrections population report, 1,889 inmates are housed at the Augusta, Sussex II and Haynesville facilities. The Stafford program is an alternative to incarceration. VADOC spokesperson Kyle Gibson said in an  email that &#8220;inmates will be transferred to different VADOC facilities throughout the commonwealth, based on security level and classification.&#8221;</p>
<p>The agency said it has begun identifying job placement opportunities for employees at the affected facilities &#8220;to ensure that all employees who wish to remain employed with the VADOC will be able to stay with the agency.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia will also end its contract with Florida-based GEO Group to operate the Lawrenceville Correctional Center in Brunswick County on Aug. 1, 2024. The medium-security prison has been operated privately since 1998 and under GEO management since 2003. </span></p>
<p>Asked why the state was assuming control of the facility, Gibson said only that the move would &#8220;enhance public safety in the commonwealth.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prison reform advocates have pushed for control of Lawrenceville to be turned back over to the state for many years, arguing that private companies&#8217; need to produce profits leads them to cut corners in staffing and other resources that endanger inmate safety. In 2021, Sen. Adam Ebbin, D-Alexandria, proposed legislation that would have prohibited the state government from contracting with private prison operators, but it <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/01/15/proposal-to-end-for-profit-prison-management-fails-in-virginia-senate/" target="_blank">was defeated in committee</a>. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/04/26/virginia-considers-private-prison-contract-renewal-despite-4-3-million-in-breaches/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reporting by the Mercury</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that persistent staffing shortages at the facility have led the Virginia Department of Corrections to repeatedly dock its payments to GEO for operation of Lawrenceville due to the company’s failure to meet minimum staffing levels required by contract. Between August 2018 and October 2022, those deductions totaled $4.3 million. Roughly three-quarters of the costs were linked to shortages between October 2021 and October 2022. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2020/RD516/PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Virginia Department of Corrections found that Lawrenceville’s operating costs would increase by $9.3 million if the state assumed control, largely to pay for “an increase of 93 correctional officers needed to provide adequate relief staffing and to address operational security needs.” </span></p>
<p>&#8220;It takes courage to close a prison,&#8221; said Rev. Dr. LaKeisha Cook, a board member for Virginia Interfaith Center for Public Policy, which has urged Virginia to take over Lawrenceville and in October 2022 released <a href="https://virginiainterfaithcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Lawrenceville-Correctional-Center-A-Prison-Run-Amok-2.pdf" target="_blank">a report</a> on what it described as dangerous conditions at the prison. &#8220;This is a significant step in the right direction.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, the Virginia Department of Corrections said it has been informed that Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s budget proposal, which he will present to the House and Senate money committees this Wednesday, includes additional funding for the state to take over Lawrenceville safely next year. Gibson said the corrections department &#8220;is expected to make capital improvements with existing funds to upgrade and renovate the facility.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The General Assembly will also come up with its own proposal for the two-year budget during the next legislative session that begins in January.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Secretary of Public Safety and Homeland Security Terry Cole said Youngkin’s budget “enhances public safety and increases efficiency inside Virginia’s prisons for staff members, inmates and everyone who lives and works in Virginia.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe these steps will help the VADOC further its mission of public safety and operational excellence,” he said. </span></p>

Parker Michels-Boyce for The Virginia Mercury</p><p>The Supreme Court of Virginia on Thursday reversed a lower court’s decision by reinstating a lawsuit brought by a former West Point High School teacher after he was fired for refusing to refer to a transgender student by his requested pronouns.</p>
<p>Peter Vlaming, a former high school French teacher, refused to use male pronouns to refer to a student who had recently undergone a gender transition and legal name change. Vlaming said doing so went against his religious beliefs and violated his right to free speech, according to court records.</p>
<p>Vlaming filed a $1 million lawsuit after the school board fired him for violating the school division’s anti-discrimination and anti-harassment policies. However, the King William Circuit Court dismissed his case, finding that Vlaming did not provide valid reasons that the law could accept his suit.</p>
<p>In his opinion, Virginia Supreme Court Justice D. Arthur Kelsey wrote that Vlaming’s rights were violated by the board and that his claim should go forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Compelling an educator’s &#8216;speech or silence&#8217; on such a divisive issue would cast &#8216;a pall of orthodoxy over the classroom&#8217; on a topic that has &#8216;produced a passionate political and social debate,'&#8221; Kelsey wrote.</p>
<p>The opinion said the Virginia Constitution “seeks to protect diversity of thought, diversity of speech, diversity of religion, and diversity of opinions.”</p>
<p>The court’s decision was a blow to school leaders and advocates from parts of the commonwealth who urged the Supreme Court of Virginia to uphold the lower court’s dismissal in an amicus brief.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Equality Virginia and our allies are still analyzing the ruling, but one thing is abundantly clear: Virginia&#8217;s students should be treated with dignity, especially in the public school system,&#8221; said Narissa Rahaman, executive director of Equality Virginia, in an email to the Mercury. &#8220;LGBTQ+ youth deserve safety, respect and the opportunity to thrive. We will keep fighting for them until that goal is a reality for all students, regardless of where they live in the commonwealth.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal organization focused on protecting religious freedoms that represented Vlaming, said a court should hear the former teacher’s case.</p>
<p>“Peter wasn’t fired for something he said; he was fired for something he couldn’t say,” said ADF Senior Counsel Chris Schandevel, who argued before the court on behalf of Vlaming. “The Virginia Supreme Court rightly agreed that Peter’s case against the school board for violating his rights under the Virginia Constitution and state law should proceed. As a teacher, Peter was passionate about the subject he taught, was well-liked by his students, and did his best to accommodate their needs and requests. But he couldn’t in good conscience speak messages that he doesn’t believe to be true, and no school board or government official can punish someone for that reason.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Fluctuating state law</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In 2020, the Virginia General Assembly passed a law requiring local school divisions to adopt model policies on transgender students. The policies adopted by former Gov. Ralph Northam&#8217;s administration directed schools to use the names and pronouns identified by students as corresponding with their gender identity, among other requirements.</p>
<p>However, beginning in September 2022, Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/09/16/youngkin-administration-overhauls-virginia-transgender-student-policies/" target="_blank">overhauled the policies</a> to prioritize parents&#8217; &#8220;fundamental rights&#8221; in a sharp reversal from the stance the state took under Northam and a Democrat-dominated legislature.</p>
<p>As part of the changes, the new policies require parental approval for any changes to students’ “names, nicknames, and/or pronouns,” direct schools to keep parents “informed about their children’s well-being,” specify that student participation in activities and athletics shall be based on sex and state that “students shall use bathrooms that correspond to his or her sex, except to the extent that federal law otherwise requires.”</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Several states this year have reported lower rates of recidivism, showing that fewer convicted criminals are being re-arrested after leaving prison.</p>
<p>But those statistics hardly tell the full story.</p>
<p>Recidivism rates across the country can vary greatly because of how they’re defined, how the data is collected and how it’s presented to the public. So it can be difficult to say that, for example, one state is doing better than another in rehabilitating formerly incarcerated residents.</p>
<p>“You have to be very, very careful. You have to compare apples to apples and oranges to oranges,” Charis Kubrin, a criminology, law and society professor at the University of California, Irvine, said in an interview with Stateline. Kubrin also is a member of the Council on Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan research think tank.</p>
<p>The statistics are used to evaluate a corrections system’s performance. They can help assess how effective rehabilitative or reentry programs and post-sentence probation programs are in lowering the number of reoffenders with certain criminal histories, such as substance use.</p>
<p>Recidivism data tracks the number of convicted offenders who engage in new criminal activities after being released from prison or jail within a specific time frame, typically ranging from one to five years.</p>
<p>A reduced recidivism rate may indicate that efforts by prison staff and probation or parole officers to rehabilitate individuals are effective, said Evan Green-Lowe, the director of state engagement at Recidiviz, a tech nonprofit that partners with state criminal justice agencies.</p>
<p>“It is one of the metrics that state correctional leadership and state community supervision leadership pay close attention to,” Green-Lowe wrote in an email to Stateline.</p>
<p>Among the states that reported lower recidivism rates this year, Iowa, Kentucky, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia all have pointed to reentry or other rehabilitative programs as part of the reason.</p>
<p>“These programs make a huge difference,” said Scott Richeson, the Virginia Department of Corrections’ deputy director of programs, education and reentry, in an interview with Stateline. Richeson said the recividism rate for incarcerated people who participate in career and technical education programs is 12%.</p>
<p>Some criminologists argue that attributing lower recidivism rates to a specific program fails to consider other influencing factors, such as population shifts and — recently — the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>Over the next couple of years, state-reported recidivism rates likely will continue to decline for individuals who were released in 2019 and 2020, as prisons and jails released more people during the peak years of the pandemic, said Shawn Bushway, an economist and criminologist with the nonprofit and nonpartisan research group RAND Corporation.</p>
<p>Most states measure recidivism by tracking former inmates who were held in state prisons or facilities and return to the state prison system within three years. Experts say the absence of a national standard makes it challenging to compare jurisdictions and programs.</p>
<p>State officials should specify how the rate was calculated, what type of offenses or acts count as recidivism, potential limitations, such as incomplete data, and the frequency of reoffenses, according to Elsa Chen, a professor and the chair of the political science department at Santa Clara University.</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Public understanding of recidivism</h4>

	</h4>
<p>Politicians and officials <a href="https://stateline.org/2023/10/27/politicians-love-to-cite-crime-data-its-often-wrong/" target="_blank">sometimes use</a> flawed crime data to burnish their crime-fighting bona fides, and they can tout lower recidivism rates as evidence of their success in rehabilitating criminals.</p>
<p>In May, for example, just five months before Kentucky’s gubernatorial election, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear announced at a news conference that the state had achieved its lowest recidivism rate in history, at 27.15% for individuals held in state custody. Kentucky defines recidivism as a return to state custody within two years of release, either due to committing a new felony or a technical violation of supervision.</p>
<p>“When we get somebody who is leaving prison in a stable position — in a good job, with the services they need, maybe in treatment if they need it — they are less likely to reoffend, which makes our communities safer,” Beshear said during the news conference. “It means fewer crimes are happening.”</p>
<p>The Kentucky Department of Corrections didn’t answer emailed questions and didn’t make anyone available for an interview.</p>
<p>But some experts argue that Beshear’s characterization — implying a connection between recidivism and public safety — is inaccurate because recidivism solely gauges whether an individual reoffends.</p>

<p>“It can have harmful effects on public understanding because the public believes they’re being told something by a responsible person that directly assesses public safety, and [recidivism] does not measure public safety,” Jeffrey Butts, a research professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, told Stateline.</p>
<p>Some state officials say recidivism rates show how effective their programming is, while acknowledging the state-by-state differences.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s misleading at all because I see all the work and the data that we have available is very reliable,” said Richeson, with the Virginia Department of Corrections. “It’s hard to compare across states because there are differences in every system.”</p>
<p>Virginia measures recidivism by tracking former state inmates who return to the state prison system within three years post-release.</p>
<p>“We feel that’s the best indicator of services that we are providing,” she said.</p>
<p>Richeson said her state’s emphasis on safety within the prisons helps incarcerated residents feel more comfortable being involved in rehabilitation.</p>
<p>“We could not do any of these programs were it not for having safe and secure prisons, so it really is how the whole system works together. It’s not just one program,” she said. “We want to create long-term public safety when people get out.”</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What the data says</h4>

	</h4>
<p>In recidivism studies, the act of reoffending may be defined differently. It can, for example, include violating parole, being arrested, being convicted of a crime or returning to prison. Some studies consider all these outcomes as recidivism, while others count only one or two.</p>
<p>Some states only consider felonies as recidivism, excluding less serious misdemeanors that may result in local jail time rather than a state prison sentence. And states vary in categorizing crimes as felonies or misdemeanors, adding even more complexity.</p>
<p>“Those are policy differences that end up structuring or creating the metric of recidivism,” Butts said. “Unless you investigate all those things and can control for them, you’re still not informing the public in a responsible way.”</p>

<p>States also are inconsistent in the time periods covered by recidivism studies. Most include new offenses within three to five years; others examine a much shorter time frame, such as six months to a year.</p>
<p>Recidivism rates might appear higher in highly policed areas, where residents are more likely to come into contact with police. And in some states, recidivism includes missteps such as missing a meeting with a parole officer, technically not a criminal offense but still counted as one.</p>
<p>“When somebody has recidivated, it doesn’t necessarily mean that they’ve committed any new crimes,” Chen said. “That’s something that is not obvious to most people in the public.”</p>
<p>Official data also can miss counting former prisoners who break the law but go undetected. This is why some criminologists argue that recidivism studies should include self-reports of criminal behavior and differentiate among various types of recidivism, such as violent crimes, property crimes and technical violations.</p>
<p>“In an ideal system, you would have measures of recidivism that span all of these different things,” Kubrin, the law and society professor, said.</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">State recidivism rates</h4>

	</h4>
<p>States this year have pointed to rehabilitation and reentry programs as major contributors to their drops in recidivism.</p>
<p>In Iowa, the recidivism rate for fiscal year 2023 stands at 34.3%, down 2.7 percentage points from last year. The state defines recidivism as an individual being released from an Iowa prison and being re-incarcerated within three years for any reason.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://doc.iowa.gov/press-release/2023-11-09/iowa-reduces-recidivism-rate" target="_blank">news release</a> announcing Iowa’s third consecutive drop in recidivism attributed the decrease to various programs, improved reentry practices and increased access to educational and job skills training.</p>
<p>The Iowa Department of Corrections also examines outcomes such as employment and wages, housing stability, program completion and probation, parole and work-release revocations, according to Sarah Fineran, the agency’s research director.</p>
<p>Tennessee saw its recidivism rate drop to 29.6% this year for people released in 2019, the lowest rate in more than a decade. The Tennessee Department of Correction defines recidivism as re-arrest, re-conviction or return to prison within three years after release.</p>

<p>The Virginia Department of Corrections in January announced its recidivism rate dropped to 20.6%, which includes people released from the state prison system in 2018 who were re-incarcerated within three years.</p>
<p>This is the seventh consecutive year that Virginia has had the second-lowest or the lowest rate of recidivism in the nation, according to the department’s <a href="https://vadoc.virginia.gov/news-press-releases/2023/virginia-s-recidivism-rate-remains-among-nation-s-lowest/" target="_blank">news release</a> and <a href="https://vadoc.virginia.gov/media/1818/vadoc-state-recidivism-comparison-report-2023-01.pdf" target="_blank">analysis</a>.</p>
<p>South Carolina, too, boasts one of the lowest recidivism rates in the country at 17%. The South Carolina Department of Corrections defines recidivism as someone who is re-incarcerated within three years of release.</p>
<p>“It’s never just one thing, but a combination of interventions. [The South Carolina Department of Corrections] takes a holistic approach based on the needs of the individual offender,” Chrysti Shain, the department’s director of communications, wrote in an email to Stateline. “We want to release inmates who have a real second chance.”</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Measuring success</h4>

	</h4>
<p>Some advocates say that using alternative factors such as employment or housing provides much better indicators of success after being released from prison.</p>
<p>“Recidivism by itself is not a true measure of the success of reentry programming or of incarceration rates,” said Ann Fisher, the executive director of Virginia CARES, a nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting formerly incarcerated people in Virginia. “It’s just not a true picture.”</p>
<p>A <a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/26459/the-limits-of-recidivism-measuring-success-after-prison" target="_blank">2022 report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine</a> suggests pairing recidivism rates with indicators that capture progress away from crime, such as reductions in the seriousness of criminal activity or an increased duration between release and a criminal act, known as “desistance.”</p>
<p>The report also recommends developing new measures of post-release success that consider factors such as personal well-being, education, employment, housing, family and social supports, health, civic and community engagement and legal involvement.</p>
<p>“Measures of desistance from crime are much more accurate and realistic in looking at changes in criminal activity after release from prison,” said Chen, of Santa Clara University, who is one of the report’s authors. “Those are much more nuanced than just whether or not they’ve had another interaction with the criminal legal system.”</p>

The manufacturer admits the appliance is in short supply, but  pledges to deliver the item in a couple of months – tops. You pay the hefty cost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You wait. And wait some more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, you keep schlepping your dirty clothes to the laundromat, fishing around for enough quarters each week. You wonder what’s going on with your purchase. Nor can the appliance maker tell you when your machine will actually arrive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That example is similar, in a roundabout way, to the issue of getting rid of bad cops in Virginia. Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration has repeatedly delayed updating parts of a</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?202+ful+CHAP0037" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 law to decertify rogue police officers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, despite a deadline that’s more than a year old. What’s going on?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More tools to remove bad cops </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">have</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> taken effect since then; the changes are an obvious improvement. They help bolster the confidence of Virginia residents toward the men and women in blue. But the administration was supposed to have approved related statewide standards</span><a href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/viewstage.cfm?stageid=9641&amp;display=documents" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">more than a year ago</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – and still hasn’t.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-11-30/bad-police-officers-virginia-glenn-youngkin-decertification" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VPM</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently reported on the foot-dragging.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In essence, Youngkin, a Republican, and his public safety officials have thumbed their noses at the law passed during the administration of Democrat Gov. Ralph Northam, which expanded reasons for officer decertification.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a bothersome precedent. It could lead to reprisals when political parties shift power, in a never-ending tit-for-tat in which duly enacted laws aren’t enforced by succeeding administrations. Ultimately, Virginians lose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m kind of mystified,” state Sen. Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax and a supporter of the 2020 law, told me in an interview. He also wondered if the administration could be sued over the delay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor “doesn’t get to pick and choose what laws he wants to follow,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We worked very closely with law-enforcement leadership to design changes to the process,” Surovell continued. Police chiefs and sheriffs had been frustrated about the inability to root out bad officers, and the options to decertify police had been limited.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before 2020, departments could decertify officers only after they were convicted of felonies or specific misdemeanors, or if they refused a drug test. Nor were law-enforcement agencies always checking closely with previous employers when officers tried to relocate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Dec. 1 letter from Surovell, the Senate majority leader; Sen. Mamie Locke, the Senate Democratic Caucus chair; and Del. Don Scott, the incoming speaker of the Democratic-majority House of Delegates, asked administration officials when they intend “to comply with state law” and why the review has taken so long.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law’s approval in 2020 came partly as a response to the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Virginia legislators and high-ranking police officials, however, had been seeking more ways to decertify officers long before that.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-crime-commission-examines-police-decertification-rules/article_f500e6fa-3592-5be5-be2b-b24a9d5b5971.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2012 news story</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for example, noted officers in Virginia fired for criminal convictions and other infractions often kept their state certification. They could move to other jurisdictions in the commonwealth. Top police officials said they needed the state’s help to change the status quo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From 1999 to early 2021,</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/08/08/statewide-police-conduct-standards-will-soon-be-enforceable-almost-two-years-after-law-passed/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">83 law enforcement officers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and jail staff lost their ability to work in Virginia because of bad conduct. From March 2021 – when the new law took effect – through February 2023, 118 officers were decertified, according to</span><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23651742-va-dcjs-master-decertification-list-vfoia-2823" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">state data published</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the law enforcement watchdog group</span><a href="https://openoversightva.org/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">OpenOversightVA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The majority of the latter group were decertified for false statements during internal affairs investigations, VPM reported. Others were jettisoned for infractions that included use of force violations or falsifying documents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stats suggest some of those officers could’ve hung on to their jobs before the new changes.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/07/24/disparity-in-police-decertifications-should-alarm-virginians/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As then-Norfolk Police Chief Larry Boone</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> told me in 2020, if he fired an officer for using excessive force, that person could “go to another agency if that department did not come and look at his personnel records.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The changes in the decertification law also meant an officer could lose his credentials if he was fired or resigned for actions that compromise his “credibility, integrity, honesty, or other characteristics.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another clause in the law dictated officers would be terminated if they didn’t adhere to as-yet-to-be-determined statewide standards.</span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-11-30/bad-police-officers-virginia-glenn-youngkin-decertification" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">As VPM reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a work group including representatives from law enforcement and criminal justice advocates developed those </span><a href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/ViewXML.cfm?textid=16995" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">policies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It took the group nine months to reach consensus on the standards, which the Criminal Justice Services Board passed in June 2022, five months after Youngkin took office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/ViewXML.cfm?textid=16995" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposed standards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> require officers to “treat all individuals with dignity and respect” and “uphold the public trust.” The proposal spells out misconduct that can lead to decertification, including making a false arrest, tampering with evidence or a witness, or having sex with someone in custody.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the regulation and several others relating to training and accountability have</span><a href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/viewstage.cfm?stageid=9641&amp;display=documents" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> spent more than 470 days</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> under review by Youngkin’s secretary of public safety, even though state law required the standards to be passed within 280 days of the statute going into effect. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked Macaulay Porter, Youngkin’s spokesperson, about the delay and whether any pending reviews of other laws had taken so long. She didn’t respond to voicemail and email requests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Law enforcement officials and other interested parties worked diligently to craft the policies. There’s no justifiable reason for the administration’s delays.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this rate, the phantom washing machine will arrive before the updated decertification standards. The administration’s tortoise-like review is indefensible – and worrisome.</span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Corrections said that while no crimes involving convicted sex offenders and minor victims were reported on Halloween, probation and parole officers requested eight warrants for probation violations and arrested five people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We would like to report zero violations on Halloween, but these warrants and arrests demonstrate the Virginia Department of Corrections’ steadfast commitment to protecting all Virginians,” said agency Director Chad Dotson. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because so many children are out and about on Halloween, knocking on the doors of neighbors known and unknown, Virginia probation and parole officers as well as state and local law enforcement take extra steps to ensure convicted sex offenders under community supervision have no contact with them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sex offenders under supervision are instructed not to decorate their homes, hand out candy or attend community gatherings, while probation and parole districts set curfews and conduct random home checks and other surveillance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is not alone in its approach to Halloween: </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/30/us/halloween-sex-offenders-cec/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNN reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that California conducts home checks on Halloween and sets a 5 p.m. curfew for sex offenders under community supervision. One Georgia county has taken the approach of collecting all local sex offenders in one location on Halloween night to hear talks from speakers, including parole officers. Others require offenders to post signs outside warning trick-or-treaters away. </span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.vacourts.gov/opinions/opnscvwp/1220596.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ruling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reverses an earlier decision by the Virginia Court of Appeals that found the state’s Department of Medical Assistance Services, the agency that administers Virginia’s Medicaid program, could not be reimbursed the more than $22,000 it paid to cover the victim’s medical costs because DMAS was itself not a victim of the crime. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That crime occurred in the fall of 2019 outside the home of Patrick County resident Justin Hawks. Larry Puckett, who court filings say had known Hawks for about 10 years, had been staying on the property as a guest but was asked to leave by Hawks after “he proved to be an unpleasant guest.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Puckett initially left Hawks’ property, he later returned several times, culminating in a physical altercation. Eventually, court filings report, as Hawks was returning home, Puckett ran up behind him and jumped on his back. Hawks told Puckett, “I’m not going to fight you,” and Puckett responded, “I’m not fighting you. I’m killing you, m&#8212;&#8211;f&#8212;&#8211;,” before stabbing Hawks multiple times. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Puckett, however, had not killed Hawks, who ran to the nearest house and was brought to the hospital. There, he was treated for multiple stab wounds to his chest and arm at a cost of almost $120,000. Because he was unable to pay for the costs of his medical care, Medicaid stepped in and paid a negotiated lesser amount of $22,691. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Puckett was convicted by Patrick Circuit Court of malicious wounding. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison, with eight years suspended, and ordered to complete five years of probation and pay DMAS the cost of the medical services as restitution. The restitution was to be paid in $50 increments each month following his release from prison. The appeals court later noted that Puckett’s attorney had called the requirement “an exercise in futility,” and that Puckett’s “last request for legal assistance showed no assets and listed his address as ‘homeless.’” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.vacourts.gov/opinions/opncavwp/1002213.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Court of Appeals concluded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Puckett couldn’t be ordered to pay DMAS restitution because “it was not established that these medical expenses were ‘incurred by the victim’ of Puckett’s malicious wounding.” The appeals court based its conclusion on a definition of “incurred” drawn from a state Medicaid regulation about what the program could cover.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Supreme Court of Virginia rejected that argument, saying it didn’t consider the Medicaid regulation relevant and noting that the state’s restitution law “does not say that the restitution must be paid </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">to</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the victim. It only requires that the expense be ‘incurred by the victim.’” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that Medicaid paid for the medical costs rather than Hawks himself doesn’t change the situation, Judge D. Arthur Kelsey wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“An incurred medical expense does not become unincurred simply because a medical provider waives its right to seek full payment from an indigent individual in hopes of recovering partial payment from a solvent entity, such as a private or public insurer” like Medicaid, Kelsey concluded. </span></p>

<p>The effort has drawn bipartisan support, as lawmakers across the political spectrum say it will help people find jobs and housing, in turn boosting local economies and reducing reliance on social services.</p>
<p>“Folks that get out of jail or prison with criminal records, it’s like getting out with the handcuffs still on,” Keith Wallington, the director of advocacy with the Justice Policy Institute, a nonprofit criminal justice research and advocacy group, told Stateline.</p>
<p>But the shift has created some new concerns. The surge in applications after lawmakers eased rules created a major backlog in several states. Some residents struggle to pay the required fees. And some prosecutors and legislators worry that people who commit additional crimes after their records are expunged may not be held fully accountable.</p>
<p>At least four states — Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota and New York — passed legislation this year that would make clearing or sealing one’s criminal record easier. Michigan and Ohio also had similar laws go into effect this year.</p>

<p>Expungement removes arrests and convictions from a criminal record as if they never existed, while record sealing hides records from the public but allows access by court officials and some law enforcement agencies. Almost every state has some form of expungement or record sealing policy. Though they can vary widely, most policies require individuals to be crime-free for a set amount of time, usually tied to how serious their conviction was.</p>
<p>Over the past five years, more states have moved to offer automatic expungement or sealing, which generally uses a computer system to wipe or shield people’s criminal records when they become eligible. At least 26 states and the District of Columbia have an automatic system already in place or in the works.</p>
<p>“More lawmakers recognize the barriers that come with having a criminal record,” said Lauren Krisai, deputy director of the Justice Action Network, a bipartisan criminal justice advocacy group. “They recognize that this is actually bad for employers. It’s bad for employment. It’s bad for the workforce and the economy.”</p>
<p>Some state Republicans have “abandoned this mentality of tough on crime,” according to Nino Marchese, the director of criminal justice and civil justice at the American Legislative Exchange Council, a conservative nonprofit membership organization that drafts model legislation. Marchese said state legislators in the group are increasingly inclined toward evidence-based policymaking, which typically involves analyzing research and data, to draft criminal justice policies.</p>
<p>But some residents haven’t been able to get their records expunged because of the fees and large backlogs.</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Backlogs and accessibility</h4>

	</h4>
<p>In 2021, Oregon <a href="https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2021R1/Downloads/MeasureDocument/SB397/Enrolled" target="_blank">passed a law</a> eliminating fees and expanding expungement eligibility to include non-conviction records, such as arrests, dismissals and acquittals. The law also removed filing fees and adjusted waiting periods for specific offenses. The surge in applications created a backlog of approximately 15,000 cases in Multnomah County, which includes Portland, and a 16-month waiting period for application reviews,<a href="https://www.wweek.com/news/2023/11/08/a-new-criminal-justice-reform-is-so-popular-its-clogged-the-system/" target="_blank"> the Willamette Week</a> reported.</p>
<p>In Utah, expungement application fees quadrupled in July after the legislature failed to pass a bill to extend its pilot program, which previously lowered fees to $65. The state also is facing a backlog of automatic expungements and of petition-based applications, which are expected to take several months, according to Nicole Borgeson, the assistant director of the Utah Bureau of Criminal Identification, the agency tasked with handling applications.</p>
<p>A staffing shortage and an influx of applications just before the pilot program shut down contributed to the state’s backlog, Borgeson said in an interview. The bureau hired new employees in August who are undergoing training and aims to review applications within 30 days, she said.</p>
<p>“It’s very important to us to make sure that we’re doing these in a timely manner — not only for us, but also for the applicants,” Borgeson said. “We know that this can be an impact on their lives and livelihoods. … We are concerned about that. We are trying to get caught up.”</p>
<p>Republican state Rep. Jim Dunnigan, who designed the pilot program, introduced legislation earlier this year to continue offering reduced fees, but withdrew his bill after receiving pushback from other lawmakers. Dunnigan said that some legislators who opposed the bill believe people seeking expungements should pay their own filing fees because they made the decision to commit a crime. Now, Dunnigan is negotiating with concerned colleagues before the state’s upcoming legislative session.</p>
<p>“We’re still working on it, and I don’t know where we’re going to end up. We’ve tried to come to a compromise — probably a little farther than some legislators want to go. It’s not as far as I want to go,” Dunnigan told Stateline. “I’m hopeful, I think we’ll see something that will pass.”</p>
<p>Many Utahns with records can’t afford the increase in fees, according to Noella Sudbury, founder and CEO of Rasa Legal Public Benefit Corporation, also known as Rasa, a company that aims to make expungement more accessible by offering low-cost legal services.</p>
<p>https://stateline.org/2021/05/25/more-states-consider-automatic-criminal-record-expungement/</p>
<p>“A just society is one in which access to justice is available to not just those who have money, but to all members of the society,” Sudbury wrote in an email to Stateline.</p>
<p>The New Jersey State Police, facing a backlog of approximately 46,000 expungement applications, has fallen up to two years behind in processing, according to a class-action<a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2023/10/23/new-jersey-state-polices-expungement-backlog-of-46k-cases-spurs-lawsuit/" target="_blank"> lawsuit filed by the New Jersey Office of the Public Defender</a> against the state police in October.</p>
<p>The lawsuit alleges that this delay has led to the illegal disclosure of sealed criminal histories to potential employers, landlords and others conducting background checks. Residents have suffered job losses, housing denials and missed professional opportunities because of the state police’s failure to adhere to judges’ orders, the lawsuit alleges.</p>
<p>“Every day that passes is a day that these people who are entitled to the relief and the benefit of their expungement order can’t actually benefit from the expungement statute that was passed to help them,” Michael Noveck, assistant deputy public defender with the New Jersey Office of the Public Defender, said in an interview.</p>
<p>Spokespeople from the state police and the New Jersey Office of the Attorney General, which oversees the state police, declined to comment on pending litigation. New Jersey’s expungement statute does not specify a time frame for the state police to process expungement orders.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>In 2019, the state police received $15 million to improve and modernize its expungement processing systems, but it is unclear whether it has made changes to handle the increase in expungement orders. The state police also declined to answer questions about the funding and any upgrades to its systems.</p>
<p>To address processing delays, the legislature should amend the statute to include a specific time frame, such as 60 or 90 days, during which the New Jersey State Police must process granted expungement orders, said Meredith Schalick, the director of the Expungement Law Project at Rutgers Law School, which has helped hundreds of people since 2018 get criminal expungements.</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Broadening eligibility</h4>

	</h4>
<p>Some critics argue that broadening eligibility for expungements or the sealing of criminal records will put the public at risk by cloaking violent crimes.</p>
<p>In Wisconsin, a bipartisan bill failed earlier this year because of objections from Republican senators. Despite being introduced multiple times over the past few years and successfully passing the Assembly, the bill has consistently faltered in the Senate.</p>
<p>During a public hearing on the bill in April, Republican state Sen. Andre Jacque suggested the bill’s proposed one-year waiting period was too short compared with neighboring states such as Illinois, Iowa, Michigan and Minnesota, whose waiting periods range from two to eight years. “It’s a pretty stark difference,” he said. Jacque also expressed concerns about overloading the court system and withholding criminal records from employers.</p>

<p>Wisconsin is the only state where past and closed cases are ineligible for expungement, according to the Wisconsin Policy Forum, a nonpartisan policy research organization.</p>
<p>Wisconsinites must apply for expungement at the time of their sentencing. Wisconsin also is among a few states that restrict expungement eligibility solely to young offenders, with the state’s age cap set at 25.</p>
<p>The bill would eliminate the age cap and shift the expungement application process to after the sentence has been served.</p>
<p>“I’m optimistic that this is the session that we finally get it across the goal line … and make some forward progress that’s hugely needed in Wisconsin,” state Rep. Evan Goyke, a Democrat and former public defender, told Stateline.</p>
<p>Prosecutors in Maryland worry that under the state’s new law, they may not be able to consider the past crimes of someone who commits another crime after having their record expunged, Baltimore County State’s Attorney Scott Shellenberger said. The <a href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Legislation/Details/sb0037?ys=2023RS" target="_blank">REDEEM Act</a>, which went into effect in October, halves the waiting period for filing a petition to expunge criminal records for certain offenses.</p>
<p>Someone who gets their record expunged can legally say they have no criminal record, which can complicate decision-making for prosecutors and court officials alike, said Shellenberger, a Democrat.</p>
<p>“We make our current decisions based upon what your background is,” Shellenberger said in an interview. “If we don’t know the truth about your background, then it’s hard to make a reasoned decision.”</p>
<p>In response to these concerns, the law’s lead author and sponsor, state Sen. Jeff Waldstreicher, a Democrat, said that if someone were to reoffend after having their record expunged, they still face criminal penalties.</p>
<p>“They will still be held accountable for their criminal offense and it’s important that we continue to hold them accountable,” Waldstreicher said in an interview.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a case involving a Chesapeake carport, the Virginia Court of Appeals ruled that zoning violation notices issued by a local government must clearly state that the property owner’s failure to contest the violation within 30 days means the decision is legally “final and unappealable.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Without the finality language, a property owner might logically conclude that the failure to appeal to the [board of zoning appeals] within 30 days would foreclose an appeal in that forum, but that they could later appeal to a court,” </span><a href="https://www.vacourts.gov/opinions/opncavwp/1692221.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judge Daniel E. Ortiz wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The case stems from a freestanding carport built without a permit on a residential property in Chesapeake almost two decades ago. In 2020, two years after new owner Donald Calway bought the property, a city code compliance inspector issued him a notice of violation and ordered him to fix it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the appeals court, fine print at the bottom of the original notice informed Calway he could contest the violation to the board of zoning appeals within 30 days “but did not mention that failure to appeal would make the decision final and unappealable.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Court of Appeals found the omission of that statement made the notice “defective” and therefore made a later penalty unenforceable because </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title15.2/chapter22/section15.2-2311/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requires that any notice of violation “include a statement informing the recipient … that the decision shall be final and unappealable if not appealed within 30 days.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the city of Chesapeake argued it had satisfied the requirements of the law by including a statement that additional information could be found on the city’s website, the judges rejected that argument. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The statute places the burden on the zoning administrator to clearly delineate the appeal rights of property owners,” Ortiz wrote, adding: “Each [notice of violation] must describe both (1) the right to appeal within 30 days </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(2) the finality of the decision after 30 days if not appealed.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The appeals court noted that its ruling is in line with a </span><a href="https://www.oag.state.va.us/files/Opinions/2008/08-025-Cole.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2008 advisory opinion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from then-Attorney General Bob McDonnell that a notice of violation “must include a statement informing the recipient … that the decision is final and unappealable if not so appealed in thirty days.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the court left the door open for Chesapeake to continue pursuing enforcement actions against Calway. Because a later letter from the city zoning administrator declaring the carport illegal included all of the statements required under the law, the judges noted it “is potentially shielded from further attack in this or any future litigation.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Koehler, the attorney representing Calway, said, “We’re holding our breath to see what the city does. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right now we’re hoping that the city will simply allow him to keep” the carport, Koehler said, noting that other homes in the neighborhood have similar structures and that Calway and the prior owner had paid property taxes that included the value of the carport for over 15 years. “It’s simply a matter of fairness, I think, given that the structure has been there since 2004.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked about whether the city intends to appeal the decision or pursue further enforcement actions, Chesapeake Director of Public Communications Heath E. Covey said in an email, “The city respectfully disagrees with this ruling and is currently evaluating next steps.”</span></p>

<p>The system — in which an arrested suspect pays cash to avoid sitting in jail until their court date and gets the money back when they appear — is deeply entrenched in the nation’s history as a way to ensure defendants return to face justice.</p>
<p>But cash bail is undergoing a reckoning as policymakers debate its disproportionate effects on underserved communities and people with low incomes who sometimes can’t afford bail — as well as just how much the system truly keeps the public safe.</p>
<p>This year some states such as Illinois and jurisdictions such as Los Angeles County in California and Cuyahoga County in Ohio scaled back their bail systems, even eliminating cash bail entirely for low-level offenses in some cases.</p>

<p>Policymakers in other places, meanwhile, are moving in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Republican lawmakers in at least 14 states — including Georgia, Indiana, Missouri and Wisconsin — introduced about 20 bills this year aimed at increasing the number of non-bailable offenses and either encouraging or requiring judges to consider defendants’ criminal records when setting bail, according to analysis by The Associated Press.</p>
<p>And in New York state, where changes to curtail the use of bail took effect in 2020, lawmakers have made several rounds of rollbacks amid concerns about rising crime rates.</p>
<p>Some bail policy advocates argue that these changes may contribute to racial and socioeconomic discrimination by relying on one’s ability to post bail and undermine the idea that those accused of a crime are presumed innocent until proven guilty.</p>
<p>“There’s no single answer to effective bail reform,” Meghan Guevara, executive partner with the Pretrial Justice Institute, a criminal justice advocacy group, told Stateline.</p>
<p>Measures to increase the use of cash bail or to include certain factors in assessing bail eligibility saw varying levels of success. In Wisconsin, voters approved a state <a href="https://apnews.com/article/wisconsin-election-cash-bail-amendment-024fafaacafb30c929dbd6bddfbed1bf" target="_blank">constitutional amendment</a> in April allowing judges to consider factors such as a defendant’s past convictions and the need to protect the public from bodily harm in “violent crime” cases.</p>
<p>Missouri Republican Gov. Mike Parson signed <a href="https://www.senate.mo.gov/23info/BTS_Web/Bill.aspx?SessionType=R&amp;BillID=44613" target="_blank">legislation</a> in July that requires judges who are setting bail to first consider factors such as a suspect’s flight risk, potential danger to others, past convictions for violent crimes and previous failures to appear in court.</p>
<p>In Indiana, lawmakers in April <a href="https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/2023/04/14/bail-public-health-changes-and-gas-tax-extension-at-the-statehouse/" target="_blank">passed their first swipe</a> at <a href="https://iga.in.gov/legislative/2023/resolutions/senate/joint/1/details" target="_blank">Senate Joint Resolution 1</a>, which would amend language in the state’s constitution and enable judges to deny bail to those they consider a “substantial risk.” The bill must pass again in 2025 before appearing on the ballot in 2026.</p>
<p>In Georgia, lawmakers considered <a href="https://www.legis.ga.gov/legislation/63873" target="_blank">legislation</a> that sought to impose cash or property bail for dozens of additional crimes, including misdemeanors. It failed due to disagreements between the House and Senate, but Republican state Rep. Houston Gaines, who sponsored the measure in the House, expects the bill to pass in the next legislative session.</p>
<p>Gaines, in an emailed statement, said: “Eliminating cash bail has been a disaster in places it’s been tried — even New York has reversed course on some of its radical policies. We can’t afford to create a revolving door of criminals who don’t show up for court and victimize other individuals.”</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Political backlash and rollbacks</h4>

	</h4>
<p>Between 2017 and 2019, a bipartisan movement for changes to bail systems gained momentum at both the local and state levels. Some states, such as New Mexico, New Jersey and Kentucky, sharply curtailed their cash bail systems by almost entirely eliminating cash bail, expanding release programs and moving toward risk-based assessments to determine pretrial release.</p>
<p>In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic strained crowded jails and detention centers, and agencies eased bail systems to reduce exposure.</p>
<p>Between 2019 and 2020, homicide rates increased 30% — one of the largest year-over-year increases on record, according to data released by the FBI and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Homicide gun deaths also surged 35% in 2020, the largest year-over-year increase recorded in more than 25 years. Despite these increases, the overall violent crime rate in the country did not increase during the pandemic, according to federal crime surveys.</p>
<p>In California and New York, policymakers rolled back their pre-pandemic changes to cash bail.</p>
<p>“Fears about public safety are in many ways greatly overblown and misplaced,” said Sharlyn Grace, a senior policy adviser at the law office of the Cook County Public Defender in Illinois. “It is exceedingly rare for someone who’s released pretrial to be arrested and accused of a new offense that involves violence against another person.”</p>
<p>A <a href="https://criminaljustice.cityofnewyork.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Pretrial-Docketed-Rearrest%E2%80%94Contextual-Overview-thru-September-2020.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> released by the New York City Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice in 2021 found that about 95% of individuals arrested and released between January and September 2020 were not rearrested while awaiting trial, and there was very little difference in rearrest rates before and after bail reform in the state.</p>

<p>New York had passed a sweeping overhaul in 2019, largely ending the use of money bail for misdemeanors and lower-level felonies, with a focus on imposing the “least restrictive” release conditions. The state’s bail law has undergone multiple rounds of revisions since then, primarily driven by calls from Republicans to amend or completely reverse the law.</p>
<p>In early 2020, New York expanded bail options, particularly in cases involving harm to a person or property. In 2022, the state further broadened the definition of “harm” and clarified factors judges must consider, such as criminal history, when setting release conditions.</p>
<p>This year, negotiations over additional changes led to the removal of the requirement for the “least restrictive” release, a proposal <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/28/nyregion/bail-reform-ny.html" target="_blank">announced</a> by Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul last spring.</p>
<p>Some state Democrats and criminal justice advocacy groups have strongly criticized these changes, arguing that the most recent revisions represent a rollback in progress.</p>
<p>“These rollbacks have had a serious effect on our pretrial population, and we’re still seeing the same kinds of wealth-based and racial inequities that were the drivers of bail reform in the first instance,” said Jullian Harris-Calvin, the director of the Greater Justice New York program under the Vera Institute of Justice, a national nonprofit criminal justice advocacy group.</p>
<p>https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/in-rare-opinion-on-cash-bond-fairfax-judge-rules-it-unconstitutional/</p>
<p>Money bail remains prohibited for most misdemeanors and nonviolent felonies in New York, with some exceptions related to rearrested individuals.</p>
<p>In 2018, then-California Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, signed Senate Bill 10 into law, which would have made the Golden State the first to end the use of cash bail for all detained suspects awaiting trials. The American Bail Coalition, a nonprofit trade association representing the bail industry, pushed back hard, organizing Californians Against the Reckless Bail Scheme to lead a repeal effort through a veto referendum.</p>
<p>Voters repealed the measure in 2020. Some who opposed the law said the proposed risk assessment tool — which generally measures factors such as flight risk, public safety risk and criminal history — could potentially cause more harm than good, said Allie Preston, a senior policy analyst for criminal justice reform with the left-leaning policy institute Center for American Progress. Some bail policy advocates say using risk assessment tools in the pretrial process may contribute to more racial and socioeconomic inequities.</p>
<p>Jeff Clayton, the executive director of the American Bail Coalition, said in an interview that risk-based assessments are problematic because “there’s no scientific way to predict pretrial risk in terms of a particular defendant.” Clayton added that setting a bail amount offers more flexibility, which may be beneficial in some cases.</p>
<p>“The question is, can we engineer the alternate system better than the existing system of monetary bonds, posting bonds and staying in jail that’s existed throughout history?” Clayton said. “There’s reasons to suggest that we can’t do a better job.”</p>
<p>Although statewide change to California’s bail system failed, a few jurisdictions in the state have introduced other changes to their bail systems. Santa Clara County and the city of San Francisco both use risk assessment tools and offer other services to help those released pretrial return for their court dates and address needs, such as transportation.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles County Superior Court implemented a zero cash bail system in October. Under the <a href="https://www.lacourt.org/newsmedia/Uploads/1420237208532523NRSAFEANDJUSTPRE-ARRAIGNMENTPROTOCOLS.pdf" target="_blank">new bail protocols</a>, those charged with nonviolent or less serious crimes will be detained before arraignment only if a judge determines they present a threat to the community or a potential flight risk instead of whether they are capable of posting bail. In cases of violent and serious felonies, however, the bail system remains intact.</p>

<p>“[Los Angeles County’s new] bail policy is a really important step towards promoting safety and justice and away from a system where the rich are able to buy their freedom and the poor languish in jail,” said Claire Simonich, the associate director of Vera California, an initiative under the Vera Institute of Justice.</p>
<p>Some residents, county officials and members of law enforcement say the new policy will compromise law enforcement’s ability to address crime. And at least a dozen municipalities in Los Angeles County filed a lawsuit in September to block the new system from taking effect.</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">More legislative efforts</h4>

	</h4>
<p>Lawmakers in some states have pushed for further changes in their legislative sessions.</p>
<p>Connecticut state Rep. Steven Stafstrom, a Democrat, said the <a href="https://ctmirror.org/2023/09/28/ct-bail-reform-stafstrom-sentencing-commission-legislature/" target="_blank">problem</a> in his state stems from an outdated constitutional provision that limits the state’s ability to deny bail, primarily reserving bail for capital offenses. But the state abolished the death penalty more than a decade ago. Since capital offenses no longer exist in Connecticut, there are limited legal grounds for holding people pretrial, especially if they have the financial means to post bail.</p>
<p>“We really need to first repeal that provision out of the state constitution and then move much more towards a risk-based system that takes into account someone’s risk and likelihood to flee as opposed to simply their ability to pay,” Stafstrom said in an interview with Stateline.</p>
<p>In Minnesota, a <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/text.php?number=HF854&amp;version=0&amp;session=ls93&amp;session_year=2023&amp;session_number=0" target="_blank">bill</a> introduced by Democrats this year would limit the use of cash bail by the courts for misdemeanor offenses.</p>
<p>In Cuyahoga County, Ohio, where Cleveland is located, <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2023/09/11/cuyahoga-county-judges-reform-bail-what-happened" target="_blank">informal changes</a> to the court’s culture and practices have reduced the number of people required to pay cash bail, according to The Marshall Project, a news outlet focused on criminal justice. The state supreme court also made changes in 2020 and 2021 aimed at reducing the number of people jailed before trial. Last year, voters passed a measure that requires judges to consider certain factors when setting bail, including public safety.</p>
<p>The adoption of alternative approaches, such as pretrial risk assessments, is gaining ground across the country. Some two dozen different risk assessment tools are in use in at least 26 states, according to the <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/civil-and-criminal-justice/pretrial-release-risk-assessment-tools#:~:text=(2)%20For%20purposes%20of%20this,recommendations%20as%20to%20bail%20or" target="_blank">National Conference of State Legislatures</a>.</p>

Ron DeSantis announced his presidential campaign in May, he proudly told the nation that Florida’s crime rate in 2021 had reached a 50-year low.</p>
<p>But really, DeSantis couldn’t say for sure.</p>
<p>That’s because fewer than 1 in 10 law enforcement agencies in his state had reported their crime statistics to the FBI. In fact, more than 40% of the Sunshine State’s population was unaccounted for in the data used by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement in its <a href="https://www.fdle.state.fl.us/CJAB/UCR/UCR/2021/Annual/UCR-Crime-in-Florida-Abstract-Statewide-2021A.aspx" target="_blank">2021 statewide crime report</a>.</p>
<p>In Wichita, Kansas, Democratic Mayor Brandon Whipple claimed in May that violent crime had decreased by half during his term. But Whipple’s source, the FBI’s<a href="https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#/pages/home" target="_blank"> Crime Data Explorer</a>, missed half the violent crimes recorded by the Wichita Police Department, possibly because the agency couldn’t mesh its system with the FBI’s recently revamped system.</p>
<p>Across the country, law enforcement agencies’ inability — or refusal — to send their annual crime data to the FBI has resulted in a distorted picture of the United States’ crime trends, according to a new Stateline analysis of the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting program participation data.</p>
<p>“We have policymakers making policy based on completely incomplete data. We have political elections being determined based on vibes rather than actual data. It’s a mess,” said Jeff Asher, a data analyst and co-founder of AH Datalytics, a data consulting firm.</p>
<p>Experts warn that some policymakers, knowingly or unknowingly, use those flawed statistics to tout promising crime trends — misleading voters. The inaccurate data also can affect efforts to improve public safety and criminal justice, potentially leading policymakers to miss the mark in addressing real community issues.</p>

<p>“The problem for voters is that they don’t have very good information about what levels of safety actually are,” said Anna Harvey, a politics, data science and law professor at New York University. Harvey also is the director of the university’s Public Safety Lab and the president of the Social Science Research Council.</p>
<p>“They’re a little bit vulnerable to politicians who are kind of throwing around allegations and claims about crime that may or may not be accurate,” she told Stateline.</p>
<p>DeSantis faced criticism for repeating the incomplete numbers, and NBC News this summer <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/ron-desantis-florida-law-enforcement-crime-50-percent-low-rcna105091" target="_blank">reported</a> that law enforcement rank-and-file had warned that the statistics weren’t correct.</p>
<p>The Florida Department of Law Enforcement defended the numbers to NBC News, saying, in part, that “criticism about FDLE’s robust data collection methods is unfounded.”</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">FBI’s switch to a new system</h4>

	</h4>
<p>A year ago, when the FBI initially released its 2021 national crime data, there wasn’t enough information to tell whether crime went up, went down or stayed the same. The FBI had estimated results for areas that declined to submit data or were unable to do so.</p>
<p>That’s partly because the FBI had rolled out a new reporting system. The data collection system, called the National Incident-Based Reporting System, or NIBRS, gathered more detail on individual incidents but also required training and tech upgrades by state and local policing agencies.</p>
<p>For the first time in two decades, the national law enforcement reporting rate fell below 70% in 2021, primarily due to the FBI’s transition. In 2022, many law enforcement agencies across the country were not NIBRS-certified in time to submit their 2021 crime data, which contributed to lower reporting rates.</p>
<p>Even before the new system launched, there was a gap in reporting nationwide. Prior to 2021, 23% of U.S. law enforcement agencies on average did not report any crime data to the FBI. In 2020, 24% of agencies did not report, and in 2021, it surged to 40%.</p>
<p>Inconsistent reporting not only hampers the ability to draw comparisons over time and across state lines, but also injects uncertainty into discussions about crime, said Ames Grawert, senior counsel for the Brennan Center for Justice’s justice program. The Brennan Center is a left-leaning law and policy group.</p>

<p>“Issues like that are invariably going to lead to some people having a misunderstanding of crime data — makes it harder to talk about crime in some states, especially given the low participation rate in Florida, for example,” Grawert said in an interview with Stateline.</p>
<p>The FBI’s latest crime report, <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/fbi-releases-2022-crime-in-the-nation-statistics" target="_blank">released earlier this month,</a> offers a glimmer of progress toward transparency: 71% of law enforcement agencies nationwide submitted data through NIBRS or the FBI’s previous reporting system, up 11 percentage points from last year. About 60% of participating law enforcement agencies submitted their data exclusively through NIBRS this year. The FBI accepted data through both NIBRS and the older system this year, a change from last year’s NIBRS-only approach.</p>
<p>According to the incomplete numbers, violent crime in the U.S. dropped last year, returning to pre-pandemic levels, while property crimes saw a significant increase.</p>
<p>While crime data reporting to the FBI is optional, some states, such as Illinois and Minnesota, have laws requiring their local law enforcement agencies to report crime data to their state law enforcement agencies. State law enforcement agencies often serve as clearinghouses for local crime data, and in some states, they are responsible for sharing this data with the feds. Some local agencies also may send their data directly to the FBI.</p>
<p>But some states lag.</p>
<p>Florida, Illinois, Louisiana and West Virginia, for example, all remain below the 50% reporting mark, which means less than half of the police departments in their states submitted 2022 crime data to the FBI. Despite these reporting rates, the data shows that greater shares of these state’s populations were represented in last year’s data than in 2021.</p>
<p>Florida has had the lowest reporting rate two years in a row — 6% in 2021 and 44% in 2022 — partly because of the state’s ongoing transition to NIBRS. For 2021, the FBI did not accept Florida’s data through the previous data collection system, which would have represented about 58% of the state’s population, according to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement’s Public Information Office.</p>

<p>“It’s a problem in both red and blue states, it’s also a local issue,” Kylie Murdock, a policy adviser with Third Way, a left-leaning national think tank, said in an interview with Stateline.</p>
<p>“When people use this data to back up tough-on-crime approaches, and say, ‘Our approach in this state is working’ — when in reality, that’s not necessarily the truth because you don’t know the full scope of the problem,” said Murdock.</p>
<p>Roughly a quarter of the U.S. population was not represented in the 2022 federal crime data, according to a Stateline analysis. More than 6,000 of 22,116 law enforcement agencies did not submit data.</p>
<p>Major police departments, including those in big cities such as Los Angeles and New York, did not submit any data in 2021. NYPD said it couldn’t submit summary statistics in 2021 as it had previously because of the FBI’s change in requirements, but was NIBRS-certified this year. Both cities’ departments did submit summary data to the FBI in 2022 through the old reporting system.</p>
<p>The FBI’s 2021 agency participation data shows that the 10 states with the lowest reporting rates included a balanced mix of both blue and red states, while last year’s data shows more red states among the 10 states with the lowest reporting rates.</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Political and social consequences</h4>

	</h4>
<p>The gaps in the FBI’s crime data create significant challenges for researchers and policymakers attempting to make sense of crime trends. As elections draw near and crime has reclaimed the spotlight, these challenges become increasingly pressing.</p>
<p>During last year’s congressional elections, 61% of registered voters said violent crime would be very important when making their decision about whom to vote for, according to a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/10/31/violent-crime-is-a-key-midterm-voting-issue-but-what-does-the-data-say/" target="_blank">survey conducted by the Pew Research Center</a>.</p>
<p>While the overall violent crime rate has steadily declined on average over the past 20 years, the Pew Research Center suggested that voters might be reacting to specific types of violent crime, such as homicide, which saw a 30% increase between 2019 and 2020 — one of the largest year-over-year increases on record.</p>

<p>A lack of accurate, real-time crime data leaves voters vulnerable to political manipulation, said Harvey, the New York University professor.</p>
<p>“Voters tend to not have that kind of access. Politicians then try to play on voters’ concerns about crime, but without giving voters the information that will actually be useful for them,” Harvey said.</p>
<p>Experts expect that the challenge of incomplete national crime data — and the incomplete picture it presents — will persist for years because many law enforcement agencies still are working to adopt the new reporting system.</p>
<p>That could affect how policymakers allocate money for law enforcement, crime prevention programs and other public safety initiatives. With crime data, it’s important to know what types of crimes are included and to avoid narrow timeframes when describing trends, said Ernesto Lopez, a research specialist for the Council on Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan research think tank.</p>
<p>“Oftentimes relying on the FBI data, which tends to be outdated, really allows politicians to sensationalize a few news stories. Without having more up-to-date data, it may not be accurate,” Lopez told Stateline. “Politician or otherwise, when we talk about crime, it’s really important to have a larger context.”</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Federal assistance</h4>

	</h4>
<p>Law enforcement agencies nationwide have received over <a href="https://bjs.ojp.gov/funding/awards/list?field_award_status_value=All&amp;state=All&amp;field_funding_type_value=All&amp;fiscal_year=2015+2016+2017+2018+2019+2020+2021&amp;combine_awards=ncs-x&amp;awardee=&amp;city=#awards-awards-list-block-aitfqa3yrblsii6k" target="_blank">$180 million in federal funding</a> to help with the transition since the FBI’s switch to its new NIBRS reporting system was announced in 2015. Many law enforcement agencies are still working to fully transition to the new system.</p>
<p>For example, in Louisiana, the agencies serving some of the state’s most populous cities, including Lafayette, New Orleans and Shreveport, did not report any data to the FBI last year because they were implementing new records management systems, according to Jim Craft, the executive director of the Louisiana Commission on Law Enforcement.</p>
<p>Louisiana’s low reporting rate may be due to smaller law enforcement agencies reporting crime statistics through their local sheriff’s office, which makes it look like fewer agencies are reporting, Craft wrote in an email.</p>
<p>In Hawaii, the police departments serving Maui and Hawaii counties were not certified in time to submit data through NIBRS to the FBI last year, according to Paul Perrone, the director of the Hawaii Uniform Crime Reporting program. Last month, Hawaii became one of the few states where all law enforcement agencies are NIBRS-certified, Perrone wrote in an email.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, even as more law enforcement agencies submit data in coming years, experts warn that the FBI’s database accounts only for crimes reported to the police. And according to the federal <a href="https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv21.pdf" target="_blank">Bureau of Justice Statistics</a>, over 50% of violent crimes and about 70% of property crimes are never reported.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Winchester resident Andrew Hahn agreed to plead guilty to five counts of embezzlement and one count of money laundering. Investigators found that he embezzled more than $890,000 by creating false invoices for computer purchases from a company he owned. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Harrisonburg police, the Harrisonburg-Rockingham Community Services Board notified law enforcement of its suspicions of embezzlement in October 2021 after an internal investigation and external financial audit. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://vacsb.org/community-services-boards-and-the-behavioral-authority-csbs-and-the-bha/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community services boards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are Virginia’s primary providers of behavioral health and developmental disability services at the local level. They are funded through the state budget and <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/09/14/youngkin-signs-virginia-budget-offering-tax-reductions-major-new-spending/" target="_blank">have been a focus of Virginia lawmakers in recent years</a> as the state struggles to shore up its beleaguered behavioral health system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police said Hahn, who as IT manager had the power to award technology-related contracts, awarded those contracts to his company for products and services that were either never provided to the board or were provided at inflated prices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hahn used his position to his advantage and went to great lengths to conceal his actions from the HRCSB,” Harrisonburg police said at the time of the arrest. “The investigation revealed that the employer followed common and standard business practices, including internal and external audits, but Hahn found a way to circumvent these safeguards.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The office of Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares, which was involved in investigating the case through its financial crimes team, said over $720,000 of the money Hahn embezzled was used for his personal expenses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rockingham County Circuit Court sentenced Hahn to 20 years of prison on each embezzlement count, with 17 years of each sentence suspended. He was also sentenced to 40 years in prison on the money laundering charge, with all of the time suspended.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to imprisonment, the court ordered Hahn to pay almost $190,000 in restitution. </span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Court of Appeals is allowing a legal malpractice suit to go forward in a case brought by a Rockingham County man who served almost nine years in prison for his involvement in the 2012 theft of sandwiches and two cases of beer from a grocery store in Harrisonburg. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.vacourts.gov/opinions/opncavwp/1079223.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ruling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, handed down Tuesday, sends the case back to Rockingham Circuit Court for further arguments about whether Mark O’Hara Wright is entitled to damages from defense attorney Andrew Graves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, the Richmond-based U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals </span><a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca4/19-7447/19-7447-2021-06-21.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ordered Wright’s early release</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, concluding that “had Wright’s trial counsel been adequately informed, there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of his trial would have been different.” That decision overturned an earlier determination by the Supreme Court of Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the federal court’s account of the theft, Wright, his brother Robert Wright and Robert Wright’s 15-year-old stepson on March 25, 2012, took sandwiches and two cases of beer from Martin’s Grocery in Harrisonburg and left without paying. Security guard Garrett Atkins then followed them to their minivan and took one of the cases of beer from Robert Wright’s hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At that point, Robert’s stepson stepped out of the minivan — with Wright on the opposite side of the van, out of Atkins’s view — and ‘took a fighting stance,’ telling Atkins, ‘I’m going to f— you up,” the ruling continued. “Robert then grabbed the beer back from Atkins, and Wright, Robert, and Robert’s stepson left in the minivan, taking with them the sandwiches and beer.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Atkins testified at trial that he never spoke to Mark Wright on the day of the theft and that the “abnormal” events made him “uncomfortable.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wright was charged with petit larceny, contributing to the delinquency of a minor and, most significantly, robbery because his brother physically took the case of beer from Atkins in the parking lot. The robbery charge carried a sentence of five years to life in prison. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After evidence was presented during the trial, prosecutors instructed the jury that it could convict Wright on the robbery charge or the lesser offense of grand larceny from the person — a crime that carries a sentence of zero to 20 years’ imprisonment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State law allows a defendant to be convicted of a crime that they haven’t been charged with as long as the crime is a less serious offense than the original charge and there is evidence to support the lesser charge. Virginia courts have ruled that though robbery and grand larceny from the person are similar crimes that both involve stealing, they are not interchangeable. Robbery requires an element of violence or intimidation. Grand larceny from the person does not but requires prosecutors to prove the stolen goods were worth at least $5.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals later noted, the grand larceny charge “is not a lesser included offense of robbery under Virginia law. Nor was there any doubt on that point at the time of Wright’s trial.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The jury subsequently acquitted Wright of robbery but found him guilty of the grand larceny charge and recommended a 10-year sentence, which a judge accepted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Altogether, Wright was sentenced to more than 22 years in prison. (Half of that sentence was on charges related to the arrest of him and his brother, when bear deterrent was deployed against a sheriff’s deputy. </span><a href="https://www.vacourts.gov/opinions/opnscvwp/1150181.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Supreme Court of Virginia later found there was insufficient evidence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to show that Mark Wright had even been in the room at the time the bear deterrent was used, and a </span><a href="https://www.dnronline.com/news/crime/theft-case-under-review/article_d3574c92-c412-11e6-b150-176c2e748b01.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rockingham County judge ultimately dismissed the charges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, Wright petitioned the Supreme Court of Virginia to review his case, arguing his attorney, Graves, had failed to assist him effectively. The state high court turned down his petition. It concluded that because Graves had testified that he “would not have objected to the instruction whether he did or did not know” the relevant law since it gave the jury the option of convicting his client on a less serious offense, the attorney had been operating on “strategy coupled with a lack of knowledge.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 4th Circuit rejected that conclusion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Under the correct and clearly established standard, trial counsel’s performance fell below prevailing professional norms when he failed, without justification, to inform himself of state law critical to his client’s case,” the court wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, the three-judge panel ruled that Graves’ lack of objection to the jury instruction likely had a significant impact on the outcome of the trial. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It also is highly likely that a jury instructed only on robbery would have acquitted Wright of that charge: The actual jury did acquit Wright of robbery, finding that the Commonwealth had failed to prove the elements of that crime beyond a reasonable doubt,” the court wrote. “And had the jury been instructed on petit larceny, it might or might not have convicted Wright of that crime – </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">but either way, Wright would have served no more than one year for the offense, as opposed to his ten-year sentence on grand larceny from the person.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following his release, Wright sued Graves for legal malpractice, a case the Virginia Court of Appeals is now allowing to go forward. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of the appeals court’s ruling Tuesday centers on state law requiring individuals who bring criminal malpractice claims against their attorney to show they were actually innocent of the crime. Virginia, the opinion by Judge Stuart A. Raphael notes, “is among the majority of jurisdictions that impose an actual-innocence requirement.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this case, Wright has repeatedly “pleaded that he was factually innocent of the crime for which he was convicted: grand larceny from the person,” the appeals court wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a separate concurring opinion, Judge Lisa Lorish wrote that the case raises the question of “whether his case merits an exception to the general rule that a criminal-malpractice plaintiff must prove actual innocence.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Graves’ attorneys did not respond to a request for comment. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The league is a nonprofit association of cities, towns and a few counties. VML representatives who supported re-examining the law may not know about the</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2008/07/16/chandler-family-remembers-loved-one-with-roadside-sit-in/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">police-involved death of Raymond C. Chandler in Norfolk back in 2000</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Here, then, is a painful refresher course – and why so many state legislators want to reduce unnecessary interactions between law-enforcement officers and motorists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chandler, who was Black, was driving to work as a security guard late at night when Norfolk police officers pulled him over for an unregistered license plate, according to newspaper archives. Officers asked for his driver’s license and registration, which he didn’t turn over; his license had been suspended.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police told Chandler they were going to arrest him. A struggle took place. Police pepper-sprayed him and placed him face down on the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chandler had an enlarged heart, among other health problems. He died shortly afterward. The officers in the Chandler case eventually were cleared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chandler shouldn’t have been behind the wheel, of course. He also should’ve listened to police. But losing your life in an incident that began over an unregistered plate is a severe, unfathomable penalty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nor do we hear about the many cases where police stop motorists, often fishing for nonexistent felonies, and find zilch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such encounters heighten the risks for citizens and police officers alike. They also antagonize drivers who are guilty of, at worst,  low-level traffic violations. They damage the relationship between police and the greater community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We saw this more recently when</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/04/14/unnecessary-opportunities-for-strife-and-use-of-force-its-time-to-re-evaluate-police-traffic-stops/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Windsor officers drew their guns and pepper-sprayed Army Lt. Caron Nazario, who is Black and Latino,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in December 2020. They had stopped him over a “missing” rear license plate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Except Nazario had a temporary plate in the SUV’s window. Video of the incident went viral.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black and brown people are disproportionately the recipients of this type of treatment, even with the 2020 law.</span><a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2023/RD340/PDF" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">State data of police stops</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for July 2022-March 2023, for example, show that 30.4% of Virginia resident drivers stopped were Black, though they comprise only 19.4% of the state’s driving-age population. Black drivers also were searched and arrested at slightly higher rates than white drivers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As my</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/10/03/progressive-groups-blast-virginia-municipal-league-over-traffic-stop-stance/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Mercury colleague Graham Moomaw reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the 2020 law doesn’t erase specific equipment violations from the books, but it prevents police from using them as the primary reason to stop motorists. It’s a way to protect motorists of color from biased treatment on state roads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican legislators criticized the bill at the time of its debate and passage. Democrats controlled both chambers and the governor’s seat back then.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, dozens of localities in VML, including Chesapeake, voted for the General Assembly to review the law. Chesapeake Mayor Rick West told me the city’s police chief and other Hampton Roads police departments have found such stops are effective in fighting crime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Pulling cars over for small events has led to the confiscation of illegal drugs, the confiscation of illegal guns, finding wanted criminals and preventing crimes,” West said. “My main reason is that the good outweighs the bad.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several progressive groups in Virginia, though, castigated the VML’s debate even before members voted – and with good reason. Those groups, including Justice Forward Virginia and the state ACLU,</span><a href="https://justiceforwardva.com/blog/2023/10/2/rescind-support-for-racial-profiling" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote to the VML</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Oct. 2, saying such “pretextual policing” – the practice of stopping motorists for minor offenses in hopes of searching for more serious crimes – “has become synonymous with racial profiling.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The letter continued: “ … Philando Castile, Samuel DuBose, Daunte Wright, and many others all were killed at the hands of police after an encounter that began with a ‘pretextual hunch.’ ” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Castile’s slaying in 2016 was especially egregious. Castile had told the Minneapolis-area police officer who stopped him that he had a gun, which he had a permit for. His girlfriend, who was in the car, said he was reaching for his driver’s license and registration when the officer fatally shot him.</span></p>

The same article said a Minnesota</span><a href="http://www.irpumn.org/uls/resources/projects/aggregate%20report%2092303.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">-commissioned study in 2003 </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">found “minority drivers were more likely than white drivers to be both stopped and searched, even though officers found contraband more often when searching white drivers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeffrey Fagan, a professor at Columbia Law School, studies policing, crime and race. He told me that pretextual stops are legal, but problematic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It makes the police workplace a little less safe,” Fagan said during a phone interview. “It aggravates racial disparities. It’s hard to find something good to say about it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later, by email, Fagan continued: “It seems irresponsible (to me) that police would argue for more frequent interactions with civilian drivers, knowing that those interactions have little impact on crime and increase danger for both police and drivers (and some passengers).</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>

Police currently provide the vast majority of transports to psychiatric hospitals across Virginia. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local government representatives who make up the Virginia Municipal League voted this week in support of a statement calling for a review of a 2020 criminal justice reform law that limited law enforcement’s ability to make traffic stops for minor vehicle equipment issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At its annual meeting in Norfolk, VML’s membership voted 47-17 to retain language calling for a review of the policy in a document laying its priorities, according to Roanoke City Councilman Luke Priddy, who opposed the group taking a skeptical stance on a law meant to minimize racial profiling in traffic enforcement. The bill took aim at the idea of “pretextual” traffic stops, or the practice of using small issues like broken brake lights as a reason to stop, question and potentially search drivers officers deem suspicious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the legislation passed three years ago, opponents of the law argued it could make roads less safe and hamstring law enforcement’s ability to fight more serious crime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VML, which represents the interests of mostly city and town governments as well as a few counties, declined to comment on the decision and said the vote was not recorded. The organization previously said the language merely asks for a review of the legislation and doesn’t endorse any particular policy action.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to the vote, progressive criminal justice reform groups had pressed VML to avoid taking a stance that could give fuel to efforts in the General Assembly to revisit or repeal the law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Absent VML taking some kind of vote to do something different in the future, individuals will be able to stand up in the next session and say the Virginia Municipal League has endorsed a policy seeking for the General Assembly to review these items,” Priddy said in an interview. “I&#8217;m just surprised to have VML take a stance that so many organizations have opposed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Priddy said he felt VML members, who work with local police chiefs, weren’t given an opportunity to hear a “balanced presentation” on the issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Roanoke City Council, the governing body on which Priddy serves, voted last year to formally call on the General Assembly to restore local police departments’ power to pull drivers over for problems like defective equipment, broken tail lights, expired registrations and overly dark window tint. Priddy, who has worked as a legislative aide to Sen. John Edwards, D-Roanoke, was not on the council at the time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an </span><a href="https://www.roanokerambler.com/roanoke-city-council-urges-virginia-lawmakers-to-roll-back-criminal-justice-reforms/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">interview with the Roanoke Rambler</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year, Roanoke Mayor Sherman Lea said he felt the city had to “take a look at everything on the table” to try to address its gun violence problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican legislators have introduced bills to repeal the 2020 law, but those efforts have been blocked in the Democratic-controlled state Senate. That means the state’s direction on the traffic stop issue could be decided by who wins the high-stakes General Assembly elections on Nov. 7, when all 140 seats in the legislature’s two chambers are on the ballot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans who control the House of Delegates have signaled they see VML’s stance as confirmation their concerns about the bill have been borne out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When Democrats voted to drastically curtail the authority of Virginia law enforcement to pull over drivers for things like missing wheels, student drivers texting behind the wheel, or other such violations of law, Republicans sounded the alarm,” the office of House Speaker Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, said in a news release last week calling attention to the issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a </span><a href="https://x.com/SenLouiseLucas/status/1709767181355921483?s=20" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">post on X</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, said the bill she helped write is now a “national model in how to reduce racial profiling.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Any attempts to repeal this landmark legislation are dead on arrival in the Senate,” Lucas said. “We will NOT go back.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a decision that touched on the finer points of how policies become law, the court ruled that language in the state budget overrode conflicting directives in a 2020 law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is hard to imagine a more definitive statement of the General Assembly’s intention that the provisions of the budget enacted in 2022 should be given effect over any other conflicting law,” wrote Justice Wesley G. Russell in a unanimous opinion Thursday that upheld an earlier decision in Albemarle County Circuit Court. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The high court’s ruling is a legal defeat for an estimated 8,000 inmates who over time could have been released early under an “enhanced” form of the state’s earned sentence credit system Democrats passed in 2020. Opponents of the GOP-led 2022 budget change altering that system have been particularly critical of its impact on more than 500 inmates who the state had notified would be released shortly after July 2022 before backtracking just weeks before they expected to be let out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current case was brought by the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia on behalf of one of those inmates, Antoine Anderson, who is being held at Coffeewood Correctional Center in Culpeper County. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to 2020, Virginia inmates could have their sentences reduced by up to 4.5 days every 30 days for good behavior. That year, the Democratic-controlled General Assembly passed a law that retroactively increased the number of credits inmates could earn in a 30-day period to 15, moving up those individuals’ release dates. The law set a date of July 1, 2022 for the new system to go into effect. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the legislation prohibited the enhanced credits from being applied to sentences for certain violent crimes, it allowed inmates with “mixed” sentences — imposed for both violent and nonviolent crimes — to reduce the sentences they received for their nonviolent crimes more quickly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In preparation for the new system, the Virginia Department of Corrections </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/07/11/a-slap-in-the-face-prisoners-families-have-hopes-dashed-by-governors-amendment/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">notified hundreds of prisoners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including Anderson, that they would be released early, and families began preparing for their return. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In June 2022, however, Gov. Glenn Youngkin proposed an amendment to the budget that would prevent inmates with mixed sentences from being eligible for any enhanced credits. The change </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/06/17/general-assembly-hands-youngkin-some-wins-losses-on-budget-amendments/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">narrowly passed the legislature</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with three Democrats — Sens. John Bell of Loudoun, Lynwood Lewis of Accomack and Monty Mason of Williamsburg — joining Republicans in its support. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson, who had previously been notified he would be released in the first wave of inmates eligible for the enhanced credits, was subsequently told he would remain incarcerated until April 2024. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First arrested on federal drug charges in 2004, Anderson that August received a 13-year state sentence after he tried to break out of the Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail where he was being held. He received four sentences for that attempt: one year for attempted escape, five years for abduction, two years for assault on a law enforcement officer, and five years for a second assault on a law enforcement officer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the 2020 law, Anderson would have been eligible to earn enhanced credits to reduce his sentences for attempted escape and assault on a law enforcement officer but could not have decreased his sentence for abduction more quickly. </span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;‘A slap in the face’: Prisoners, families have hopes dashed by governor’s amendment&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/07/11/a-slap-in-the-face-prisoners-families-have-hopes-dashed-by-governors-amendment/embed/#?secret=RBx4CLUyos#?secret=GaCP0lH05I" data-secret="GaCP0lH05I" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the lawsuit, the ACLU of Virginia argued that the budget change couldn’t be used to halt the early releases of inmates who had accrued credits under the 2020 system. The group contended that while the 2020 law had specified it applied “retroactively,” the budget amendment had not included that language. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, the Supreme Court of Virginia rejected that argument on the grounds that because the 2020 law wasn’t scheduled to go into effect until July 1, 2022, none of the inmates had actually earned any enhanced credits before the budget change was implemented. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2020 law “did not go into effect prior to July 1, 2022, and has never been in effect without the modification,” Russell wrote. “As a result, neither Anderson nor others similarly situated have ever been eligible to receive enhanced [earned sentence credits].”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ACLU of Virginia said it was “disappointed” in the ruling, but “the fight is far from over.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The legislature can and should keep its promise to people who have done the hard work to earn a second chance,” said attorney Geri Greenspan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this summer, the Supreme Court of Virginia </span><a href="https://www.acluva.org/sites/default/files/field_documents/opinion.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ruled in favor of another inmate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> represented by the ACLU of Virginia, Steven Prease, who had argued the state was unlawfully limiting his eligibility for the enhanced sentence credits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prease contended that he could earn the enhanced credits for attempted aggravated murder because it was not explicitly listed among the crimes state law declared ineligible for quicker release, while the Virginia Department of Corrections argued the General Assembly had intended to include it. The court rejected that argument, and Prease was released July 13.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ACLU of Virginia has since filed </span><a href="https://www.acluva.org/en/press-releases/aclu-virginia-files-two-new-cases-calling-vadoc-release-people-who-have-earned" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two more cases</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> arguing the corrections department is unlawfully interpreting the law to deny other inmates early release.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Virginia State Police is aware of and tracking the various local law enforcement agencies that responded to bomb threats called in to local schools across the commonwealth yesterday and today,” said Virginia State Police spokeswoman Corinne Geller in an email. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Geller noted that local law enforcement and school districts aren’t required to report threats to VSP, she said the agency is aware of seven occurring across Virginia Oct. 10 “and several more happening today and in other states.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local agencies, including those in Madison County, have said they </span><a href="https://www.cbs19news.com/story/49809988/investigation-underway-into-threat-against-schools-in-madison-county" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">believe the threats were part of a nationwide hoax</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the 2023 General Assembly session, lawmakers passed legislation extending penalties for </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/24/three-interesting-bills-selling-children-swatting-penalties-and-regulating-vape-products/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">calling in a false threat to 911 </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">with the intent of drawing a large police response to cover false threats made directly to schools. The practice, known as swatting, has become increasingly disruptive in Virginia and nationwide. Earlier this month, </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/10/04/school-swatting-hoax-active-shooter/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Washington Post reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that more than 500 schools in the U.S. have been targeted in a “coordinated campaign” of hoax threats over the past year.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Today concludes a multi-year investigation and prosecution by my office,” said Attorney General Jason Miyares in a release announcing the sentencing of Bhagavan “Doc” Antle. “In Virginia, we uphold the rule of law without exception, whether dealing with violent repeat offenders, big pharma, fraudsters and scammers, or wildlife traffickers.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Antle, the owner of 50-acre tropical preserve Myrtle Beach Safari, came under scrutiny by Virginia officials because of his relationship with Keith Wilson, the owner of Wilson’s Wild Animal Park in Winchester. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After state agents raided the Winchester zoo and seized 119 wild animals, including lions and tigers, in 2019, </span><a href="https://www.insidenova.com/headlines/wilsons-wild-animal-park-owner-nephew-plead-in-animal-cruelty-case/article_d34bfb2e-ac76-11ec-82fd-23c0455c977e.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wilson was convicted of 27 counts of animal cruelty</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and forbidden to own, sell or work with any exotic species. (His nephew was also convicted on 19 counts of animal cruelty.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a separate case, a Frederick grand jury </span><a href="https://www.oag.state.va.us/files/2020/WilsonIndictments.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in October 2020 indicted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> both Wilson and Antle for conspiring with each other to traffick lions in violation of the federal Endangered Species Act, as well as engaging in animal cruelty. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This June, a Frederick jury convicted Antle of two felony counts of wildlife trafficking and two felony counts of conspiring to traffick wildlife. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiger-king-documentary-antle-trafficking-conviction-689456335b6be5cc51f87f48f7463539" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Associated Press</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the prosecution characterized Antle’s purchases of lion cubs from the Winchester zoo as a “cub pipeline” from Virginia to South Carolina that operated illegally after lions were designated endangered in 2015. Antle’s defense attorney, Erin Harrigan, argued the lion cubs Antle received were gifts from Wilson, and that Antle had separately donated thousands of dollars to Wilson’s zoo for an expanded tiger habitat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the terms of his sentence, Antle isn’t allowed to “work, own, possess, broker, buy, sell, trade, transfer, barter or donate any exotic animals for five years in the Commonwealth of Virginia.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If he violates the law or those terms during the next five years, he could be subject to two years of incarceration that are otherwise suspended.</span></p>
<p>Antle&#8217;s attorneys, Eric Breslin and Erin Harrigan, said they were &#8220;pleased and grateful that the judge rejected the government&#8217;s request for incarceration and saw Mr. Antle&#8217;s immense value in his work and family community.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Antle was convicted on four charges that amount to failing to obtain a permit for otherwise entirely lawful activity in the highly-regulated industry that is exhibiting endangered species,&#8221; they wrote. &#8220;These charges have never been brought in Virginia before, and the commonwealth’s case suffers from a variety of factual and legal defects. As we have maintained since his conviction at trial, we remain confident Mr. Antle will be fully vindicated by the courts in Virginia.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Municipal League is a nonpartisan group that represents the interests of city and town governments across the state, as well as a handful of counties. In a Tuesday news release, Justice Forward Virginia said that by preparing a draft policy document that suggests the law should be revisited, VML was making “a full-throated endorsement of racial profiling.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the nationwide scrutiny of police tactics after the 2020 murder of George Floyd, Democratic lawmakers in the Virginia General Assembly passed a law to sharply limit so-called “pretextual” police stops with the goal of reducing racial disparities in traffic enforcement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VML’s tentative support for reviewing the state’s traffic stop procedures heightens the possibility that it could become a live issue for the General Assembly again in the years ahead. Republican lawmakers have introduced bills to repeal the 2020 law, and they could gain the power to achieve that goal if they win majorities in next month’s statehouse elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those disparities have persisted. In a nine-month period ending March 31, more than 30% of Virginia residents subjected to traffic stops were Black, according to a </span><a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2023/RD340/PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> released over the summer, even though only about 19% of the state’s driving-age population is Black. The report also found Black drivers were searched and arrested at higher rates than white drivers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2020 law doesn’t erase minor equipment violations from the books entirely, but it prevents law enforcement from using them as the primary reason to initiate a traffic stop. Supporters of the bill characterized it as a concrete step to protect Black drivers from unfair treatment on Virginia’s roads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican lawmakers sharply criticized the bill at the time, saying it villainized law enforcement at the expense of public safety.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed language in VML’s draft policy document for 2024 says the group supports having the General Assembly take another look at the issue but doesn’t endorse an outright repeal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an open letter, Justice Forward Virginia, the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia, New Virginia Majority, RISE for Youth and several other left-leaning advocacy groups urged VML to change course, saying local governments “ought to expect more from their police departments.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia lawmakers have represented their constituents&#8217; interest in passing and protecting these reforms, limiting these dangerous and potentially deadly police encounters, and our communities are safer for it,” said Justice Forward Virginia Executive Director Rob Poggenklass.  “The VML’s draft policy does not represent a view of public safety that protects all Virginians.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The letter was also backed by the Virginia Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked for a response to the release, VML Executive Director Michelle Gowdy said her organization wasn’t endorsing any particular policy action and does not advocate for racially biased policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s very bland language,” Gowdy said of the draft language. “And it was intended to be very bland language to not take a position on the pretextual stops at all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The VML’s draft policy document, which has not yet been approved by the full group, includes an asterisk noting the language “did not have unanimous support” within VML.  As part of its advocacy, the organization approves general policy statements meant to reflect the needs and views of its members. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The draft document at issue was prepared by a committee of about two dozen members of city councils, municipal attorneys, mayors and city managers. VML’s policy statements are typically discussed and approved at the group’s annual conference and business meeting, which begins this weekend in Norfolk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The language sparking controversy reads: “VML supports the General Assembly reviewing the ability of law enforcement to stop vehicles for expiration of registration stickers, illegal use of defective and unsafe equipment, taillights, brake lights and the suspension of objects or alteration of vehicle to obstruct a driver’s view to promote the safety and security of all persons on the road.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn’t immediately clear Tuesday which local officials supported or opposed the inclusion of that paragraph.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lobbyist for the city of Chesapeake, which has urged the state to repeal the 2020 law, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Chesapeake’s recommendations for state legislative action for the 2023 General Assembly session suggest seemingly minor traffic enforcement can be an important tool in combating more serious crime and getting “countless guns off the street.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Repealing these legislative changes would help officers more proactively address not only highway safety, but also the gun violence and other violent crime that has been plaguing our city and other localities across the commonwealth,” Chesapeake officials wrote in </span><a href="https://www.cityofchesapeake.net/DocumentCenter/View/12135/2023-Legislative-Priorities-PDF?bidId=" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a document</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> laying out the city’s 2023 legislative priorities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration struck a similar note in its report on traffic stop demographics, which said the data wasn’t detailed enough to determine “specific reasons” for disparities between racial groups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The intentional increase of police presence through traffic policing remains one of the most important tools to address high crime, especially violent crime involving a firearm,” Department of Criminal Justice Services Director Jackson Miller, a Youngkin appointee, said in a letter accompanying the traffic stop data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Roanoke City Council has also encouraged the General Assembly to roll back criminal justice reform measures approved in 2020, including the law restricting pretextual traffic stops, according to reporting by </span><a href="https://www.roanokerambler.com/roanoke-city-council-urges-virginia-lawmakers-to-roll-back-criminal-justice-reforms/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Roanoke Rambler</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After pushback from neighborhood groups who wanted police to do more about excessive vehicle noise, the General Assembly already rolled back one element of the 2020 law by </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/04/01/easing-new-limits-on-police-powers-virginia-is-cracking-back-down-on-noisy-cars/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">restoring local authorities’ power</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to stop vehicles with loud exhaust systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the letter of opposition to VML, the groups supporting the 2020 traffic law rejected the connection between traffic enforcement and gun violence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is no reason police need to rely on race-based hunches to end gun violence,” the letter said. “In fact, doing so damages community trust in law enforcement, while doing almost nothing to solve the problem.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preventing traffic stops over minor violations, the coalition of progressive groups also argued, lowers the chances of routine encounters escalating to potential violence. The letter points to the example of Black and Latino Army Lt. Caron Nazario, who </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/04/13/viral-police-stop-in-small-virginia-town-renews-focus-on-qualified-immunity/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">had guns drawn on him in 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when police in the small town of Windsor attempted to pull him over due to a suspected issue with his license plate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These are the types of injustices our commonwealth needs to start caring about,” the letter spearheaded by Justice Forward says. “We all want safe communities, but ‘public safety’ must not be anachronistic and misguided, and must not subject Black people and communities to disproportionate harm.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was one of those cases that inspired Aboutanos to create a hospital-based violence prevention program known as “</span><a href="https://www.vcuhealth.org/news/vcu-healths-bridging-the-gap-program-awarded-part-of-5-million-grant" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bridging the Gap</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” at the VCU trauma center in 2003. That instance involved a 17-year-old boy who died from a gunshot wound to the head after having previously spent months in the hospital due to being shot on two separate occasions that same year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I watched this kid die in our trauma bay. … I realized the function, the role of the trauma center is at the end of this vicious cycle of violence,” Aboutanos said. “We have to change the paradigm, change the role of the trauma center so that it can be part of the community&#8217;s answer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, </span><a href="https://www.vcuhealth.org/services/injury-and-violence-prevention/ivpp-programs/bridging-the-gap" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bridging the Gap</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has become a national model for how to help reduce gun violence rates and break the cycle of violence for patients in vulnerable communities. It primarily focuses on people ages 10 to 24 who are admitted to the trauma center for intentional injuries such as gunshot wounds, stab wounds and assaults.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aboutanos said 17 years of research into the program shows 76% of its nearly 2,000 participants were less likely to be readmitted to the hospital for gun violence. Additionally, program participants have reduced their use of alcohol and drugs by more than half. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to its success, the program is poised to expand to other hospitals across the state through </span><a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2023/RD252/PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$5 million in state funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Virginia’s Firearms Violence Intervention and Prevention Grant Program. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s not enough to say you have a great idea,” Aboutanos said. “You have to study that, you truly have to show that, if money and resources are limited, we should only be putting our efforts into evidence-based programs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though emergency department visits for firearm injuries in Virginia </span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/surveillance-and-investigation/syndromic-surveillance/firearm-injury-surveillance/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">slightly decreased</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2022 prior to peaking in 2021, Virginia State Police </span><a href="https://vsp.virginia.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/CrimeInVirginia2021.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reports</span></a> <a href="https://vsp.virginia.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Crime-In-Virginia-2022.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">show</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a 4.5% increase in the use of firearms in violent crimes during the same time period. On a local level, Aboutanos said a significant number of the approximately 4,300 trauma patients VCU sees annually from the Richmond area have been shot, stabbed or involved in violence, and that figure continues to rise. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aboutanos said VCU’s program works to “bridge that gap between the clinical and social crisis that we have.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While most hospitals typically have programs where social workers give trauma patients a list of resources to call themselves, VCU’s program sets them up with an interventionist at the hospital, who provides a litany of community resources catered to the specific patient’s needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For example, what is their level of conflict resolution? What is their possibility of truly getting a job or not?” Aboutanos said. “We work on both their strengths and susceptibilities and then we find out what this person needs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What a person might need includes resources like job training, transportation, mental health and education help. Even after a patient is discharged, the interventionist and other community partners will then follow up throughout the following year to ensure they are getting the help they need. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $5 million grant will allow the program to expand to five other hospitals with community violence intervention programs. They include Riverside Regional Medical Center in Newport News, Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital, Bon Secours Southside Medical Center in Petersburg, and Sentara Norfolk General Hospital and Children’s Hospital of the King&#8217;s Daughters in Norfolk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The funds will be administered by the Virginia Department of Criminal Justice Services and the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association Foundation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our mission goes beyond providing medical care; it extends to fostering a culture of health, compassion, and resilience,” said VCU Health Chief Operating Officer Michael Elliot in a statement. “That’s what the programs are all about.”</span></p>

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Court of Appeals on Tuesday upheld a 2020 decision by the Virginia Employment Commission that Amazon’s logistics arm had misclassified delivery drivers who work under its Uber-like Flex system as independent contractors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ruling stems from a case that began in 2019 when former Flex driver Ronald Diggs filed an unemployment claim with the VEC. The commission subsequently found the work Diggs and other Flex drivers had performed for Amazon as independent contractors should be classified as employment, and ordered the company to pay unemployment insurance taxes for all other drivers who were “misclassified as independent contractors.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Sept. 26, a three-judge panel of the state appeals court found that “the evidence supports the Commission’s determination that Diggs was an Amazon employee” and that it was reasonable for the commission to extend that conclusion to all other Flex drivers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Amazon’s Flex driver program, independent drivers compete for available delivery routes through an app and then are responsible for collecting and dropping off all of the packages on that route. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s simple: You use your own vehicle to deliver packages for Amazon as a way of earning extra money to move you closer to your goals,” the company says on its Flex website. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon considers Flex drivers self-employed independent contractors. Among other arguments in an appeal of VEC’s decision in Richmond City Circuit Court, the company contended Flex drivers “are free to conduct the manner and means of the delivery services without instruction from Amazon” and “have no set hours of work, do not work full time, do not make any regular oral or written reports to Amazon, are free to choose their own routes to deliver packages, and are paid ‘by the job,’ not hourly, weekly, or monthly.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Employment Commission, however, disputed that classification. State law directs the commission to rely on 20 factors outlined by the Internal Revenue Service in determining whether a worker is an independent contractor or an employee for tax purposes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those 20 factors include the employer’s provision of training to the worker, a continuing relationship between the worker and employer, set hours of work, the requirement that a worker be full time or work on the employer’s premises, the employer’s furnishing of a worker with tools and materials, the employer’s ability to order that a worker do a job in a particular sequence, and the ability of a worker to work for more than one firm at a time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Generally the relationship of employer and employee exists when the person or persons for whom the services are performed have the right to control and direct the individual who performs the services, not only as to the result to be accomplished by the work but also as to the details and means by which that result is accomplished,” the commission quoted the IRS in support of its determination. “That is, an employee is subject to the will and control of the employer not only as to what shall be done but as to how it shall be done.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Employment Commission argued that many of the 20 factors showed that Amazon exerted a level of control over Diggs — and, by extension, other Flex drivers — that was more in line with a relationship between an employer and employee rather than an employer and an independent contractor. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, Flex drivers were given specific instructions “about when, where, and how they are to work,” including where they had to place packages, were required to undergo training in the form of mandatory video tutorials, were compelled to follow a particular sequence of services, were required to contact the company about any problems they encountered and were subject to regular reporting through the driver app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VEC also concluded that even though drivers were paid by delivery block, or route, “all delivery blocks reflected a $20.00 per hour rate,” meaning they received “in effect, an hourly rate of pay.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon appealed that conclusion in both Richmond Circuit Court and the Virginia Court of Appeals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whether, when, and how frequently to provide delivery services to Amazon customers are … entirely within delivery partners’ discretion,” the company wrote in filings with the Richmond Circuit Court. “When making deliveries, delivery partners control all aspects of the delivery service, including how to load packages, how to sequence deliveries, and how to complete deliveries.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon also pointed in its defense to the independent contractor agreement it enters with Flex drivers, which it said “confirms the independent-contractor relationship between each Delivery Partner and Amazon and expressly disclaims the existence of any employment relationship.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In later proceedings, Virginia’s appeals court rejected that argument. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Contrary to Amazon’s contentions, the commission’s determination that ‘Amazon required Flex drivers to comply with specific instructions on when, where and how delivery blocks were to be completed’ is supported by the record,” the judges wrote. “That the text of the agreement purports to give Flex drivers control over the ‘means and manner’ for providing services does not negate the commission’s determination.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorney General Jason Miyares, whose office represented the VEC, told the Mercury he was &#8220;pleased with today’s decision from the Court of Appeals and I am proud of my office’s efforts to ensure that these workers are treated fairly and given the benefits they rightly deserve. &#8220;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A request for comment from Amazon’s lead attorney in the appeal did not receive a response.  </span></p>

<p dir="ltr">A Virginia Commonwealth University professor and a partner are developing a new THC breathalyzer that could be used to quickly detect if someone is driving under the influence of cannabis.</p>
<p dir="ltr">VCU professor Emanuele Alves, who has a doctorate in forensic science, partnered with Wagner Pacheco, who has a doctorate in inorganic analytical chemistry and is an associate professor at Universidade Federal Fluminense. Pacheco traveled from Brazil earlier in the year to help develop the breathalyzer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The device would offer immediate results and produce fewer false positives, according to Alves. Law enforcement and employers could test within a certain window of time for impairment that many tests, such as urine or hair analysis, do not offer. A blood test can track cannabis use within a <a href="https://lobdock.com/2020/08/new-instant-thc-test-shows-drug-use/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lobdock.com/2020/08/new-instant-thc-test-shows-drug-use/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1695414923605000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2J4OgeZnmRyAq3iN9HTU3d">3- to 4-hour time frame</a> but is not a viable driver impairment option. Current THC breathalyzers take <a href="https://news.vcu.edu/article/2023/08/vcu-forensic-science-professor-hopes-a-better-thc-breathalyzer-will-increase-road-safety" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.vcu.edu/article/2023/08/vcu-forensic-science-professor-hopes-a-better-thc-breathalyzer-will-increase-road-safety&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1695414923605000&amp;usg=AOvVaw33iHJRqHN95OS5x1OwGTLg">hours</a> to achieve results.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The VCU-developed breathalyzer will also distinguish between the presence of THC and CBD, which have different effects, in someone’s system. CBD does not get a user high and is often sold as supplemental or personal care products.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The device will produce a change in color if a person has THC in their system and a different color for CBD, according to Pacheco.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Our expectation is that this THC breathalyzer could be so useful for society as it is the alcohol breathalyzer,” Pacheco said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Law enforcement would be able to identify on-site if a driver is under the influence of THC. The breathalyzer could improve road safety by holding drivers accountable for driving impaired, Pacheco said. It is <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title18.2/chapter7/section18.2-266/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title18.2/chapter7/section18.2-266/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1695414923605000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0qdOftdxEOGKBb82sUULV7">illegal</a> to operate a vehicle while impaired.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The goal is to have the first prototype of the THC breathalyzer complete by 2025.</p>
<p dir="ltr">JM Pedini, development director for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, or <a href="https://norml.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://norml.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1695414923605000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2r6IEqcIf1ku4J7BmBocJe">NORML</a>, said they do not agree with the development and eventual use of THC breathalyzers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Studies have failed to prove that the presence of THC in breath is an indicator of either impairment or recent cannabis exposure, Pedini said. NORML has argued against the expansion of drug detection testing and advocated instead for performance-based tests to determine someone’s sobriety.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Examples include the <a href="https://www.impairmentscience.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.impairmentscience.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1695414923605000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2bBJlGSXFXTl9tizOJVE3t">DRUID</a> test, which is an app that measures cognitive and motor functioning to test for impairment. The test measures such things as the person’s reaction time, hand-eye coordination and balance. The measurements are then calculated and an impairment <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/druidapp/id1107595146" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/druidapp/id1107595146&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1695414923605000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2MaaEfYM2I3RYcrGEwX2Cq">score</a> is provided.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One reason NORML does not support THC breathalyzers is because the packaging of CBD products does not always accurately reflect their contents, according to Pedini.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Because of the lack of regulatory oversight on products that are called CBD, a consumer may be of the belief that they are buying a product that contains just CBD when, in fact, it actually contains THC,” Pedini said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The VCU Police Department issued 20 DUIs in the past year, two of which “indicated the presence of some drug or narcotic,” according to police Detective Frederick Wiggins.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Colorado was the first state to legalize recreational cannabis. Almost 80 deaths were reported in 2021 that involved a driver who had more than the allowed limit of THC, according to <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/denver/2023/04/20/driving-high-colorado-crashes-cannabis-marijuana" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.axios.com/local/denver/2023/04/20/driving-high-colorado-crashes-cannabis-marijuana&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1695414923605000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0kgh02IwKpNlthAEFB5P4X">Axios Denver</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Richmond Police did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">VCU Police complete field sobriety test training to help identify impairment and then can use other tests “to determine beyond that,” according to Wiggins.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are still many steps before the breathalyzer is ready for the market.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The VCU Police are constantly evaluating new equipment and I would personally say that any new tool that is evaluated and found could be useful would be of use to officers in any capacity,” Wiggins said.</p>

(Pat Sullivan/Associated Press)</p><p>It can take hours for a sexual assault victim to undergo the multiple swabs, hair samples, blood and urine collections, and other invasive procedures of a sexual assault examination. And then it can take months, sometimes years, for investigators to process that evidence kit.</p>
<p>But now, responding to demands from survivors and their advocates, more states have committed to tackling yearslong investigative backlogs — and dozens are adopting tracking systems that allow patients to follow the forensic paths of their own sexual assault kits.</p>
<p>The tracking systems aim to address historical challenges, such as inadequate forensic evidence handling, delays in case processing and underreporting of assaults. The systems can streamline communication among law enforcement agencies, forensic laboratories and survivors, for example. Perhaps most importantly, the accountability and transparency that come with tracking the assault kits also can speed up a case’s resolution.</p>
<p>“The overarching purpose is to restore dignity and sort of try to tip the balance of power from folks who have been sexually assaulted,” said Colorado state Rep. Meg Froelich, a Democrat who authored her state’s rape kit tracking law, in an interview with Stateline.</p>
<p>“What we’re trying to do is get folks to come forward,” she said, “and to feel that the process is there for them to achieve what they need for healing and closure.”</p>
<p>At least 40 states and the District of Columbia have implemented or committed to establishing a sexual assault kit tracking system in the past nine years, including several coming on board this year, according to the End the Backlog website run by the nonprofit advocacy group Joyful Heart Foundation. The foundation supports survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence and child abuse.</p>
<p><a href="https://alaskabeacon.com/briefs/sexual-assault-survivors-in-alaska-can-now-track-their-rape-kits-online/" target="_blank">Alaska</a> and <a href="https://www.fdle.state.fl.us/News/2023/May/FDLE-Sexual-Assault-Kit-tracking-now-available-sta" target="_blank">Florida</a> launched their online sexual assault kit tracking portals this summer. <a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb23-1199" target="_blank">Colorado</a> and <a href="https://legis.la.gov/legis/BillInfo.aspx?i=244527" target="_blank">Louisiana</a> enacted legislation in May and June, respectively, to establish their own tracking systems.</p>

<p>Advocates say providing a tool to monitor the progress of their kits gives survivors a sense of control and participation in the investigative process, which can be crucial in their healing journey. Moreover, the transparency offered by tracking systems ensures that law enforcement agencies are held accountable for timely kit processing.</p>
<p>“This is just one more tool to evaluate the whole entire system, whether it’s the [sexual assault nurse examiners], the crime lab, the police departments, so that we are doing the best service to these survivors,” said Monica Taylor, the special projects coordinator for the Louisiana attorney general’s office, in an interview with Stateline.</p>
<p>“This tracking system is going to help them go from being a victim to being a survivor, and taking some of the control and power back into their lives,” she said.</p>
<p>Tracking systems also allow advocates to fully support survivors who may have concerns about delays, said Nicole Kass Colvin, the manager of coordinated community responses for the Ohio Alliance to End Sexual Violence. Prior to the launch of <a href="https://sakt.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/" target="_blank">Ohio’s tracking system</a> in 2020, monitoring a kit’s progress was challenging, often requiring survivors to contact law enforcement for updates, Colvin recalled.</p>
<p>“If there was a mistake made somewhere within the process, we [now] can see where that error is and rectify it, rather than that kit being lost for years with no idea of knowing what happened or where it might be,” she said.</p>
<p>Sexual assault kit tracking systems are typically web portals designed to trace the kits’ movement throughout their chain of custody.</p>
<p><i></i>With the collection of a rape evidence kit at a medical facility, a unique tracking or serial number is assigned and provided to the survivor. Law enforcement typically picks up the kits, then sends them to a crime lab for testing.</p>
<p>After testing, the kit may be stored at the crime lab or another secure location for several months or years, depending on the state’s storage requirements.</p>
<p>The evidence can be used to link the assault to a suspect in existing DNA databases, or to develop a DNA profile that can be used in the future. Processing times for rape kits vary by state; for instance, it can take up to 120 days in Florida, 60 days in Alaska and just 30 days in Ohio.</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Addressing backlog, empowering survivors</h4>

	</h4>
<p>The exact scope of the rape kit testing backlog remains unclear. But as of Sept. 7, there are at least 59,894 untested kits in 23 states, according to <a href="https://www.endthebacklog.org/#explore_backlog_map" target="_blank">data collected by the Joyful Heart Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>Among the contributing factors to the backlog are victim-blaming attitudes, budget cuts, reduced crime lab staff, and bias against women and victims of sex crimes, according to a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/ovw/page/file/931391/download" target="_blank">white paper</a> published in 2017 by the U.S. Justice Department’s Office on Violence Against Women.</p>
<p>In recent years, the issue has eroded public trust in law enforcement, the agency noted. In some instances, untested rape kits were linked to cases dating back to the 1980s.</p>

<p>The Virginia Department of Forensic Science operates the <a href="https://perk.dfs.virginia.gov/Account/Login?ReturnUrl=%2F" target="_blank">Physical Evidence Recovery Kit (PERK) Tracking System</a>. In 2016, the General Assembly passed <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+sum+SB291" target="_blank">legislation</a> requiring all kits to be submitted to the agency for analysis within 60 days of collection. Another law passed in 2019 required the agency to &#8220;<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+HB2080" target="_blank">maintain a statewide electronic tracking system</a> for physical evidence recovery kits&#8221; that assigned each a unique identification number. In 2020, former Attorney General Mark Herring <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/crime-law/2020/07/08/virginia-eliminates-backlog-2665-untested-rape-kits/" target="_blank">announced</a> the state had eliminated a backlog of 2,665 untested rape kits.</p>

<p>Sexual assault survivors, from <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Houston-sexual-assault-victims-appeal-to-U-S-14977375.php#:~:text=A%20lawsuit%20filed%20by%20two,than%206%2C000%20untested%20rape%20kits" target="_blank">Houston in 2020</a> to <a href="https://tennesseelookout.com/2023/04/19/class-action-suit-over-rape-kit-delays-moves-forward-in-memphis-but-survivors-cant-savor-a-relief/" target="_blank">Memphis in 2023</a>, have filed class-action lawsuits against city officials over processing delays.</p>
<p>A statewide sexual assault kit tracker has quickened the pace of forensic testing in some states, and in some cases allowed states to identify and address delays. Several states have reduced their backlogs of unsubmitted rape kits, those that were never even sent to a lab for testing.</p>
<p>Alaska, for example, cleared its backlog of untested kits that were held by law enforcement in 2021 and completed result analyses in 2022, according to the Alaska Department of Public Safety’s communication director, Austin McDaniel.</p>
<p>In 2022, 75 untested sexual assault kits were found at the state’s crime lab — down from 558 in 2021, according to <a href="https://dps.alaska.gov/Comm/SAK/Annual-Statewide-Inventory" target="_blank">statistics published by the state’s public safety department</a>.</p>
<p>Similarly, New Hampshire reduced its backlog from 582 kits in 2019 to just one kit in 2022, according to <a href="https://usafacts.org/articles/how-many-rape-kits-are-awaiting-testing-in-the-us-see-the-data-by-state/" target="_blank">an analysis</a> by USAFacts, a nonpartisan data center.</p>
<p>The kits have significant investigative value. In Ohio, for example, state investigators plowing through a backlog of 13,931 kits found 5,349 hits in a DNA database. The state has now cleared its backlog entirely.</p>
<p>North Carolina and Michigan also have reduced their backlog significantly. From 2018 to 2022, North Carolina saw a 99% reduction in unsubmitted kits, while Michigan achieved a 95% reduction during the same period. USAFacts also found that in some states, such as Louisiana and Maryland, the number of unsubmitted kits held by law enforcement increased between 2018 and 2022. Both states’ tracking systems are currently in development.</p>
<p>Under Louisiana’s new <a href="https://legis.la.gov/legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=1332177" target="_blank">law</a>, the state’s sexual assault kit tracking system will be created by the Louisiana State Police. The agency must have a plan by January, and all police and health care providers who store rape kits must fully participate by July 1, 2024.</p>
<p>Rape kit tracking systems play a pivotal role in empowering survivors and enhancing transparency in the criminal justice system, said Morgan Lamandre, the president and CEO of Sexual Trauma Awareness &amp; Response, a Louisiana-based nonprofit advocacy and support group.</p>
<p>“Having this system in place for Louisiana is another step in the right direction for survivors to be taken seriously, for survivors to be treated with real fairness, dignity and respect,” Lamandre said in an interview with Stateline.</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Technology and funding</h4>

	</h4>
<p>The path to establishing state tracking systems varies widely. Some states have passed laws, while others have set up their trackers through agency action or funding priorities, according to Mateo Cello, a policy implementation associate with the Joyful Heart Foundation. New Hampshire, for example, <a href="https://www.apnews.com/a049eeb56ff74086a397f613b3018e4d" target="_blank">secured federal money in 2019</a> to develop a tracking system, but doesn’t have a law on the books.</p>

    </div>

	
<p>In some states, tracking systems exist only in specific cities or counties. Before the launch of Michigan’s statewide system, <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2015/06/08/detroit-ups-rape-kit/28683789/" target="_blank">Wayne County partnered with UPS</a> to create a sexual assault kit tracking system in Detroit, using the same technology the company uses to track packages.</p>
<p>Technological approaches also differ, with some states buying software from private companies and others, such as Idaho, building their systems in-house. Multiple vendors and systems, such as SAMS-Track and <a href="https://www.invitahealth.com/solutions/dna-and-forensics/track-kit-sexual-assault-kit/" target="_blank">Track-Kit by Invita Healthcare Technologies</a>, now sell tracking software for evidence kits.</p>
<p>Some states have relied on their own coffers to fund rape kit tracking projects, while others have used grants awarded by the Justice Department’s Office on Violence Against Women or the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, which is funded by the Bureau of Justice Assistance, a federal agency that awards grants for state, local and tribal criminal justice projects.</p>
<p>“One of the main barriers is the initial cost,” Cello said. “A lot of states get scared by how much implementing a tracking system can cost, so these federal grants definitely help ease some of the states’ worries in terms of creating a tracking system.”</p>
<p>The Sexual Assault Kit Initiative has awarded more than $140 million since 2015 to 23 state agencies, three state law enforcement agencies and nine state attorney general offices in 30 states. Much of the money goes to tracking, though some states have used it to tackle backlogs or hire staff.</p>
<p>“There’s definitely been a lot of progress. That doesn’t mean that it’s done. There’s still a lot more work to do,” Cello said. “We’d like to see all 50 states get a tracking system.”</p>

(Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><em><strong>By Dale M. Brumfield</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around 8:00 a.m. on March 7, 2023, Anitrel “Kiki” Webb, a 45-year-old inmate at the all-female Fluvanna Correctional Facility in Troy, Virginia, went to take a shower.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officers found her almost four hours later, hanging from the rod, dead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Webb had been sentenced in Roanoke the previous April to 15 years with five suspended for malicious wounding. After admission, Fluvanna staff assigned her to the Acute Care Unit (ACU), a restrictive housing facility designed for individuals with severe mental illness. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later, Webb moved to E-wing, a residential treatment unit (RTU) intended for those who are higher functioning than those in ACU. Then, for reasons no inmate there understands, officials placed her into general population.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the wrong move. Staff and inmates saw that Webb’s profound mental health issues were worsened by the merciless general population conditions. “I was in the wing with her for a couple of months,” recalled a fellow inmate, Denise. “In that time, she appeared unstable. I heard that she asked for help because of bullying.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, Webb had an outgoing, empathetic side, which made her mistreatment at the hands of alpha inmates and administration and her untimely death even more tragic. “She was nice to me,” wrote one inmate who goes by the pseudonym Unsilenced. “She brightened up the room with her sense of humor.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/profiles/VA.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prisonpolicy.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Virginia has the highest per capita mass incarceration rate of any democracy in the world, with 749 per 100,000 citizens behind bars. Of these, 161 per 100,000 are female. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These outrageous numbers underscore the commonwealth’s sordid history of being incapable of meeting its own standard of providing “reasonably adequate” health care to its prison population. A lawsuit filed by Fluvanna inmates in 2012, </span><a href="https://www.justice4all.org/what-we-do/criminal-legal-system/fluvanna-correctional-center-for-women/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott v. Clark</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, alleged that deficient care violated Constitutional protections against “cruel and unusual” punishment. </span><a href="https://www.justice4all.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/221-1-exh-1-settlement-agg-w-appendices-A-B-C.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A court-approved settlement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2016 presented 23 terms of compliance that had to be met. Because of delays implementing those terms, in July 2017, two inmates died from undiagnosed health problems. In 2018 the court again ordered Fluvanna to meet the compliance standards. An inspection in April 2022 found Fluvanna compliant in all the standards but two.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This lawsuit was buttressed by a </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt511.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2018 Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) report (table 1-1, pg. 5) which notes that among Virginia’s female inmate population, 53.4% were diagnosed with  mental health conditions categorized as “serious” (at least 2 on a 0-4 scale, with 4 the most serious), compared to 17.7% of the male population.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The audit also noted that Virginia’s incarceration numbers are inflamed by a draconian compassionate release policy that doesn’t consider serious but non-terminal, non-permanently incapacitating illnesses as worthy of early release. In fact, the report acridly noted that “Virginia is the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">only state</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> [emphasis added] that does not have a policy under which inmates who have complex health conditions or are permanently incapacitated may be considered for release.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Virginia Department of Corrections Mental Health and Wellness Operating Procedures 730.3,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Fluvanna, with all of its deficits, is the sole provider of acute mental health care for women in the Virginia prison system. “It’s deeply disturbing that there are 80-year-old women at Fluvanna who have dementia and don’t know why they’re there and are being cared for in such an appalling manner,” Shannon Ellis, an attorney with the Legal Aid Justice Center told The </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/08/14/as-prisoners-continue-to-die-virginia-appeals-court-order-mandating-better-healthcare/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Mercury</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in an August 14, 2019 report. “Those women should not be incarcerated.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to inmates, some women in Fluvanna’s ACU never get outside recreation. One woman has allegedly been in ACU for over 12 years, and never gets out of her cell but to shower. “She is alone, no one to help her,” wrote Unsilenced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another inmate, Denise, said that “I think one of the worst things the DOC did was to stop sending inmates to state mental health facilities when needed.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other inmates report that the Fluvanna staff is spread too thin, paid poorly, badly trained and frequently preoccupied with computer games and their phones. “Walk-throughs are supposed to be done every thirty minutes,” former inmate Stephanie Angelo said in a recent phone interview. “Why did it take them four hours to find Kiki?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unsilenced asked, “Where was the Building 6 staff that day? Why weren’t they doing the job they were hired to do? For four hours, no one noticed that [Kiki] wasn’t in her cell or the dayroom.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The events leading up to Webb’s death are equally worrying to those who knew her. “I am more disturbed by the fact that she kept asking for help,” wrote “Sally,” a former Fluvanna inmate who has since been moved to another facility. “An officer here that used to work at Fluvanna commented that he couldn’t believe she was in a general population unit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Webb purportedly struggled to access her medicine, “especially if she missed pill line, and no medical personnel would then put forth the effort to bring it to her,” wrote Unsilenced. “This is sad because it was well known that she needed her medication.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inmates note that in addition to staffing issues, overcrowding and COVID-19 lockdowns, there is a rampant illicit drug problem at Fluvanna. Angelo worked in the infirmary during her entire three-year incarceration and stated that during that period the prison fired at least two nurses for bringing drugs inside. Several others quit. Another anonymous inmate reported that a fellow inmate in Building 3 was severely beaten on March 13 in a drug dispute. “There is a large drug problem within this compound,” she wrote, “and many victims pay dearly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Angelo recalled that she saw several suicide attempts by other inmates, usually by cutting. Another told of how one inmate, “Florence,” talked of suicide while destroying all her belongings during a mental health crisis. Only a call from another inmate to Florence’s mother – who in turn called watch command – may have prevented Florence’s death. According to the inmate, “no one would listen to her.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is unknown if Webb’s death is in any way connected with the latest turmoil at Fluvanna. In late April, with no explanation, VADOC </span><a href="https://wina.com/news/064460-courteney-stuart-reports-warden-mystery-at-fccw-prompts-renewed-call-for-doc-oversight/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">abruptly removed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Warden Mariea LeFevers. In addition, inmates reported crime scene tape around offices of deputy wardens and FBI agents asking questions. The shakeup briefly prompted renewed cries from some lawmakers for independent oversight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sally wrote that Webb’s death has caused “aftershocks in the system.” Officers  have “made it clear that they will be doing their rounds and checking on everyone, as they do not want that to happen to anyone here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While procedural change may hopefully emerge from Kiki Webb’s death, Virginia’s nightmare mix of mass incarceration and mental illness practically guarantees that more inmates — especially those in the throes of a crisis — will die alone and forgotten, as she did, then have their death covered up by the very system that aggravated their condition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is how we treat our mentally ill,” Sally said of the Webb incident. “We punish and cage them, ignore their cries for help. We offer no proper treatment, only sedation and judgment. IF, a BIG IF, they make it, they are sent out into a world further stamped by those who failed them.”</span></p>

(Danielle Gaines / Maryland Matters) </p><p>A Maryland man admitted to sending threatening messages to Maryland and Virginia lawmakers and faces five years in prison after pleading guilty in federal court to threatening a group that advocates for LGBTQI+ people.</p>
<p>Adam Michael Nettina, 34, of West Friendship, entered the plea in U.S. District Court in Baltimore on Wednesday.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Attorney’s Office, Nettina left multiple voicemails on the night of March 28, 2023, at the Human Rights Campaign, a Washington, D.C.-based advocacy organization.</p>
<p>The messages, left at 11:17 p.m. and 11:21 p.m., referenced the March 27, 2023, mass shooting at a Nashville private school, where police identified the perpetrator as transgender.</p>
<p>In the expletive-laced messages, Nettina made multiple threats, including, “We’ll cut your throats. We’ll put a bullet in your head.”</p>
<p>He was arrested for the threats on March 31.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Nettina was re-arraigned in the case. As part of the plea agreement, the threats to lawmakers were made public.</p>
<p>According to the plea, on Oct. 15, 2022, Nettina sent an email to a Virginia delegate’s press email account, stating: “The delegate is a terrorist. You are a terrorist. You deserve to be shot and hung in the streets. You want to come after people? Let’s go b**ch.” Nettina also sent a similar message to another email address of the delegate two minutes later, according to prosecutors.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Del. Elizabeth Guzman (D-Prince William) confirmed she is the Virginia delegate listed in the documents.</p>
<p>The plea states that the emails were sent two days after an Oct. 13 news story that included an interview with Guzman &#8220;in which she advocated for the prevention of abuse towards transgender children.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that time, Guzman had said she planned to reintroduce a failed <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+HB580" target="_blank">2020 bill</a> that would have expanded the state&#8217;s definition of child abuse and neglect to include situations where a parent or guardian &#8220;creates or inflicts &#8230; a physical or mental injury on the basis of the child&#8217;s gender identity or sexual orientation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The proposal caused <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/10/14/lgbtq-bill-virginia-guzman/" target="_blank">a political uproar in Virginia</a> after news station WJLA-TV ran a report stating that it could lead to felony charges for parents who don&#8217;t affirm their child&#8217;s gender identity or sexual orientation. Republicans including Gov. Glenn Youngkin, Attorney General Jason Miyares and the state party all released statements castigating the proposal, and some Democrats distanced themselves from it. Guzman and her team disputed the portrayal of the legislation, arguing it made no mention of gender-affirming care, but ultimately withdrew it. A full recording of her interview with WJLA released later includes an exchange where she denies that the bill would consider parents not affirming their child&#8217;s gender identity or sexual orientation to be abuse.</p>
<p>In Maryland, according to the plea, Nettina made a threat on March 31, 2022, to now-Del. Nick Allen (D-Baltimore County), who was then a candidate for the House of Delegates and had posted a message of support on social media in honor of the Trans Day of Visibility.</p>
<p>Nettina replied with a Facebook message, in which he said he had “begun the formal process of getting [Allen] excommunicated…” from the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>On election night, when Allen won his race, Nettina sent another series of Facebook messages, calling the delegate-elect a “Baby killing terrorist,” and wishing death on the candidate and his wife. “Enjoy hell You’re going sooner than you think,” the messages stated, according to prosecutors.</p>
<p>Allen was not publicly named in the plea agreement, but his March 2022 Facebook post remained public Tuesday and he confirmed the threatening messages were directed to him.</p>
<p>“It’s clear that we have a mental health crisis in this country. And we have a hate crisis in this country. And those things tend to overlap in violent ways,” Allen said in an interview. The delegate said he would pray for Nettina, who was a high school classmate.</p>
<p>“I hope we will begin to see less of these kinds of things and less violence and less violent rhetoric,” Allen said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Sentencing to occur in November</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. Attorney’s Office is expected to argue at sentencing that the additional threats to the lawmakers mean Nettina should face a longer sentence. Prosecutors are also seeking a sentencing enhancement for Nettina’s targeting of LGBTQ+ supporters and the community.</p>
<p>In an earlier case filing seeking Nettina’s release from pre-trial detention, his lawyers wrote that while he was accused of making threats, there was no evidence that he had made any effort to act on the threat.</p>
<p>“His words were offensive and harmful, but Mr. Nettina is not an individual who has acted on, or sought to act on, the threat,” his attorney, Joseph Murtha, wrote in April.</p>
<p>His attorneys sought Nettina’s release to an inpatient treatment program.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Murtha offered a brief statement after the guilty plea was entered: “Mr. Nettina found himself in a dark place in his life at the time of the voicemail that he left. He has accepted responsibility for his actions, and regrets that it happened. At no time did he ever intend to harm anyone.”</p>
<p>The guilty plea was announced Wednesday by U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Erek L. Barron, Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, and Special Agent in Charge Thomas J. Sobocinski of the FBI’s Baltimore Field Office.</p>
<p>“You have the right to your own opinions, but you don’t have the right to threaten the lives of those who disagree with you,” Barron said in a statement. “We’ll continue prosecuting these threats to the fullest extent of the law.”</p>
<p>Sobocinski urged people who receive threatening messages to notify law enforcement.</p>
<p>“All Americans should be able to go about their daily lives without fear and without threats of violence,” Sobocinski said in a statement. “Protecting the American people is the FBI’s number one priority and we remain committed to protecting the rights of all Americans. We urge members of the public to notify law enforcement about threats of violence or if they have any concerns.”</p>
<p>Nettina faces a maximum sentence of five years in federal prison for making threats transmitted by interstate communications.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge George L. Russell, III has scheduled a sentencing hearing for Nov. 3.</p>

Glenn Youngkin. (Sarah Vogelsong  / Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to a request by Gov. Glenn Youngkin, Attorney General Jason Miyares released <a href="https://www.oag.state.va.us/files/Opinions/2023/23-042-Youngkin-issued.pdf" target="_blank">an official advisory opinion</a> today concluding the state’s model policies concerning the treatment of transgender students comply with federal and state anti-discrimination laws and reiterating the administration’s stance that school boards must adopt policies in line with them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is my opinion that the model policies comply with the Equal Protection Clause, Title IX, and the [Virginia Human Rights Act], and that … local school boards are required to adopt policies that are consistent with them,” Miyares wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 10-page document mainly focuses on the potential conflict between federal and state anti-discrimination laws and the policies’ guidelines regarding athletics, student identification and bathroom use. </span></p>
<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trans_official_opinion.pdf" class="pdfemb-viewer" style="" data-width="max" data-height="max" data-toolbar="bottom" data-toolbar-fixed="off">Trans_official_opinion</a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a press release announcing the opinion, Miyares said the policies are about parents’ rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Parents, not government, are in the best position to work with their children on important life decisions, and no parent signs up to co-parent with the government,” the statement said. “The Model Policies ensure that all students are treated with dignity and that parental involvement remains at the center. These policies are fully compliant with the law, and school boards across the Commonwealth should support and implement them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The opinion notes the inaugural set of model policies produced in 2021 under former Gov. Ralph Northam was withdrawn because the Department of Education under the Youngkin administration concluded they “promoted a specific viewpoint aimed at achieving cultural and social transformation in schools.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The revised model policies were designed to correct the failure of the prior policies to recognize that … ultimately, ‘the education of the youth of this [Commonwealth] is the responsibility of the parents of the students,’” Miyares wrote. </span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;As Va. school districts split on transgender policies, state enforcement tools appear limited&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/08/22/as-virginia-school-districts-split-on-updated-transgender-policies-state-enforcement-tools-appear-limited/embed/#?secret=JwKkTJqtSs#?secret=RKkAPlYqRX" data-secret="RKkAPlYqRX" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Education’s 2023 “Model Policies on Ensuring Privacy, Dignity, and Respect for All Students and Parents in Virginia’s Public Schools” were first drafted in 2022 and add steps students and parents must take when seeking gender-affirming changes to the student’s identity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The policies prohibit students from using school facilities or participating in sports activities that don’t align with the sex on their official school record. Changes to that designation require students and their parents to submit school divisions legal documentation like a new birth certificate or passport. A parent must provide written permission in order for a student to go by a different name or pronouns at school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Because the manner in which a child is addressed by school officials is inextricably tied to the educational upbringing of that child, parents’ fundamental rights necessarily encompass the prerogative to decide how their child will be addressed while at school,” the opinion said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Students who wish to be referred to by certain pronouns without the approval of their parents are not a protected class under any relevant federal or state law,” the opinion continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That conclusion drew swift criticism from the ACLU of Virginia, which issued a statement from Legal Director Eden Heilman calling the policies “part of a coordinated, national effort to erase transgender and nonbinary students from the classroom.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At best, they invite discrimination; at worst, they require it,” Heilman said. “Attorney General Jason Miyares’ opinion defending the policies is every bit as cruel and misguided as the policies themselves.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares, however, argued in his opinion that discrimination on the basis of sex is different from discrimination on the basis of gender identity and that the Fourth Amendment, Title IX and the Virginia Human Rights Act allow for the separation of sexes in certain contexts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Both sides of the classification — biological males and biological females — include transgender students and treat them identically to all similarly situated students of the same sex,” the opinion said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The opinion also stated the model policies do not conflict with the 2020 Grimm v. Gloucester County School Board decision. In that case, the Richmond-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit upheld a previous ruling that the local school board had violated Title IX by preventing transgender student Gavin Grimm from using a boys’ bathroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grimm</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> does not impose a blanket rule forbidding sex-separate facilities in all situations,” the opinion said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, Miyares wrote, the model policies “expressly address situations where federal law or a binding decision interpreting federal law may require a departure from the model policy’s default rule.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The model policy addressing bathrooms requires students to use ‘bathrooms that correspond to [their] sex, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">except to the extent federal law requires otherwise</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,’ and expressly cites </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grimm</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as an example of a federal law that may require otherwise,” the opinion continues. “A model policy that instructs school divisions to follow federal law, including </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grimm</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, cannot possibly conflict with federal law and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grimm</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because there is not a conflict with state or federal law, the opinion concluded, then school boards are required to adopt the model policies under Virginia code. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the opinion does not comment on what enforcement tools the state has to take action against school boards who do not comply. Several school divisions, including Fairfax, Arlington and Richmond, have </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/08/22/as-virginia-school-districts-split-on-updated-transgender-policies-state-enforcement-tools-appear-limited/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">openly stated they do not plan to adopt the model policies. </span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a press conference Wednesday, Gov. Youngkin responded to a question about steps the state could take besides telling school boards to follow the law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I just ask you to stand by,” Youngkin said. “Just like they initially pushed back when we issued an executive order empowering parents to make decisions for their children, while they are pushing back now, eventually we got to the right place. And I expect us fully to get to the right place.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ACLU of Virginia Thursday said that “like all attorney general opinions, today’s is only advisory, not binding.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia courts are not required to follow it,” the group said. “School boards continue to have an obligation to create safe, inclusive school environments for all students in compliance with state and federal law.”</span></p>

(Peter Dazeley/Getty Images)</p><p>A federal judge in Virginia will likely stay – or pause – a case regarding medical providers and mifepristone, a drug commonly used as part of chemical abortions, because of similar challenges in Texas and Washington.</p>
<p>Groups from Virginia, Montana and Kansas had filed the suit in the Charlottesville division of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia and asked Judge Robert S. Ballou to order the Food and Drug Administration to drop requirements of reporting adverse effects of the drug as well as limiting which providers can prescribe it. The plaintiffs, a group of women’s health providers and clinics, had said an April ruling by a federal judge in Texas would have curtailed their ability to prescribe the drug via telehealth.</p>

<p>However, Ballou pointed out that the Texas case, as well as a different one in Washington state, focus on the FDA, mifepristone and what prescription guidelines should be in place. Those issues are winding their way through other federal courts and will likely land at the U.S. Supreme Court. Ballou said for those reasons, and because most of the legal actions surrounding medical providers’ ability to prescribe mifepristone have been temporarily paused because of the ongoing court action, it was in the best interest to wait or pause the Virginia case until the matter was decided, possibly by the nation’s highest court.</p>
<p>Originally, medical providers pointed to the remarkable track record of safety for the drug, noting that its risk of death was much smaller than some over-the-counter medications, including ibuprofen. However, the organizations bristled at more restrictions being implemented by the FDA without corresponding scientific data. They said that the additional measures were burdensome and limited healthcare for women who were considering an abortion.</p>
<p>“Plaintiffs have offered no evidence that FDA intends to take action to change any of mifepristone’s (tracking and prescribing requirements) or to restrict the access of the drug in Virginia, Kansas or Montana,” Ballou said in a memorandum opinion. “Indeed the FDA has been enjoined from changing (them) at this time in 17 states and the District of Columbia by the Washington court. “</p>
<p>Ballou did point out, though, that the issue may again become ready to litigate in court after a decision by the Supreme Court or an appeals court.</p>
<p>“I agree that the outcome of the (Texas) case could have an impact on plaintiffs, but it is neither necessary nor appropriate to issue a preliminary injunction in anticipation or because of a ruling from another court,” Ballou said.</p>
<p>He ordered all parties to set up a conference to make sure the record in the court case is complete before issuing any final order.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON —  A federal appeals court ruled Wednesday the abortion pill can stay on the market, but it agreed with a lower court that ultimately use should revert to prescribing and dosage instructions that were in place before 2016.</p>
<p>That appeals court <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca5.213145/gov.uscourts.ca5.213145.506860229.1.pdf" target="_blank">ruling</a> will immediately be put on hold until the U.S. Supreme Court decides whether to take the case, under <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-preserves-access-abortion-pill-lawsuit-continues" target="_blank">a decision the high court released</a> in April. The ruling from the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals is expected to quickly be appealed to the high court.</p>
<p>The ruling means mifepristone remains legal and on the market in states that haven’t banned it, and, due to the Supreme Court’s earlier order, can be used under modifications approved by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
<p>Mifepristone was originally approved in 2000 and is the first of two drugs used in medication abortion. It is approved for use up to 10 weeks gestation and is also frequently used to treat miscarriage.</p>
<p>The Kaiser Family Foundation <a href="https://www.kff.org/report-section/a-national-survey-of-obgyns-experiences-after-dobbs-report/" target="_blank">released a survey</a> in June showing that 62% of the nearly 600 OB-GYNs surveyed said they use mifepristone with a second drug called misoprostol to treat a miscarriage.</p>
<p>“Miscarriages are very common and an important aspect of many OBGYNs’ scope of practice, and sometimes involve the same procedures and medications that are used for abortions,” KFF wrote. “In early pregnancy, medical management for miscarriage with misoprostol and mifepristone allows a shorter time course than waiting for nonviable pregnancy tissue to pass on its own (expectant management) in patients without complications.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Many questions in oral arguments</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The three-judge panel from the New Orleans-based appeals court that issued the ruling Wednesday <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/three-judge-panel-us-appeals-court-hears-arguments-abortion-pill-case" target="_blank">heard oral arguments</a> in the case in May after the federal government appealed a district judge’s ruling.</p>
<p>The judges had dozens of questions for the federal government’s attorney, the lawyer representing a manufacturer and the attorney for Alliance Defending Freedom, the anti-abortion legal organization that originally filed the case.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s ruling comes from that same panel, made up of Jennifer Walker Elrod, who was nominated by former President George W. Bush, as well as James C. Ho and Cory T. Wilson, who were both nominated by former President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>The appeals court on Wednesday disagreed with the district court judge’s ruling that the 2000 approval of mifepristone should be overturned and that the generic version of the pharmaceutical should no longer be available.</p>

<p>The appeals judges agreed with the lower court’s opinion that several changes the FDA made in 2016 and 2021 regarding dosing and use of the prescription should no longer be in effect.</p>
<p>“In loosening mifepristone’s safety restrictions, FDA failed to address several important concerns about whether the drug would be safe for the women who use it,” the appeals court’s ruling states.</p>
<p>“It failed to consider the cumulative effect of removing several important safeguards at the same time. It failed to consider whether those ‘major’ and ‘interrelated’ changes might alter the risk profile, such that the agency should continue to mandate reporting of non-fatal adverse events,” the appeals judges wrote. “And it failed to gather evidence that affirmatively showed that mifepristone could be used safely without being prescribed and dispensed in person.”</p>
<p>The appeals court acknowledged in its ruling that several medical organizations filed briefs expressing concern that eliminating access to mifepristone for miscarriage management “even temporarily, may pose health risks to certain women.”</p>
<p>“These concerns are not insignificant,” the appeals court wrote. “But they apply primarily (if not wholly) to the challenge to the 2000 Approval — a claim that we have concluded is not likely to succeed.”</p>
<p>Arguments about reducing access to mifepristone by reverting to the more limited use instructions in place before 2016 “are lessened by the fact that mifepristone would remain available … as would options for surgical abortion,” the appeals court wrote.</p>
<p>Ho wrote his own opinion, saying that unlike his colleagues on the appeals court, he believed the anti-abortion organizations that filed the lawsuit likely would succeed with their challenge to the 2000 approval of mifepristone.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the U.S. Justice Department said in a statement it “strongly disagrees with the Fifth Circuit’s decision in Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v. FDA and will be seeking Supreme Court review of that decision.”</p>
<p>“As the Attorney General has said before, the Justice Department is committed to defending the FDA’s scientific judgment and protecting Americans’ access to safe and effective reproductive care,” the spokesperson said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Limits prior to 2016</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Reverting to the pre-2016 instructions would lower when the medication can be prescribed from 10 weeks gestation to seven weeks and change dosage and timing.</p>
<p>It would mean only doctors, not qualified health care providers, could prescribe mifepristone. Patients would need to attend three in-person doctor’s office visits, eliminating the ability for the medication to be prescribed via telehealth and shipped through the mail.</p>
<p>The generic version of mifepristone could be at risk of no longer being approved, though the appeals court rejected that option in its Wednesday ruling.</p>
<p>The manufacturer of the brand name version, Mifeprex, would need to relabel the product to comply with the court’s ruling, if the Supreme Court ultimately agrees with the appeals court’s ruling. Lawyers for the company that manufactures the brand-name version have said this could take months.</p>
<p>The case began in mid-November when Alliance Defending Freedom filed the lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas.</p>
<p>ADF, on behalf of four anti-abortion medical organizations and four anti-abortion physicians, argued the U.S. Food and Drug Administration incorrectly approved mifepristone to terminate pregnancies in 2000.</p>
<p>The lawsuit asked the district court to overturn that approval, but in the event the judge didn’t agree to do that, ADF requested the court revert prescribing and use of the medication to instructions that were in place before 2016.</p>
<p>Judge Matthew Joseph Kacsmaryk ruled to end access to mifepristone in April when <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-administration-appeals-judges-ruling-ordering-abortion-pill-us-market" target="_blank">he issued a stay</a> of the FDA’s original 2000 approval.</p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court placed that ruling on hold while the case works through the appeals process. That decision, which has kept mifepristone legal, would lift after the nine justices issue a ruling, or refuse to hear the case.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Reactions to ruling</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>​​Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a written statement the “appeals court decision sets up a showdown at the Supreme Court over baseless attacks on medication abortion, which has been a lifeline since the high court reversed Roe last year.”</p>
<p>“This order, if allowed to take effect, could jeopardize the FDA’s entire scientific system of drug approvals and would leave patients panicked and confused about their health and safety,” Northup said.</p>
<p>Christopher M. Zahn, interim CEO of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said in a statement the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals decision “is another example of judicial activism that reflects ideology, not science.”</p>
<p>“Mifepristone is demonstrably safe and effective for its FDA-approved use up to 10 weeks of gestation, it is demonstrably safe and effective when used as directed by telemedicine, and it is demonstrably safe and effective when prescribed by qualified advanced practice clinicians,” Zahn said. “The FDA made these changes to mifepristone’s regulation for medication abortion and miscarriage management based on robust scientific data and with the support of the medical community, including ACOG.”</p>
<p>The medical organization, Zahn said, looks “forward to sharing with the Supreme Court the overwhelming evidence and consensus of the medical community in support of mifepristone for medication abortion and miscarriage management.”</p>
<p>​​Alliance Defending Freedom Senior Counsel Erin Hawley said in a written statement that the 5th Circuit’s ruling was a “significant victory for the doctors and medical associations we represent and, more importantly, the health and safety of women.”</p>
<p>“The 5th Circuit rightly required the FDA to do its job and restore crucial safeguards for women and girls, including ending illegal mail-order abortions,” Hawley added. “The FDA will finally be made to account for the damage it has caused to the health of countless women and girls and the rule of law by unlawfully removing every meaningful safeguard from the chemical abortion drug regimen.”</p>

(Richard Vogelsong for the Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Court of Appeals ruled Tuesday that wine shippers who buy wine from different wineries that then box and ship orders on to Virginia customers must get a state license for every location involved in the chain. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.vacourts.gov/opinions/opncavwp/0973222.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The decision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> overturns an earlier ruling by Richmond Circuit Court that found California-based company VinoShipper only needed a state license for its home office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VinoShipper engages in what’s known as drop-shipping — a practice where a company doesn’t keep inventory in its own warehouse but instead contracts with third parties to fulfill orders. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In VinoShipper’s case, when customers buy wine through the company’s website, it verifies they are 21 or older and that their order doesn’t violate any state laws governing how much wine can be shipped to them. (Virginia law only authorizes wine shippers to send a Virginian up to two cases of wine per month.) It then buys the selected wine from the winery, sends it a shipping label and a state-required notice that someone 21 or older must receive the delivery and directs UPS to pick up the shipment from the winery and deliver it to the customer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following “inquiries from other licensees” about VinoShipper’s business model, ABC has argued that because state law requires shippers to obtain a separate license for “each separate place” where business occurs, VinoShipper must get licenses for every place that selects, boxes and transfers packages to UPS on its behalf. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VinoShipper, however, contended shipping is a “process” rather than a single act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company “insists that the only legally significant step in that process is when VinoShipper tells UPS to pick up the shipment from the winery for delivery to the customer in Virginia,” the appeals court Judge Stuart A. Raphael wrote. “And because VinoShipper directs that activity (and all other activities) from its office in Windsor, California, it says that the ‘shipping’ takes place there and there alone.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court rejected that argument Tuesday, ruling the company was violating state law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Shipping,” Raphael wrote, includes “(1) receiving the customer’s order; (2) purchasing the wine from the wineries; (3) selecting and packing the wine in boxes for shipment; (4) affixing the shipping and over-21 labels; and (5) tendering the package to UPS for delivery to the customer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That VinoShipper delegates the third, fourth, and fifth steps to the wineries does not mean that VinoShipper does not perform those essential selling and shipping functions; it just does them through entities without their own Virginia license, using those entities’ employees,” he continued. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Raphael noted VinoShipper “may have developed an innovative and efficient wine-shipping model that is ideal for a ‘just-in-time digital economy,’” he concluded “that model does not currently comply with Virginia law.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The General Assembly has amended the ABC Act to account for technological innovations,” he said. “Whether the ABC Act should be amended again to accommodate VinoShipper’s business model is the General Assembly’s choice, not ours.”</span></p>

(Wyatt Gordon/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p>While sweltering heat in prisons without air conditioning has long been an issue in the South, extreme heat waves worsened by climate change are expanding the problem into Northern states.</p>
<p>In recent years, Michigan, Minnesota, South Dakota, Washington and Wisconsin have seen extreme heat in prisons. Many of these states lack the necessary infrastructure for ventilation or cooling systems capable of managing extreme heat.</p>
<p>“This is not at all an issue that’s confined to what we all think of as the hot states,” David Fathi, director of the ACLU National Prison Project, said in an interview with Stateline. “While it may be more common, or more of a pressing problem in the Southern states and the states of the Southwest, this is now truly a national problem.”</p>
<p>Some advocates have argued that hot conditions in prisons constitute “cruel and unusual punishment” prohibited by the Eighth Amendment. The conditions have led to lawsuits and protests across the country.<b></b></p>
<p>The lack of air conditioning amid rising temperatures creates challenges for prisons: possible heat-related illnesses, increased violent incidents and high staff turnover, according to experts and advocates.</p>

<p>To address these problems, some states are offering alternative cooling methods such as cooling beds and increased access to water stations or ice; others have allocated funding toward upgrading or building new facilities with air conditioning.</p>
<p>Most states, however, have taken little to no action, advocates say.</p>
<p>“The absence of air conditioning in prisons and jails is a disaster waiting to happen,” Fathi said. “This is not an issue of comfort or luxury, it is an issue of life and death. … The decision not to air condition these facilities is essentially a decision to let people die.”</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Impact on incarcerated people and visitors</h4>

	</h4>
<p>A <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0281389" target="_blank">study published in March</a> by PLOS One and written by researchers affiliated with Brown University, Boston University and Harvard University suggests that extreme heat is causing fatalities within prisons across the United States, offering one of the first pieces of epidemiological evidence linking the climate crisis to prison mortality. The study also revealed elevated rates of mortality in the Northeast region.</p>
<p>The researchers analyzed deaths in both state-run and privately run prisons during June, July and August from 2001 to 2019. They found that a 10-degree temperature increase above the average correlated with a 5.2% increase in deaths or a 6.7% increase in deaths related to heart disease.</p>
<p>The study also found that a two-day heat wave correlated with a mortality increase of 21% in the Northeast, compared with 0.8% in the Midwest, 1.3% in the South and 8.6% in the West.</p>
<p>People in prison are increasingly vulnerable to heat-related illnesses, according to David Pellow, the director of the Global Environmental Justice Project at the University of California, Santa Barbara.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://bjs.ojp.gov/library/publications/aging-state-prison-population-1993-2013" target="_blank">prison population is aging</a>, and about 40% of incarcerated people report having a <a href="https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/mpsfpji1112.pdf" target="_blank">chronic medical condition</a>, according to estimates released by the Bureau of Justice Statistics. <a href="https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/mhppji.pdf" target="_blank">Mental health problems</a> are also prevalent across the prison population. Psychotropic drugs, which are used to treat some mental illnesses, can exacerbate heat sensitivity because they “reduce the body’s ability to naturally regulate heat and cool down,” Pellow wrote in an email.</p>
<p>Roy Rogers, who spent almost 30 years in Wisconsin’s correctional facilities — including the Columbia Correctional Institution and the Green Bay Correctional Institution — said the inmates’ living quarters were not air-conditioned. In some cases, inmates relied on manually opening and closing windows for ventilation.</p>
<p>“To put it plainly, it sucked,” said Rogers, who now sits on the board of directors for the Wisconsin Justice Initiative, a criminal justice reform group, in an interview with Stateline. “When you get to the extreme heat, there’s really not much that is done for those who are incarcerated.”</p>
<p>While there is not universal air conditioning in Wisconsin’s facilities, the majority are equipped with “some kind of air handling system that circulates air throughout the buildings,” according to Kevin Hoffman, the deputy director of communications for the Wisconsin Department of Corrections. The department’s current administration plans to include tempered air systems in upcoming construction and renovation projects, Hoffman wrote in an email to Stateline.</p>
<p>Rogers said personal fans are considered a “high luxury” among incarcerated individuals, but the fans sold to inmates are often too small and cheaply made to be effective against the blistering heat.</p>
<p>“They really do nothing for you. If the air around you is hot, the only thing you will accomplish is blowing around more hot air,” Rogers said. “It’s going to end up being like 90 or close to 100 [degrees] in your room.”</p>
<p>Inmates’ limited financial means, often constrained by wages ranging on average from 14 cents to $1.41 per hour, according to a <a href="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2017/04/10/wages/" target="_blank">2017 analysis by the Prison Policy Initiative</a>, further complicate their ability to access cooling resources. Fans sold in some state prison commissaries can cost about $20.</p>
<p>Some prisoners resort to extreme measures to seek relief, Rogers said, even opting for solitary confinement in segregated cells with cooler temperatures.</p>
<p>Moreover, the scorching conditions can create a volatile atmosphere that fosters aggression and escalates potentially violent incidents.</p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virginia conditions</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>About 77% of people incarcerated by the Virginia Department of Corrections and probationers in the Community Corrections Alternative Program are housed in buildings with air conditioning, according to a June 20 press release from the agency on preparations for summer heat.</p>
<p>VADOC says the remaining 23% of inmates <span style="font-weight: 400;">— about 5,500 people — &#8220;are provided ample heat mitigation resources, including the installation of fans, providing extra ice and water pouches, adjustments to scheduling, and the location of some activities to accommodate for high temperatures.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Misting fans are also used by several facilities, as well as smoke exhaust fans to increase airflow,&#8221; the department wrote.</p>
<p>VADOC said it plans to use funding from the American Rescue Plan Act to carry out renovations in buildings without air conditioning and is &#8220;closely monitoring&#8221; state capital improvement funds &#8220;to address further heat-related renovations in additional facilities over the next year and beyond.&#8221;</p>

<p>“The extreme heat is not good for anyone,” he said. “The staff [is also impacted], so they are more agitated. They are more inclined to handle the residents a little bit more roughly than usual. … It elevates the overall atmosphere in a prison to a real volatile level where it makes it unsafe for everybody.”</p>
<p>The heat also affects visitors.<i></i></p>
<p>When Kehaulani Walker visited her husband last summer at the Monroe Correctional Complex in Washington state, the heat was “unbearable.” The complex only has air conditioning in its Special Offender Units, according to the Washington State Department of Corrections.</p>
<p>“It affected us to the point where I’ve left visitation a few times because we would be sweating so bad,” Walker, an activist and the founder and CEO of the group Families of the Incarcerated, said in an interview with Stateline. “We really couldn’t have an actual true visitation because both of us were drenched in sweat, and we were focusing on the heat more than we could focus on each other.”</p>
<p>During one of her visits, Walker also noticed a correctional officer dozing off in the heat — something she said is a safety issue.</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Staff, infrastructure lacking</h4>

	</h4>
<p>Some advocates say extreme heat is fueling staff turnover and staffing shortages in state prisons.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.nj.gov/correctionsombudsperson/documents/Jail%20Inspection%20Reports/DOC%20Ombudsperson%20Special%20Report-%20Heat.pdf" target="_blank">report released in 2022 by the New Jersey Office of the Corrections Ombudsperson</a> said around 3,500 prisoners were housed in units with no air conditioning, while 3,000 correctional officers were assigned to work in those areas.</p>
<p>“The office also heard reports from staff and labor leaders that high heat increased irritability and slowed responses to prison security incidents,” the report said. “Incarcerated people and staff universally suggested that air-conditioning and other building repairs were badly needed.”</p>
<p>At least 44 states lack universal air conditioning within their prison facilities, even in regions known for sweltering summer temperatures, according to a <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/graphics/2022/09/12/american-prisons-air-conditioning-heat-climate/8017395001/" target="_blank">2022 USA Today investigation</a>.</p>
<p>In some instances, non-air-conditioned areas include living quarters, while air-conditioned spaces might be designated for correctional officers, heat-vulnerable individuals or specific units like solitary confinement. Alaska is the only state without air conditioning across any of its facilities.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2866&amp;context=ulj" target="_blank">article published in 2022 in the Fordham Urban Law Journal</a> found that chronic understaffing in correctional facilities will worsen because of climate-induced hazards and economic pressures. It also said deteriorating facilities pose heightened dangers as they’re more susceptible to extreme heat, flooding and other catastrophic climate and weather events.</p>
<p>“Facility-related hazards caused by climate-related stress will become more dangerous and disruptive as the frequency and amplitude of extreme weather increase,” the article said.</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How states are responding</h4>

<p>Some states, including those in northern parts of the country, are taking steps that range from cooling system installations to temporarily lifting uniform policies.</p>
<p>South Dakota installed air conditioning in some of its newer facilities, including the women’s prison and work release centers, and is <a href="https://southdakotasearchlight.com/2023/07/29/state-official-says-new-mens-prison-will-alleviate-health-risks-during-heat-events/" target="_blank">planning the development of a new men’s prison equipped with air conditioning</a>. Uniform restrictions were lifted in Florida, allowing inmates to don shorts and single-layer shirts. State authorities have also undertaken repairs on broken water fountains and provided cool water kegs as measures to alleviate the effects of heat.</p>
<p>The Montana State Prison in Deer Lodge will receive $200 million in infrastructure upgrades. The funding, approved by the state legislature, will go toward upgrading low-security housing and updating technology such as locks and video surveillance systems.</p>
<p>The prison, which was built in the 1970s, did not have air conditioning installed when it was built, according to the Montana Department of Corrections. Any necessary HVAC or air conditioning upgrades will be evaluated during the prison’s remodel of its D-Unit and low-security housing rebuild, the department said.</p>
<p>The Montana Women’s Prison, which does have air conditioning, will get $750,000 to upgrade its cooling system, Alexandria Valdez Klapmeier, the department’s public information officer, wrote in an email.</p>
<p>In Oregon, where residents grappled with a heat wave in 2021, the Oregon State Correctional Institution, a medium-security prison in Salem, sold inmates $18 cooling towels. The towels were purchased by the prison for $9.35 each, a nearly 100% markup. A spokesperson for the Oregon Department of Corrections told the <a href="https://www.wweek.com/news/courts/2021/07/14/an-oregon-prison-sold-inmates-18-towels-to-stay-cool-after-record-temperatures/" target="_blank">Willamette</a><a href="https://www.wweek.com/news/courts/2021/07/14/an-oregon-prison-sold-inmates-18-towels-to-stay-cool-after-record-temperatures/" target="_blank"> Week</a>, a local weekly newspaper, that proceeds would go toward new sports equipment for the facility’s inmates.</p>
<p>In Washington, there are five HVAC system upgrade projects that received legislative funding for the Monroe Correctional Complex, the Washington Corrections Center for Women, the Washington State Penitentiary and the Progress House Work Release.</p>
<p>“Recent excessive heat events have been unusual; the good news is that staff and incarcerated individuals, overwhelmingly keep a positive outlook, and recognize the efforts that staff and incarcerated make to mitigate the effects of the heat,” Tobby Hatley, Washington State Department of Corrections’ media relations manager, wrote in an email. “Our facilities are prepared if another heat wave should occur.”</p>

(Scott P. Yates for the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed two long-standing legal challenges against the Mountain Valley Pipeline Friday, citing its lack of authority to hear the cases following the passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act earlier this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dismissals mean the project, which was </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/07/27/u-s-supreme-court-lifts-stays-on-mountain-valley-pipeline/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">temporarily halted by the latest legal challenges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, can continue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Here, Congress has removed our jurisdiction to hear the merits of the present petitions,” the three-judge panel wrote in its </span><a href="https://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinions/231384.P.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dismissal order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Therefore, the motions to dismiss must be granted.”</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;U.S. Supreme Court lifts stays on Mountain Valley Pipeline&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/07/27/u-s-supreme-court-lifts-stays-on-mountain-valley-pipeline/embed/#?secret=lvDAOWMZQ0#?secret=umiHI38jDg" data-secret="umiHI38jDg" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mountain Valley Pipeline, a 303-mile project intended to deliver natural gas from the Utica and Marcellus shale fields into Southwest Virginia, has been mired for years in legal challenges over the harms environmental groups say it poses to wildlife and water quality. As a result of those arguments, the 4th Circuit repeatedly overturned federal permits granted to the project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This June, however, Congress passed the Fiscal Responsibility Act with a provision granting all necessary approvals for completion of the project and stripping jurisdiction from the 4th Circuit. The law also transferred jurisdiction over any challenges to the constitutionality of the provision, known as Section 324, to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, the judges agreed Section 324 had stripped their jurisdiction over two pipeline cases the court had been hearing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is well settled that Congress has the power to ratify agency action,” wrote Judge James Wynn. Furthermore, he wrote, because the Fiscal Responsibility Act transferred constitutional challenges to the D.C. Circuit, the 4th Circuit no longer has authority to hear them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With Section 324, Congress removed our jurisdiction in a way that mandates dismissal of the underlying petitions, which challenge agency actions that grant necessary approvals for the completion of the Mountain Valley Pipeline,” Wynn said. “Indeed, ‘no court’ has jurisdiction to review these approvals … including the D.C. Circuit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In separate concurring opinions, Judges Roger L. Gregory and Stephanie D. Thacker issued pointed warnings about the potential impacts of Section 324 on the principle of separation of powers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There can be no mistake, however, that Section 324 is a blueprint for the construction of a natural gas pipeline by legislative fiat,” Gregory wrote. “If that provision is likewise constitutionally sanctioned, then Congress will have found the way to adjudicate by legislating for particular cases and for particular litigants, no different than the governmental excesses our Framers sought to avoid.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Can Congress, with particular pending litigation in mind, strip a particular court of jurisdiction to hear a certain type of cases when it disagrees politically with the view of the law that court has taken in the past?” Thacker similarly asked. “As it stands, we have no clear guidance from the Supreme Court on where the line between legislative and judicial power lies, especially when Congress acts for the purpose of influencing pending litigation or even going so far as to pick a winner in that pending litigation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mountain Valley Pipeline spokeswoman Natalie Cox said the company agreed with the court’s conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Congress and President Biden declared the timely completion of construction and operation of the Mountain Valley Pipeline as being in the national interest,” Cox said. “Mountain Valley is committed to finalizing work on this critical energy infrastructure project by the end of 2023 in compliance with all approved federal and state authorizations so it can enter service and help satisfy public demand for cleaner, affordable and reliable domestic energy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, environmental groups expressed dissatisfaction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jamie Williams, president of The Wilderness Society, said the group was “deeply saddened and concerned that Mountain Valley has been granted the ability to sidestep critical conservation protections and silence the voices of community members in harm’s way.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spencer Gall, an attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center, said he believes Congress violated the Constitution by guaranteeing a winner in pending court cases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Fourth Circuit did not bless this gambit today and simply held that the D.C. Circuit and the Supreme Court must be the ones to confront the constitutionality,” Gall said in a statement. “We are evaluating potential next steps.&#8221;</span></p>

Lee Monument in Richmond, Va., June 2, 2020. Parker Michels-Boyce for the Virginia Mercury</p><p>Faced with growing calls for the public release of police disciplinary records, lawmakers in almost every state have grappled with how to balance revealing law enforcement misdeeds and protecting officers’ privacy and safety.</p>
<p>Fueled by public outrage over the 2020 murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer and other high-profile incidents of police violence, state policymakers have offered a variety of police oversight and transparency bills.</p>
<p>Between May 2020 and April 2023, lawmakers in nearly every state and the District of Columbia introduced almost 500 bills addressing police investigations and discipline, including providing access to disciplinary records, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Sixty-five of the bills have been enacted.</p>
<p>Delaware in June became the most recent to pass transparency legislation, expected to be signed into law this month. California, Colorado, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland and New York also are among the states that have opened police disciplinary records to the public in recent years.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="pf0QrkNyuU"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2020/07/27/in-virginia-records-detailing-police-misconduct-and-use-of-force-are-effectively-secret/">In Virginia, records detailing police misconduct and use of force are effectively secret</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;In Virginia, records detailing police misconduct and use of force are effectively secret&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2020/07/27/in-virginia-records-detailing-police-misconduct-and-use-of-force-are-effectively-secret/embed/#?secret=YGPQCJhcmu#?secret=pf0QrkNyuU" data-secret="pf0QrkNyuU" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>But police records in most states remain largely confidential or have some release restrictions. And even in states with open records laws, advocates seeking records have faced barriers, leading to lawsuits.</p>
<p>Advocates for transparency argue that the release of disciplinary records empowers residents, journalists and civil rights activists to identify patterns of misconduct and hold officers accountable.</p>
<p>“Police misconduct records should be available to the public in most situations, if not all situations, because these are folks who have a lot of power and authority,” said Lauren Bonds, executive director of the National Police Accountability Project, which advocates for more transparency. “They have the power to lawfully take a person’s life. The stakes are just so high when there’s a police officer who’s got a lengthy record of misconduct.”</p>
<p>But some police unions and law enforcement organizations have raised concerns about officer safety and privacy, with names and other identifying information made public. They emphasize that the focus should be on serious misconduct rather than minor infractions like being tardy, worry about false accusations and want officers to have due process.</p>
<p>“What’s included should be substantiated. It should be included only after the officer was provided due process, and it should be significant misconduct,” said Bill Johnson, the executive director of the National Association of Police Organizations, in an interview with Stateline. He said that includes an officer having the opportunity to respond to allegations and having a “neutral fact finder” investigate.</p>
<p>“If it’s going to be something that’s useful, where you are safeguarding the public against persons who should not be in law enforcement, you have to be careful about, ‘What are we really talking about here? What gets included and how do we know that we can rely on this?’”</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Ongoing debate</h4>

	</h4>
<p>Even states that have recently enacted laws face ongoing debate.</p>
<p>In Maryland, where records have been available through public records requests since October 2021, public interest groups and news organizations have filed lawsuits citing exorbitant fees, missed deadlines and outright denials of records requests by law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>And in New Jersey, <a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2023/06/21/court-ruling-in-police-disciplinary-records-battle-a-blow-for-transparency-critics-warn/" target="_blank">the state Supreme Court issued a ruling</a> in June that requires individuals who sue for public records to pay the entire cost of their own attorneys, regardless of the case’s outcome. Public interest and transparency advocates fear the decision will create additional hurdles for people seeking access to police records, including disciplinary reports and dashboard camera videos.</p>
<p>Delaware is the latest state to pass legislation that will require substantiated reports of misconduct, such as use of force that results in serious physical injury and sexual assault or harassment, to be reported to the state’s Criminal Justice Council and posted publicly on the council’s website. Democratic Gov. John Carney is expected to sign the <a href="https://legis.delaware.gov/BillDetail/140511" target="_blank">legislation</a> into law on Aug. 7, according to state Rep. Melissa Minor-Brown, a Democrat who sponsored the bill.</p>
<p>“After we witnessed the situation that happened with George Floyd and we saw the public outcry, we knew that something had to be done,” Minor-Brown said in an interview with Stateline. “We owe it to the community. I owe it to my son, to my daughter, to my husband, to my colleagues, to those who do not have a seat at the table, to those whose voices aren’t heard, to those who have experienced injustice.”</p>
<p>It took lawmakers about three years to push through the legislation. While transparency advocates supported previous versions of the bill, they opposed the current version, arguing that it falls short of achieving full transparency and external oversight. The ACLU of Delaware noted, for example, that police departments will decide whether to investigate complaints and that only specific categories of misconduct are covered.</p>
<p>“It does not necessarily meet the standards that we think is enough to increase trust between communities and the police,” said Javonne Rich, the group’s policy and advocacy director, in an interview with Stateline. “All the information that will be made public will be what the police department wants to be made public.”</p>
<p>But Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings, a Democrat, endorsed the new bill, as did representatives from several police agencies. During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in June, a witness read a supportive statement from Jamie Leonard, who leads the Delaware Fraternal Order of Police union, <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/delaware-transaprency-police-misconduct-records-reform-officer-bill-of-rights/amp/" target="_blank">WHYY reported</a>.</p>
<p>“We wanted to lift the veil of secrecy that so many believe surrounds our profession,’’ Leonard’s statement said, according to WHYY, the Philadelphia public radio station. “We want to provide access to information that includes names on cases where we believe our officers fell short of the standard expected by our agencies, by other officers, and by our community.”</p>
<p>Minor-Brown, the Delaware state representative, said that although the bill may not entirely meet advocates’ expectations, it represents a “huge step in the right direction.”</p>
<p>“I hear what the advocates are saying and there’s definitely going to be some space for tweaking,” Minor-Brown said. “We could have not moved forward based off of some of the advocates feeling like it wasn’t enough, and then we could have gotten nowhere. I was not willing to not move anywhere because we weren’t at 100%.”</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">California concerns</h4>

	</h4>
<p>In 2018, California made records on officer use-of-force incidents, sexual assault cases and acts of dishonesty available through public records requests. Another law enacted in 2021 established a decertification process for law enforcement officers involved in serious misconduct.</p>
<p>But this year, <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=7923.601&amp;lawCode=GOV" target="_blank">a provision</a> enacted in the state’s budget shifts back to local police departments the responsibility of releasing their records, instead of having the state’s Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training do so.</p>
<p>The measure, backed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom as a cost-saving measure in the face of a large budget deficit, drew strong criticism from criminal justice and press freedom groups, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/newsom-police-misconduct-public-records-budget-4da9b6e89716ddc92d3ac69e6e2a8079" target="_blank">The Associated Press reported</a>.</p>
<p>The state commission backed the bill. The measure “continues to ensure public access to police misconduct records in a way that improves efficiencies, reduces duplicative efforts, and saves substantial taxpayer money,” wrote Meagan Poulos, the commission’s legislative liaison and public information officer, in an emailed statement.</p>
<p>But transparency advocates argue that the public should have a central clearinghouse for the records and that some local police departments may resist releasing such information.</p>
<p>“There has been significant resistance to disclosure. Others have been more proactive,” said David Loy, the legal director of the First Amendment Coalition, a nonpartisan group that aims to protect free speech rights, in an interview with Stateline. “It impacts the entire community. … Information is power, and without transparency, there’s no accountability at any level.”</p>
<p>Some police unions and law enforcement organizations have raised concerns about officer safety and privacy in California and nationwide. They fear that releasing unrestricted personnel records, which may include names and other identifying information, could expose individual officers to undue scrutiny and even endanger their safety and professional reputation.</p>
<p>“We understand that’s not the intent of why these things are getting released, but it is an unintended consequence of releasing names. … They could be doxxed, they could be harassed, there could be protests in front of their house. And because of the nature of the work we do, it’s very concerning,” said Lolita Harper, the executive director of the Sheriff’s Employees’ Benefit Association and a former detective for the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department, in an interview with Stateline.</p>
<p>Many law enforcement groups recognize the importance of accountability and transparency in fostering community trust and say that making disciplinary records accessible plays a significant role in achieving that goal.</p>
<p>“The utmost thing is to have that trust with the public, so with the specifics that at least the California legislation requires … we can understand that compromise with where the legislation was coming from and if that helps the public to have more trust than we understand it,” Harper said.</p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit over the contentious firing of former Nottoway County Registrar Angela Stewart and another election official who worked with her, ruling that city and county electoral boards function more as state bodies rather than local ones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stewart, who had served as Nottoway’s registrar for 28 years before being removed from her position in the fall of 2021, argued the move by the Nottoway Electoral Board violated her constitutional rights by being based on false allegations of malfeasance. She also claimed the board didn’t give her an adequate chance to defend her actions in office to try to keep her job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/08/17/special-prosecutor-trying-to-sort-out-elections-drama-in-nottoway-county/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nottoway case</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is largely a local dispute, the court ruling is an indicator that federal courts may not be a strong option for other ousted registrars looking to file legal challenges against the boards that oversee them. Those three-member boards are supposed to be nonpartisan, but decisions to fire registrars are often hotly disputed and frequently involve allegations of political motives. A similar federal lawsuit was filed last month by a </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/ousted-lynchburg-registrar-files-lawsuit-against-2-electoral-board-members/article_5146a328-1781-11ee-955a-cbd9cc89d6d8.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently dismissed registrar in Lynchburg</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a ruling issued last week, Richmond-based U.S. District Court Judge Henry Hudson dismissed the case on jurisdictional grounds, pointing to 11th Amendment immunity restricting the ability of private individuals to sue states in federal courts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Here, it is clear that local electoral boards are more like an arm of the state than they are like municipalities,” Hudson wrote in the July 28 opinion. “Local electoral boards derive all their power and responsibilities from Virginia statutory law. They are subject to the State Board’s supervision and authority, which includes the power to initiate removal proceedings against local electoral board members. Electoral board members are appointed by state circuit court judges. The party affiliation of board members depends upon the party affiliation of the governor, not the party in power locally.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though electoral board members are initially paid with local funds, Hudson noted, their compensation is set by the state and “reimbursed annually from the state treasury.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hudson dismissed all the claims Stewart brought under federal law on the basis of the immunity provision and said he had no jurisdiction over the remaining claims under state law, leaving nothing left to argue in the case. He reached the same conclusion in an accompanying case brought by Sharon Caldwell, a former assistant registrar and officer of election in Nottoway who was removed around the same time as Stewart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among several other complaints, Stewart alleged she was unfairly retaliated against after publicly telling electoral board members “that they did not understand their roles and were not carrying out their duties,” according to court records.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorneys representing the various Nottoway officials Stewart had sued denied her claims and argued the board had clear legal authority to remove her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Notably, the Code of Virginia provides members of the local electoral board with broad discretion to remove a general registrar from office for failing to discharge his or her duties according to law,” the legal team for the defendants wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lawyer for Stewart and Caldwell said the two former election officials plan to keep pursuing their case through the state courts. The two have been “silent” for almost two years, said attorney Melvin Williams, “because it is their goal to seek redress through the courts, and not in the media.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These matters are far from concluded, and both ladies look forward to the truth coming out in the proper venue, i.e., a courtroom,” Williams said in an emailed statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Williams called Stewart and Caldwell “good and valuable servants of Nottoway County and its citizenry” and noted that Stewart was partially cleared by the conclusion of a Virginia State Police investigation into the Nottoway election feud that resulted in “no finding of criminal culpability” on Stewart’s part.</span></p>

Police currently provide the vast majority of transports to psychiatric hospitals across Virginia. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Court of Appeals overruled a man’s misdemeanor conviction for fleeing from police after ruling the Lynchburg police officer who attempted to make the arrest didn’t get close enough to the suspect to have a realistic chance of grabbing him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://www.vacourts.gov/opinions/opncavwp/1218223.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an opinion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> revealing what the court described as a legal quirk unique to Virginia, the court found that an officer telling someone to stop from 20 yards away doesn’t satisfy a rule requiring officers to have the “immediate physical ability to place the person under arrest.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The opinion applies mainly to foot chases, not a separate eluding law that criminalizes fleeing police in a motor vehicle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ruling arose from a 2022 case in which Lynchburg police officer M.D. Iazzi attempted to arrest Jessi Ryan Hackett during a snowstorm. After arriving at a home in uniform to try to make the arrest, Iazzi found Hackett standing outside. When Hackett spotted the officer, court records say, he “took off running” into the woods. The officer then told Hackett to stop and said he was under arrest, to which Hackett, still running, replied: “I didn’t do anything wrong.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same officer found Hackett nearby about an hour later and, from about 50 yards away, again told him to stop. Hackett ran off a second time but was later arrested and charged with fleeing from law enforcement. He was subsequently convicted of the charge and sentenced to 90 days behind bars, with 60 days suspended.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the opinion overruling the conviction, Judge Stuart A. Raphael wrote that a distance of 20 yards was simply too great to meet the criteria for fleeing the General Assembly specified when writing the law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There was too much time and space separating them to conclude that Iazzi had the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">immediate </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">physical ability to arrest Hackett,” Raphael wrote. “Put another way, Hackett was not within Iazzi’s ‘immediate span of control’ when he fled.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The appellate court noted that the immediate proximity rule appeared to originate from the General Assembly’s attempts to broaden earlier versions of the law to allow authorities to charge someone with the offense of fleeing law enforcement even if they weren’t physically in the “custody” of police.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court’s opinion noted that many other states don’t criminalize fleeing from an impending arrest and those that do “typically focus on the defendant’s act of fleeing.” Virginia, the court said, “appears to be the only state in the country” that requires close physical proximity to an officer as an element of the crime.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Under the Fourth Amendment, probable cause of contraband is the standard to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">obtain </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">a warrant, not the standard to search a person without one,” wrote Judge Lisa M. Lorish in </span><a href="https://www.vacourts.gov/opinions/opncavwp/0744224.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an opinion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> issued Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, she continued, “The number of exceptions to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement make this an exceedingly difficult analysis, and we sympathize with the trial judge here.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The July 5 ruling reverses a Culpeper County Circuit Court decision that the drugs found in the search could be included in the trial of Renee Parady, one of three people stopped by Culpeper Sheriff’s Deputy Dustin Tharp in the early hours of Jan. 28, 2021. Parady had asked the court to block the use of the drugs as evidence on the grounds that they had been obtained through an unconstitutional warrantless search.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parady ultimately pleaded guilty to felony possession of a controlled substance but reserved the right to appeal the court’s denial of her request to suppress the drugs as evidence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia argued in support of including the drugs as evidence, saying Tharp had probable cause to believe Parady was concealing narcotics, the search was done as part of an arrest and the search was justified by “exigent circumstances” — in this case, the fear that Parady would destroy the drugs if Tharp had to wait to get the warrant. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Culpeper Circuit Court previously rejected the third argument, finding that because Parady was placed in the back of a police vehicle and three officers were at the scene, Tharp could have gotten a search warrant without risking the destruction of the drugs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Court of Appeals on Wednesday rejected the other two arguments. Tharp had not actually arrested Parady the night of the search, the judges noted, and she would not be arrested until nearly two months later. The court concluded her search could not be justified on that basis, quoting the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in United States v. Robinson that “it is the fact of the lawful arrest which establishes the authority to search.” (While Virginia argued the officer had not arrested Parady at the scene because she said she had tested positive for COVID-19, the court of appeals pointed out Tharp arrested the driver on a separate charge, even though he said he had been quarantining in a house of sick people, including Parady.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, the court ruled that the officer having probable cause to arrest Parady was not sufficient grounds to search her without a warrant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Commonwealth bears the burden of proving that a warrantless search fits under an exception to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment,” the court wrote. “While the exceptions are many, mere probable cause is not one of them.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The case will now return to Culpeper Circuit Court.</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce for the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin Thursday praised the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark decision striking down affirmative action at higher education institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Today, after the Supreme Court’s ruling, we are closer than ever before to ensuring that an individual’s future opportunities are unlocked based on the trajectory of their potential, their aspirations and the quality of their capabilities as opposed to simply on their race,” Youngkin said on Twitter shortly after the country’s highest court struck down race-conscious admissions in a case involving Harvard University and the University of North Carolina.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, who in 2021 became the first Black woman to hold statewide office in Virginia, also applauded the outcome, saying it will “ensure college admissions are based on a student&#8217;s merits, not the color of their skin.” Earle-Sears noted she had joined a legal brief supporting the plaintiffs who challenged affirmative action policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorney General Jason Miyares, who did not comment on the ruling, also signed onto </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20-1199/222849/20220509155246082_OkSFA%20Merits%20Amicus%20MAIN%20May%209%202022%20E%20File.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a brief supporting the plaintiffs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Democrats had sharply different reactions to the </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/20-1199_hgdj.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">6-3 decision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ruling that consideration of race violates the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, said the decision “undermines an important effort to address racial inequality caused by our nation’s history with racism,” adding, “The impact of 246 years of slavery and 100 years of Jim Crow on our communities and institutions did not go away with a magic wand.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., who began his career as a lawyer fighting housing discrimination in Richmond, said the “strength of Virginia’s—and America’s—higher education system lies in its diversity.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Today’s sad ruling means we have even more work to do to address our nation’s ugly history of racism and root out the system inequities that unfairly burden diverse communities, like Black and Latino Americans,” Kaine said. “Not only are those system inequities plain wrong; they hurt all of us and hold our economy back.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What the court ruled</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The majority opinion penned by Chief Justice John Roberts found Harvard and UNC “fail to operate their race-based admissions programs in a manner that is ‘sufficiently measurable to permit judicial [review],’” haven’t sufficiently proved a connection between those programs and goals like increasing diversity and training future leaders and haven’t identified an endpoint by which the programs would no longer be considered necessary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, the court ruled that the universities’ programs “fail to comply with Equal Protection Clause’s twin commands that race may never be used as a ‘negative’ and that it may not operate as a stereotype,” pointing to a lower court finding that Harvard’s process resulted in fewer admissions of Asian American students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “assertion that race is never a negative factor in their admissions programs cannot withstand scrutiny,” the majority wrote. “College admissions are zero-sum, and a benefit provided to some applicants but not to others necessarily advantages the former at the expense of the latter.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor argued that the ruling will result in “further entrenching racial inequality in education” and will end progress toward more inclusive schools begun in Brown v. Board of Education. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For 45 years, the Court extended Brown’s transformative legacy to the context of higher education, allowing colleges and universities to consider race in a limited way and for the limited purpose of promoting the important benefits of racial diversity,” she wrote. “This limited use of race has helped equalize educational opportunities for all students of every race and background and has improved racial diversity on college campuses.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thursday’s ruling, she concluded, “cements a superficial rule of colorblindness as a constitutional principle in an endemically segregated society where race has always mattered and continues to matter.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia universities reacted cautiously Thursday to the ruling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Erin Jay, a spokesperson for William &amp; Mary, said “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the university will take time thoughtfully to review (the ruling) and understand if there are implications to William &amp; Mary’s comprehensive review process for admissions.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The university reported that 32% of its students “identify as people of color” and </span><a href="https://www.wm.edu/offices/compliance/discrimination_overview/affirmative_action/index.php" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on its website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has said it is “committed to affirmative action, equal opportunity/equity, and diversity.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, Virginia Commonwealth University President Michael Rao said the school “has been preparing for some time by evaluating admissions procedures and considering the impact of this ruling.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While he acknowledged that “we won’t know all of those answers right away,” he said that “many of VCU’s admissions procedures are unlikely to be affected.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rao noted that a third of VCU’s incoming freshman class are first-generation students, while a third of undergraduate students are eligible for Pell grants.</span></p>
<p>George Mason University said flatly the decision will have no impact on the school, because it doesn&#8217;t consider race in its admissions process and admits more than 90% of undergraduate applicants. In August, GMU said, the school will &#8220;once again welcome the largest and most diverse student body in the history of the Commonwealth of Virginia.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This diversity of origin, identity, circumstance, and thought is what drives our quality and defines our character,&#8221; <a href="https://www.gmu.edu/news/2023-06/george-mason-university-statement-supreme-court-rulings-regarding-college-admissions" target="_blank">GMU said</a>. &#8220;When walking across one of our campuses, the rich diversity everyone sees is not artificially curated by an admissions process primarily defined by keeping students out.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Tech said its administration is reviewing the ruling but will continue to live up to its motto “Ut Prosim (That I May Serve)” and its goal of providing a “practical education to all members of the commonwealth, nation, and beyond.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To accomplish this mission, we will continue to work hard to expand access to underserved and underrepresented populations,” Virginia Tech said in a statement from its communications office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Eric Claville, a political and legal analyst and professor of politics and law at Norfolk State University, characterized the Supreme Court&#8217;s Thursday ruling as both expected and regressive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Higher education leaders have known for a long time that this challenge [to affirmative action] would come,” he said. “We need these policies to advance diversity and equity on campuses, and the law is the incentive to make and enforce those changes. Without that, we will not have the same protections for promoting diverse, inclusive, equitable student bodies in Virginia and elsewhere.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claville said the high court&#8217;s decision “will have far-reaching implications beyond limiting race-based admissions in colleges.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe that here in Virginia, we will see ripple effects – perhaps in the way we hire for jobs, in the ways we support our communities, in the work across many sectors – that could basically roll back advancement opportunities for non-white people,&#8221; he said.</span></p>

(Wyatt Gordon/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the four and a half years that Shiri Yadlin worked as a housing coordinator for a D.C.-based church, she heard from her formerly incarcerated clients again and again about an abundance of barriers to securing permanent housing. After she began her current job as a senior program manager for the </span><a href="https://www.csh.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corporation for Supportive Housing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, she decided to conduct a landscape assessment of the issue that resulted in some shocking findings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Someone who has been incarcerated is ten times more likely to be homeless, and if you’ve been incarcerated more than once your chances double to be homeless,” she said. “It’s harder and harder to get out of homelessness, the more experience you have with incarceration.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Susceptible to insecurity</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, where the incarceration rate exceeds the national average (which is already </span><a href="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/profiles/US.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the highest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the world), </span><a href="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/profiles/VA.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">749 out of every 100,000 people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are currently locked up in a jail, prison, immigrant detention or juvenile justice center. That translates to over 64,000 Virginians who will be susceptible to housing insecurity when they are released, not to mention the tens of thousands of others who have already served their time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a lot of people we are talking about here,” Yadlin added. “It’s not just a small subset of our population.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the ideological cradle of </span><a href="https://virginiahistory.org/learn/civil-rights-movement-virginia/massive-resistance#:~:text=Senator%20Byrd%20promoted%20the%20%22Southern,prevent%20integration%20of%20the%20schools." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Massive Resistance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there is an unsurprising racial dynamic at play as well. Black Virginians are </span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/virginia-news/who-is-incarcerated-in-virginias-prisons/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over four times more likely</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be incarcerated than whites.  For juveniles, that figure is even higher, according to Yadlin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The system that has the most disparity is </span><a href="https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/CalAIM/Justice-Involved-Initiative/Pages/home.aspx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">justice-involved</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> youths,” said Yadlin. “Black children in the commonwealth are eight times more likely to have justice involvement than anyone else.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Barrier barometer</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Yadlin had heard that background checks can present a huge barrier to housing for formerly incarcerated individuals, she wanted to understand exactly how that process alienates and excludes people. To do that, she and her team </span><a href="https://www.csh.org/supportive-housing-101/data/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">analyzed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the tenant selection plans for 123 properties across the commonwealth built using </span><a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-low-income-housing-tax-credit-and-how-does-it-work" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low-Income Housing Tax Credits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as such buildings have a higher likelihood of serving her target population.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After examining which convictions management companies screened for, how far they look back into individuals’ records for transgressions and the processes they use to select or deny potential tenants, Yadlin’s team found a plethora of problems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While nearly every property screened potential tenants for violent offenses, a third of them also disqualified applicants for petty offenses such as loitering or trespassing that are </span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/cities-try-to-arrest-their-way-out-of-homeless-problems" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">often associated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with periods of homelessness. All properties denied potential tenants for drug distribution, but half of them also dismissed applicants for simple possession.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Background check companies are supposed to calculate the lookback period on any felony or misdemeanor from the date which the crime was committed. However, all too frequently such firms count from the date a person was released from serving their sentence, making a long lookback period more punitive. 15 tenant selection plans had no lookback period for offenses but eight of them featured incredibly long lookback periods for both felonies and misdemeanors. Even more concerning: nine percent of all properties screened for arrests which imply no guilt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to the application process, two of the biggest barriers result from properties not disclosing why a potential tenant was turned away and not offering an appeals process. A third of the sites Yadlin surveyed engaged in both practices. Increasing transparency in the application process could be an easy fix, if property owners and managers prove willing to implement it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the problem is complex, the list of solutions proposed by the Corporation for Supportive Housing is straightforward: remove public nuisance and non-violent offenses from the screening process; offer notices of denial and an appeals process; and undertake a nuanced individual assessment, rather than throwing applicants out at the first red flag.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just over half of the properties surveyed bothered to consider the circumstances around specific applicants’ cases. Without individual assessments, a teenager who had the cops called on them while experiencing a mental health crisis decades ago can appear just as suspect as an adult who committed robbery last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/pdredge/pdr-edge-frm-asst-sec-051722.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">science</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also bears out the wisdom behind not punishing people for offenses long past, according to Yadlin. “Any impact of a criminal record on your performance as a tenant disappears after five years for a felony and after two years for a misdemeanor,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such findings are in alignment with </span><a href="https://www.dpor.virginia.gov/Suggestions" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">guidance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for landlords issued by Virginia Housing last year, which was designed to encourage more access for formerly incarcerated folks. Where the commonwealth has issued non-binding guidance, other jurisdictions have legislated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both New Jersey and Montgomery County, Maryland have </span><a href="https://www.njoag.gov/about/divisions-and-offices/division-on-civil-rights-home/fcha/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">passed</span></a> <a href="https://www.npr.org/local/305/2021/04/21/989466043/law-bans-montgomery-county-landlords-from-rejecting-people-convicted-of-minor-crimes" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">laws</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to prevent landlords from denying people housing for petty offenses. Since both bills are relatively recent, advocates like Yadlin don’t yet have enough data to determine their efficacy, but they are hopeful.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Let the funding flow</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the founder and director of </span><a href="https://www.where-we-help.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where We Help</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Richmond-based supportive housing organization, Aisha Bullard has witnessed the struggles of individuals leaving incarceration from all sides. With just 70 short-term transitional housing beds and 32 long-term units that they lease out, Bullard and her team have helped over 3,100 people in D.C. and the commonwealth since she began her business in 2005.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where more corporate landlords can be unforgiving, she has seen many mom and pop property owners offer folks second chances. Our housing system has a history of treating formerly incarcerated folks harshly, but marginalized people and good samaritans have forged their own networks that can be hard to capture in a survey, according to Bullard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People who have been justice-involved or who have had mental health issues, they have networks they are navigating that are more informal,” she said. “There are committed people trying to help this subset of the population by any means necessary, but I just don’t think enough of the money is headed to them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many affordable housing providers in the nation do not rent units to people with any kind of criminal background, no matter their stated missions of “housing for all.” Even public housing — designed to serve as the shelter of last resort in the United States — will </span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2004/11/18/no-second-chance/people-criminal-records-denied-access-public-housing" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">often turn away</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> potential tenants with convictions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To this day, the Department of Housing and Urban Development </span><a href="https://nextcity.org/urbanist-news/hud-new-orleans-public-housing-convictions-prison-discrimination#:~:text=HUD%20Excludes%20People%20With%20Convictions,Local%20Solutions%20Can%20Help." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">allows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> public housing authorities broad leeway to discriminate against justice-involved individuals. That doesn’t sit right with Bullard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“HUD caused problems for decades [by] saying people with convictions couldn’t live in their units,” she said. “Serious money needs to be put in place to help those populations that were disparately impacted in the past. When you’re scoring people for [Low-Income Housing Tax] credits, you need to give some extra points for helping this population. It’s the economics that need to change in order for help to flow down to this group of people, and I haven&#8217;t heard a lot of the big affordable housing providers talk about it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over her nearly 20 years in the transitional and supportive housing industry, some of Bullard’s best tenants have been those who have committed the most serious crimes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It makes sense that the person who was in prison for 25 years doesn’t want to go back and do that again,” she said. “If people do commit a new crime, it’s a crime out of poverty, for lack of opportunity. If communities were more accepting of folks who have served their time, then our recidivism rate would go down.”

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More funding for supportive housing should not only build more units in her opinion. Those individuals being freshly released also need skills training for simple everyday problems they haven’t dealt with in a long time or ever before, like when a toilet overflows or the dryer malfunctions. Despite all the barriers in their way, the majority of formerly incarcerated folks make it in the real world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you ask where justice-involved people live, some live in beautiful homes in Chesterfield with a gorgeous backyard,” said Bullard. “Plenty of justice-involved people are just model citizens buying homes and living their lives like everyone else.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Associated Press</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/voting-rights-felony-convictions-lawsuit-af720e316859e25b2e99ab8e69ee4af9" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">reported Monday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the lawsuit, brought by the ACLU of Virginia and the nonprofit voting rights group Protect Democracy, alleges that Virginia’s current restoration-of-rights regimen violates a Reconstruction-era law Congress passed setting terms for readmitting Virginia to the Union.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/an-act-to-admit-the-state-of-virginia-to-representation-in-the-congress-of-the-united-states-january-26-1870/" target="_blank">1870 Readmissions Act</a>, signed by President Ulysses Grant, bars the commonwealth from disenfranchising people other than those who were convicted of “common law” felonies during the Reconstruction period following the Civil War. Among those serious crimes were murder, arson, rape, robbery, manslaughter and larceny.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, the AP reported, Virginia expanded its list of felonies that carry automatic lifetime loss of voting rights, including drug offenses. And that is the root of so much of the current system’s inequity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This isn’t an argument against prosecuting those who traffic in drugs that are increasingly ubiquitous and dangerous, particularly fentanyl and the prescription opiates that have devastated massive swaths of Appalachia. If anything, efforts to interdict those drugs and punish those who distribute them should redouble.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, as the bromide goes, the punishment should fit the crime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An 18-year-old drug runner who was convicted as a felon faces lifetime disenfranchisement in Virginia even after he has returned to society as a productive, tax-paying citizen. That’s a punishment indistinguishable from a convicted drug cartel captain. And it comes at a dismaying, racially disparate cost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black people comprise just</span><a href="https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/interactive/racial-and-ethnic-diversity-in-the-united-states-2010-and-2020-census.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">18.3%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Virginia’s slightly more than 8.6 million residents. Yet they account for almost half of the 312,000 Virginians — the fifth-largest number of any state — who can’t vote because of a felony conviction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia, however, is not alone. According to the FBI’s most recent</span><a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/nibrs/2019/tables/pdfs/arrestees_race_by_arrest_offense_category_2019.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Uniform Crime Report in 2019</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Black people accounted for 32% of arrests for crimes against persons, including assault, homicide, kidnapping and human trafficking, 30% of property crime arrests (including 57% of robbery arrests, 41% of embezzlement arrests and 37% of stolen property arrests), and 28% of “crimes against society” including 26% of drug offense arrests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black people are imprisoned at five times the rate of whites, meaning that one out of every 81 Black adults in the United States is incarcerated, according to</span><a href="https://www.sentencingproject.org/policy-brief/shadow-report-to-the-united-nations-on-racial-disparities-in-sentencing-in-the-united-states/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a 2022 analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by The Sentencing Project, a nonprofit criminal-justice reform research and advocacy organization based in Washington, D.C., and the ACLU.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A state</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+sum+SJ272" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">constitutional amendment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would restore felons’ voting rights was enacted by a Democratic-controlled General Assembly in 2021 and signed by then-Gov. Ralph Northam, also a Democrat. But to make it to a statewide ballot for voter ratification, constitutional amendments must pass </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">twice</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a legislative election in between. Republicans won control of the House of Delegates and the governor’s office in the 2021 election, and the bill was</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+SJ1" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">left to die in a House committee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three governors of both parties — Republican Bob McDonnell and Democrats Terry McAuliffe and Northam — all significantly boosted the number of felons whose voting rights were restored. In March, Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced that he was</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/06/us/virginia-youngkin-voting-former-felons.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">ending his predecessors’ policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of automatically granting voting rights restoration for felons who’ve completed their sentences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Societal and racial dynamics notwithstanding, it’s an unfair, feudal arrangement that’s out of step with the majority of states. Virginia is</span><a href="https://test.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/felon-voting-rights" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">one of 11 states</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the most restrictive processes for restoring felons who’ve paid their due to full citizenship, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where’s the incentive to reform and rehabilitate, if the hope for regaining one’s dignity resides solely in groveling to the governor and beseeching his favor?

On Friday the court issued a landmark decision overturning the right to an abortion. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)</p><p>The U.S. Supreme Court rejected North Carolina Republican legislators’ argument that the state courts cannot review laws legislatures pass governing federal elections.</p>
<p>Republican legislators claimed the Elections Clause in the U.S. Constitution makes legislatures the sole state authorities on federal elections law,  including congressional redistricting. Critics said the high court’s endorsement of the independent state legislature theory would cause chaos with state elections, with states trying to enforce a set of rules for state elections and another set for federal elections.</p>
<p>In a 6-3 opinion, the nation’s high court rejected Republicans’ argument, known as the independent state legislature theory.</p>
<p>Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote a concurring opinion. Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch and Samuel Alito dissented. Thomas wrote that the case was moot because the North Carolina Supreme Court has already decided the question that brought Republican legislators to court in their favor.</p>
<p>“We are asked to decide whether the Elections Clause carves out an exception to this basic principle,” said the majority opinion by Chief Justice John Roberts.  “We hold that it does not. The Elections Clause does not insulate state legislatures from the ordinary exercise of state judicial review.”</p>
<p>The case drew national attention because of its potential to disrupt laws for federal elections across the country.</p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Virginia, a former state senator, said in a statement that the decision &#8220;protects the integrity of our electoral process and preserves a proper system of checks-and-balances on states&#8217; roles in regulating federal elections.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The right-wing ISL theory is a dangerous fringe perspective that would upend American elections. &#8230; Today, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of democracy and rejected this extreme constitutional perspective,&#8221; she wrote.</p>
<p>The leader of Common Cause North Carolina, which was a party in the case, said in a statement that the opinion is a victory for American democracy.</p>
<p>“Today, the U.S. Supreme Court made clear that state courts and state constitutions should serve as a critical check against abuses of power by legislators,&#8221; Bob Phillips, Common Cause North Carolina executive director, said.  “Now, we must ensure our state courts fulfill their duty to protect our freedoms against attacks by extremist politicians.”</p>
<p>The opinion affirms the February 2022 decision by the Democratic majority on the North Carolina Supreme Court that congressional districts the Republican majority created were extreme party gerrymanders that required revision.</p>
<p>Roberts wrote that courts “may not transgress the ordinary bounds of judicial review such that they arrogate to themselves the power vested in state legislatures to regulate federal elections.”</p>
<p>“We decline to address whether the North Carolina Supreme Court strayed beyond the limits derived from the Elections Clause. The legislative defendants did not meaningfully present the issue in their petition for certiorari or in their briefing, nor did they press the matter at oral argument.”</p>
<p>When pressed during December’s oral arguments whether the state’s Democratic justices has misinterpreted the state constitution, the Republicans’ lawyer “reiterated that such an argument was ‘not our position in this Court.’”</p>
<p>https://stateline.org/2022/03/18/contentious-fringe-legal-theory-could-reshape-state-election-laws/</p>
<p>Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder applauded the decision, but said in a statement that the question should not have made it to the high court in the first place. Holder is chairman of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee. Voters who challenged the congressional districts as partisan gerrymanders were supported by the National Redistricting Foundation.</p>
<p>“By rejecting the independent state legislature theory, the Supreme Court preserved the vital role state courts play in protecting free elections and fair maps for the American people,” Holder said in a statement. “This is a victory for our system of checks and balances, the cornerstone of American democracy.</p>
<p>“Make no mistake, this appeal and the truly fringe, truly ideological theory it espouses should never have been brought before our nation’s highest tribunal in the first place, and it demonstrates the lengths to which too many in the Republican Party are willing to go in order to bend — even break — our democracy in order to hold onto illegitimate power.”</p>
<p>Democrats from U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to Democratic leaders in the North Carolina legislature weighed in with statements supporting the decision.</p>
<p>Lawyers on both sides of the case tried to use the historical record dating back to the founding of the country to bolster their arguments.</p>
<p>Roberts’ opinion said that history supports judicial review.</p>
<p>“State cases, debates at the Convention, and writings defending the Constitution all advanced the concept of judicial review. And in the years immediately following ratification, courts grew assured of their power to void laws incompatible with constitutional provisions,” he wrote.</p>
<p>During oral arguments last year,  Thomas, Alito and Gorsuch indicated they supported the Republican legislators’ argument, while Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan challenged their logic and interpretation of history.</p>
<p>The state Supreme Court’s new Republican majority is unlikely to intervene in congressional redistricting this year.</p>
<p>Before the U.S. Supreme Court could rule, Republican legislators petitioned for and received a chance to reargue a redistricting decision the state Supreme Court issued in December that said the Senate districts used for the 2022 elections were unconstitutional.</p>
<p>The court majority in April overturned partisan gerrymandering opinions handed down last year by a Democratic court majority. The Republican-majority opinion said redistricting is the legislature’s job and the courts cannot not judge partisanship.</p>
<p>The NC League 0f Conservation Voters, one of the parties fighting partisan redistricting, said the U.S. Supreme Court did the right thing, but the state Supreme Court didn’t when the majority overturned last year’s decision on partisan gerrymandering.</p>
<p>“Today, in a case that NCLCV has been fighting since 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the independent state legislature theory and affirmed that, in a constitutional democracy, the courts do have a role in redistricting and protecting free and fair elections,” Dan Crawford, the organization’s lobbyist, said in a statement.</p>
<p>“This draws into sharp contrast the blatantly partisan decision by the North Carolina Supreme Court to concede total power to the legislature to select their own voters. Without the ability for every voter to choose their representatives, our environment and all North Carolinians will be at risk to deep-pocketed polluters and power-hungry politicians,” the statement said.</p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court twice asked case participants this year if the state Supreme Court rehearing the gerrymandering case and later, siding with Republican legislators made the federal case moot.</p>
<p>The lawyer representing Republican legislators said the Supreme Court should decide the federal case even though North Carolina’s highest court had given them a victory.</p>
<p>Republicans found agreement from Common Cause, which sued over the redistricting plans and opposed Republicans’ position on the independent state legislature theory. Common Cause wants the U.S. Supreme Court to decide the question because it will keep coming up, its May letter said.</p>
<p>Most of the parties who opposed state Republicans’ position, including the U.S. solicitor general, told the court the case was moot.</p>
<p>Attorneys for a group of voters who sued over the Republican redistricting plans said in a recent letter to the Court that since the state Supreme Court had ruled in Republicans’ favor, Republicans no longer had standing and there is nothing more that they could win. Likewise, a lawyer for the NC League of Conservation Voters wrote the case is moot.</p>

</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something bizarre must happen to some folks when they get behind the wheel, cruise onto the interstate and encounter other motorists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least that’s how one man, arrested after a shooting in March on Interstate 64, explained it to the Virginia State Police. It’s the first time the suspect has faced violent criminal charges, according to his comments and an online search of court records.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So much gunfire in Hampton Roads has occurred recently that Capt. Timothy Reibel, a division commander in the state police’s Chesapeake field office, felt compelled to publicize the 18 freeway shootings that happened between Jan. 1 and June 7 in his area. The attacks injured six people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The uptick in shootings is an indicator of the mayhem that too often accompanies motorists on highways in Virginia. It was understandable – if regrettable – during the pandemic, when nerves, fear and frustration were at a breaking point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact many shootings still take place, as we strive for a return to normalcy, shows the disturbing trend hasn’t fully abated. That threat frightens motorists and challenges state troopers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of incidents in Hampton Roads is on pace to exceed the 35 reported freeway shootings in 2022 in the sprawling division. Seven shootings have occurred this year in Hampton alone, the city with the most.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reibel – who is part of a state police division that covers a huge territory including New Kent County to the north, Brunswick County to the west and the Eastern Shore – said there’s no indication that most interstate shootings have been random. Several cases involved suspects and victims who knew each other. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/07/14/road-rage-and-highway-shootings-are-on-the-rise-but-why/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a similar spate of freeway shootings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> took place last year, I wrote about the pandemic’s effect on road rage and other lawbreaking on highways in Virginia and nationwide. I mentioned then that authorities blamed road rage in the shooting death of a</span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/alleged-killers-of-6-year-old-orange-shooting-victim-in-court/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">6-year-old boy in California in 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/murder-suspect-alleged-road-rage-shooting-denied-bail/story?id=78362166" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Aiden Leos’ mom</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had raised a middle finger to a car that cut her off. Someone in the car fired, killing the boy. A man and woman have since been charged in the slaying. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roadway gun violence is truly a longstanding problem, especially in Hampton Roads. An</span><a href="https://scholar.lib.vt.edu/VA-news/VA-Pilot/issues/1994/vp940818/08180581.htm" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">August 1994 news story</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> noted 19 of 36 shootings reported so far that year on Virginia highways had happened in Hampton Roads. The region I live in has too many trigger-happy folks on the freeways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet the pandemic’s effects can’t be ignored, either. Isolation, anxiety and our short fuses have played a role in the craziness on the highways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A</span><a href="https://stateline.org/2021/07/13/cops-scramble-to-deal-with-deadly-road-rage-during-pandemic/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">stateline.org report in 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mentioned the problems around the United States after the pandemic began. Police said road-rage incidents spiked as people became more stressed and tensions flared more quickly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we emerge from the worst of COVID-19, we need to take a collective breath and resist the urge to tailgate, flip off passing motorists or take every perceived slight as an excuse to rumble at 65 mph.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fifty-one freeway shootings occurred statewide in 2020, 71 in 2021 and 55 last year, said Corinne Geller, a state police spokeswoman. Most cases remain without arrests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With every shooting, we always appeal to the public,” Reibel told me during an interview last week about the Hampton Roads cases. The recent spate made the situation more urgent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shooting I referred to in Chesapeake earlier is a case in point. No one was hurt, but it could’ve easily turned out worse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The unnamed victim, according to a criminal complaint filed in Chesapeake General District Court, told officials an SUV pulled alongside on eastbound I-64 during a road rage incident. The paperwork doesn’t specify what caused the confrontation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man in the SUV rolled down his passenger-side window and fired at least two shots, the victim said, near Exit 296A. Officials later recovered a bullet from the victim’s vehicle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A separate witness photographed the SUV and gave the images to police. Troopers linked the vehicle to Duane A. Brown, 51, of Portsmouth, who the complaint says admitted being in a confrontation but denied shooting at anyone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown told officials, though, they’d find a firearm in his vehicle. He had no prior arrests and said he had “never been handcuffed,” according to the complaint; he said that the incident was uncommon for him. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown now faces two felony counts. A preliminary exam is scheduled on July 20.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another shooting occurred in March on I-664 in Chesapeake. The criminal complaint describes a driver in a Lexus tailgating another vehicle and then racing in front of it and hitting the brakes. The victim told police as the Lexus left the interstate, two shots were fired. The victim continued driving to work, where he found bullet holes on his vehicle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State police eventually identified Eltron Mizell of Suffolk as the suspected shooter. The 24-year-old man confessed to police he was involved in a road-rage incident and shot at the other vehicle, court records show. He faces a felony charge in the shooting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reibel reiterated, perhaps to calm fears, that no single person is behind the uptick in shootings. It is a public problem that will take our collective efforts to solve. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also advised motorists on how to de-escalate incidents on the road with other cars: Back off. Get in another lane. “Don’t do anything to further incite an individual,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In these freeway shootings, rarely are there fixed locations, Reibel said.Witnesses are hard to find and the duration of the incidents is quick. In some cases, victims won’t cooperate – suggesting they want to settle the score themselves. All of this makes it hard to arrest suspects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We need people to come forward,” the captain told me. “We need people to talk.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s true whenever crime occurs and doubly so in freeway shootings. Killings rarely happen, but injuries often do. They’re all preventable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t engage. Keep calm. Drive away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stay alive.</span></p>

(RISE for Youth)</p><p><strong><em>By</em> <i>Briana Jones and Monica Hutchinson</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, the conversation surrounding the acknowledgment and celebration of <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/juneteenth" target="_blank">Juneteenth</a> has gained traction across the nation. But while we are honoring the end of chattel slavery in America, another conversation has been simultaneously picking up steam in the background: burdensome fines and fees facing young people in the juvenile and criminal justice systems. The Commonwealth Institute and RISE for Youth are working with our partners on uplifting this conversation and raising awareness around the impact fines and fees have on our youth and families, especially on Black and Latino youth. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://debtorsprison.jlc.org/documents/JLC-Debtors-Prison.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the youth faced with these costs come from low-income families</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and with </span><a href="https://thecommonwealthinstitute.org/the-half-sheet/the-60-year-shadow-of-court-fines-fees/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s 30- and 60-year statutes of limitations on court debt</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, our youth can be stuck with these costs for a lifetime. This creates long-standing harm for children who enter the system and their families, with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black teenagers most often being </span><a href="http://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt558-1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">swept into the youth criminal legal system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and therefore facing the greatest financial and family harms.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cjcj.org/history-education/juvenile-justice-history" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout U.S. history</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, juvenile justice policies have repeatedly failed to adequately consider the culpability differences between kids and adults, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">thus leading to practices and policies that didn’t </span><a href="https://law.asu.edu/sites/default/files/pdf/academy_for_justice/14_Reforming-Criminal-Justice_Vol_1_Juvenile-Justice.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">appropriately treat kids as kids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With youth crime rates declining since the &#8217;90s, juvenile justice reformers are seeking to evolve from the </span><a href="https://www.cjcj.org/history-education/juvenile-justice-history" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">punitive beginnings of juvenile justice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fines are intended to function as </span><a href="https://www.vera.org/downloads/publications/the-high-price-of-using-justice-fines-and-fees-virginia.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">punishment for the underlying offense</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, most court assessments charged to young people in Virginia are not fines meant to discourage or “punish” harmful behavior, but instead </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ETdKyg58sjohxAD2t_bazCfv1ukDXWlS/edit#gid=153189838" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">court fees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> meant to cover costs for operating Virginia’s court system</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So if the state isn’t assessing fines for punishment, why are kids paying in the first place? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analyses of these fines and fees’ economic and social impacts on Black and Latino teenagers highlight the pressing challenges these children and their families can face. In Virginia, </span><a href="https://thecommonwealthinstitute.org/research/set-up-to-fail-how-court-fines-fees-punish-poverty-and-harm-black-communities-in-virginia-2/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fines and fees are assessed at the highest rates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the courts serving localities with the highest share of Black residents and residents with incomes below the poverty line. While detailed Virginia data on the impact of juvenile court fines and fees by race is not available, there is evidence from other states that Black youth pay the highest amount in fines as a result of courts sentencing Black youth to </span><a href="http://64.166.146.245/docs/2016/BOS/20161025_813/27510_PAC%20High%20Pain%2C%20No%20Gain.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a greater frequency and duration of average probation conditions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than their white peers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The high cost of these </span><a href="https://debtorsprison.jlc.org/documents/JLC-Debtors-Prison-dane-county.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fines and fees can financially harm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a family and alter family dynamics. The financial burden forces families with low incomes to </span><a href="https://debtorsprison.jlc.org/documents/JLC-Debtors-Prison.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">choose between paying for necessities and paying fees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It can also heighten tensions within already strained familial relationships and fuel feelings of anger and resentment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the rising awareness of the harm that court-assessed fines and fees can have on kids and their families, organizations across the country are calling for the courts to end this harmful practice and instead step into </span><a href="https://www.arnoldventures.org/stories/a-nationwide-campaign-to-end-juvenile-fines-and-fees-is-making-progress" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a new era of true youth justice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Many localities and states are already taking steps toward a more</span><a href="https://www.arnoldventures.org/stories/a-nationwide-campaign-to-end-juvenile-fines-and-fees-is-making-progress" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> youth-centered juvenile justice system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Five states have completely abolished all fines and fees in the juvenile justice system, with an additional four eliminating juvenile court fees. This year the state legislature in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington considered a bill that would establish a <a href="https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2023/feb/13/washington-legislature-considers-bill-to-eliminate/" target="_blank">state-funded restitution program</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are great examples that Virginia can look to on its path to providing meaningful justice for young people and communities. Virginia legislators have an opportunity to make sure that the youth criminal legal system connects young people — no matter what they look like or how much money their family has — to the support and resources needed to reach their full potential, rather than placing additional barriers in their path.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we celebrate Juneteenth this year, let it also be a time to reflect on the harms that still disproportionately impact Black and Latino kids in Virginia. May the conversations about the harms of fines and fees on our youth become louder and louder. May we not forget our children who are bound to the court system through fines and fees. </span></p>

(Ariana Figueroa / D.C. Bureau, States Newsroom)</p><p><em><b>By Faith Alejandro &amp; Cullen Seltzer</b></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the coming days, the Supreme Court of the United States is poised to decide the fate of affirmative action in higher education. Employers in Virginia, however, should pay attention to the </span><a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2022/20-1199" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harvard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2022/21-707#:~:text=Facts%20of%20the%20case,as%20a%20factor%20in%20admissions." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">University of North C</span></a><a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2022/21-707#:~:text=Facts%20of%20the%20case,as%20a%20factor%20in%20admissions." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">arolina</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cases now pending, as the Students for Fair Admissions alleges that these universities unlawfully rejected white and Asian students on the basis of race. The ways that Virginia employers implement diversity, equity and inclusion programs could be drastically affected, if the high court agrees with the student group’s allegation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In both cases, the universities proved that they used holistic application processes that considered race as merely one factor in admissions decisions. That’s in line with 45-year old precedent allowing them to do so. The schools proved that they considered, but rejected, race-neutral alternatives that were shown to be ineffective in building a diverse student body. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beginning with the case of Regents of the University of California v. Bakke in 1978, and reaffirmed in Grutter v. Bollinger in 2003, higher education institutions have been able to legally justify affirmative action programs that consider race as a “plus” factor to increase diversity in their student bodies. The high court recognized then that diversity, in and of itself, was a “compelling state interest” because diversity makes a student body better equipped, productive, and successful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is no surprise, therefore, that the “business case” for diversity and the benefits it offers abounds as justification for voluntary affirmative action programs in the American workplace. Indeed, employers largely recognize the value of fostering diverse, equitable, and inclusive (“DEI”) workplaces, as research shows that DEI can improve client service with </span><a href="https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">smarter teams</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who </span><a href="https://hbr.org/2017/03/teams-solve-problems-faster-when-theyre-more-cognitively-diverse" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">solve problems faster</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and achieve </span><a href="https://blog.shrm.org/workforce/inclusive-workplaces-lead-to-engaged-employees" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">greater employee engagement and satisfaction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We anticipate, though, that the conservative majority of the Supreme Court will soon decide that the value of diversity is no longer enough to justify race-conscious affirmative action. During </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2022/20-1199_6537.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">oral arguments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, many of the justices questioned the efficacy of these policies. Several expressed concerns that these admissions policies may have harmed Asian-American students — notwithstanding the lower courts’ findings that these schools did not engage in such discrimination. (Notably, Harvard just accepted a </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/harvard-admits-record-number-asian-american-students-black-latino-admi-rcna77923" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">record number of Asian-American students this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If, in fact, the Supreme Court agrees in the coming days that diversity,as a goal, is no longer a compelling state interest, how should Virginia employers respond? Here are three potential replies:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We should change nothing about our DEI initiatives because the Harvard and UNC cases concern higher education, not employment.” </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While this may be true, it is not a giant logical leap that the rejection of diversity as a goal in higher education may result in a similar rejection in employment. After all, Title VI federal higher education law and Title VII federal employment law have developed in similar fashion over the years.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Affirmative Action is dead. Employers need to stop </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">all</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> DEI efforts immediately to avoid getting sued.”</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employers who react too quickly may view this as the prudent approach and miss the opportunity to fully unpack the Court’s ruling. For example, may DEI initiatives be permissible if they take into consideration applicants’ socio-economic disadvantages? May those policies be permissible even if employers hope to increase racial diversity but don’t explicitly consider race? Plus, abandoning all DEI efforts may result in policies and practices that disparately affect protected classes, which could expose employers to a discrimination claims. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We should evaluate the effectiveness of our DEI initiatives and make sure our historical and business justification for DEI is sound, documented and legally compliant.”</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This approach, we believe, would give Virginia employers the best chance of following through on their DEI objectives while taking the time to understand their risk in this evolving landscape. After all, unlike higher education law, employment law recognizes that employers </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">can</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> justify affirmative action plans if they can demonstrate a “manifest imbalance” in “traditionally segregated job categories.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employers in Virginia should take the time, now, to evaluate their corporate values and recommit to DEI initiatives that bring about authentic, meaningful change. Merely performative plans could otherwise be in future peril legally, or at best, ineffective.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minority-owned businesses, as well, should prepare given that their eligibility to participate in Virginia’s SWaM (Small, Woman and Minority Owned) business loan funds may be compromised. After all, those Virginia businesses’ access to SWaM loans hinges directly on proof of business ownership by women or ethnic or racial minorities. Virginia’s General Assembly may have to take steps to protect its public policy commitment to promote SWaM businesses if SCOTUS declares race-conscious policies to be unconstitutional.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to recognize that 45 years ago in the groundbreaking Bakke case,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the Supreme Court concluded that remedying the ills of past unlawful discrimination was not enough to justify affirmative action by entities if they were not, themselves, guilty of historic discrimination. That ruling gave rise to today’s alternative basis for affirmative action: the benefits of diversity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employers and others have relied on that precedent in thousands of contexts to develop policies intended to both comply with constitutional restrictions and redress long standing systemic biases. Nevertheless, the high court has recently shown itself willing to set aside precedent when it determines doing so is warranted by either changed circumstances or the court’s evolving understanding of the Constitution’s requirements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It remains to be seen whether modern employers – who recognize that the country’s past sins of discrimination enabled at least some of their own economic, social, and political advantages – may affirmatively act to remedy those sins.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Whether and how employers can try to remedy that legacy and promote equity is very much on the Supreme Court’s docket right now.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The overdose crisis has wreaked havoc on the health of Virginians, claiming over </span><a href="https://drugabusestatistics.org/opioid-epidemic/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1,000 lives each year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across the Commonwealth – and </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">107,000 across the United States</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A closer look into these staggering numbers reveals an even more alarming truth: some members of society, specifically those battling opioid use disorders behind bars, are significantly more at risk of dying from an overdose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People released from jails or prisons are </span><a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/content/forefront/save-lives-prioritize-treatment-opioid-use-disorder-correctional-facilities" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">40 times more likely to die of an overdose</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the first two weeks after release than the general population. But we know what works to save their lives: jail- and prison-based programs that provide medications for opioid use disorders (MOUD) to incarcerated individuals </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36305669/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reduce the risk of fatal overdose by 80%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fairfax County Sheriff’s Office is working collaboratively with the county’s public health and social services systems to prevent fatal overdoses in our community. In late 2020, the Sheriff’s office used grant funding to establish the Medication for Addiction Treatment (MAT) program, in which every person with a substance use disorder is offered during the jail booking process following arrest. Fairfax County offers FDA-approved MOUD that prevent overdose and help incarcerated individuals maintain their recovery. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Programs like the one in the Fairfax County Adult Detention Center are few and far between. Nationwide, </span><a href="https://prisonopioidproject.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">just 12% of jails and prisons offer MOUD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to incarcerated individuals. While some states, including Rhode Island and Maryland, have created laws and initiatives to ensure incarcerated people have access to life-saving medications, federal legislation and funding is needed to guarantee no individual behind bars is left behind. The bipartisan Reentry Act does just that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By allowing Medicaid payments for medical services thirty days before an incarcerated person is released, the Reentry </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Act gets incarcerated people the critical health insurance they need to access MOUD treatment prior to leaving jail, putting millions of people on a reliable course of recovery as they transition out of incarceration and onto a path toward a healthy, fulfilling life. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The impact </h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fairfax County has created a safer, healthier community for everyone who calls the county home. Evidence-based addiction treatment services equip formerly incarcerated individuals with the skills to reenter their communities healthier with the tools necessary to maintain their recovery. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This program has had immediate results. In 2022, more than 800 people received MOUD at the Fairfax County Adult Detention Center. And at release, they ensure that formerly incarcerated individuals receive two doses of naloxone — the medicine that reverses the effects of an opioid overdose. At a time when national overdose death rates were continuing to climb, Fairfax saw a precipitous drop. In 2021, 111 people died from an overdose in Fairfax County. In 2022, that number </span><a href="https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/health/opioid-overdoses-data" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dropped to 82</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Why now? </h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While local and statewide efforts are a great start, they have not moved the needle far enough toward finding a reliable solution. It’s evident by the number of record-breaking overdose deaths the U.S. saw in 2021, the first time the number of lives lost at the hands of opioids and other drugs </span><a href="https://nida.nih.gov/research-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reached over 100,000</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The health inequities we see inside prison reflect what we witness in our communities. Virginians of color are </span><a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/virginia/articles/2022-10-30/opioid-overdose-deaths-nearly-triple-among-black-virginians" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">disproportionately impacted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by OUDs, and consistently jailed at a higher rate. Those in poverty are also more likely to end up incarcerated. And with the recidivism rate of drug offenses at 77%, it’s a challenge for this group to overcome poverty and stay out of the criminal justice system without OUD treatment prior to leaving jail. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grants that fund these initiatives are never assured long-term. An overarching federal policy like the Reentry Act would fight against o</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">utdated federal regulations and stigmas about addiction and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">establish a standard that no matter where someone is incarcerated in the U.S., they can access lifesaving treatment.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s part of a larger tide that’s already begun to turn in Washington. Last </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">year’s omnibus package included the bipartisan Mainstreaming Addiction Treatment (MAT) Act, which makes buprenorphine more readily accessible, including in jails. Such national, mainstream policies help remove the stigma from those already impacted by being incarcerated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congressional leaders and federal agencies must continue proposing and passing laws like the Reentry Act that benefit all OUD patients, giving at-risk individuals in jails and prisons the chance for treatment at a time when their journey to recovery and survival is at a crossroads. In Fairfax County, we see firsthand that access to treatment brings those recovering hope and a greater chance of living a long, gratifying life by ensuring jail is not a contributing factor to relapse or death. With the Reentry Act, access to treatment when it’s needed most will be possible</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, saving the lives of millions of people across Virginia and beyond. </span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Court of Appeals upheld a bribery conviction Tuesday for a Southside Virginia convenience store operator who offered the town of La Crosse a $500 monthly donation in exchange for officials’ support for gaming machines at his business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businessman Mamdoh Abouemara was appealing his 2021 guilty conviction in Mecklenburg County, arguing prosecutors hadn’t sufficiently proven he acted with corrupt intent, partly because he made the offer to the town openly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The appellate court rejected that argument in a </span><a href="https://www.vacourts.gov/opinions/opncavwp/0284222.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2-1 opinion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, ruling nothing in Virginia law requires quid pro quos to be offered “secretly or surreptitiously” in order to qualify as an illegal bribe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If that were true, the most unseemly, open and notorious bribes offered to public servants in plain view would be immunized from prosecution,” Judge Stuart A. Raphael wrote for the majority.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court opinion appears to center on so-called skill machines, the slots-like devices installed in convenience stores throughout Virginia despite </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/12/20/as-virginia-gears-up-for-gambling-debate-thousands-of-slot-like-games-have-already-slipped-in-the-back-door/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">questions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about their </span><a href="https://www.c-ville.com/city-ban-prosecutor-boots-queen-of-virginia-gaming-machines/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legality</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, the court opinion only refers to “gaming machines,” and local officials could not confirm Tuesday that the devices at issue were skill machines. The events in the bribery case occurred before the General Assembly voted to ban skill machines in 2021. That ban remains in limbo while the skill-game industry continues to </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/11/28/virginia-skill-game-lawsuit-pushed-back-again-over-disputed-budget-amendment/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fight the law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in court.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abouemara was sentenced to one year of probation, with a five-year term of incarceration fully suspended.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kevin Calhoun, one of Abouemera’s attorneys, said the legal battle would continue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are disappointed by the Court of Appeals’ ruling today, but we intend to appeal the case to the Supreme Court of Virginia and to vigorously fight for our client’s conviction to be overturned,” Calhoun said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The events that led to Abouemara’s legal trouble began when local law enforcement started investigating his store after noticing “many cars” in the parking lot late at night when the store was supposed to be closed, according to court records. In early October of 2019, Abouemara went to the La Crosse town manager’s office to discuss making donations to the town in exchange for a letter supporting the gaming machines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The town manager at the time, F.A. Hendrick, told Abouemara the town couldn’t take donations directly, but donations could be made to a nonprofit called “Friends of La Crosse” that focuses on civic improvement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hendrick said he would take Abouemara’s offer to the town council, and the matter was taken up at a Dec. 9 meeting. The council responded with a resounding no. According to the court opinion, a “garbled” recording of that meeting shows council members laughing after rejecting the proposal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abouemara also wrote the town a $200 check, which town officials did not accept. Hendrick had originally testified at trial that the check came after the December council meeting, but the check was dated Oct. 26 and Hendrick later acknowledged he might have received the check before the meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abouemara was charged with two felony counts of bribery, according to the appellate opinion, but the count related to the attempted $200 donation was dismissed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The appellate court rejected the defense’s claim that the attempted $200 donation after the town rejected his original proposal shows “the original offer was not a bribe.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For instance, his paying $200 once, rather than $500 every month, could well have signaled punishment for the council’s failure to accept the bribe,” Raphael wrote in the majority opinion. “Or the donation could have been a fallback effort to curry favor. Or an attempt to cover up the crime.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Dec. 15, 2019, according to court records, law enforcement executed a search warrant at Abouemara’s business and “seized several gaming machines.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appeals Court Judge Vernida R. Chaney disagreed with the opinion, writing in a dissent that the majority was taking an overly broad reading of the bribery law by treating the possibility of an informal letter as an official act by the public servants allegedly being improperly propositioned. Her dissent notes that both the donation offer and the request for a letter of support would have been legal on their own, and the mere fact they were linked together doesn’t prove the “requisite intent for bribery.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To construe the bribery statute as criminalizing any proposed quid pro quo would absurdly criminalize offers of monetary donations to benefit the community in return for a letter of thanks or a birthday greeting to the community’s oldest citizen,” Chaney wrote. “By construing the bribery statute to criminalize any proposal in which there is an exchange of benefits between the town and a private individual, the majority converts the lawful act of proposing a contract to the town council into a criminal act.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The majority, however, said the offer became a “completed crime once communicated to the town council.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another $5 million will go toward the extension of a hospital-based violence intervention program meant to help people escape life circumstances that led to them being shot or stabbed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia State Police plans to spend $256,044 to hire a new analyst at the crime-fighting Virginia Fusion Center who will use geographic data to help authorities and spot and address trends in violent activity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And more than a dozen local law enforcement agencies, prosecutors and community groups will receive grant funding for a variety of initiatives to stem gun violence in their areas, projects that range from hiring more prosecutors to funding outreach programs for at-risk youth.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2023/RD252/PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> issued this week by the Virginia Department of Criminal Justice Services lays out how various state and local entities plan to spend roughly $10 million in anti-gun violence funding recently approved by the General Assembly. The new report also includes status updates on $500,000 grants previously issued to the cities of Hampton, Newport News, Portsmouth, Richmond and Roanoke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more recent state funding was awarded through the 2023 Operation Ceasefire Grant Program, which runs from the start of this year through the end of 2024. Ceasefire programs are modeled after an anti-violence model Boston officials implemented in the 1990s that focuses on trying to steer people away from gangs and other activities that make them more likely to be shot or shoot someone, while cracking down on those who disregard those efforts and go on to commit violence with a firearm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prince William County told the state it intends to use the $353,974 it received to hire a full-time “gun violence interventionist” responsible for implementing the county’s “community-based intervention and prevention initiatives.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city of Suffolk said it intends to hire a new prosecutor and “identify high risk individuals to participate in call-ins, which will provide directed cease and desist messaging.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prosecutors in Prince George County and neighboring Hopewell plan to use $249,996 to create a “regional prosecutor initiative,” with a new attorney working in both jurisdictions to “prosecute offenders involved in firearms offenses and gun violence.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Southwest Virginia’s Lee County, officials will receive $81,766 for an additional prosecutor focused on guns, violent crime and “methamphetamine trafficking.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A handful of nonprofit groups also received state funds for a variety of intervention programs meant to prevent violence before it occurs through mentoring programs, skills training and mental health support.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a grand jury </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/04/17/tysons-corner-police-shooting-indictment-declined/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declined to indict the officer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who shot Timothy Johnson last month, the decision was disappointing, but not necessarily surprising.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a retired senior law enforcement officer who’s spent the last decade exploring issues in policing, I know that more than individual bad actors, it is often the broader justice system that impedes accountability. That’s why it’s critical to have independent actors in our justice system, like Fairfax County Commonwealth’s Attorney Steve Descano, who are willing to push through institutional hurdles to pursue just outcomes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last decade, </span><a href="https://mappingpoliceviolence.us/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fewer than 2% of killings by police nationwide have resulted in an officer being charged with a crime</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – and even fewer result in a conviction, according to Mapping Police Violence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We see the same trend here in Northern Virginia; only once in Fairfax’s history has a police officer been charged for killing someone while on duty. After the </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/true-crime/wp/2016/06/24/ex-fairfax-police-officer-who-killed-john-geer-returns-to-court-friday-for-sentencing/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2015 killing of John Geer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Descano served on the inaugural Fairfax Police Civilian Review Panel. The shooting officer’s defense attorney in that case was Ed Nuttall,who’s now running to unseat Descano as the head of the criminal justice system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Descano’s request to empanel a </span><a href="https://wjla.com/news/local/second-grand-jury-to-probe-fatal-police-shooting-timothy-johnson-indictment-fairfax-county-tysons-corner-center-virginia-nordstrom-sunglasses-dmv-shoplifting-bodycam-video-nova-chief-kevin-davis-steve-descano-commonwealth-attorney" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">special grand jury</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to investigate the fatal shooting of Johnson was approved a few weeks ago. The second jury will have the opportunity to indict the officer who shot Johnson; that opportunity wouldn’t exist without the commonwealth attorney’s persistence in seeking justice.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve spent over 30 years in law enforcement and believe “superior officers” are those who use their superior judgment to avoid those situations where they might have to rely on their superior skills, but the recent developments in the Johnson case illustrate that even after a national reckoning on police use-of-force issues, most criminal justice systems are still structured to protect bad actors. As we work to improve accountability across the system, we need relentless elected leaders who will fight for that change. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a series of emails, Vincent T. Brooks, senior local records archivist at the Library of Virginia, said the Mercury’s coverage prompted staff to scour county records. They retrieved several boxes from a separate facility, and a member of the local records staff, Mary Ann Mason, found Noah Cherry&#8217;s inquest along with three others filed within a box of constable&#8217;s warrants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This inquest, along with the inquest into the death of Alice Powell – whose murder triggered Cherry’s lynching – had been missing from the </span><a href="https://ead.lib.virginia.edu/vivaxtf/view?docId=lva/vi03358.xml" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Princess Anne coroner’s records</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Powell’s inquest remains missing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hree</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">page</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">document</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showed the mob killed Cherry on Nov. 15, 1885, and the inquest took place the following day. This timeline aligned with the Norfolk Virginian’s account of the lynching. A single line inserted into the text said the jury could not determine who had killed Cherry in a lynching that involved 150 to 200 people and was reported across the county, </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/13bXAO-FTp9Vxeq9iWEeRrZBpz0Pk5L1t/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to the Virginian’s account</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cassandra Newby-Alexander, Endowed Professor of Virginia Black History and Culture at Norfolk State University, said John Mitchell Jr., a former enslaved person who edited the Richmond Planet, investigated how law enforcement officials in Virginia often hid their responsibility for lynchings by blaming unruly mobs, which they did little to control.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No arrests were ever made of anyone,” she said, “including people who did these crimes in plain sight.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, Library of Virginia staffers uncovered a notation of an $11.50 charge for </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/105Cb0Geb0WPLcPwwiMBE6VvKRl2uBlV2/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">summoning the coroner’s jury</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a $7 charge for </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KrLd_bM4aLQhLIzt7hQI02DEZP0Eo0F9/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">making Noah Cherry’s coffin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a $1 charge for </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FIpLCwuUIFQxsrXLpn5ApC5Do4VMNVAs/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">digging his grave</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The inquest had a notice from the coroner, E.W. Eaton, that Cherry’s estate was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">too poor to pay for the costs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of his inquest. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staffers also found a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$25 charge for Charles H. Ferrell’s services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a detective for “working up the case against Noah Cherry for the murder of daughter of Mr. C.D. Powell.” A notation on the document says the county only allotted $15 for the service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Library staff did not find the actual inquest into Powell’s death, or any records of payment for the jurors who would have taken part in it, after an extensive search. Brooks said the inquest should have led to Cherry’s arrest and called it “odd” that the documents were missing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re pretty much out of obvious (and not so obvious) places to look,” he said. “We&#8217;ve looked at every conceivable box of records around the 1884-1886 time frame. Unless it is wildly misfiled in some random year, it is not in the Princess Anne Co. materials here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mercury&#8217;s investigation of the case found two state newspapers, the Norfolk Virginian and the Richmond Dispatch, put together timelines of Alice Powell’s murder that didn’t agree with each other or the county’s death registry. The story of this murder, widely circulated in the press, incited the lynching and scapegoated Cherry as the chief suspect in the murder, an accusation that has persisted, without solid proof, for more than a century.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The publishers of the newspapers were actively involved in a rising political movement aimed at curtailing the civil and voting rights of non-white people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brooks said his staff worked on a </span><a href="https://www.jmu.edu/africana/racial-terror.shtml" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lynching documentation project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at James Madison University, and the library’s </span><a href="https://lva.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?vid=01LVA_INST:VU" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Untold project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> highlights Black history before 1870.</span></p>

Parker Michels-Boyce for The Virginia Mercury</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Supreme Court of Virginia turned down a request by Wegmans to reconsider a February decision that found neighbors had a right to challenge local approvals of the grocery giant’s plans to build a massive distribution center in Hanover County. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The denial, issued May 11, was terse and offered no explanation of the reasoning of the judges, whose earlier decision in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morgan v. Board of Supervisors of Hanover County</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was unanimously in favor of the neighbors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are gratified that once again the Court has unanimously declared that Wegmans is wrong,” Brian Buniva, the attorney for Roderick Morgan and four other Hanover residents, said in a text message. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What practical implications the ruling will have for the Hanover project are unclear. The distribution center is nearly complete and expected to begin operations this summer, even as the Supreme Court of Virginia decision sends the case back to a lower court for further review.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are no approvals from the County contingent upon resolution of this case at the Circuit Court,” said Hanover spokeswoman Kristin Smith Dunlop in an email. “As there are no court orders directing the County to withhold permits, inspections, or approvals — such as the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for this facility — the County will continue to process these requests as they would for any applicant or property owner.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wegmans did not respond to a request for comment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris French, a Hanover resident who has been involved with a separate lawsuit over the project, said Thursday’s decision “again affirmed citizens should have reasonable access to courts when challenging a zoning case.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Local governments throughout Virginia were overstepping when they sought to dismiss cases solely on legal standing when the required criteria was obviously met,” he said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wegmans distribution center in Hanover has been beset by legal challenges since the local Board of Supervisors approved it in May 2020. Expected to create 700 jobs, the project garnered tax credits and $2.35 million in state incentives under former Gov. Ralph Northam’s administration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, many neighbors, including the Brown Grove community founded by freedpeople after the Civil War, have staunchly opposed the development on the grounds that it will destroy wetlands and cause major traffic and noise and light pollution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Morgan case ended up at the state Supreme Court after Hanover Circuit Court found five residents whose property lay within 1,000 feet of the new facility had no standing to challenge the county’s approval of the project because they hadn’t demonstrated they would suffer “particularized harm” from it. The neighbors, who had argued the board violated multiple local ordinances and state laws in its approval, appealed that decision. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Supreme Court </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/02/supreme-court-of-va-rules-hanover-residents-can-sue-over-wegmans-warehouse/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ruled in favor of the property owners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this February and sent the case back to Hanover Circuit.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have no difficulty concluding that the allegations of particularized harm made by the homeowners are fairly traceable to the Board’s 2020 decision,” wrote Justice D. Arthur Kelsey. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/03/21/wegmans-business-groups-ask-virginia-supreme-court-to-overturn-hanover-ruling/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wegmans’ petition for the court to reconsider that ruling was supported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by 21 major real estate, housing, local government and business groups, who in an amicus brief had contended the court’s February ruling “will have disastrous consequences for all types of development in Virginia.”  </span></p>

Glenn Youngkin addresses a crowd at the Executive Mansion before the ceromonial signing of a bill dealing with antisemitism. (Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin said Monday that he’s confident the state’s watchdog agency conducted a “full investigation” into Virginia State Police hiring practices after a former trooper killed three people, despite the lack of an independent report by the Office of the State Inspector General laying out any findings or analysis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin had called for an investigation into how State Police missed background information that should have disqualified Austin Lee Edwards, the so-called “catfish cop,” from being hired as a state trooper in early 2022. Edwards left his job with the State Police last October about a month before he killed three members of a California family and attempted to abduct a 15-year-old girl he had been communicating with online. He had recently been hired to work for the Washington County Sheriff’s Office in Southwest Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The inspector general’s office recently told media outlets, </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/05/04/virginias-probe-into-state-police-hiring-of-catfish-cop-ends-with-no-investigative-report/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">including the Virginia Mercury</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, that its review of the case had been completed but the office had not produced a report of its own. Instead, the office released a letter written by State Police leaders that described the results of an internal review.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course they worked with the State Police and conducted a full investigation,” Youngkin said Monday when asked about the topic at an unrelated bill-signing event at the Executive Mansion. “State Police reported that there had been human error, that there was a mistake, and they were going to revise all of their processes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to Monday’s statement, Youngkin’s office had declined to comment on the lack of a formal report from the inspector general. The case has drawn concern about potentially lax vetting of law enforcement recruits at a time of personnel shortages, but State Police maintain that the Edwards hiring was an isolated case and not part of a pattern of potentially disqualifying information going undetected by its background investigators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though State Police officials initially said there had been “no indicators of concern” in Edwards’ hiring process, they now acknowledge their vetting process failed to turn up a publicly documented </span><a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-12-06/austin-lee-edwards-catfishing-cop-threats-kill-dad#:~:text=The%20Virginia%20police%20officer%20who,a%20police%20report%20obtained%20by" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mental health incident in 2016</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that resulted in a court ordering Edwards to receive treatment and stripping him of his firearm rights as a safety precaution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the letter released by the inspector general’s office, State Police Superintendent Gary Settle said his agency has enacted remedial training on background check procedures for potential hires and has instituted a new rule requiring investigators to interview everyone who lives with a job applicant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The reality is that errors do happen,” Youngkin said. “And our job is to make sure they&#8217;re not repeated. And I think this is a case where they have made sure that that error won&#8217;t be repeated.”</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Court of Appeals is asking a lower court to consider whether state law setting a local residency requirement for people collecting and witnessing signatures in support of a referendum violates political speech rights under the First Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The case, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Williams v. Legere et al.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, concerns an attempt by Williamsburg resident Margaret Williams to put a referendum on the November 2022 ballot on the question of whether members of the joint Williamsburg-James City County School Board who represent Williamsburg should be directly elected. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The division is one of just 15 in Virginia where school boards are partially or fully appointed. While the five members of the seven-member Williamsburg-James City County board who represent the county are directly elected by residents, the two members who represent the city are appointed by city council. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/22.1-57.2/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">State law allows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> voters to petition a circuit court to hold a referendum on whether their local school board should be directly elected. Virginia code requires that the petition be signed by at least 10% of the locality’s registered voters 111 days before the general election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last June, Williams began collecting the 999 signatures needed for such a petition in Williamsburg. By the middle of July, she had submitted 1,587 signatures to the court, and City Registrar Tina Reitzel later determined 1,246 were qualified city voters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the registrar found only 64 of the signatures met statutory requirements for a referendum because the people who witnessed the remaining signatures — the people circulating the petition — were residents of either James City County or York County. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reitzel’s determination was based on a different </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title24.2/chapter6/section24.2-684.1/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">provision of state law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requiring that all signatures collected on a petition for a referendum “shall be witnessed by a person who is qualified to vote, or qualified to register to vote, in the referendum for which he is circulating the petition.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Williams then sued three members of the Williamsburg Electoral Board and the city registrar, arguing state law was severely limiting her First Amendment rights. The city of Williamsburg intervened, arguing that the requirement protected “the integrity of the referendum process … by requiring that those driving the change and circulating the petition are would-be voters of the referendum itself.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the joint Williamsburg-James City County Circuit Court ruled in favor of the city, Williams appealed the case to the Virginia Court of Appeals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On May 2, the higher court reversed that decision and asked the circuit court to analyze whether the residency requirement in state law “is necessary and narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling government interest.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.vacourts.gov/opinions/opncavwp/1225221.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">opinion by Judge Kimberley Slayton White</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> noted the U.S. Supreme Court has previously found “that the distribution of referendum petitions is a protected right to speech under the First Amendment and that any limitation on political expression is subject to ‘exacting scrutiny.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Williamsburg case, “the City wishes to enforce a requirement which would cut down the number of political message carriers, thus limiting the audience Williams may reach,” wrote White. “Such a requirement substantially restricts Williams’ ability to engage in ‘core political speech. Because this restriction on political speech is a clear deprivation of a right guaranteed in the First Amendment, courts must subject it to strict scrutiny.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">White also pointed to U.S. Supreme Court decisions striking down various requirements linked to the circulation of petitions, such as requirements that a person circulating a petition for a ballot initiative be a registered voter and wear an identification badge, as “impermissible restrictions on the fundamental free speech right of political expression as guaranteed by the First Amendment.” </span></p>
<p>Nicole Trifone, a spokesperson for the city of Williamsburg, said the city had no comment on the ruling.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only document the Office of the State Inspector General (OSIG) said it could provide was a </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/FOIA-2023-088-VSP-HL-2023-297_Redacted.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dec. 30 letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> written by State Police Superintendent Gary Settle. That letter recounts the State Police’s own assessment of what went wrong and ideas for how to prevent similar mistakes going forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The administrative hotline case is complete and has been closed by OSIG in accordance with established policy,” Chief Deputy Inspector General Corrine Louden said when asked about the status of the investigation Youngkin described.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeff Pike — a private investigator in Wytheville who formerly worked in law enforcement and has provided media outlets with internal State Police documents that contradicted the agency’s initial public statements about Edwards — said the State Police letter falls far short of the type of investigation he feels was warranted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If that is indeed the embodiment of this investigation, then basically the State Police investigated themselves,” Pike said. “And they’re sticking with a narrative that comes nowhere close to addressing the multiple mistakes made with this guy and in their hiring process.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edwards, dubbed the “catfish cop” in media reports last year due to the online relationship he cultivated with a 15-year-old California girl by posing as a teenage boy, wasn’t a State Police employee at the time of the murders. He had worked as a state trooper for a little over a year before leaving last October for a job with the Washington County Sheriff’s Office in Southwest Virginia. Edwards killed three members of the girl’s family the day after Thanksgiving and then reportedly died by suicide as police pursued him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In their initial response to the killings in California, Virginia State Police said there were no “indicators of concern” during the agency’s background check of Edwards. The agency was forced to backtrack after the </span><a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-12-06/austin-lee-edwards-catfishing-cop-threats-kill-dad#:~:text=The%20Virginia%20police%20officer%20who,a%20police%20report%20obtained%20by" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Los Angeles Times reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Edwards had a prior mental health episode in 2016 during which he threatened to kill his father and himself. That incident, which State Police later admitted Edwards partially disclosed during the hiring process without going into full detail, led to the issuance of a court order hospitalizing him as a safety precaution and stripping him of his gun rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Police have since acknowledged errors in Edwards’ background check, but the agency’s letter says the failure was an “isolated incident” and not a sign of potentially broader hiring lapses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s unclear why the inspector general’s office is only releasing an assessment written by State Police as opposed to writing an investigative report more in line with Youngkin’s description of what the office would be doing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The inspector general’s office, which is tasked with investigating fraud, waste, abuse and corruption in state government, refused to make any officials available for an interview. The office, headed up by Inspector General Michael Westfall, didn’t respond to follow-up questions sent via email about why there was no independent report and what steps OSIG had taken to investigate the matter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s office also refused to comment. The Virginia Mercury asked the governor’s office on April 24 if the administration had received a report from OSIG in response to Youngkin’s request for an investigation. Youngkin staffers said twice that they were working on a response to the Mercury’s inquiry. After being given more than a week, the governor’s office provided no information for this story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One possible explanation for the discrepancy is confusion on the Youngkin administration’s part about OSIG’s different processes for full-blown investigations versus less in-depth administrative reviews initiated by complaints from state employees or the general public. The State Police letter’s reference to a “complainant” and OSIG’s description of the matter as an “administrative hotline case” suggest the agency was not conducting a full investigation, despite Youngkin’s public comments to the contrary. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/california-virginia-riverside-620670e12cfd39da2b9618a04e2c1012" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a statement about OSIG’s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> purported investigation late last year, a Youngkin spokeswoman said the governor “has full confidence that they will follow the evidence, wherever it may lead.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The inspector general’s office answers to the governor’s chief of staff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s office did not provide an answer when asked if the governor did or did not formally ask OSIG to conduct an investigation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the letter sent to OSIG, State Police officials said one of the agency’s background investigators entered the wrong code when checking Edwards’ criminal history, thereby failing to turn up records of Virginia mental health orders. In response to the Edwards case, all background investigators were given remedial training and written instructions on the proper use of those codes, the agency said. Staffers vetting potential hires have also been told to take extra steps to “discuss any potentially relevant information” revealed in polygraphs or pre-employment interviews, the letter said, and investigators are now required to interview all adults who live with someone applying for a State Police job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The letter acknowledges Edwards disclosed some details about his 2016 mental health incident during the process, but insists it is “false” to suggest the agency knew he “had been committed to a mental institution.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“However, this would have been an opportunity for clarification,” Settle said in the letter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to declining a request for an interview, the inspector general’s office delayed releasing the State Police letter to the Mercury, indicating its official practice is to wait five days before responding to requests for public records. Under the state’s Freedom of Information Act, government agencies are required to respond “promptly” to all requests for public records, but they are allowed to take up to five business days before a response is considered unlawfully late. On its website, the inspector general’s office says part of its mission is “increasing confidence and trust in government.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Louden, the chief deputy inspector general, acknowledged the letter had already been released to other media outlets and gave little explanation for why it would take nearly a full week to provide a digital copy of a single document.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s our standard FOIA process … five days,” Louden said.</span></p>

(JW Caterine / For Virginia Mercury</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Virginia weighs whether to renew its contract with GEO Group to run the Lawrenceville Correctional Center, the state’s only privately operated prison, records show persistent staffing shortages at the facility have cost the company $4.3 million since August 2018. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under GEO’s current contract, which ends July 31, the Virginia Department of Corrections can dock the payments it makes to the company to run the prison whenever GEO breaches a minimum level of staffing at the prison. According to intradepartmental memos obtained by the Mercury, between August 2018 and October 2022, VADOC deducted $3.7 million from payments to the operator for non-medical staff shortages and over $605,000 for medical staff shortages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Department is committed to effectively managing all contracts and is always prepared to explore options that will best serve the interest of the Commonwealth,” VADOC spokeswoman Carla Miles said in an email in response to a question about whether Virginia intends to renew its contract with GEO Group. “At this time, we continue to be engaged in that process.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawrenceville was opened in 1998 as Virginia’s first privately run prison, and GEO has managed the medium-security facility since 2003. The current contract, which went into effect Aug. 1, 2018, lasts five years with the option for the state to renew annually for an additional 10 years. </span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Proposal to end for-profit prison management fails in Virginia Senate&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2021/01/15/proposal-to-end-for-profit-prison-management-fails-in-virginia-senate/embed/#?secret=0eYu5pWL6i#?secret=soc4muugxG" data-secret="soc4muugxG" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GEO Group’s management of Lawrenceville has sparked debate in the General Assembly. During the 2021 legislative session, Sen. Adam Ebbin, D-Alexandria, sponsored a bill that would have prohibited the state from contracting with private prison operators, but it failed to move out of committee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If the state is going to take someone&#8217;s liberty away and incarcerate them, then we have a direct responsibility to supervise and see that they are in a safe situation where rehabilitation is being worked on, not where we’re just trying to nickel and dime and warehouse them in the most profitable way,” Ebbin told the Mercury.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GEO Group declined an interview request for this story, but a spokesperson told the Mercury that “all correctional facilities in the Commonwealth of Virginia, and across the country, are facing similar staffing challenges.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While we remain focused on addressing these challenges, we are committed to taking all necessary steps, including the authorized use of overtime, to adhere to daily staffing requirements, which are designed to ensure the safety of the facility and those in our care,” the statement continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People who have been imprisoned at Lawrenceville, however, say that their safety has suffered from the frequent staff shortages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hilary Robinson said her husband Travis, a former Lawrenceville inmate, was stabbed five times and beaten by other inmates at the facility on July 18, 2020, when trying to break up a fight. She said she is convinced that if more staff had been present, her husband would not have been as badly injured as he was. (GEO Group referred questions about the incident to the Department of Corrections, which referred questions to GEO Group.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s why [inmates] call it ‘Las Vegas,’ because they can do whatever they want,” she said. “The staff isn’t there to regulate or anything like that. The staff doesn’t care; they just want to survive it too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Documents show top-ranking officials within the department have expressed concern about staffing shortages at Lawrenceville. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a letter dated July 27, 2020, VADOC Director Harold Clarke wrote GEO that “on July 22, 2020, I am told that there were 16 security vacancies, 19 in training, 10 on administrative leave, 7 on [Family Medical Leave Act]/Medical Leave, 6 out for COVID, and 4 waiting test result.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Although we certainly understand the issues that COVID-19 is causing everyone, this vacancy rate could become worrisome if it continues to increase,” he continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, a GEO spokesperson in a letter claimed that the shortages were specific to the COVID crisis, and that as of August 2020, staffing was “at historically high levels.” However, intradepartmental memos show the deductions GEO faced for shortages in August 2020 — over $26,000 of damages for 214 days’ worth of shortages for non-medical staff and 43 hours for medical staff — were higher than those it faced in some previous months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The staffing problem appears to have escalated since then, with 76% of the $4.3 million in total damages being deducted by the state linked to shortages between October 2021 and October 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The memos share more details about medical staff shortages. GEO Group has faced deductions at different times for vacancies among physicians and physicians’ assistants, as well as dentists and dental assistants. Between May 2019 and August 2019, there was no psychiatrist on staff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nursing staff suffered the most from chronic vacancies. Shortages were so severe that GEO faced deductions for failing to staff enough licensed practical nurses in virtually every month between August 2018 and October 2022. Registered nurses were also regularly understaffed. In total, the state deducted costs for a combined 8,929 hours of shortages for both positions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Irene Shin, D-Fairfax, who toured Lawrenceville last September during a lockdown, said inmates have told her that GEO’s health care was subpar compared to that at state-run facilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At Lawrenceville, a number of those folks told us that they were denied health care over and over in spite of acute pain and illnesses, which led to worsened health conditions,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Franchesca Hylton, the wife of former inmate Robert Hylton, said that while her husband had been told by his doctor that he needed to see a cardiologist annually, he lost such access after being transferred to Lawrenceville in 2016. For the next four years, he experienced seizures that led to injuries, including a broken rib. Franchesca Hylton </span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/taking-action/wife-claims-husband-is-being-denied-medical-care-inside-virginia-state-prison/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advocated on his behalf to get him transferred</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to a state-run facility in 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With the state facilities, it’s still a headache to get them to do some things,” she said. “But with GEO it was really a headache.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shawn Weneta of the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia, a former inmate of Lawrenceville himself, said GEO Group has been allowed to continue operating the prison in spite of staffing shortages because it saves the state money. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s going to cost a whole lot more to have the facility under state control than to have GEO Group run it,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morally, however, Weneta said the state has an obligation to take back management of the prison, which has been racked by overdoses under GEO. According to local emergency call records from Brunswick County, there were a total of 39 “Overdose / Poisoning” incidents at the prison between January 2021 and May 2022. <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/08/10/state-investigating-after-overdoses-death-at-privately-run-lawrenceville-prison/" target="_blank">One death occurred last Augus</a>t. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The disappointing thing is that [a state takeover] could be done easily. We don’t need the legislature to act,” Weneta said. “The executive can act, the Secretary of Public Safety can act.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2020 </span><a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2020/RD516/PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VADOC study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> estimated a state takeover would raise Lawrenceville’s operating costs by $9.3 million, mainly to pay for “an increase of 93 correctional officers needed to provide adequate relief staffing and to address operational security needs.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VADOC can terminate the contract at any time, and a document dated June 19, 2019, and signed by Lawrenceville administrators lays out “a detailed plan to implement in the event of a contract termination and assumption of control of this facility by the Virginia Department of Corrections.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jake Petzold, a spokesperson for Secretary of Public Safety and Homeland Security Bob Mosier, said no decisions had been made as far as renewing the contract.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quadaire Patterson, a current inmate at Lawrenceville, told his fiance Santia Nance over the phone last week that while conditions at the prison had improved since last year, he still believes the private operators are profiting at the expense of the lives of those incarcerated there. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The state being able to outsource its own economic responsibility is a big negative when it comes to justice,” he said on the call.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stanlee Fazi, 41,</span> <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/virginia-man-pleads-guilty-trafficking-turtles" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pleaded guilty to trafficking turtles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a federal court in Alexandria after admitting he illegally collected the animals from the wild, bound them in socks and shipped them by FedEx to online buyers across the country on at least 27 occasions from 2017 to 2020. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trafficking of the animals violated the federal Lacey Act, which prohibits the interstate transportation or sale of any wildlife captured or possessed illegally under state law and carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Virginia banned the catching of box turtles, as well as other common reptiles and amphibians, from the wild </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/07/01/ban-on-pet-box-turtles-takes-effect-in-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because of declining populations and mistreatment by pet owners. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service offices in Baltimore and Vero Beach, Florida, conducted the investigation as part of “Operation Middleman,” which focused on the trafficking of reptiles from the U.S. to China.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also referred to as eastern box turtles, the colorful reptiles reside in forested regions of the eastern U.S. and can grow up to 6 inches long and live more than 100 years. The box turtle’s namesake comes from the “box”-like appearance the animal assumes when it retreats into its yellow and orange-splotched shell. Those with more colorful markings are particularly prized in domestic and foreign pet trade markets. </span></p>

Glenn Youngkin's rights restoration policies. (Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><em>By Duane Edwards and Barbara Harris for Virginia Organizing</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We want Gov. Glenn Youngkin to </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/03/23/youngkin-administration-now-requires-felons-to-apply-to-get-their-voting-rights-back/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bring back the Restoration of Rights process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that previous governors of both parties developed over the 13 years before he took office. It was a simple, fluid process that resulted in tens of thousands of returning citizens getting their rights back. Gov. Youngkin has slowed that down to a trickle even though his administration’s Secretary of the Commonwealth, Kay Coles James, claimed last year that their priority was to make the process more efficient.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We, the authors of this column, both served time in prison years ago, but after we came home we wanted to return to our communities and contribute. We knew that one way to do that was to get our civil rights restored. Back then you had to fill out a 13-page application, get three letters of recommendation, and then, if it was denied, they didn&#8217;t tell you why, and you couldn&#8217;t apply again for a year. Only a few thousand people succeeded in getting their rights back each year while tens of thousands waited with no assurance that they would ever succeed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the 20</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century, most returning citizens were unable to secure decent jobs and housing, vote, or live with dignity in Virginia. As soon as they were released, they met with prejudice, especially if they were people of color, and they were shut out of public life. That’s why Virginia Organizing held our first Restoration of Rights workshop in 1999, to teach returning citizens how to apply. Along with many other groups, we met with every governor after that to ask them to improve the process, and they did. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our chapters register voters every year. Under former Gov. Northam, whenever a formerly incarcerated person told us they couldn’t vote, we could explain to them that they could get their rights back. We could explain the criteria and the steps they had to take. We could pull up the website with the simple application and help them fill it out. And we could feel confident that in about two months, their rights would be restored. We would follow up with them to help them register to vote in time for the next election. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Virginia passed the automatic restoration constitutional amendment for the first time and passed the Virginia Voting Rights Act in 2021. Suddenly, Virginia led the nation in civil rights progress. But all the forward strides we&#8217;ve made are daily being pushed back to where we started from.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why must a fellow Virginian be forced to pay for life for a mistake made years before? After time served, we deserve a new beginning. In many cases decades have passed and we&#8217;re still being penalized. Most returning citizens are just average people, looking for a second chance at a normal life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We both have children. We taught them that when you make a mistake, you apologize and do what you can to make it right again and then you will be forgiven. We don’t hold their mistakes against them every day forever. This is what we teach our kids, so why are we treating each other like this, with this new policy?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As returning citizens who had the good fortune to benefit from the Restoration Program, we have been able to move forward and become advocates and activists through Virginia Organizing for men and women who are going through what we endured. It has been a blessing to be an integral part of the movement. We want that for every returning citizen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&#8217;s all take a stand for our rights and join together to fight the bias against returning citizens, especially people of color. We will take the fight to the community, the city, and the state to help make sure Virginia continues to lead the nation in its commitment to civil rights.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The woman, Danaesha Martin, said in the suit filed Friday, April 7 in Portsmouth Circuit Court that the deputy ordered the detainees to expose themselves as a condition of obtaining sanitary products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The provision of a sanitary napkin, pad, and/or tampon by a correctional officer to a female detainee/inmate is a mere ministerial function that in no way requires the exercise of discretion,” reads Martin’s suit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a copy of an email obtained by the Mercury, Portsmouth City Jail Chief Deputy of Jail Operations Lt. Col. Dorothy Dildy-Clemons wrote deputies shortly after the alleged May 2 incident that “at no time are you to ask female inmates to pulled [sic] down their pants and undergarments to visually see if they are on their cycle.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This can become a PREA issue that can escalate into a lawsuit,” wrote Dildy-Clemons, presumably referring to the </span><a href="https://bja.ojp.gov/program/prea/overview" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">federal Prison Rape Elimination Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “This is to stop immediately, expeditiously!!!” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dildy-Clemons noted in the same email that the jail had “plenty” of sanitary products and directed deputies to log the names of inmates receiving such products and the quantity used. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marvin Waters, an undersheriff in the Portsmouth Sheriff’s Office, said Dildy-Clemons’ email was sent in response to a rumor and not an official report. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What the lieutenant colonel was doing was putting something out there about it to say, ‘Hey, this is something we do not do,’” he said. “There was never an official report of an incident that had occurred.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waters said the sheriff’s office doesn’t comment on pending litigation and plans to file a response within the next 30 days. He also said Dildy-Clemons&#8217; description of the procedure used to provide detainees with sanitary products accurately reflects the jail&#8217;s ongoing policy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I really wish I could speak on it more, but once all the facts in the lawsuit come out, a lot of viewpoints on the matter will definitely change,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Martin is accusing the sheriff and the deputy, variously called “Katherine Adams,” “Catherine Adams” and “RC Adams,” among other spellings, of sexual abuse, gross negligence and wilful and wanton misconduct, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under state code, sexual abuse is defined as “an act committed with the intent to sexually molest, arouse, or gratify any person” in four specific situations, including when “the accused forces another person to touch the complaining witness’s intimate parts or material directly covering such intimate parts.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Martin is seeking $1 million in compensatory damages and $350,000 in punitive damages, as well as attorney’s fees and costs. She is being represented by Mark Dix, an attorney with the Richmond-based Dix Law Firm. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time of the alleged events, Martin was being held at Portsmouth City Jail on charges of malicious wounding and conspiracy to maliciously wound in connection to </span><a href="http://kwayradio.com/woman-arrested-while-awaiting-sentencing-for-cousins-murder/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the shooting of a man and the striking of a woman by a vehicle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Portsmouth. The charges were later dropped. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, she was awaiting sentencing in a separate case related to the November 2018 death of her cousin, Shavondes Martin, in Waterloo, Iowa. While she was originally charged with first-degree murder in that death, Martin agreed to plead guilty to a lesser conspiracy charge and testify against a man accused of shooting her cousin. This past October, </span><a href="https://wcfcourier.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/prison-sentence-handed-down-for-woman-who-lured-her-cousin-to-his-death/article_9ec942b4-5dd7-570a-9650-27dea0664918.html#:~:text=The%20decision%2C%20handed%20down%20Wednesday,said%20upon%20hearing%20the%20sentence." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a judge sentenced Martin to up to 10 years in prison</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dix said his law firm was retained last summer to represent Martin in the Portsmouth City Jail case but the Portsmouth Sheriff’s Office did not respond to requests for documents under the state Freedom of Information Act for several months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dix filed a separate lawsuit against the sheriff in January 2023 asking Portsmouth Circuit Court to require the office to comply with the FOIA request. He said he then received a response.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Court records show the FOIA case was dismissed Feb. 15. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women’s use of sanitary products in jails and prisons has sparked a string of legal cases in Virginia and other states in recent years. In 2018, the Virginia Department of Corrections </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-prison-bans-female-visitors-from-wearing-tampons/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">instituted a policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> forbidding female visitors to state prisons from wearing tampons, citing concerns about the women instead smuggling in contraband. The agency later rolled the policy back, although some department officials told the General Assembly in 2019 that women wearing tampons were </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/prison-officials-say-theyre-still-blocking-women-wearing-tampons-from-full-visitation-privileges-over-contraband-concerns/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">only being allowed no-contact visitation with inmates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This September, a jury in federal district court </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/09/20/virginia-prison-agency-discriminated-against-female-employee-in-tampon-case-jury-rules/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">found VADOC had discriminated against a former employee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who was fired after a body scanner detected a tampon she was wearing, causing officials to suspect she was carrying contraband into the prison. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Tennessee, a lawsuit between the nation’s largest private prison operator, CoreCivic, and female prison visitors ordered to remove tampons or sanitary pads to prove they were menstruating </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/7fd362260ce54d15b2642d3d9d023fbd" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">was settled in a confidential agreement in 2017</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The women had said guards forced them to expose their genitals as proof. </span></p>
