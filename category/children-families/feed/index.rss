<p>“There are standards in every other industry,” she said. “Why not us?”</p>
<p>After a decade of domestic work, Dominguez became an organizer for the Fair Work Center, a labor advocacy group in Washington state that won a victory in 2019 when Seattle <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/documents/Departments/LaborStandards/OLS_QA_Domestic%20Workers_FINAL_10022020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">implemented</a> an ordinance guaranteeing minimum wage, meal periods and paid rest breaks for domestic workers. Now, advocates are pushing for new statewide legislation that would ensure minimum wage and sick time and require written agreements between employers and workers.</p>
<p>“I know what it is to be unprotected and alone in this industry,” Dominguez said. “There’s no co-workers.”</p>

<p>If advocates are successful, Washington would join a dozen Democratic-leaning states and several cities that have added new protections for domestic workers. Efforts in those places did not face widespread opposition, though they raised some concerns about privacy and overregulation of workers in private homes.</p>
<p>In 2010, <a href="https://labornotes.org/2010/07/domestic-workers-new-york-win-first-ever-job-protections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York became the first state</a> to pass a Domestic Worker Bill of Rights, guaranteeing overtime pay, at least one day off per week and protections against racial and sexual harassment. Since then, 11 other states have passed similar laws, as have Philadelphia, Seattle and Washington, D.C., according to the National Domestic Workers Alliance.</p>
<p>Congress is unlikely to pass national standards anytime soon. President-elect Donald Trump has promised mass deportations of immigrants — who make up a disproportionate share of domestic workers — and he and the GOP-dominated Congress almost certainly would be cool to new regulations designed to protect them.</p>
<p>Federal labor laws for decades exempted domestic workers from many safeguards, including a minimum wage, civil rights protections and workplace safety standards. These exclusions were rooted in racism and sexism, said Zoë West, a senior researcher at The Worker Institute at Cornell University who has studied the industry and operated training programs to educate workers about their rights.</p>
<p>Historically, domestic work has largely been done by Black and immigrant women, West said, and that work — cleaning, child care and the like — has long been viewed as “women’s natural work.”</p>
<p>“There’s a very persistent, strong perception that this isn’t real work,” she said.</p>
<p>Some of the new state and local legislation has mandated that domestic workers are paid overtime and at least the state or city minimum wage, while other laws have gone further, ensuring protections such as paid time off.</p>
<p>But new laws are just the first step.</p>
<p>“[Y]ou still have this enforcement question,” West said. “Across all kinds of low-wage work — not just domestic work — there’s a lot of challenges in enforcing labor law.”</p>
<p>Many domestic workers are privately employed by families, making it difficult to educate both employers and workers about new protections. And domestic workers, who are sometimes paid cash without any formal work agreement, can be particularly vulnerable to retaliation.</p>
<p>In Philadelphia, which approved new domestic worker protections in 2019, some workers who pushed employers to honor newly won rights such as lunch breaks or contracts were fired, said Aurora Munoz, the Pennsylvania organizing manager for the National Domestic Workers Alliance.</p>
<p>The organization has since launched an anti-retaliation campaign and is pushing the Philadelphia City Council to approve new legislation next year to prevent retaliation and beef up enforcement.</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.phila.gov/media/20240122095349/Policy-and-Compliance-Report-2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Philadelphia received six complaints </a>regarding domestic worker protections; five of those cases were closed. The city’s labor department could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>“If we enforce it to the T, then it will be really amazing and beneficial for not just domestic workers, but a lot of low-wage workers,” Munoz said.</p>
<h4 class="editorialSubhed">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘People are paying attention’</h4>

<p>For New Jersey state Sen. Britnee Timberlake, the story of domestic work is the story of her family.</p>
<p>Her grandmother worked as a so-called baby nurse and house cleaner. When she relocated to the Northeast from North Carolina, she found domestic jobs for other family members moving North.</p>
<p>Timberlake, a Democrat, sponsored legislation requiring meal breaks, protection from discrimination and the right to written contracts for domestic workers.</p>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" title="“Steep fines in Iowa set off state-federal showdown over child labor laws” — Stateline" src="https://stateline.org/2024/07/23/steep-fines-in-iowa-set-off-state-federal-showdown-over-child-labor-laws/embed/#?secret=GDbSJQ7wtt#?secret=orLbWvTw9b" width="500" height="440" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-scripts" data-secret="orLbWvTw9b" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>“One of my only regrets with the bill is that I did not name it after her,” she said of her grandmother. “This is something that is a part of my history and a part of my fabric.”</p>
<p>Timberlake said <a href="https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/bill-search/2022/S723" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the legislation</a>, introduced in 2022 and enacted earlier this year, aligns with broader efforts to provide protections for workers who aren’t in unions.</p>
<p><a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2024/01/09/domestic-workers-celebrate-passage-of-bill-granting-them-new-labor-protections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Business groups opposed the bill</a>, saying it would unfairly overburden employers, the New Jersey Monitor reported.</p>
<p>The New Jersey Business &amp; Industry Association pushed for some amendments that were added to the bill, including removal of a provision that would have mandated an extra hour of pay in situations where the employer cannot provide a meal or rest period. <a href="https://njbia.org/lame-duck-review-how-nj-business-fared/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In a legislative update on the group’s website,</a> Vice President of Government Affairs Elissa Frank said the changes “successfully strike a balance between providing flexibility for employers to manage their workforce according to business needs and ensuring certain protections for employees.”</p>
<p>Now, Garden State advocates are working to ensure both workers and employers know about the new law, said Evelyn Saz, the lead New Jersey organizer with the National Domestic Workers Alliance.</p>
<p>Saz came into domestic work <a href="https://19thnews.org/2023/10/domestic-workers-health-safety-protections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">after fleeing war</a> in her native El Salvador for the United States, where she struggled to find work because she did not speak English and had a foreign university degree.</p>
<p>“I took any opportunity I could as a single mother to support my family,” she wrote in an email to Stateline translated into English by a co-worker at her alliance. “This work can’t stop now. We need to make sure that domestic workers are fully informed about their rights and are able to enforce them.”</p>
<p>Traditional labor organizing focuses on a single geographic location: a hotel or factory with a broad group of workers and a single employer. But that’s not possible with domestic workers, said Ben Fuller-Googins, deputy director of Carroll Gardens Association, a neighborhood organization in Brooklyn that advocates for affordable housing, worker rights and other issues.</p>
<figure id="attachment_41608" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:225px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=41608" rel="attachment wp-att-41608"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-41608 size-medium" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/domestic-workers-sign-768x1024-1-225x300.jpeg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/domestic-workers-sign-768x1024-1-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/domestic-workers-sign-768x1024-1.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  The Carroll Gardens Association celebrates International Domestic Workers Day in June 2024 in Brooklyn, N.Y.

<p>“You don’t know how many domestic workers there are, where they work,” he said. “There’s one employer per worker.”</p>
<p>That’s led his organization to aim to educate workers and employers across the entire Carroll Gardens neighborhood about the state’s protections for domestic workers.</p>
<p>“Our approach is that, generally, employers want to do the right thing but are not equipped with the resources and guidance they might need,” he said.</p>
<p>The New York State Department of Labor has conducted 840 investigations into potential violations of the law since 2010, when the law was enacted.</p>
<p>Kenya Williams, who’s been a nanny in New York for 26 years, said she was only recently informed of her rights when a member of the Carroll Gardens group approached her in a local park. Before that, she said, she generally took whatever pay and conditions were offered to her and didn’t know to ask about holiday or overtime pay.</p>
<p>“Things are slowly getting better,” she said. “I think we are making improvements in our industry and people are paying attention.”</p>
<h4 class="editorialSubhed">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Is the home a workplace?</h4>

	</h4>
<p>By its nature, domestic work can be informal.</p>
<p>With no human resources department at hand, families will often ask friends what they pay their nannies or Google how to hire a housekeeper, said Stacy Kono, director of Hand in Hand, a national group representing employers of domestic workers.</p>
<p>“In many ways, the first barrier we often face is people don’t even realize they’re employers,” she said.</p>
<p>While some employers do not provide benefits or pay fair wages, Kono said many want to do the right thing for those who work in their homes.</p>
<p>“We haven’t seen organized employer opposition to the efforts,” she said of the new laws. “It’s generally been employers supporting the efforts.</p>
<p>“We want to shift the mindset so that people do recognize domestic work as protected labor that is work like any other work, and for that reason, the home is a workplace.”</p>
<p>Whether private homes should be considered a workplace has been an ongoing debate in California.</p>
<p>Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2020 <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/SB-1257.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetoed legislation</a> that would have required domestic employers to comply with occupational health and safety rules. In his veto message, the governor said he agreed with the sponsor’s intent.</p>
<p>“However, new laws in this area must recognize that the places where people live cannot be treated in the exact same manner as a traditional workplace or worksite from a regulatory perspective,” he wrote.</p>
<p>This September, <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billHistoryClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB1350" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newsom signed narrower legislation</a> extending safety standards for domestic workers employed by agencies.</p>
<p>“It isn’t everything we want. It doesn’t protect all of our base. But it is an important and historical step forward for California,” said Kimberly Alvarenga, director of the California Domestic Workers Coalition.</p>
<p>The University of California, Los Angeles estimates the state is home to more than <a href="https://losh.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/37/2020/06/Hidden-Work-Hidden-Pain.-Domestic-Workers-Report.-UCLA-LOSH-June-2020-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">350,000 domestic workers</a> employed in 2 million households. That includes an estimated 175,000 who work for agencies or services as opposed to private families, Alvarenga said.</p>
<p>California previously <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/DomesticWorkerBillOfRights.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extended overtime pay</a> to most domestic workers, but they still were not given the same health and safety protections as many other workers.</p>
<p>While the organization would like to see safety standards extended to all workers, Alvarenga said it’s currently focused on enforcement and education around the new law.</p>
<p>“This work is not being valued. It’s not being recognized,” she said. “They’re not asking for something special. They’re just asking for basic protections.”</p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce for The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parents in Virginia who don’t vaccinate their young children,</span> <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/richmond/2024/11/20/school-vaccine-exemptions-virginia" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a percentage that’s grown over the past decade</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, are making a risky bet with their kids’ health – and maybe even their lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a dangerous trend, perhaps attributable to the bleats of vaccine deniers who elevate misinformation, emotion and quackery over science.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some adults may be unaware of past scourges where children frequently became ill before vaccines were available. Many decades ago, polio sufferers had to depend on metal apparatuses called</span> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/10/25/1047691984/decades-after-polio-martha-is-among-the-last-to-still-rely-on-an-iron-lung-to-br" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">iron lungs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> just to help them breathe. Today, because of vaccines, polio is</span> <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/An-important-moment-in-the-fight-against-polio" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly eradicated worldwide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and iron lungs are primarily an eerie part of my youthful subconscious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vaccines work. More Americans should know that fact. Refusal of vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic,</span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0250123" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">often along partisan lines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, makes the current challenge tougher.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.axios.com/local/richmond/2024/11/20/school-vaccine-exemptions-virginia" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Axios Richmond</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently noted the number of parents in Virginia now opting out of getting their children vaccinated. It reported the percentage of kindergartners with vaccine exemptions has quadrupled over the past 10 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CDC statistics show 2.4%, or about 2,050 children out of 85,374 kindergartners in the commonwealth, had either medical or nonmedical vaccine exemptions in the 2023-24 school year. In 2014, that figure was 0.6%. (Nonmedical exemptions often involve religious reasons, though I suspect parents often cite them merely to refuse the injections.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s rate of exemptions was still below the national average of 3.3%, Axios reported. Parents nationwide also overwhelmingly support childhood vaccinations,</span> <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2023/05/16/americans-largely-positive-views-of-childhood-vaccines-hold-steady/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to the Pew Research Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those positive facts could be altered, however, because</span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/12/03/nx-s1-5198506/rfk-jr-anti-vaccine-chd-lawsuits" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is set to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under President-elect Donald Trump. Kennedy is a prominent anti-vaxxer and has been criticized as a</span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/10/rfk-jr-faces-trouble-in-the-senate-00193579" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“denier of science.”</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s another example of Trump</span><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-trumps-washington/the-scandal-of-trumps-cabinet-picks-isnt-just-their-personal-failings" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">using his picks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to undermine the health and safety of everyday Americans, while at the same time awarding his sycophants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vaccine refusal disturbs epidemiologists like Carrie Dolan, an associate professor of kinesiology and public health at William &amp; Mary. She said the benefits of vaccines far, far outweigh the risks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They’re effective,” Dolan told me. “They’re safe. They’re reliable.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When people aren’t vaccinated, she added, the chance for an infected person to spread a contagious disease to someone else increases. Getting a little wonky – at least for me – Dolan explained something called an</span><a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/25/1/17-1901_article" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“R0,” or basic reproduction number</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Measles has an R0 of 12 to 18, meaning one infected person could spread it to up to 18 others in an unvaccinated population, she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Before the vaccine, measles caused widespread outbreaks, often leading to complications like pneumonia and, in rare cases, brain swelling,” Dolan said by email. “Thanks to vaccination programs, measles cases have been drastically reduced worldwide. However, when vaccination rates drop, outbreaks can quickly return.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whooping cough, or pertussis, has an R0 of 12–17 and is especially dangerous for infants, who can have severe coughing fits that make breathing difficult. “Vaccination has greatly reduced the risk,” she said, but without it, “this disease could spread more easily, putting vulnerable groups like babies and the elderly at greater risk.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vaccinations also help protect children who, paradoxically, can’t take them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. John Harrington, a general pediatrician at Children’s Hospital of The King’s Daughters in Norfolk, told me that young oncology patients chronically on steroids are “unlikely to mount a response” to certain vaccines. In those instances, vaccines could be harmful.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_41481" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:150px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/13/vaccines-protect-your-children-and-others-too/harringtonjohn2015/" rel="attachment wp-att-41481"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-41481" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/HarringtonJohn2015-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Dr. John Harrington, general pediatrician at Children&#8217;s Hospital of The King&#8217;s Daughters in Norfolk, said vaccine-hesitant parents are often willing to listen to their doctors&#8217; advice about whether to get their children vaccinated.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The assumption is if everybody else is vaccinated, that protects” children with serious health problems, Harrington said. (This is also another way to define</span><a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22599-herd-immunity" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">herd immunity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vaccine-hesitant parents tend to have heard or seen things on the internet or social media that influence their thinking, he said. Many, though, are willing to listen to their pediatricians or primary care physicians about the issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, vaccines are overwhelmingly safe and effective, even if the total risk can’t be ruled out. Children are more likely to be protected, though, from diseases than if they hadn’t gotten the shots, Harrington said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Erica Hunter, immunization data and outreach manager in the Virginia Department of Health,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">told me the recent trends on refusing vaccines for young children “certainly raise concerns.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most Virginians do vaccinate their children,” Hunter said, adding she had no information on what role vaccine denialism might have in contributing to the statistics. “We just try to provide the best and most accurate information we can.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She noted the state’s Vaccines for Children program provides free immunizations and has done so for decades. “These viruses have not gone anywhere,” Hunter said. “They can resurface when vaccination rates decline.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Non-COVID outbreaks have occurred in Virginia from time to time. For example, since June 2022,</span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/surveillance-and-investigation/meningococcal-disease-outbreak-response/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">41 confirmed cases</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of meningococcal disease associated with an outbreak of a specific bacterium have occurred. It killed eight people of all ages.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nationwide, 283 measles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cases were reported this year through Dec. 5, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. Virginia had one reported case. Some 89% of the total cases were listed as unvaccinated or unknown.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not vaccinating children exasperates Dolan, the Willam &amp; Mary epidemiologist. She helps run an immunization project in Kenya, and this summer, she had just 14 vaccines to fight HPV.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some 300 girls sought the precious supply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In America, she said, we forget how lucky we are to have access to vaccines. “It’s been weaponized politically,” Dolan noted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please vaccinate your children. Your actions will protect them and may help others, too.</span></p>

(Courtesy of SDI Productions via Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/eo/EO-43---FINAL.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Executive Order 43 </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Thursday, which enacted a multi-pronged effort to address the impact of social media use on children’s mental health. The order established the Reclaiming Childhood Task Force to counter “addictive” social media use in youth and “create opportunities for cultural change.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The directive came months after the governor issued an executive order requiring the Department of Education to draft guidelines for cell phone-free schools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest order will mobilize state agencies to provide resources for parents, educators and healthcare providers to “combat the negative effects of excessive social media use.” It will also spur the agencies to create a toolkit with training materials and educational resources that will “offer educational and technical support” for health care providers and families to promote healthy social media use. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The scope of this challenge is going to require all of us, private sector, non-profit organizations and (the) government to support parents as they work to improve their children’s mental health,” Youngkin said in a release. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The task force will convene parents, youth, teachers, mental health experts, faith leaders, public safety officials and private sector technology experts to compile recommendations to share with Youngkin and members of the General Assembly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secretary of Health and Human Resources Janet Kelly noted the “addictive” nature of social media algorithms. The order cites Pew Research Center data showing 95% of U.S. teens use social media, and Gallup studies showing that youth use social media frequently and that 41% of high-frequency social media users report having “poor or very poor mental health,” with the percentage higher for teens who use it with low parental monitoring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Reclaiming Childhood Task Force will drive collaboration and innovation to address this mental health crisis and ensure our children grow up with the tools they need to thrive,” Kelly wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the cell phone-free guidelines for schools were being developed this past summer, academics noted the adjustment period they would require for students who have grown accustomed to frequent cell phone and social media use. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Naff, a Virginia Commonwealth University professor with a concentration in educational psychology, said in an interview at the time that he hoped the policy would help youth become more intentional about when they use their devices outside of school hours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s human nature to crave social interaction, Naff said, “whether we realize it or not” and  social media interactions are less personal than face-to-face interactions. He also noted how research points to increased device use and social media access contributes to anxiety and other mental health issues in today’s younger generations  — research also cited in Yougnkin’s order. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naff also noted still-emerging research on the effect the COVID-19 pandemic had on kids. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the virus first plagued the globe roughly four years ago and triggered  shutdowns of public life, education  pivoted to virtual learning for a time. This meant youth were on screens more than ever before while missing out on the personal interactions of in-person learning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s kind of hard to distinguish the COVID mental health impacts from the cell phone use mental health impacts, because they&#8217;re overlapping. When schools were closed, our world just moved online,” Naff said. “So then, adolescents are using devices and social media more frequently at that point. Someone could argue that the mental health impacts were related to COVID — which they were —  but you could also say ‘maybe at least a portion of the mental health impacts were that we&#8217;re just on our devices constantly, like to the point of addiction.’”</span></p>

<p>The girl’s teacher told her to keep moving without her shoe, then grabbed it herself and gave it back to the girl when the class settled into their designated safe location.</p>
<p>The girl recently recounted the story of losing her shoe during a morning car ride to school. It was just one of several times the girl or her siblings described what they were supposed to do – run “over to that fence,” “across that field” or “into those woods” – if an intruder enters their school building.</p>
<p>The reason I know this story is because the girl is my daughter.</p>
<p>In the quarter-century since the <a href="https://vault.fbi.gov/Columbine%20High%20School%20" target="_blank">Columbine High School massacre</a> of April 20, 1999, a whole generation of children, including my own, have lived under the threat of school-related gun violence. More recent tragedies, like those occurring at <a href="https://vault.fbi.gov/sandy-hook-elementary-school-shooting" target="_blank">Sandy Hook Elementary School</a> in Connecticut in December 2012 and <a href="https://portal.cops.usdoj.gov/resourcecenter/Home.aspx?item=cops-r1141" target="_blank">Robb Elementary School</a> in Texas in May 2022, reveal the persistent nature of this threat.</p>
<p>Regrettably, gun violence stands at the backdrop of all contemporary American education. As such, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/02/when-schools-simulate-mass-shootings/385642/" target="_blank">active shooter and intruder drills have become standard fare</a>, not only for my children but for nearly all American schoolchildren.</p>
<p>I am concerned about the fact that preparedness exercises – such as the one in which my daughter temporarily lost her shoe – sometimes <a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/146/3/e2020015503/36710/Participation-of-Children-and-Adolescents-in-Live" target="_blank">cause students harm</a>. For example, a recent study showed that active intruder drills can result in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2018.0120" target="_blank">distress and anxiety</a> for students. In another case, one of these drills led to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/03/active-shooter-drills-erika-christakis/580426/" target="_blank">hysteria and a stampede</a> in a school in Florida as students attempted to flee their faux intruder. Students and teachers alike experienced terror at the pronouncement of a real threat, that it was “<a href="https://www.today.com/parents/active-shooter-drill-leaves-students-teachers-shaken-t144748" target="_blank">not a drill</a>.”</p>
<p>As a <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aREmyhsAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">researcher in developmental and educational psychology</a> – and as a <a href="https://www.clemson.edu/education/about/directory/profile.html?userid=lrapa" target="_blank">faculty member who trains future teachers</a> – I understand the need for schools to ensure the safety and security of <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=372" target="_blank">the nation’s 55 million school-age youth</a>. But might there be a better way to protect children in the post-Columbine era?</p>
<p>I’m not the only one raising this question. A new initiative by the <a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/the-impact-of-active-shooter-drills-on-student-health-and-wellbeing" target="_blank">National Academies</a> has been initiated to assess the effects of active shooter drills on student health and well-being and to determine best practices in preparing schools to respond to threats of violence.</p>
<h2>A look at the trends</h2>
<p>To gain insight on the prevalence of school-related gun violence, my colleagues and I conducted a study of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2023-064311" target="_blank">school shootings and school mass shootings</a> that took place in America’s K-12 schools from 1997 through 2022. We used two public databases to count <a href="https://www.chds.us/sssc/data-map/" target="_blank">school shootings</a> and <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/" target="_blank">school mass shootings</a> that occurred each school year.</p>
<p>School shootings in our study were defined as “each and every instance a gun is brandished, is fired, or a bullet hits school property for any reason, regardless of the number of victims, time of day, or day of week.” School mass shootings were defined as those that happened at a K-12 school site and met the federal definition of a mass shooting in place at the time of the shooting: four or more victims killed, up to December 2012, or three or more victims killed, from January 2013 onward.</p>
<p>During the 25 school years we examined, 1997-2022, there were 1,453 school shootings. More than half of those, 794, occurred in the last five years, 2017-2022. Our analyses revealed a <a href="https://publications.aap.org/view-large/figure/13881403/peds.2023-064311f1.tif" target="_blank">sharp increase in school shootings after 2017</a>, with the number of shootings jumping from a then-record high of 89 in the 2017-2018 school year to 328 in the 2021-2022 school year.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" id="TQnEX" class="tc-infographic-datawrapper" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/TQnEX/1/" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>While the number of school shootings has increased dramatically in recent years, the number of school mass shootings has not increased at the same rate – though they have become more deadly. In total, 11 school mass shootings occurred across the 1997-1998 to 2021-2022 school years, with 126 fatalities and 122 injuries sustained overall. Five of those school mass shootings occurred in the 1997-2012 school years, while six occurred in the 2012-2022 school years. Nevertheless, the fatality rate nearly doubled in the last decade, rising from 7.6 deaths per mass shooting event from 1997-2012 to 14 deaths per school mass shooting event from 2012-2022.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" id="jSGzS" class="tc-infographic-datawrapper" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/jSGzS/1/" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>Efforts to maximize student safety are paramount. To be sure, I want my children’s schools to do their utmost to protect their students. However, many current measures designed to keep students safe – like the appointment of <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/docs/wh_now_is_the_time_full.pdf" target="_blank">school resource officers</a> – have <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/2372966X.2020.1846458" target="_blank">not been proven to prevent school shootings</a> or <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2018.12.006" target="_blank">lessen the severity of school shootings</a>, in terms of injury or fatality, when they do occur.</p>
<p>Gun injury is now the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMc2201761" target="_blank">leading cause of death for children and adolescents</a> in the United States. While school shootings and school mass shootings represent only a portion of gun injuries sustained by school-age youth, gun violence – including school-related gun violence – is a <a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/sites/default/files/2024-01/2023-june-cgvs-u-s-gun-violence-in-2021-v3.pdf" target="_blank">public health crisis</a>. As such, a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMsb1302631" target="_blank">public health approach</a> is merited.</p>
<h2>Relying on research</h2>
<p>I see at least three ways that schools and communities can work to lessen gun violence occurring in and around schools:</p>
<p><strong>1: Educate parents and families about safe gun storage.</strong></p>
<p>Educators and community health care providers – including <a href="https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2023-065281" target="_blank">pediatricians, primary care physicians and mental health clinicians</a> – can engage in efforts to counsel families on <a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/at-home/Pages/Handguns-in-the-Home.aspx" target="_blank">safe firearm storage</a>. Health care providers can also work to understand <a href="https://www.aap.org/en/advocacy/state-advocacy/extreme-risk-protection-orders-erpo-or-red-flag-laws" target="_blank">Extreme Risk Protection Order laws</a> in their states; such laws allow them to coordinate with law enforcement to remove firearms from a home environment when an individual is identified who may be at risk of doing harm to self or others.</p>
<p><strong>2: Utilize evidence-based, schoolwide approaches to promote school safety.</strong></p>
<p>School safety can be supported through evidence-based frameworks, such as <a href="https://www.pbis.org/" target="_blank">Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports</a>, which aims to improve school-based practices affecting student outcomes. This positive approach can be used to proactively address students’ <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/pits.22614" target="_blank">social, emotional and behavioral needs</a> and promote school safety. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2012-0243" target="_blank">This approach</a> also allows school personnel to monitor and manage students’ mental health needs, attend to schoolwide behavior and discipline issues, and foster a safe school climate. Accordingly, it may help reduce potential threats of gun violence perpetrated by students.</p>
<p><strong>3: Support legislation and regulations for gun safety and violence prevention.</strong></p>
<p>Community members, including parents and teachers, and policymakers can support <a href="https://efsgv.org/wp-content/uploads/PublicHealthApproachToGVP-EFSGV.pdf" target="_blank">legislation for gun safety, evidence-based violence prevention practices and regulations</a>. For example, child access protection laws – laws that impose penalties on gun owners if children access firearms – decrease <a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/wjps-2020-000223" target="_blank">firearm injuries</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1086/699657" target="_blank">gun carrying</a>, and thus help promote safety in and around schools.</p>

<h2>Hope for the future</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://nij.ojp.gov/funding/opportunities/o-nij-2024-171966" target="_blank">National Institute for Justice</a> has made it a priority to support new research to study firearm violence and mass shootings, including research on the effectiveness of school campaigns to educate families on safe gun storage.</p>
<p>These efforts will provide important new insights about how to <a href="https://everytownresearch.org/report/how-to-stop-shootings-and-gun-violence-in-schools/#solutions-to-prevent-school-gun-violence" target="_blank">prevent school-related gun violence</a>.</p>
<p>While my own children and their millions of peers attending school in the United States today continue to endure the threat of school-related gun violence, I hope future generations will experience school without having to worry about someone showing up at their school with a gun.</p>

Tim Walz and his wife Gwen shared that they had children through a less commonly known procedure.</p>
<p>Since Vice President Kamala Harris selected Gov. Walz as her running mate, he has discussed his family’s fertility journey during speeches in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/wP5qOjgY88M?feature=shared&amp;t=4386" target="_blank">Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?537741-1/democratic-vice-presidential-nominee-tim-walz-campaigns-omaha-nebraska" target="_blank">Nebraska</a> and mostly recently at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/former-high-school-football-coach-rises-running-mate-walz-accepts-vp-nomination" target="_blank">Illinois</a>.</p>
<p>“It took Gwen and I years,” Walz <a href="https://youtu.be/Mf0u5MJEjhw?feature=shared&amp;t=468" target="_blank">said</a> on last Wednesday night. “But we had access to fertility treatments. And when our daughter was born, we named her Hope.”</p>
<p>This week, the Walzes clarified that they conceived via intrauterine insemination, not in vitro fertilization.</p>
<p>IUI involves injecting sperm into the uterus <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/gynecology-obstetrics/specialty-areas/fertility-center/infertility-services/intrauterine-insemination" target="_blank">during</a> or <a href="https://www.bcm.edu/healthcare/specialties/obstetrics-and-gynecology/reproductive-endocrinology-and-infertility/intrauterine-insemination-iui" target="_blank">just before</a> ovulation to increase the chances of fertilization and pregnancy.</p>
<p>“Our fertility journey was an incredibly personal and difficult experience. Like so many who have experienced these challenges, we kept it largely to ourselves at the time — not even sharing the details with our wonderful and close family,” Gwen Walz said in a statement provided to States Newsroom. “The only person who knew in detail what we were going through was our next door neighbor. She was a nurse and helped me with the shots I needed as part of the IUI process.”</p>
<p>During IVF, eggs and sperm are combined in a lab and an embryo is inserted into the uterus. IVF has been drawn into national reproductive rights debates for much of this year, and Walz has been talking about it on the campaign trail while discussing his family’s fertility journey.</p>
<p>U.S. Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, the Republican vice presidential candidate, accused his opponent of lying about how he and his wife had children. In an Aug. 20 social media post, Vance <a href="https://x.com/JDVance/status/1825905977008533700" target="_blank">said</a>, “Today it came out that Tim Walz had lied about having a family via IVF. Who lies about something like that?” He also shared a clip of Walz talking about fertility care and families on <a href="https://x.com/KamalaHQ/status/1821904074649883007" target="_blank">Aug. 9</a>.</p>
<p>In a statement, Harris-Walz campaign spokesperson Mia Ehrenberg said, “Governor Walz talks how normal people talk. He was using commonly understood shorthand for fertility treatments.”</p>
<p>Experts said that patients commonly get IUI and IVF confused or refer to them interchangeably, given that in vitro fertilization is more popular.</p>
<p>“There’s such a huge sort of alphabet soup that comes along with assisted reproduction,” said Kimberly Mutcherson, a professor at Rutgers University-Camden who specializes in reproductive justice, bioethics, and family and health law.</p>
<p>Dr. Kelly Acharya, a fertility physician and assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Duke University, said patients’ partners are more likely to mix up the two treatments or rope related procedures into IVF.</p>
<p>“A lot of times in my line of work, I see people that are referring to other things, like egg freezing, they call that IVF, even though technically it’s not,” she said.</p>
<p>Both Acharya and Mutcherson said the main differences between IUI and IVF are where fertilization occurs, the price and effectiveness.</p>
<p>“Intrauterine insemination or IUI is basically less invasive. It’s typically less expensive, and it is often what is recommended as the first thing that somebody tries,” Acharya said. “When somebody has mild forms of infertility, like if there are mild differences in the semen analysis, or if somebody is young and they’re not quite sure why they’re not getting pregnant, then often a provider will recommend that they do IUI as a first step to help things along.”</p>
<p>IUI is performed during or near ovulation, and it typically takes 10 minutes and is a minor procedure, according to Acharya. The price of IUI varies, depending on insurance coverage, from a <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/pregnancy/fertility-treatments/what-iui" target="_blank">few hundred dollars</a> to <a href="https://www.fertilityiq.com/fertilityiq/iui-or-artificial-insemination/the-cost-of-iui" target="_blank">several thousand dollars</a>.</p>
<p>Mutcherson noted that some people also confuse IUI with intracervical insemination, or ICI. During this method, the sperm is inserted into the cervix — the passageway to the uterus, according to the <a href="https://carolinasfertilityinstitute.com/the-difference-between-ici-and-iui/#:~:text=Intracervical%20insemination%20is%20when%20sperm,increase%20the%20chances%20of%20conception." target="_blank">Carolina Fertility Institute</a>.</p>
<p>Doctors often recommend ICI or IUI as a precursor to IVF, which Mutcherson said can cost $12,000 to $15,000 per cycle — or more with grading and genetic testing. During IVF, “fertilization happens outside of the body,” Acharya said.</p>
<p>IUI, the treatment the Walz family used to have children, is not under the same scrutiny as IVF, which has faced opposition from anti-abortion hardliners. “It sometimes is listed as being less controversial than IVF, because it’s just helping along the natural process of getting the sperm inside the uterus and then expecting fertilization to happen inside the body,” Acharya said.</p>
<p>But Mutcherson said that could also be attributed to the fact that it’s a less well-known procedure.</p>
<p>“I think the really big issue when it comes to something like artificial insemination is that it allows people to create families that a lot of these folks — unfortunately, in the Republican Party and folks who are evangelicals — don’t approve of: families with two moms, families with two dads, single women who are having children,” she said.</p>
<p>Price is a significant barrier to fertility care. Only 21 states require insurers to cover fertility procedures, <a href="https://stateline.org/2023/07/28/fertility-health-coverage-is-still-hard-to-come-by-in-many-states/" target="_blank">Stateline</a> reported. A successful birth via IVF can cost more than $60,000, according to a 2022 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9351254/" target="_blank">study</a> published in Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology.</p>
<p>“It requires a lot more physically, emotionally and economically to be able to do IVF,” Mutcherson, who conceived via IUI, said.</p>
<p>IVF became a national reproductive rights issue in February after the Alabama Supreme Court likened frozen embryos to “unborn children” in a ruling. The plaintiffs were couples who sued for damages under an 1872 wrongful death of children law after their embryos were accidentally destroyed in a clinic four years ago, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/alabama-supreme-court-ruling-could-end-ivf-treatments-state" target="_blank">Alabama Reflector</a> reported. Alabama’s fertility clinics temporarily closed after the ruling until Republican Gov. Kay Ivey signed legislation in March shielding providers from criminal and civil liabilities, the <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/alabama-passed-new-ivf-law-questions-remain" target="_blank">Reflector</a> reported.</p>
<p>But there’s still <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/women-undergoing-ivf-alabama-face-uncertainty-amid-legal-battle" target="_blank">uncertainty</a> over whether embryos and fetuses in the state have legal “personhood” rights. Despite the new law, two fertility clinics in Alabama announced <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/alabama-clinic-end-ivf-services-light-litigation-concerns" target="_blank">plans to close</a> by the end of the year, though <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/huntsville-ivf-clinic-close-january-denies-link-alabama-supreme-court-ruling" target="_blank">one denied the decision was related</a> to the  ruling.</p>
<p>Since the Alabama ruling, polls have shown most Americans back IVF. A survey conducted by <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/05/13/americans-overwhelmingly-say-access-to-ivf-is-a-good-thing/#:~:text=An%20April%20Pew%20Research%20Center,%2C%20while%2022%25%20are%20unsure." target="_blank">Pew</a> in April found that 70% said IVF is a good thing, while 22% said they’re not sure, and 8% said it’s a bad thing. Awareness is growing, too: <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/09/14/a-growing-share-of-americans-say-theyve-had-fertility-treatments-or-know-someone-who-has/" target="_blank">42% of Americans said they or someone they know have had fertility treatments</a>, according to a 2023 Pew poll.</p>
<p>Nationally, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-comes-out-against-alabama-ivf-ruling-national-republicans-scramble-distance" target="_blank">Republicans</a> and <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-republicans-reject-democrats-bill-ivf-protections" target="_blank">Democrats</a> condemned the Alabama Supreme Court’s ruling and filed bills seeking to protect IVF this spring, though all of them stalled in Congress. The Republican Party’s <a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/2024-republican-party-platform?emci=e10b129f-7f4f-ef11-86c3-6045bdd9e096&amp;emdi=1abd2530-f54f-ef11-86c3-6045bdee6681&amp;ceid=526826#:~:text=We%20proudly%20stand%20for%20families,pass%20Laws%20protecting%20those%20Rights." target="_blank">platform</a> featured support for both IVF and the equal protections clause of the 14th Amendment, which <a href="https://www.heritage.org/life/report/can-the-fourteenth-amendment-be-used-protect-human-life-birth?emci=e10b129f-7f4f-ef11-86c3-6045bdd9e096&amp;emdi=1abd2530-f54f-ef11-86c3-6045bdee6681&amp;ceid=526826" target="_blank">conservative legal scholars</a> argue can be used to solidify “<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/potential-threats-ivf-push-political-novices-election-year-advocacy" target="_blank">fetal personhood</a>” along with effectively banning abortion. And in June, the <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/republican-ivf-bill-fails-us-senate" target="_blank">Southern Baptist Convention</a> — the largest Protestant denomination in the U.S. — voted to condemn IVF, particularly the destruction or donation of embryos that are not implanted in the uterus.</p>
<p>“People who believe that life begins at conception, people who believe that an embryo is no different than a 5-year-old sitting in a kindergarten classroom, those are people who have really deep and abiding principles related to procedures like in vitro fertilization,” Mutcherson said.</p>
<p>The number of babies born in the U.S. using assisted reproductive technology has increased in recent years: 2.5% of newborns were conceived using fertility treatments in 2022, according to the <a href="https://www.asrm.org/news-and-events/asrm-news/press-releasesbulletins/ivf-assisted-pregnancies-constitute/#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20the%20number%20of,result%20of%20successful%20ART%20cycles" target="_blank">American Society of Reproductive Medicine</a>. That’s up from <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/03/13/fact-sheet-in-vitro-fertilization-ivf-use-across-united-states.html" target="_blank">2.3% in 2021</a>, per federal data.</p>

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris released her first detailed economic policy proposal Friday, laying out how she’d like to ease rent increases, boost first-time home buyers, end grocery price gouging and bolster the child tax credit.</p>
<p>The Harris campaign’s announcement said the proposals, most of which would need approval from Congress, would “address some of the sharpest pain points American families are confronting and bolster their financial security.”</p>
<p>“Vice President Harris has made clear that building up the middle class will be a defining goal of her presidency,” the announcement stated. “She will deliver for Americans who are demanding a new way forward towards a future that lifts up all Americans so that they can not just get by, but get ahead.”</p>
<p>Harris <a href="https://ncnewsline.com/briefs/harris-walz-campaign-launches-offices-in-rural-nc/" target="_blank">will campaign later Friday</a> in Raleigh, North Carolina, ahead of the Democratic National Convention beginning Monday, as both campaigns focus on a handful of swing states.</p>
<p>The economic plank of her plan seeks to curb the expenses that often come with building a family by expanding the child tax credit to the $3,600 per child that existed under the COVID-19 spending law that Democrats approved during the first months of the Biden administration. That provision has since expired.</p>
<p>Harris proposes increasing that credit to $6,000 for families that have children under a year old.</p>
<p>The maximum child tax credit is currently $2,000 per qualifying child for an individual making less than $200,000 annually or a couple filing jointly that makes less than $400,000.</p>
<p>There are several <a href="https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/individuals/child-tax-credit" target="_blank">qualifications</a> to receive a child tax credit, including that the child was under the age of 17 at the end of the year and that they are a U.S. citizen, U.S. national or U.S. resident alien.</p>
<p>The Earned Income Tax Credit, or EITC, would expand “to cover individuals and couples in lower-income jobs who aren’t raising a child in their home, cutting their taxes by up to $1,500,” according to the announcement.</p>
<p>Harris also pledged that no one making less than $400,000 annually would see an increase in new taxes, matching a promise that President Joe Biden has made throughout his time in the Oval Office.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Grocery price gouging</h4>

	
<p>The proposal says that if elected, Harris would seek Congress’ passage of a law to implement a ban on price gouging on groceries and other food as well as establish “rules of the road” that would bar companies from “excessive profits on food and groceries.”</p>
<p>Rising prices on groceries have been a major pain point for consumers, and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Thursday <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/%C2%A0im-entitled-personal-attacks-against-harris-trump-asserts" target="_blank">made the case</a> that prices are too high for American families, laying the blame for inflation at the feet of the Biden-Harris administration and insisting he’s the only person able to get prices back down.</p>
<p>To implement her grocery gouging plan, Harris proposes providing the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general with new authority to “impose strict new penalties” on companies that price gouge.</p>
<p>“Many big grocery chains that have seen production costs level off have nevertheless kept prices high and have seen their highest profits in two decades,” the proposal states. “While some food companies have passed along these savings, others still have not.”</p>
<p>“Price fluctuations are normal in free markets, but Vice President Harris recognizes there is a big difference between fair pricing and the excessive prices unrelated to the costs of doing business that Americans have seen in the food and grocery industry,” it says.</p>
<p>A Harris administration would also address “unfair mergers and acquisitions” that can contribute to higher prices on food and groceries, the Harris plan says.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Expansion of drug pricing controls</h4>

	
<p>Harris hopes to expand a price ceiling for insulin that Democrats established in their signature climate change, health care and tax package known as the Inflation Reduction Act or IRA.</p>
<p>That section of the law, which only applies to Medicare,<a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/bd5568fa0e8a59c2225b2e0b93d5ae5b/aspe-insulin-affordibility-datapoint.pdf" target="_blank"> caps the price of insulin</a> per month at $35. Harris’ proposal looks to expand that to “everyone” while setting the maximum out-of-pocket cost for other prescriptions at $2,000.</p>
<p>The plan would increase the pace that Medicare is allowed to negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies.</p>
<p>“Vice President Harris and Governor Walz will also work with states to cancel medical debt for millions of Americans and to help them avoid accumulating such debt in the future, because no one should go bankrupt just because they had the misfortune of becoming sick or hurt,” according to the proposal.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Boosting home building</h4>

	
<p>The economic plan released Friday includes numerous changes that could ease the increasing costs of renting and purchasing a home for the first time.</p>
<p>Harris would seek to bolster home building throughout the country by 3 million units during the next four years by taking “down barriers that stand in the way of building new housing, including at the state and local levels.”</p>
<p>A Harris-Walz administration would call on Congress to create a tax incentive for construction companies that build “starter homes” that would then be sold to first-time home buyers.</p>
<p>The announcement says the new tax incentive would “complement the Neighborhood Homes Tax Credit that encourages investment in homes that would otherwise be too costly or difficult to develop or rehabilitate.”</p>
<p>Harris’ proposal calls for up to $25,000 in down payment assistance for first-time home buyers who have paid rent on time for at least two years.</p>
<p>The proposal says that if implemented, the down payment financial aid would go out to more than 4 million people over four years.</p>
<p>Harris also pressed lawmakers to address the rising cost of rent by approving two bills that have been introduced in Congress, but haven’t gained any ground.</p>
<p>One <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/2224" target="_blank">bill</a> would reduce the incentive for large firms to buy more than 50 single-family rental homes. The legislation would bar those companies “from deducting interest or depreciation on those properties,” according to a <a href="https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/sherrod-brown-colleagues-bill-crack-down-corporate-investors-buy-local-homes-housing-prices" target="_blank">summary</a> of the measure.</p>
<p>The second rental proposal asks Congress to approve a <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/3692" target="_blank">bill</a> that would “crack down on companies that help landlords increase rents in already high-priced markets,” according to a <a href="https://www.welch.senate.gov/welch-and-wyden-introduce-legislation-to-crack-down-on-companies-that-inflate-rents-with-price-fixing-algorithms/" target="_blank">summary</a>.</p>
<p>“Vice President Harris knows that our nation’s housing affordability crisis is making it hard for tens of millions of Americans to make ends meet while putting the American Dream of homeownership out of reach for too many working families,” the proposal states. “That’s why she will launch an urgent and comprehensive four-year plan to lower housing costs for working families and end America’s housing shortage.”</p>
<p>The Harris-Walz campaign also announced Friday that the ticket would<a href="https://penncapital-star.com/election-2024/harris-and-walz-to-kick-off-pennsylvania-bus-tour-in-pittsburgh/" data-type="link" data-id="https://penncapital-star.com/election-2024/harris-and-walz-to-kick-off-pennsylvania-bus-tour-in-pittsburgh/" target="_blank"> hold a bus tour</a> in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and the surrounding area on Sunday, just ahead of the Democratic National Convention.</p>
<p>Harris; her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz; second gentleman Doug Emhoff; and first lady of Minnesota Gwen Walz will all participate in the tour of Allegheny and Beaver counties.</p>

That hasn’t stopped Congress, state legislatures, and the U.S. surgeon general from moving ahead with age bans and warning labels for YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram.</p>
<p>But the emphasis on fears about social media may cause policymakers to miss the mental health benefits it provides teenagers, say researchers, pediatricians, and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.</p>
<p>In June, Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, the nation’s top doctor, called for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/opinion/social-media-health-warning.html" target="_blank">warning labels</a> on social media platforms. The Senate approved the bipartisan <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/1409/text" target="_blank">Kids Online Safety Act</a> and a companion bill, the Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act, on July 30. And at least 30 states have <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/technology-and-communication/social-media-and-children-2024-legislation" target="_blank">pending legislation</a> relating to children and social media — from age bans and parental consent requirements to new digital and media literacy courses for K-12 students.</p>
<p>Most research suggests that some features of social media can be harmful: Algorithmically driven content can distort reality and spread misinformation; incessant notifications distract attention and disrupt sleep; and the anonymity that sites offer can embolden cyberbullies.</p>
<p>But social media can also be helpful for some young people, said <a href="https://www.wcwonline.org/Active-Researchers/linda-charmaraman-phd" target="_blank">Linda Charmaraman</a>, a research scientist and director of the Youth, Media &amp; Wellbeing Research Lab at Wellesley Centers for Women.</p>
<p>For children of color and LGBTQ+ young people — and others who may not see themselves represented broadly in society — social media can reduce isolation, according to Charmaraman’s research, which was published in the <a href="https://www.teensandtech.org/handbook/" target="_blank">Handbook of Adolescent Digital Media Use and Mental Health</a>. Age bans, she said, could disproportionately affect these marginalized groups, who also spend more time on the platforms.</p>
<p>“You think at first, ‘That’s terrible. We need to get them off it,’” she said. “But when you find out why they’re doing it, it’s because it helps bring them a sense of identity affirmation when there’s something lacking in real life.”</p>
<p>Arianne McCullough, 17, said she uses Instagram to connect with Black students like herself at Willamette University, where about 2% of students are Black.</p>
<p>“I know how isolating it can be feeling like you’re the only Black person, or any minority, in one space,” said McCullough, a freshman from Sacramento, California. “So, having someone I can text real quick and just say, ‘Let’s go hang out,’ is important.”</p>
<figure id="attachment_39593" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:225px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=39593" rel="attachment wp-att-39593"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-39593" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Social_Media_Bans.jpg-225x300.webp" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Social_Media_Bans.jpg-225x300.webp 225w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Social_Media_Bans.jpg-768x1024.webp 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Social_Media_Bans.jpg-1152x1536.webp 1152w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Social_Media_Bans.jpg-1536x2048.webp 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Social_Media_Bans.jpg-scaled.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Arianne McCullough (left) and her mother, Rayvn, of Sacramento, California, support social media legislation that would require platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok to be more transparent about the effects of their products on adolescent mental health.(Courtesy of Rayvn McCullough )</p></figure>
<p>After about a month at Willamette, which is in Salem, Oregon, McCullough assembled a social network with other Black students. “We’re all in a little group chat,” she said. “We talk and make plans.”</p>
<p>Social media hasn’t always been this useful for McCullough. After California schools closed during the pandemic, McCullough said, she stopped competing in soccer and track. She gained weight, she said, and her social media feed was constantly promoting at-home workouts and fasting diets.</p>
<p>“That’s where the body comparisons came in,” McCullough said, noting that she felt more irritable, distracted, and sad. “I was comparing myself to other people and things that I wasn’t self-conscious of before.”</p>
<p>When her mother tried to take away the smartphone, McCullough responded with an emotional outburst. “It was definitely addictive,” said her mother, Rayvn McCullough, 38, of Sacramento.</p>
<p>Arianne said she eventually felt happier and more like herself once she cut back on her use of social media.</p>
<p>But the fear of missing out eventually crept back in, Arianne said. “I missed seeing what my friends were doing and having easy, fast communication with them.”</p>
<p>For a decade before the covid-19 pandemic triggered what the American Academy of Pediatrics and other medical groups declared “<a href="https://www.aap.org/en/advocacy/child-and-adolescent-healthy-mental-development/aap-aacap-cha-declaration-of-a-national-emergency-in-child-and-adolescent-mental-health/" target="_blank">a national emergency in child and adolescent mental health</a>,” greater numbers of young people had been struggling with their mental health.</p>
<p>More young people were reporting feelings of hopelessness and sadness, as well as suicidal thoughts and behavior, according to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/index.htm" target="_blank">behavioral surveys</a> of students in grades nine through 12 conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>The greater use of immersive social media — like the never-ending scroll of videos on YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram — has been blamed for contributing to the crisis. But a committee of the national academies found that the relationship between social media and youth mental health is complex, with potential benefits as well as harms. Evidence of social media’s effect on child well-being remains limited, the <a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/27396/social-media-and-adolescent-health" target="_blank">committee reported this year</a>, while calling on the National Institutes of Health and other research groups to prioritize funding such studies.</p>
<p>In its report, the committee <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/morning-breakout/utah-law-requires-parental-permission-for-kids-to-use-social-media/" target="_blank">cited legislation</a> in Utah last year that places age and time limits on young people’s use of social media and warned that the policy could backfire.</p>
<p>“The legislators’ intent to protect time for sleep and schoolwork and to prevent at least some compulsive use could just as easily have unintended consequences, perhaps isolating young people from their support systems when they need them,” the report said.</p>
<p>Some states have considered policies that echo the national academies’ recommendations. For instance, <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/youngkin-recommends-tighter-parental-approvals-for-children-accessing-websites/">Virginia</a> and Maryland have adopted legislation that prohibits social media companies from selling or disclosing children’s personal data and requires platforms to default to privacy settings. Other states, including Colorado, Georgia, and West Virginia, have created curricula about the mental health effects of using social media for students in public schools, which the national academies also recommended.</p>

<p>The Kids Online Safety Act, which is now before the House of Representatives, would require parental consent for social media users younger than 13 and impose on companies a “duty of care” to protect users younger than 17 from harm, including anxiety, depression, and suicidal behavior. The second bill, the Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act, would ban platforms from targeting ads toward minors and collecting personal data on young people.</p>
<p>Attorneys general in California, Louisiana, Minnesota, and dozens of other <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/meta-sued-facebook-instagram-children-teens-harm-mental-health/" target="_blank">states have filed lawsuits</a> in federal and state courts alleging that Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, misled the public about the dangers of social media for young people and ignored the potential damage to their mental health.</p>
<p>Most social media companies require users to be at least 13, and the sites often include safety features, like blocking adults from messaging minors and defaulting minors’ accounts to privacy settings.</p>
<p>Despite existing policies, the Department of Justice says some social media companies don’t follow their own rules. On Aug. 2, it sued the parent company of TikTok for allegedly violating child privacy laws, saying the company knowingly let children younger than 13 on the platform, and collected data on their use.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/10/31/81-of-us-adults-versus-46-of-teens-favor-parental-consent-for-minors-to-use-social-media/" target="_blank">Surveys show</a> that age restrictions and parental consent requirements have popular support among adults.</p>
<p><a href="https://netchoice.org/" target="_blank">NetChoice</a>, an industry group whose members include Meta and Alphabet, which owns Google and YouTube, has filed <a href="https://netchoice.org/category/netchoice-cases/" target="_blank">lawsuits against at least eight states</a>, seeking to stop or overturn laws that impose age limits, verification requirements, and other policies aimed at protecting children.</p>
<p>Much of social media’s effect can depend on the content children consume and the features that keep them engaged with a platform, said <a href="https://midas.umich.edu/faculty-member/jenny-radesky/" target="_blank">Jenny Radesky</a>, a physician and a co-director of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ <a href="https://www.aap.org/en/patient-care/media-and-children/center-of-excellence-on-social-media-and-youth-mental-health/" target="_blank">Center of Excellence on Social Media and Youth Mental Health</a>.</p>
<p>Age bans, parental consent requirements, and other proposals may be well-meaning, she said, but they do not address what she considers to be “the real mechanism of harm”: business models that aim to keep young people posting, scrolling, and purchasing.</p>
<p>“We’ve kind of created this system that’s not well designed to promote youth mental health,” Radesky said. “It’s designed to make lots of money for these platforms.”</p>

(Photo by Jemal Countess/Getty Images for Community Change)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans and two independents blocked a bipartisan tax package Thursday that would have temporarily expanded the child tax credit and revived tax breaks for some business activities.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1182/vote_118_2_00230.htm" target="_blank">48-44</a> procedural vote to advance the package was largely viewed as a messaging exercise by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer ahead of the August recess and continued ramp up to the general election in November, when the presidency and control of Congress are on the line. Virginia Democratic U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine cast a &#8220;yea&#8217; vote to advance the measure, while Virginia&#8217;s U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, also a Democrat, did not vote.</p>
<p>The vote on the tax bill was the Senate’s last until it returns in September. The House left for August recess a full week ahead of the Senate.</p>
<p>During a post-vote press conference, Schumer said, “American families lost.”</p>
<p>“Today, Senate Republicans boldly told the American people we refuse to help you in 2024, and we want to be frank, Republicans voted no because of partisanship, not policy,” the New York Democrat said.</p>
<p>Not all Senate Republicans voted against the bill. Those who voted yes included: Sens. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, Josh Hawley of Missouri and Rick Scott of Florida.</p>
<p>Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, independents who generally caucus with the Democrats, voted no.</p>
<p>Schumer switched his vote from yes to no as a way to enter a motion to reconsider, a routine maneuver.</p>
<p>Eight senators did not vote Thursday, including Democrat John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, and Republicans Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, John Hoeven of North Dakota, Mitt Romney of Utah, Tim Scott of South Carolina, Warner, and Republican vice presidential candidate and Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance. <a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2024/07/16/sen-menendez-convicted-of-bribery-other-charges-in-corruption-trial/#:~:text=Bob%20Menendez%20was%20convicted%20Tuesday,%E2%80%9Cshocking%20levels%20of%20corruption.%E2%80%9D" target="_blank">Convicted felon</a> and soon-to-be <a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2024/07/23/sen-menendez-to-resign-ending-storied-career-capped-by-bribery-conviction/#:~:text=Gray%2FGetty%20Images)-,Sen.,was%20convicted%20on%20corruption%20charges." target="_blank">former</a> Democrat Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey also did not vote.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Show vote,’ Republicans say</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>A large swath of Senate Republicans, including their top tax writer, Mike Crapo of Idaho, the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Finance, has remained opposed to the legislation, which needed 60 votes to advance in the closely divided upper chamber.</p>
<p>Crapo panned the cloture vote on the floor ahead of time as a “doomed-to-fail show vote” that is “focused on election year messaging.”</p>
<p>“If the Democrats are serious about helping these working families, I’m ready to push for an extension of those changes beyond 2025. I’ve maintained a willingness to negotiate a bill that provides meaningful relief to Americans now,” Crapo said.</p>
<p>Taxation has risen on the list of campaign issues as the Trump-era tax law is set to expire at the end of 2025, teeing up a major debate for the next administration and Congress.</p>
<p>“I offered to make changes,” Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat and chair of the Senate Finance Committee, said on the floor ahead of the vote. “I met with a significant number of Senate Republicans personally.”</p>
<p>“This is a thoroughly bipartisan bill — 357 votes in the House of Representatives. Every Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee voted for this bill.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Child tax credit and the campaigns</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In a recent interview with news personality Megyn Kelly, Vance accused the likely Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, of being opposed to the child tax credit, a statement that has been <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/jul/30/jd-vance/kamala-harris-has-worked-to-expand-the-child-tax-c/" target="_blank">debunked</a>.</p>
<p>Democrats, including Harris, are <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/06/21/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-at-child-tax-credit-event/" target="_blank">on</a> <a href="https://x.com/VP/status/1767697362334400984" target="_blank">the</a> <a href="https://x.com/VP/status/1634690668164677633" target="_blank">record</a> advocating for a permanent expanded child tax credit similar to the pandemic-era version — a poverty reducer, according to census <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/working-papers/2022/demo/SEHSD-wp2022-24.html" target="_blank">data</a> — that eliminated the income requirement, raised the amount per child and provided the refund in monthly installments.</p>
<p>The Democratic Party immediately pounced on the absence of Vance from Thursday’s vote.</p>
<p>“When the American people vote in November, they’ll remember that when Vance had a chance to show up for working families, he was nowhere to be found,” Democratic National Committee spokesperson Aida Ross said in a statement after the vote.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Temporary tax cuts for families, businesses</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7024" target="_blank">bicameral, bipartisan package</a> brokered by Wyden and Missouri’s Rep. Jason Smith, chair of the GOP-led House Committee on Ways and Means, received overwhelming approval in the House in January in a  <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/202430" target="_blank">357-70</a> vote.</p>
<p>The lawmakers hailed their formula to pay for the bill by clawing back a fraud-ridden <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/understanding-the-employee-retention-credit-offset-in-the-bipartisan-tax-bill/" target="_blank">pandemic tax break</a>. However, the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget <a href="https://www.crfb.org/blogs/how-much-would-wyden-smith-tax-deal-cost" target="_blank">warned</a> that the policies “would add significantly to the already massive federal debt” if extended beyond their 2025 expiration dates.</p>
<p>The legislation would have <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/congress-looking-expanding-child-tax-credit-again-who-would-benefit" target="_blank">increased</a> the current $2,000 child tax credit through 2025 by adjusting it for inflation to $2,100 and raising the refundability limit — the actual amount families could see in their tax refunds — to $1,800 for tax year 2023, $1,900 for 2024 and $2,000 for 2025, up from the current $1,600 cap.</p>
<p>Additionally the bill includes a provision that would allow families to claim a previous year’s income, if higher than the current year, when calculating the tax credit — a measure that <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/expanded-child-tax-credit-stranded-us-senate-gop-comparisons-welfare" target="_blank">drew fierce opposition</a> from Senate Republicans who likened it to welfare.</p>
<p>The bill also would have temporarily restored business’ ability to fully expense domestic research and development as well as immediately deducting 100% of equipment purchases and other investments the same year of the transaction  — both <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-a-comparison-for-businesses" target="_blank">incentives</a> under the 2017 Trump tax law that have phased out or are phasing out incrementally.</p>
<p>Business owners, CEOs and a union official <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/business-owners-union-leader-urge-us-senate-move-ahead-soon-stalled-tax-package" target="_blank">urged</a> the Senate Finance Committee in March to move forward on the bill.</p>
<p>Also included in the legislation: increasing the amount of low-income housing tax credits, relieving double taxation for residents of Taiwan, and <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/one-year-after-ohio-train-derailment-congress-mulling-tax-break-relief-payments" target="_blank">tax exemption for relief payments</a> to victims of the massive 2023 train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio — though the IRS largely took care of this <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-many-payments-to-individuals-affected-by-east-palestine-train-disaster-are-tax-free-new-guidance-could-help-those-in-ohio-pennsylvania-west-virginia#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20%E2%80%94%20The%20Internal%20Revenue%20Service,%2C%20Ohio%2C%20are%20not%20taxable." target="_blank">in June</a>.</p>
<p>Supporters of the legislation range from the Business Roundtable, which represents American CEOs, to the Economic Security Project, an organization that advocates for increased tax credits and guaranteed basic income initiatives.</p>
<p>Anna Aurilio, senior campaign director for Economic Security Project Action, said in a statement following the vote that Republican senators were “selfishly picking politics over parents and brazenly disregarding this important opportunity to help families succeed right now.”</p>
<p>“The expanded Child Tax Credit was a critical tool for millions of parents who were struggling to afford the necessities and should be made permanent in the 2025 tax reform fight,” Aurilio said.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A coalition of 15 other states has joined Miyares on the brief including Alaska, Florida and Texas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If successful, the case could strengthen the reformed transgender student school policies adopted by Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration, requiring </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/09/16/youngkin-administration-overhauls-virginia-transgender-student-policies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">parental approval</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for any changes to students’ “names, nicknames, and/or pronouns.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The administration’s changes to the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/09/12/despite-law-few-virginia-school-districts-adopt-state-model-transgender-policies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">original policies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which protected the rights of transgender and nonbinary students, direct school divisions to keep parents “informed about their children’s well-being” and require that student participation in activities and athletics and use of bathrooms be based on sex, “except to the extent that federal law otherwise requires.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Wisconsin, a group of parents attempted to overturn in court a school division’s decision to implement guidelines allowing students to change their gender identity at school without parental consent or notification. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Parents have the right to be involved in major decisions affecting their children&#8217;s lives. This case presents an opportunity for the U.S. Supreme Court to provide much-needed clarity and reaffirm that government officials cannot override parents’ fundamental rights simply because they believe they know better,” said Miyares in a July 8 statement. “It is essential that schools work with parents, not against them, to support a child’s wellbeing.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not all schools in Virginia have supported the revised policies. The state’s revised transgender student policies haven’t been embraced by all school districts in the state. The Virginia Department of Education was facing </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/aclu-sues-virginia-department-of-education-over-transgender-policies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two lawsuits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — stemming from Hanover and York Counties — over the policy changes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, the York County Circuit Court accepted the VDOE&#8217;s pleas in bar and dismissed the one case. The second case in Hanover was continued to Aug. 20.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breanna Diaz, policy and legislative counsel for the ACLU of Virginia, which promotes and defends citizens’ civil liberties and rights, said the lower court in Wisconsin has already ruled that the parents did not experience any actual injury from the decision, compared to the transgender and nonbinary students in Virginia who alleged they experienced “real harm” and “actual discrimination” due to the revised policies in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February, the ACLU of Virginia announced that it and law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, LLP are representing two transgender students in the counties of </span><a href="https://www.acluva.org/sites/default/files/field_documents/hanover_model_policies_complaint.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hanover</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.acluva.org/sites/default/files/field_documents/final_york_county_complaint_w._verification_1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">York</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who are challenging the department’s policies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The reality is that what a few parents want doesn’t always match school policies designed to accommodate all families,” Diaz said in a statement. “Parents who opt for public schools are signing up for a system that must serve entire communities, and although parents can opt out of public schools by choosing private schools or homeschooling, they can’t remake public schools to match their individual preferences.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adults and Virginia schools must put pupils first by affirming all students, Diaz continued. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia’s leaders should focus on making Virginia schools safe for students of all gender identities, starting by rescinding the policies that have already harmed so many Virginia families.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not long ago, in vitro fertilization — the medical process by which human sperm and ovum are united in clinical conditions outside a woman’s body and later implanted, giving the otherwise childless a chance at having a child — would have met scant resistance in the chambers of political power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome to 2024 and the looming American dystopia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, Virginia’s Democratic U.S. senators, Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, were copatrons (along with most of the Senate’s Democratic conference) of a bill sponsored by Sens. Tammy Duckworth and Patty Murray that would establish legal protections for IVF.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill was in response to an</span><a href="https://publicportal-api.alappeals.gov/courts/68f021c4-6a44-4735-9a76-5360b2e8af13/cms/case/343d203a-b13d-463a-8176-c46e3ae4f695/docketentrydocuments/e3d95592-3cbe-4384-afa6-063d4595aa1d" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">extraordinary ruling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in February by Alabama’s Supreme Court that outlawed IVF. It held that embryos frozen in liquid nitrogen at a temperature of 320 degrees below zero Fahrenheit are legally no different from a newborn in its mother’s arms or a kindergartner on a school bus. Since there are more embryos on ice than a woman could reasonably carry to term, the choice becomes whether to leave them frozen permanently or, eventually, to destroy them. To IVF foes, that’s homicide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ruling instantly suspended IVF procedures across Alabama and produced panic and heartbreak among aspiring parents for whom it was their best, or last, shot at having offspring and had spent many thousands of dollars out of pocket toward that end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to our sister publication, The</span><a href="https://alabamareflector.com/2024/02/19/alabama-supreme-court-ruling-could-end-ivf-treatments-in-state/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Alabama Reflector</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Justice Jay Mitchell tied his majority opinion to a state law enacted seven years after the Civil War authorizing lawsuits over the wrongful deaths of children and a</span><a href="https://www.al.com/news/2018/11/alabama-passes-anti-abortion-amendment.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">2018 Alabama constitutional amendment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that requires the state to “ensure the protection of the rights of the unborn child.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitchell wrote that neither specified an exception for frozen embryos. That goes without saying for the statute, passed 106 years before the first birth from an extracorporeal conception, when electricity was in its infancy and refrigeration was decades in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greater illumination into motivations behind the decision, however, derive from a concurring opinion by Alabama’s chief justice, Tom Parker, that reads more like a sermon than a legal treatise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…[E]ven before birth, all human beings bear the image of God, and their lives cannot be destroyed without effacing his glory,” Parker wrote. “We believe that each human being, from the moment of conception, is made in the image of God, created by Him to reflect His likeness.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state constitutional amendment, which conveys personhood at a somewhat uncertain instant of conception, was approved by Alabama’s conservative, largely evangelical and fundamentalist religious electorate six years ago to deter abortion. When the court applied it to IVF, however, the volume and intensity of the resulting outrage sent the Republican-ruled legislature scurrying back to Montgomery to promptly enact legislation that put IVF clinics back in operation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a place for proselytizing — by </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">all</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> faiths — and it should be afforded all the robust protections of our First Amendment. But the First Amendment also prohibits the government from establishing a religion, a safeguard against an American theocracy enacted by founders who bore the Church of England’s yoke before winning independence from Britain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When religion — in this case, segments of Christianity — muscles its doctrines into public policy to be imposed upon those who don’t share them, the resulting conflict is uncivil and ubiquitous. It produces the sort of uncompromising, paralyzed politics that grips our nation’s tribalized culture today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Polling consistently shows majorities of Americans support abortion rights in some form. A</span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/03/25/what-the-data-says-about-abortion-in-the-us/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">recent poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Pew Research Center says 62% of Americans surveyed believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases. A</span><a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/506759/broader-support-abortion-rights-continues-post-dobbs.aspx" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Gallup survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that 69% said abortions should generally be legal in the first trimester. Support for abortions declines the longer a fetus progresses toward birth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As this near-existential election year moves toward its decisive conclusion on Nov. 5, one of the few issues that augurs in favor of Democrats is that of women&#8217;s reproductive freedom. Until recently, that was abortion, particularly after the U.S. Supreme Court’s</span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> decision struck down 49 years of federal protections for abortion access and made abortion a state-by-state issue. Virginia is the lone southern state that has not banned or severely curbed abortion access.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It galvanized abortion rights voters, especially women, and staunched what was expected to be a crimson wave midterm congressional election for Republicans in 2022. Rather than win back a Senate majority as predicted, Democrats narrowly retained power after a late November runoff election in Georgia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which brings us back to June’s effort in the Senate to codify IVF protections. It failed on a near party-line vote with 47 Republicans in opposition. Forty-four Democrats, two Republicans and two independents voted for it, but that’s shy of the 60 votes needed to advance bills in the Senate. But even in its demise, it served a purpose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no small amount of partisan theater in votes like these, particularly in high-stakes election years. The goal is to force one party to take damaging, adversarial votes that the other party can use to rally sympathetic voters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is the normal course of events in Congress in election years,” said Stephen Farnsworth, professor of political science and director of the Center for Leadership and Media Studies at</span><a href="https://cas.umw.edu/polisci/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Mary Washington University</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Fredericksburg. “Legislating may be the driving factor in year one, but demonizing your opponent is the prominent factor in year two of the election cycle.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Both parties do this. The Republicans, when they were in the majority, forced the Democrats to take tough votes on immigration and, when Obamacare was unpopular, Republicans pushed for Obamacare votes,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine stands to be a direct beneficiary of the IVF bill’s death. He’s on this fall’s ballot seeking his third Senate term and hitting his Republican challenger, retired Navy officer Hung Cao, relentlessly on the reproductive rights issue. Cao</span><a href="https://www.fauquier.com/news/wexton-cao-clash-on-abortion-va-policies-for-transgender-students-in-first-debate/article_c835174e-4379-11ed-a0a6-bf53776c5ea8.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">said in a debate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a U.S. House seat two years ago that life “begins at conception” and he felt compelled to protect it.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="1TycpL7oXZ"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/17/they-dont-like-abortion-but-kaines-gop-challengers-say-they-wont-seek-a-federal-ban/">They don’t like abortion, but Kaine’s GOP challengers say they won’t seek a federal ban</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other Democrats can reap a residual benefit by using the outcome in a broader message about a GOP threat to women’s rights, particularly in two of the nation’s most fiercely contested U.S. House races. Incumbent Democratic Reps. Abigail Spanberger and Jennifer Wexton — both forceful advocates for reproductive rights — are leaving seats they won in 2018 in Virginia’s 7th and 10th congressional districts, respectively. Spanberger is a 2025 candidate for governor and Wexton is departing for health reasons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The painful reality about politics these days is that we’re talking about trench warfare,” Farnsworth said. “An unpopular vote here, an unpopular vote there may weaken a party in a swing district.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger’s seat is a prime example, he said. “In that Washington-area district, the greater the focus is on the Dobbs decision and IVF, the better for a Democratic candidate.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women are a potent voting bloc. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pissed off</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> women are a force of nature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a year when Kaine and down-ballot Democrats swim upstream against unfavorable issues such as the economy, immigration and an octogenarian president whose recent debate debacle leaves overwhelming majorities —</span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/poll-debate-should-biden-be-running-mental-abilities/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">72%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — believing he’s too old to perform, a force of nature is a comforting thing to have.</span></p>

<p>It’s the latest in a long-running saga involving Massachusetts-based Magellan Diagnostics, which will <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/pr/magellan-diagnostics-agrees-plead-guilty-and-pay-42-million-resolve-criminal-charges" target="_blank">pay $42 million in penalties</a>, according to the Department of Justice.</p>
<p>While many of the fault-prone devices were used from 2013 to 2017, some were being recalled <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CCDPHP/DEODC/CLPPB/CDPH%20Document%20Library/magellan_fact_sheet_20211203_ADA_v2.pdf" target="_blank">as late as 2021</a>. The Justice Department said the malfunction produced inaccurate results for “potentially tens of thousands” of children and other patients.</p>
<p>Doctors don’t consider any level of lead in the blood to be safe, especially for children. Several U.S. cities, including Washington, D.C., and Flint, Michigan, have struggled with widespread lead contamination of their water supplies in the last two decades, making accurate tests critical for public health.</p>
<p>It’s possible faulty Magellan kits were used to test children for lead exposure into the early 2020s, based on the recall in 2021. Here’s what parents should know.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What tests were affected?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The inaccurate results came from three Magellan devices: LeadCare Ultra, LeadCare II, and LeadCare Plus. One, the LeadCare II, uses finger-stick samples primarily and accounted for more than half of all blood lead tests conducted in the U.S. from 2013 to 2017, according to the Justice Department. It was often used in physician offices to check children’s lead levels.</p>
<p>The other two could also be used with blood drawn from a vein and may have been more common in labs than doctor’s offices. The company “first learned that a malfunction in its LeadCare Ultra device could cause inaccurate lead test results – specifically, lead test results that were falsely low” in June 2013 while seeking regulatory clearance to sell the product, the DOJ said. But it did not disclose that information and went on to market the tests, according to the settlement.</p>
<p>The agency said 2013 testing indicated the same flaw affected the LeadCare II device. A 2021 recall included most of all three types of test kits distributed since October 27, 2020.</p>
<p>The company said in a <a href="https://www.magellandx.com/resources/magellan-diagnostics-announces-voluntary-resolution-of-federal-investigation/" target="_blank">press release</a> announcing the resolution that “the underlying issues that affected the results of some of Magellan’s products from 2013 to 2018 have been fully and effectively remediated,” and that the tests it currently sells are safe.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What does a falsely low result mean?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Children are often tested during pediatrician visits at age 1 and again at age 2. Elevated lead levels can put kids at risk of developmental delay, lower IQ, and other problems. And symptoms, such as stomachache, poor appetite, or irritability, may not appear until high levels are reached.</p>
<p>Falsely low test results could mean parents and physicians were unaware of the problem.</p>
<p>That’s a concern because treatment for lead poisoning is, initially, mainly preventive. Results showing elevated levels should prompt parents and health officials to determine the sources of lead and take steps to prevent continued lead intake, said Janine Kerr, health educator with the Virginia Department of Health’s <a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/leadsafe/" target="_blank">Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program</a>.</p>
<p>Children can be exposed to lead in a variety of ways, including by drinking water contaminated with lead from old pipes, such as in Flint and Washington; ingesting lead-based paint flakes often found in older homes; or, as reported recently, eating some <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/outbreaks-foodborne-illness/investigation-elevated-lead-chromium-levels-cinnamon-applesauce-pouches-november-2023" target="_blank">brands of cinnamon-flavored applesauce.</a></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What should parents do now?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>“Parents can contact their child’s pediatrician to determine if their child had a blood lead test with a LeadCare device” and discuss whether a repeat blood lead test is needed, said <a href="https://profiles.mountsinai.org/maida-p-galvez" target="_blank">Maida Galvez</a>, a pediatrician and professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York.</p>
<p>During an earlier recall of some Magellan devices, in 2017, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-warns-americans-about-risk-inaccurate-results-certain-lead-tests" target="_blank">recommended that patients be retested</a> if they were pregnant, nursing, or children younger than 6 and had a blood lead level of less than 10 micrograms per deciliter as determined by a Magellan device from a venous blood draw.</p>
<p>The 2021 recall of Magellan devices recommended retesting children whose results were less than the current CDC reference level of 3.5 micrograms per deciliter. Many of those tests were of the finger-stick variety.</p>
<p>Kerr, at the Virginia health department, said her agency has not had many calls about that recall.</p>
<p>The finger-stick tests “are not that widely used in Virginia,” said Kerr, adding that “we did get a lot of questions about the applesauce recall.”</p>
<p>In any case, she said, the “best course of action for parents is to talk with a health care provider.”</p>

(Getty Images)</p><p>As the summer travel season approaches, new parents may be navigating airports with their babies — and the complexities of keeping them fed. Despite federal guidelines for airport agents laying out how to treat nursing moms, stories about problem encounters with security sometimes go viral.</p>
<p>In 2023, actress and singer <a href="https://x.com/KekePalmer/status/1668205775154552833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1668205775154552833%7Ctwgr%5Ebbb9a6cf41a179440115a3a76d4d1932f4b64e25%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theroot.com%2Fembed%2Finset%2Fiframe%3Fid%3Dtwitter-1668205775154552833autosize%3D1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Keke Palmer</a> said she was at Houston airport when she faced threats to throw out her 16 ounces of breast milk. A year earlier, engineer and science TV host Emily Calandrelli said U.S. Transportation Security Administration officers escorted her out of line and made her check her partially thawed ice packs, which are used to keep breast milk cool.</p>
<p>“It was a very traumatizing experience, and it also didn’t align with what the TSA policies were, which state that you’re allowed to have them for medically necessary purposes,” Calandrelli told States Newsroom.</p>
<p>In May 2022, she went on her first work trip away from her 10-week-old baby and was traveling from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C. Calandrelli planned on pumping after going through security at LAX, but TSA officers drilled her with questions about what the ice packs were for and said it wouldn’t have been an issue if her breast milk was already pumped.</p>
<p>“I spoke to three different males who worked at TSA, and I requested to speak to a woman but wasn’t able to,” she said.</p>
<p>Like Palmer, she shared the experience with her legions of social media followers. Calandrelli said the agency later apologized. TSA issued a <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/news/press/statements/2022/05/13/statement-regarding-screening-breast-milk-formula-and-other" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement</a> shortly after the incident: “Our employees go through regular training to effectively engage and screen diverse traveler populations, including those who are breastfeeding and/or traveling with breast milk.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/whatcanibring/items/breast-milk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Both women’s experiences violate TSA guidelines</a>: Formula, breast milk, toddler drinks and baby food are allowed on planes and carry-ons in quantities greater than 3.4 ounces. Breast milk, formula and ice packs — along with other cooling accessories — are considered medically necessary. Passengers are advised to let TSA officers know they’re carrying these items when arriving at airport security.</p>
<p>Even though these protections exist, many lactating parents still encounter problems during air travel, and these issues carry physical and emotional side effects, according to Tina Sherman, a doula and interim executive director at the U.S. Breastfeeding Committee.</p>
<p>“Lactating parents have to pump on a fairly regular basis to be able to continue to keep up their supply,” Sherman said.</p>
<p>When they can’t express milk or that cycle is interrupted, mothers experience pain or breast leaks, she said. In some cases, long delays in pumping can lead to <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/mastitis#:~:text=Mastitis%20is%20an%20infection%20or,as%20body%20aches%20and%20fever." target="_blank" rel="noopener">mastitis</a> — an infection that causes swelling in the breasts and cracked nipples. Emotionally, being prevented or delayed from expressing milk can make parents feel anxious, embarrassed and stressed, Sherman said.</p>
<p>Calandrelli’s plight two years ago led her to reach out to her local California congresswoman. U.S. Democratic Rep. Katie Porter first introduced legislation to <a href="https://porter.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=485" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strengthen existing protections for breastfeeding parents</a> in August 2022.</p>
<p>“You have to have clear instructions and clear rules, and have people follow them in order for moms to be able to meet the standards,” Porter said. “There’s a lot of obstacles to breastfeeding. There’s a lot of challenges to feeding a baby and traveling with a baby.”</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" title="“State AGs Want Power to Hit Airlines for Consumer Complaints” — Stateline" src="https://stateline.org/2022/09/06/state-ags-want-power-to-hit-airlines-for-consumer-complaints/embed/#?secret=QTqdQMSpGP#?secret=7L9ikGA72D" width="500" height="589" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-scripts" data-secret="7L9ikGA72D" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>The Bottles and Breastfeeding Equipment Screening (<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3386/text#:~:text=To%20amend%20the%20Bottles%20and,screening%2C%20and%20for%20other%20purposes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BABES</a>) Enhancement Act would require “hygienic handling of breast milk and baby formula” by TSA officers and private security companies. Porter’s bill would direct airport officials to “minimize the risk for contamination” of breast milk, formula and infant drinks, along with ice or freezer packs and related cooling accessories.</p>
<p>Under the proposal, the agency must consult with maternal health organizations — March of Dimes, Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine — to determine what policies and regulations need to be updated as pumping technology and best practices for breast milk storage evolve, she said.</p>
<p>BABES Act is an update to a <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/COMPS-16487/pdf/COMPS-16487.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016 law</a> that required TSA training on special screening procedures for nursing parents. The original law also made it legal to carry larger amounts of breast milk, formula and infant drink — juice or purified water — in airports and on planes.</p>
<p>Reps. Maria Elvira Salazar, a Florida Republican, and Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat, are the lead <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3386/cosponsors?s=1&amp;r=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">co-sponsors</a> in the House. Democratic Sens. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, along with GOP Sens. Steve Daines of Montana and Ted Cruz of Texas <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/1570/cosponsors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sponsored</a> the bill in the upper chamber.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3386/text#:~:text=To%20amend%20the%20Bottles%20and,screening%2C%20and%20for%20other%20purposes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The bipartisan bill didn’t go anywhere last session</a>, but Porter <a href="https://porter.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=541" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reintroduced</a> the proposal. She said the bill is set to be heard in the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee soon.</p>
<p>As a mother of three, Porter is acutely familiar with the problems that come with traveling with infants. Her children are adolescents and teens now, but when they were babies, lactation stations in airports were uncommon. She said a flight attendant once told her to stop nursing her baby while the plane was still on the ground. Porter said she was angry and scared, but mostly “worried about my baby, who was hungry.”</p>
<p>As for her bill, she recognizes that TSA agents have a hard job. But the BABES Act will help them “have clear rules and better training so that they’re not put in challenging situations when they’re dealing with frustrated parents,” she said.</p>
<p>Making travel for lactating parents easier could chip away at larger stigma about breastfeeding, advocates said. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/data/facts.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">More than 80% of babies are breastfed in infancy</a>, and 58% are still getting some breast milk by the time they’re 6 months old, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>Still, earlier this month, an ad for lactation cookies featuring a cooking star’s covered breasts and pregnant belly was temporarily removed from a Times Square billboard, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/17/style/lactation-cookie-billboard-times-square.html?unlocked_article_code=1.uE0.QJcx.czJRWM86Metg&amp;smid=url-share" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times</a>.</p>
<p>“Normalizing breastfeeding and lactation is really critical to families being able to meet their breastfeeding goals,” Sherman said.</p>

(Courtesy of Rebecca Rivas/Missouri Independent)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has implemented new guidelines to establish a unified rating and improvement system to assess the commonwealth’s publicly funded early childhood care providers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Approximately 75% of child care programs that received public funding previously did not participate in the state’s voluntary quality measures, according to Del. David Buolva, D-Fairfax, who co-patroned 2020 legislation that led to all publicly funded providers being required to participate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the following year, a pilot system known as the Unified Virginia Quality Birth to Five system, or </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/teaching-learning-assessment/early-childhood-care-education/quality-measurement-and-improvement-vqb5" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VQB5</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, was created to improve children’s school readiness and expand access to parents and support providers. Advocates say the new system is a critical tool for the state, providers and families to gauge the effectiveness of Virginia’s early childhood education programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is always important to have the data to show where young children are so that we can make the right investments moving forward,” said Alison Gilbreath, senior director for policy and programs for Voices for Virginia&#8217;s Children. “We want all children in Virginia to be ready for kindergarten when they reach that age and we also need to know what communities are struggling the most and sometimes the data can really help us understand what is working well and what isn&#8217;t.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kathy Glazer, president of the Virginia Early Childhood Foundation, said in a statement that the organization has been supportive of the system’s developments and implementation throughout the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By focusing on providing feedback to teachers regarding effective interactions with children and use of curricula that is aligned with Virginia’s early learning standards, VQB5 drives increased quality improvement across settings and classrooms,” Glazer said. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The new rating system</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, the Board of Education voted unanimously to adopt the system’s </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/54001/638492791550300000" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">guidelines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which will apply to over 3,200 birth-to-five programs including child care centers, and Head Start and Early Head Start programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move is in conjunction with ongoing state efforts to prepare children for school and secure affordable child care, with the well of federal funds drying up.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="4hPI0k19PU"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/29/with-child-care-increasingly-unaffordable-virginia-legislation-seeks-to-make-long-term-changes/">With child care increasingly unaffordable, Virginia lawmakers propose long-term fixes </a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;With child care increasingly unaffordable, Virginia lawmakers propose long-term fixes &#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/29/with-child-care-increasingly-unaffordable-virginia-legislation-seeks-to-make-long-term-changes/embed/#?secret=ezAhfW016y#?secret=4hPI0k19PU" data-secret="4hPI0k19PU" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the rating system, a birth-to-five program’s quality of teaching and learning is measured by its interactions between a teacher and child, and a curriculum that is aligned with Virginia’s early learning and development standards. The department said provider profiles, including ratings, will be available online in the fall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guidelines will help the state understand how classroom-level experiences impact school readiness and longer-term child outcomes, and provide accurate and supportive feedback to meet diverse needs of classrooms. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Previous efforts</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The board’s vote builds on Virginia’s efforts, dating back to legislation in 2020, to improve school readiness for children.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Less than half of Virginia’s children enter kindergarten without any literacy, math and social-emotional skills they need for success, and [it’s] even more acute for at-risk children entering kindergarten,” said Bulova during a Feb. 7, 2020 House Appropriations committee hearing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation, which Buolva helped to carry along with then-Democratic Sen. Janet Howell, moved early care and education operations oversight from the Department of Social Services to the Department of Education because the previous system was “fragmented,” Bulova said, lost efficiency and confused providers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill also created the </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/data-policy-funding/virginia-board-of-education/board-committee-meetings/early-childhood-advisory-committee-ecac" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early Childhood Advisory Committee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is required to obtain federal funding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation also established the Early Childhood Advisory Committee (ECAC), which advises the board on all programs, systems and regulations related to Virginia’s unified early childhood system.</span></p>

(Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder)</p><p>For the second time while serving in the Nevada Legislature, Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro gave birth last year. And again, she publicly pledged to continue full participation in her duties.</p>
<p>As the nation’s groundbreaker when it comes to working moms in a state capitol, Nevada made history in 2019 as the only female-majority legislative body in the U.S. Still, legislators like Cannizzaro acknowledge uncertainty before deciding to grow their families while serving, the <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/when-it-comes-working-moms-nevada-legislatures-demographics-reflect-reality" target="_blank">Nevada Current</a> reported.</p>
<p>“What does that look like? What does it mean to be in this building and pregnant? What does it mean if I have a 1½-year-old and have to leave a meeting to pick him up at daycare? Does that make me less able to fulfill my duties? There were questions that I had as I announced my first and second pregnancy,” Cannizzaro told the Current.</p>
<figure id="attachment_38654" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:410px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Canizzarro2.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-38654" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Canizzarro2-300x200.jpeg" alt="" width="410" height="273" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Canizzarro2-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Canizzarro2-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Canizzarro2-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Canizzarro2-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Canizzarro2-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 410px) 100vw, 410px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Nevada Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro, who was first elected in 2016 and was pregnant during the 2023 legislative session, has said it’s important to find balance and set boundaries as a legislative mom. (Trevor Bexon/Nevada Current)</p></figure>
<p>The number of women serving in state legislatures has more than quintupled since 1971, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University (CAWP). Nearly 33% of the 7,386 state legislative seats are occupied by 2,432 women, the center reported.  In Virginia, 35% of the legislative seats are filled by women. Meanwhile, Vote Mama Foundation estimates 23% of lawmakers nationally are moms.</p>
<p>“Things within the political ecosystem have changed to be more open to women,” said Kelly Dittmar, director of research at CAWP. “Having more women also begets more women.”</p>
<p>And there are visible signs of progress at statehouses across the country as the number of mom lawmakers grow.</p>
<p>In Georgia, where women state representatives did not have a bathroom near the House chamber until the 1970s, there is now a lactation pod on the first floor of the Capitol. And a freshman Republican lawmaker has brought her baby to the floor daily, but more notably, the baby was given an official House name tag — labeling him the “baby of the House’’ — so he would have floor privileges. Just two decades ago, such a move was frowned on by House leadership.</p>
<p>“We talk a lot up here about how representation matters, and I believe that to be true,” Georgia state Rep. Lauren Daniel, a Republican, said to her colleagues late last year.</p>
<p>“I hope as I stand here today, and every day, as the youngest female member of this body, that it shows any young girl in this state who may find herself pregnant that her life does not end when a new one begins,” said Daniel, who first became pregnant when she was 17 and is now mother to four.</p>
<p>Still, moms are struggling to get elected and remain in office. Beyond child care, there are myriad impediments. It takes money and an organized campaign infrastructure. As candidates, they are confronted with gender stereotypes that they often consider in executing their campaign strategy. And the time away from young children can be daunting.</p>
<p>Having run for office herself, Liuba Grechen Shirley said she sees why moms, especially moms of small children, are often missing from elected office. Grechen Shirley is the founder of Vote Mama, a political organization that seeks to increase the number of moms in office.</p>
<p>“If you are a mother with young children and you decide to step up and run, the first question you get asked is always ‘but who will watch your kids while you campaign?’” said Grechen Shirley, who ran for Congress in 2018 in New York’s 2nd Congressional District while wrangling her 1- and 3-year-old children on the campaign trail.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A run for the money</h4>

	
<p>When it comes to fundraising, men dominate. A 2021 OpenSecrets report analyzing fundraising during open-seat House primary races in 2020 found white men candidates led the money race, though white women candidates maintained a significant advantage over women of color, raising three times as much as Black women in open-seat primaries, <a href="https://dkftve4js3etk.cloudfront.net/OpenSecrets_RaceGenderReport2020_BrynerHaley.pdf" target="_blank">according to the report.</a></p>
<p>Women donors also give less money overall than men, comprising around one-third of money contributed to state general office and legislative races nationwide from 2019 to 2022, according to <a href="https://cawp.rutgers.edu/research/cawp-women-money-and-politics-series/donor-gap" target="_blank">a 2023 report</a> by CAWP. At the individual state level, financial support from women donors ranged from 14% of donations in Nebraska state races, to 46% of contributions in Colorado.</p>
<p>That doesn’t sit right for Grechen Shirley.</p>
<p>Data from the Pew Research Center shows 85% of women will give birth and become mothers by the time they’re 45 years old. Vote Mama’s research arm, the Vote Mama Foundation, found that in 2022, 23% of state legislators were moms, and 5% had children under the age of 18.</p>
<p>On Capitol Hill, 37 of 541 lawmakers in 2022 were moms with children under 18, equal to 6.8% of the 118th Congress, according to Vote Mama Foundation. Put another way, there were three times as many men named John or Jon as there were moms of minor children serving.</p>
<p>“Vote Mama exists because of my personal experience running for Congress with two small toddlers,” Grechen Shirley said. “I immediately understood why there were not more moms serving at the federal level when I was running because it is really difficult. It’s unsustainable for somebody who’s a working parent, somebody who’s not independently wealthy, somebody who is a primary caregiver. This system was designed for wealthy older white men.”</p>
<p>Vote Mama PAC has helped over 500 Democrats who are moms run for office. Grechen Shirley pressed the Federal Election Commission to rule in her favor to allow use of campaign funds to cover the cost of her child care so she could run in 2018. And since then, at the federal level, parents started using funds similarly.</p>
<p>Between 2018 and 2022, 68 federal candidates spent $717,706 in campaign funds on child care, <a href="https://www.votemamafoundation.org/reports/cfcc2024" target="_blank">according to a report released by Vote Mama</a> at the beginning of the year. About half those funds were spent by women. Grechen Shirley wants people to know that efforts to help moms run for office also help dads.</p>
<p>Women of color represent 77% of total Republican campaign funds spent on child care, the report says.</p>
<p>“This is a complete game changer and it will help diversify both parties,” Grechen Shirley said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A major barrier to running</h4>

	
<p>At the state level, 70% of campaign funds spent on child care between 2018 and 2022 were spent by candidates of color, according to the same report.</p>
<p>Thirty-two states authorize candidates to use campaign funds for child care, but according to Vote Mama, in at least six of them, the option had never been touched. In Virginia, the Attorney General&#8217;s office issued an advisory opinion allowing the use in 2021. The <a href="https://scdailygazette.com/2024/04/09/sc-house-approves-letting-candidates-use-campaign-donations-for-childcare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South Carolina House approved legislation</a> last month over the objections of the chamber’s hardline Freedom Caucus. But the bill died with session’s end Thursday after <a href="https://www.scstatehouse.gov/sess125_2023-2024/bills/4561.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">never getting a vote</a> in the Senate.</p>
<p>A bipartisan pair of moms pushed for the change in Georgia by asking the state ethics commission to weigh in. The commission approved the change last summer through an <a href="https://8c99c177-8ae3-4e84-b7ff-133cca25df05.usrfiles.com/ugd/8c99c1_83dae44615d9485683c52339081fce55.pdf" target="_blank">advisory opinion</a>.</p>
<p>Georgia Republican state Rep. Beth Camp said she thought it was odd that federal candidates could use campaign funds for child care expenses but state candidates could not. And she says she hopes the change will encourage more parents with young children to run for office.</p>
<p>“It is not a partisan issue. It is a nonpartisan issue because it impacts everyone,” said Camp, whose children are now adults.</p>
<p>Camp said she was surprised when she heard negative feedback from some colleagues who questioned why the change was needed when candidates had not used campaign funds for child care in the past.</p>
<p>“Well, honestly, we probably would have had more parents — not going to say women or men but more parents — enter into elected office if they’d had the opportunity,” Camp said. “When you start looking at how expensive it is to provide child care, there are some people who make the decision not to take that out of their family household budget.”</p>
<p>Rhode Island <a href="http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/BillText/BillText21/SenateText21/S0060.pdf" target="_blank">passed a law in 2021</a> letting state and local candidates spend campaign funds on child care. It has yet to be used by any candidate with child care burdens, man or woman.</p>
<p>Sen. Sandra Cano, a third-term Democratic state senator who has given birth to two children since she was elected in 2018, said she opted not to dip into her campaign war chest for child care partly due to public perception.</p>
<p>“I do feel I would put myself through more criticism if I did, even though it is legal,” she said.</p>
<p>Also a factor: her family members provide most of the care for her children, Arianna, 4, and Alessandro, 1. And her parents refuse to accept her offers to pay them for it.</p>
<p>Lack of access to child care is a major barrier moms face when running for office and that problem continues if they win the election, Dittmar said.</p>
<p>“(Women) are still more likely than their male counterparts to be the caregivers,” said Dittmar of the Center for American Women and Politics.</p>
<p>Ohio has not authorized political candidates to use campaign funds for child care.</p>
<p>Ohio House Minority Leader Allison Russo, a Democrat, spent thousands of dollars in extra child care costs when she first campaigned in 2018. Her daughter was a 1-year-old and her two sons were in elementary school at that time.</p>
<p>“It was a big, expensive part of my first campaign that we paid out of pocket,” she said. “I am privileged to have the circumstance that I have with family nearby and the support network, but not everybody has that and I think if we want more parents with young children, especially women to run for office, we have to think about how do we create this support at work.”</p>

<p>And in Indiana, Ragen Hatcher, a representative from Gary, noted that childcare access and expenses continued to pose challenges even after she was elected. The mom of four moved her family hours away from their home in northwest Indiana so she could continue to care for them while she served in the legislature. Hatcher said she’d like to see free childcare offered at the statehouse, as well as the option to enroll her kids in schools closer to the state capitol.</p>
<p>“Being a state representative or state senator, for young parents, is difficult. And I think it may be a barrier to why many younger people, and moms, don’t run for these offices,” Hatcher said. “There are some things that the legislature can do to accommodate people better with younger children, and I just hope that we start doing that instead of leaving that age group out — those who may have the younger children but don’t want to necessarily have to leave them at home.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The X factor</h4>

	
<p>From scheduling breast pumping, dropping kids off at school, securing child care and performing the full spectrum of duties expected of women as primary caretakers for their children, campaigning as a mom is a challenge and that’s before a person faces all the hurdles of serving in office as a mom, Grechen Shirley said.</p>
<p>“You campaign and you’re working full time for up to two years with no salary … the reality is no one talks about these things. Unless you know somebody personally who has run for office or served in office, there’s really no way to know what it will be like. It’s like childbirth, unless you know someone who’s gone through it, you really don’t know what it’ll be like,” Grechen Shirley said.</p>
<p>And no one questions why dads run for office because having kids is viewed as an asset for men in elections, and they’re good dads for taking a picture with their kids, Grechen Shirley said. But if a woman on the campaign trail or in elected office takes a picture with her kids, they’re “using” their kids.</p>
<p>Increased representation of moms in office doesn’t mean the behind-the-scenes burdens have lessened, said Jennifer Lawless, the Leone Reaves and George W. Spicer Professor of Politics at the University of Virginia and chair of its politics department.</p>
<p>Lawless highlighted U.S. Rep. Grace Meng, a New York Democrat, as an example. Meng has talked about <a href="https://19thnews.org/2023/05/members-congress-mothers-minor-children/" target="_blank">the continued stress</a> of finding child care in New York while she sits through marathon sessions on Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>“It seems normatively wrong that women are being asked to manage this additional aspect of serving or running,” Lawless said. “We should have a political system where they should not be asked to manage something extra. Because women have been doing this for so long they’ve somehow figured it out.”</p>
<p>Said Dittmar: “In holding office you’re at the whims of leadership and deadlines and timelines. You can’t just say, ‘I’m sorry, I have to take off tomorrow because my kid is sick’ if you have a major vote.”</p>
<p>Lawless, who challenged U.S. Rep. Jim Langevin in the 2006 Democratic primary for Rhode Island’s 2nd Congressional District, said the experience was “incredibly taxing,” even as a single woman without children.</p>
<p>“I can’t imagine what it would have been like to have that third component of child care factored in,” Lawless said.</p>
<p>Because of that, some moms wait until their children are older or out of the house before running for office, but Dittmar said she thinks that’s changing.</p>
<p>“A lot of the women who have young kids feel like there’s a lot going on in the world and in their states that they need to speak up on and so you’re seeing that translate into candidacy and office holding,” she said.</p>
<p>It’s those life experiences that drive moms into running for office. Without people in positions of power who have experienced the challenges of raising children, things like child care aren’t prioritized issues, Grechen Shirley said.</p>
<p>“When you talk to men about why they ran, they say ‘I thought I would be good at this job’. When you talk to a woman, a mom with young kids in particular, there’s usually one particular issue that they reached out to their local representative to get help with and either never heard back from their representative or didn’t get the help that they needed and they said ‘you know what, I can do this job better,’” Grechen Shirley said.</p>
<p>For example, the female-majority in Nevada has advocated for policies such as the “pregnancy fairness act” that strengthens protections beyond federal law for pregnant and postpartum workers and endorsed a maternal mortality review committee to improve health outcomes, the Current has reported. In January, eight weeks of paid family leave for state employees after the birth or adoption of a child or to care for a family member with a serious illness took effect. Other issues, including pay equity, remain on the agenda.</p>
<p>Lawless didn’t think achieving parity between mothers in the population and in elected office was necessary, though. More important to Lawless was working toward equal representation of women in political office and campaigns, regardless of their family status.</p>
<p>“Right now if we continue at the rate we are currently electing women in Congress, it won’t be until 2108 that we reach parity for women,” she said.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an </span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/clinicians/reporting-adverse-events-in-children-following-exposure-to-thc-and-cbd-containing-products/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">April 24 letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to clinicians, State Health Commissioner Karen Shelton said her agency had received enough reports of minors getting sick from products containing CBD and THC, chemical compounds found in cannabis, that the state was establishing a “special surveillance system” to keep tabs on the issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Reported symptoms for these adverse events have included vomiting, hallucinations, low blood pressure, low blood sugar, altered mental status and anxiety,” Shelton wrote, adding that “some hospitalizations have occurred” as a result of minors consuming cannabis products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The letter specifically asks that local health departments be made aware of any cannabis-related hospitalizations in patients under 18 years old and any “clusters of adverse events” affecting multiple minors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“After a hospitalization or cluster is reported, VDH staff will collect information about the illness(es), possible exposures, and laboratory results,” the letter says.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_38621" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:371px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-1.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-38621" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-1.png" alt="" width="371" height="236" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-1.png 371w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-1-300x191.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 371px) 100vw, 371px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  State data shows an increase in emergency room visits involving minors and cannabis. (Source: Virginia Department of Health)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Health Department provided data showing an increase in emergency room visits involving minors being exposed to cannabis, and said the new surveillance system will help bolster those tracking efforts. In 2019, there were 52 ER visits. By 2023, the number had grown to 377.</span></p>
<p>That data only covers emergency room visits and doesn&#8217;t reflect every incident reported to health officials.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a result of these data, the special surveillance system was established in order for VDH to receive these reports directly and better assess the impact of adverse events related to consumption of products containing THC or CBD among children in the Commonwealth,&#8221; said Health Department spokesperson Cheryle Rodriguez.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The letter also points to an </span><a href="https://redcap.vdh.virginia.gov/redcap/surveys/?s=7R4T3M7KFL" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online portal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allowing anyone who had an adverse experience with cannabis products to submit a report to the Health Department with information about what happened, where the product was obtained and how it was labeled. The agency also noted that lab testing is available to “support patient and product testing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tracking system set up by health officials is the latest government effort to mitigate the downsides of cannabis, as policymakers continue to debate what to do about adult use of marijuana and products close enough to weed to produce a similar high. Earlier this year, Gov. Glenn Youngkin pointed to health risks to children as one of his reasons for vetoing legislation that would have legalized retail sales of marijuana for purely recreational use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The most concerning consequence of cannabis commercialization is its impact on adolescents and our children,” Youngkin said in his veto statement, which also cited data showing increases in calls to poison control centers for children who consumed cannabis edibles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There have been numerous news stories in the past few years of THC-related overdoses at Virginia schools, some of them being serious enough to require hospitalization. Last year, a high school in the city of Richmond took the unusual step of banning all candy after four students suffered “medical distress” after eating edibles believed to contain a form of THC, the intoxicating element found in marijuana, </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/education/hemp-richmond-public-schools-edibles-virginia-cannabis-control-authority/article_fac073be-84d4-11ee-93ab-eb2e982913a0.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As lawmakers have relaxed Virginia’s laws on adult possession of small amounts of marijuana, they’ve taken steps to crack down on legally murky products like delta-8 THC, which produces a high similar to marijuana but has gone largely unregulated because it’s typically derived from hemp plants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michelle Peace, a forensic science professor at Virginia Commonwealth University who specializes in vaping and cannabis research, said data collection and better testing will help health officials “get their arms around” the issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s important to know how pervasive the problem is,” Peace said in an interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peace has been doing her own research into the vaping habits of Virginia K-12 students by testing the contents of vape equipment confiscated by school officials. Out of 369 submissions, 82% contained nicotine and 18% had some form of THC. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of that THC was “very highly concentrated,” Peace said, making it more likely that the user would experience negative effects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At the end of the day, there needs to be proper attribution as to what the child actually consumed,” Peace said.</span></p>

(Jemal Countess/Getty Images for Community Change)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The bipartisan tax package passed by the U.S. House <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/child-tax-credit-expanded-business-tax-breaks-get-new-life-bill-passed-us-house%C2%A0" target="_blank">last month</a> is not a done deal, but the proposal’s supporters say it could restore some poverty-reducing benefits that reached millions under the pandemic-era child tax credit expansion.</p>
<p>A majority of low-income families who do not currently qualify for the full credit would see some increase just within the first year of the three-year deal, according to an <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/about-16-million-children-in-low-income-families-would-gain-in-first-year-of#Table1" target="_blank">analysis</a> by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.</p>
<p>The center estimates within the initial year of the legislation, if enacted, 16 million of the 19 million children in low-income households that don’t receive the full credit because of low earnings would benefit.</p>
<p>States topping the list of where those children live include California, Texas, Florida, New York, Georgia, Illinois, Ohio, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Michigan, in that order.</p>
<p>“This is really Congress’ only shot this year to pass legislation that would substantially boost the incomes of millions of low-income families and substantially lower child poverty,” said Stephanie Hingtgen, research analyst for the <a href="http://added" target="_blank">liberal-leaning</a> Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.</p>
<p>A successful bipartisan, bicameral legislative package would be a rare win for both lawmakers and the administration, particularly during an election year. Many of those parents who would see gains live in key 2024 swing states.</p>
<p>The CBPP’s analysis calculates that roughly 400,000 children would be lifted above the poverty line within the first year. The overall benefits would reach families across race and ethnicity, and would particularly help families in low-income rural areas, according to an additional <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/blog/house-passed-bipartisan-tax-bills-child-tax-credit-expansion-would-especially-help-children" target="_blank">report</a>.</p>
<p>Hingtgen found that families of 2.5 million children in rural areas would see an increase in the first year. Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Ohio and Texas would each see more than 100,000 children benefit in their respective rural communities, she reported.</p>

<p>Both Democrats and Republicans tout the deal, dubbed the Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/bipartisan-deal-expand-child-tax-credit-revive-business-tax-breaks-advances-congress" target="_blank">as a compromise</a> because it would expand the child tax credit while extending Trump-era corporate tax incentives through 2025.</p>
<p>Increasing child tax credit benefits has been a rallying cry for Democrats since the temporary pandemic-era expansion for 2021 lifted more than 2 million children out of poverty, according to <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/working-papers/2022/demo/SEHSD-wp2022-24.html" target="_blank">census data</a>.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Recent history of the child tax credit</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The tax break amount per child was doubled under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, from up to $1,000 to up to $2,000 per child under age 17. The actual refundable portion of that credit for 2023 — meaning how much a parent could see in a refund check after his or her tax liability — is capped at $1,600.</p>
<p>However, low-income earners hardly ever hit the full refund amount because it phases in at 15% on the dollar for earned income above $2,500. Households that earn less do not even qualify.</p>
<p>As the current law stands, a single parent with two children would need to earn about $29,000 annually to receive the full credit, or about $34,000 for married parents, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Families with more than two children would need an even higher annual income level to realize the full credit.</p>
<p>As the U.S. was digging out from under the COVID-19 economic fallout, Congress approved a <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/coronavirus/assistance-for-american-families-and-workers/child-tax-credit" target="_blank">one-year expansion</a> of the tax credit to $3,000 per child under age 18, and $3,600 for those under age 6 — even for families who made $0 to $2500 in income. Lawmakers made the entire amount refundable, and a portion of it was sent to families in monthly installments.</p>
<p>Advocates hailed the <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-antipoverty-effects-of-the-expanded-child-tax-credit-across-states-where-were-the-historic-reductions-felt/" target="_blank">research findings</a> that showed the temporary move was a game changer for poverty in the U.S.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Hope for low-income earners?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The changes under negotiation in Congress right now contain several advantages for low-earning parents: For one, the refundable portion of the credit would increase incrementally over the 2023, 2024 and 2025 tax years — from $1,800 to $1,900 to $2,000.</p>
<p>Second, parents could use their current or previous year’s income to calculate their tax credit — what tax experts call a “look-back” approach — and therefore maximize their refund checks. That way, if a parent or couple falls on hard times because of job loss or illness, they can choose to use a previous year’s higher income on their tax return when claiming the credit.</p>
<p>Third, the credit would phase in at 15% per dollar per child on earnings above $2,500, therefore allowing bigger families to reach the full credit faster (as illustrated in a helpful <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/new-child-tax-credit-proposal-versus-old-concerns-about-work-incentives" target="_blank">table</a> from the Tax Policy Center).</p>
<p>“For example, a family that consists of a married couple with three children — one parent earns $32,000 as a farm worker, while the other parent stays at home to care for their two younger kids, while their older one is in school — I mean, under the expansion, the family would get about $1,900 per child for a total of $5,800. And that is an increase of almost $1,000 compared to current law,” Hingtgen said. “So that’s real money that the family can use to help buy food, clothes or school materials for their children.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Senate GOP opposition</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>While the legislation received overwhelming bipartisan support in the U.S. House on Jan. 31 when it passed in a <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/202430?Page=2" target="_blank">357-70</a> vote, the deal is hitting opposition from some Republican lawmakers in the U.S. Senate.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Cdd7yRZGJr"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/16/state-report-finds-child-care-is-unaffordable-for-most-virginia-families-with-young-kids/">State report finds child care is unaffordable for most Va. families with young kids</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;State report finds child care is unaffordable for most Va. families with young kids&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/16/state-report-finds-child-care-is-unaffordable-for-most-virginia-families-with-young-kids/embed/#?secret=39jaakjNVd#?secret=Cdd7yRZGJr" data-secret="Cdd7yRZGJr" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>Several, including GOP Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho, the ranking member on the Senate Committee on Finance, hope to make “necessary changes to build support,” as Crapo stated after the lower chamber’s vote.</p>
<p>Both Crapo and Republican Sen. John Thune of South Dakota told reporters that one of their top concerns is the “look-back” provision that would allow parents to use prior-year earnings, according to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/31/house-passes-an-expanded-child-tax-credit-bill-and-sends-it-to-the-senate.html" target="_blank">comments</a> the senators made during hallway interviews compiled by Crapo’s office.</p>
<p>Researchers at the American Enterprise Institute published a <a href="https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/The-Work-Incentive-and-Employment-Effects-of-Eliminating-the-Child-Tax-Credits-Annual-Income-Requirement-2.pdf?x91208" target="_blank">paper</a> in January warning that the option for parents to calculate their eligibility using their current earnings or the prior year’s income “would have important impacts on the labor market that require further study before being considered for passage by Congress.”</p>
<p>According to the AEI’s analysis, the every-other-year change would “lead over 700,000 parents to stop working.” At the same time, the change would double the work incentive for a minority of caregivers who don’t work in a two-year period and “lead 395,000 parents to start working,” write the researchers Kevin Corinth, Angela Rachidi, Matt Weidinger and Scott Winship.</p>
<p>Hingtgen refutes that argument.</p>
<p>“The credit as a whole is only going to families that have earnings, and the look-back provision is only applying to people who have a history of earnings, so it is really not a concern,” she said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Coupling the expansion with corporate tax breaks</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Other <a href="https://patrioticmillionaires.org/2024/02/01/congress-is-trading-horses-kids-are-losing-out/" target="_blank">criticism</a> of the deal is aimed at the “horsetrading” that lawmakers are characterizing as compromise, according to the group Patriotic Millionaires.</p>
<p>Alongside the child tax credit expansion, the legislation revives corporate tax breaks that are winding down or expired under the 2017 tax law.</p>
<p>Among them is a provision that allows companies to expense purchases, for example a $30 million piece of equipment, in the first taxable year rather than getting a deduction over a multi-year period, as was previous law.</p>
<p>Patriotic Millionaires, a group of high-net-worth individuals who lobby Congress on tax policy, calls this “a lopsided trade.”</p>
<p>“Those tax cuts are going into the pockets of America’s very, very rich,” said Bob Lord, the group’s senior adviser on tax policy. “There shouldn’t have to be ransom paid to America’s super rich every time we want to help poor children.”</p>
<p>A timeframe on when the tax deal could receive a vote in the Senate is unclear.</p>
<p>If opposing senators let the upper chamber’s legislative clock run out on the deal this year, the lawmakers will not be able to escape looming tax policy negotiations as the Trump-era tax law further winds down in 2025.</p>
<p>Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, chair of the Senate Finance Committee, is in regular talks with colleagues and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, according to committee staff.</p>
<p>“No decisions have been made at this point with respect to a markup or floor process, but obviously Senator Wyden’s goal is to move as quickly as possible to get the expanded CTC out to kids and families who qualify,” said Ryan Carey, committee spokesperson.</p>

But new attention to the issue — including multiple legislative studies, the involvement of the Virginia State Bar and the National Center for State Courts, and a bill, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb893" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB893</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, from Del. Adele McClure, with several House and Senate co-patrons — could make a difference this year.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Inadequate legal representation for families</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/child-abuse-mandatory-reporting-laws-rcna50715" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">harms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/21/nyregion/foster-care-nyc-jane-crow.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">racial</span></a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/22/nyregion/nyc-acs-racism-abuse-neglect.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">inequities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of our American foster care system have been witnessed by the public eye through articles and opinion pieces in various national media outlets, as well as reports by the </span><a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/litigation/resources/newsletters/childrens-rights/racial-discrimination-child-welfare-human-rights-violation-lets-talk-about-it-way/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Bar Association</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2022/11/17/if-i-wasnt-poor-i-wouldnt-be-unfit/family-separation-crisis-us-child-welfare" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Human Rights Watch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and books such as  “Shattered Bonds” by Professor Dorothy Roberts. Though designed to protect children, the system often traumatizes them and tears families apart, sometimes permanently. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, one issue that contributes to poor outcomes for children in foster care is the extremely poor system of legal representation for parents of children in foster care. Multiple other states have vastly improved the quality of legal representation for parents, because this has been shown to improve outcomes for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">children</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the system. These improvements led the federal Children’s Bureau, which provides guidance, supervision, and funding to states’ foster care agencies to improve the quality of parents’ legal representation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Virginia has known since 2015, following </span><a href="https://vcoy.virginia.gov/Parents%20Court%20Appointed%20Attorneys%20Child%20Welfare%20-%20Final%20Report.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Virginia Commission on Youth, that it pays the lowest compensation of all the states for the attorneys appointed to represent indigent parents in child dependency (foster care) matters: $120 flat per case (sometimes including multiple hearings). This amount is unchanged since the year 2000. Due to this, judges report they cannot find attorneys to appoint to cases. Further, attorneys are not trained in representing parents, and there are no standards of practice and no oversight or monitoring of this practice area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even before 2015, other states had surged ahead of Virginia in correcting these issues by implementing a legal representation model (called variously the multi-disciplinary or holistic model) that has been found – through several robust studies in diverse states – to improve outcomes not just for parents, but for children</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in the system. Since then, other states have taken advantage of federal dollars that became available in 2019 to implement such improvements. But Virginia remains regressive, steadfastly rejecting attempts in </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+sum+SB1028" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2015</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+HB401" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2022/1/SB30/Introduced/MR/345/9s/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2022</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB940" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2023</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to improve the quality of legal representation provided to parents and thus outcomes for children in the care of the state.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Worse yet, there is compelling evidence that </span><a href="https://www.dss.virginia.gov/geninfo/annual_report/fam_serv/index.html?pageID=4" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia could save money</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — as much as $80 million a year — if it were to implement </span><a href="https://www.law.nyu.edu/news/ideas/martin-guggenheim-family-defense-clinic-interdisciplinary" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recommended changes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to our system, including this holistic model which would cost pennies on the dollar. Virginia spends an average of $835,000 per day on foster care ($305 million annually for 5,000 children in care). New legislative studies, released in </span><a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2023/SD8/PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">November 2023</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2024/RD116/PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">January 2024</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, have brought additional information and attention to the issue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">States that have improved the quality of legal representation to families in this system have found savings are significant: fewer courts rescheduled hearings (because attorneys are fully prepared) and children exited foster care on average </span><a href="http://partnersforourchildren.org/resources/publications/evaluation-impact-enhanced-parental-legal-representation-timing-permanency" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">four months faster</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, regardless of the type of permanency outcome (reunification, relative guardianship, or adoption). With at least </span><a href="https://www.dss.virginia.gov/geninfo/annual_report/fam_serv/index.html?pageID=3" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5,000 children</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in care in Virginia, even one</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">less month in foster care per child could save Virginia over </span><a href="https://www.dss.virginia.gov/geninfo/annual_report/fam_serv/index.html?pageID=4" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$25 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> annually, according to my calculations. Further, </span><a href="https://www.naccchildlaw.org/general/custom.asp?page=TitleIVforLegalRepresentation" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">federal funds are available</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to reimburse nearly 22% of costs of these improvements,but Virginia leaves these federal dollars on the table. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, the Virginia State Bar has stepped in. In a rare move, its governing body the Bar Council </span><a href="https://virginialawyer.vsb.org/publication/?m=53176&amp;i=808382&amp;p=44&amp;ver=html5" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voted unanimously to take a position on the matter,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the Supreme Court of Virginia has granted permission to the agency to advocate for measures to improve the system. The last time the State Bar took such action, nearly 20 years ago, it made a difference in criminal defense cases. Will it help turn the tide on this matter this year? </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virginia’s poor child welfare system metrics</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has some of the worst outcomes nationally for children in the system. We are consistently at or near the bottom in metrics such as aging out of foster care </span><a href="https://datacenter.aecf.org/data/customreports/48/5945,6273,6277" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(16% vs 9% nationally) and reunification with parents (27% vs 47% nationally</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One reason for our poor metrics is that Virginia pays its court-appointed attorneys for parents of children in the system the least of any state in the country, $120 flat per case stage, a rate unchanged since 2000, as I previously noted. The decrease in the value of the dollar since that year means the compensation is now functionally $64. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nor does the state provide specialized training for attorneys representing parents. As a result of these problems, judges often cannot find any attorneys willing to take such cases. Parents report their attorneys only meet with them (if at all), in the five minutes prior to a hearing, and attorneys report they are paid less than minimum wage when they attempt to provide meaningful representation to their clients. But multiple studies in a variety of states show that when parents are provided with high-quality legal representation, their children spend less time in foster care and are more likely to find safe permanent homes, whether through reuniting with their family, placement with a relative guardian, or adoption.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People unfamiliar with the system sometimes ask: “Why should we give bad parents good lawyers?” But the data shows that a large majority of “neglect” cases are due to lack of resources, not parents’ commitment. Over half of the cases reported to child protective services in Virginia are invalid; of valid cases, only about 30% warrant an investigation. Fewer than half of those are deemed “founded.” Of the founded cases, </span><a href="https://cpsaccountability.dss.virginia.gov/index-social-services.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">60%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are due to “physical neglect.” The Virginia Department of Social Services data indicates many physical neglect cases are really poverty-adjacent neglect, or PANS. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good lawyering can ameliorate PANS by providing help for a family facing separation due to eviction or lack of childcare, exploring less drastic alternatives with the family, or questioning whether the agency provided legally-mandated “reasonable efforts” to prevent child removal. Good legal advocacy can keep families together by addressing family needs as well as agency concerns. If a child is removed from their parents’ home, high-quality parent counsel can help the child </span><a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/public_interest/child_law/resources/child_law_practiceonline/january---december-2019/providing-parents-multidisciplinary-legal-representation-signifi/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">exit foster care sooner</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="y4cVP0mqYf"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/08/09/stolen-afghan-child-needs-to-be-returned-to-her-rightful-family/">Stolen Afghan child needs to be returned to her rightful family</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Stolen Afghan child needs to be returned to her rightful family&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/08/09/stolen-afghan-child-needs-to-be-returned-to-her-rightful-family/embed/#?secret=9XHfEcWGaj#?secret=y4cVP0mqYf" data-secret="y4cVP0mqYf" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well-trained attorneys work with social workers to advocate for a family’s needs, and push agencies to provide mandated services. When attorneys have time and skills to garner necessary evidence, research case law, and advocate for the client, parents become more committed to their part of the process — addressing the concerns that brought a child into care — because they know their attorneys are working diligently on their behalf. But in Virginia, as one attorney in Alexandria put it in a recent email to me, “we are set up to fail from the moment of appointment.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Will Virginia finally act?</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has repeatedly failed to implement recommended improvements to address its system failures. Del. McClure’s bill reflects the recommendations of the 2023 studies and would, if passed, establish practice standards, training, support and oversight to parents’ counsel (Virginia currently lacks all of these). It would also pilot the  multidisciplinary law offices that have shown such excellent results for children and families in other states (this is how the </span><a href="https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/virginias-pilot-public-defender-program-report-virginia-public" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Indigent Defense Commission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was created, for similar reasons, in 1972), and establish pre-petition legal advocacy within the multidisciplinary model. Such early advocacy has been implemented in 26 states, with all of them seeing </span><a href="https://www.ncjfcj.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/early-legal-advocacy-2.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">similar improvements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for family preservation and state budget cost savings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a state where “parents matter,” improving outcomes for children, strengthening low-income families, and providing due process for parents, all while saving money, is a win for all. It is well past time for the state to act on what a Virginia judge has called “one of the most critical issues in the administration of justice in Virginia.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s always fun to see what the most popular baby names will be in Virginia,” said Seth Austin, state registrar and director of the Virginia Department of Health’s Office of Vital Records </span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/news/2024-news-releases/virginia-department-of-healths-office-of-vital-records-announces-top-baby-names-of-2023-other-interesting-virginia-birth-data/?utm_campaign=20240206_&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in a release</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tuesday. “The inspiration for a name can come from so many different places, and no matter the inspiration, these new babies’ names will be central to their identity as they grow up and do great things in the world.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides repeats Charlotte and Liam, many of this year’s top baby names also made last year’s list. Emma, Olivia, Ava, Sophia, Amelia, Evelyn, Elizabeth, Eleanor, Harper and Abigail proved perennial favorites for girls, as did Noah, James, Oliver, William, Lucas, Henry, Theodore, Benjamin, Levi, Elijah and John for boys. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, state data showed August was the busiest month of the year for births, but July 7 saw more infants ushered into the commonwealth — 332, to be exact — than any other day in the year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you believe </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monday%27s_Child" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the old “Monday’s Child” poem</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> linking character to the day of the week a baby is born, Virginia has a lot of little ones right now who are “loving and giving,” with 14,231 babies born on a Friday in 2023. On the flipside, only 8,768 were born on a Sunday, meaning the state’s ranks of babies who are “bonny and blithe, good and gay” may be depleted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a final tally of births isn’t yet available for last year, the Office of Vital Records estimates the number will be similar to the 95,583 recorded in 2022. </span></p>

I was both excited and nervous, but I was also sure that I was making the right decision. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For people looking to grow their families, surrogacy is a highly reliable – and sometimes singular – way to become parents. In addition to the barriers that same-sex couples face, </span><a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/infertility#tab=tab_1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one in six</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> couples globally face infertility issues that may prevent them from growing their family without the help of a surrogate, egg or sperm donor. And in Virginia alone, over </span><a href="https://resolve.org/learn/financial-resources-for-family-building/insurance-coverage/getting-insurance-coverage-at-work/number-of-infertile-by-state/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">250,000 women of childbearing age</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> experienced infertility as of 2020.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;New postpartum depression pill can help Virginia moms but isn’t a magic fix&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/24/new-postpartum-depression-pill-can-help-virginia-moms-but-isnt-a-magic-fix/embed/#?secret=YOKAijlBdy#?secret=suAybEGL9w" data-secret="suAybEGL9w" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Virginia women struggling with infertility who might also be wondering if surrogacy is right for them – or who are open to considering it – this is my story as a former surrogate and current surrogacy advocate, who wants to assist potential parents just like you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surrogacy is a life-changing and fulfilling experience, and it is one that should be made with great consideration and thoughtfulness. The reality is that it’s not all smiles and rainbows. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I decided to become a surrogate in 2010 and worked with an agency to match me to prospective parents. When I first met the intended parents who I would be carrying for during our welcome call, a same-sex couple who lived overseas, I knew their goals for communication and the surrogacy aligned perfectly with mine. It was amazing getting to meet them; with the agency’s assistance, I was able to learn about their culture, their goals and, ultimately, their vision of parenthood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, questions remained. I knew that I had easy pregnancies with my own two children, but I wondered whether it would be different to undergo the </span><a href="https://www.surrogacy.com/medical-questions" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">IVF (in vitro fertilization) process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a necessary step to be able to carry my intended parents&#8217; embryo(s). Was this something I was really ready to do?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I eventually got pregnant with twins, but as it turns out, it </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">was </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">very different from my previous pregnancies.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_37671" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:288px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Twins.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-37671" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Twins-288x300.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="300" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Twins-288x300.jpg 288w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Twins-983x1024.jpg 983w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Twins-768x800.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Twins.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 288px) 100vw, 288px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Niki Renslow, a former surrogate and three-time egg donor living in Hampton Roads, Virginia, shown during her surrogate pregnancy with twins in 2014. (Provided photo)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actually, everything I wasn&#8217;t prepared for did happen, and I wish I&#8217;d had a community of surrogates around me, supporting me as I went through my surrogacy journey. Prior to getting pregnant with the twins, I suffered two miscarriages and had a third failed embryo transfer. Because of this, I had to pause my surrogacy journey, and it wasn&#8217;t until the parents were able to find a new egg donor and create new embryos that they came back to ask me to try one more time — my fourth and final embryo transfer, which was a success. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During my pregnancy, I also found myself correcting peoples&#8217; misconceptions. People asked me if I felt like I was giving the twins away, and I had to explain that there was no genetic connection between me and the twins. These twins already had parents. I&#8217;ll never forget the day the twins were born or seeing them with their dads for the first time. I just kept thinking, &#8220;We did it!&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I approached surrogacy for the first time, I was grappling with all of the questions, concerns, and uncertainties that come with such an intimate and personal journey. I would have liked to have a community of surrogates who had gone through or were currently going through a pregnancy journey like mine. I longed for a place where I could ask my questions, hear the honest truth, and take in a real picture of what the process and experience is like. There were dozens of clinics and health centers in Virginia that offer surrogacy services, but there was no cohesive network connecting women acting as surrogates here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I made a decision to become a resource for other surrogates, and now I&#8217;m a full-time member of the </span><a href="https://www.surrogacy.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surrogacy.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> team, which is the very resource that I wish I had: a 100% surrogate-centered community designed to educate, guide, onboard and support future surrogates. Surrogates need a personable, trusted, candid resource that can provide them with the facts, know-how, and support they need on their surrogacy journey. There’s no one better to provide that guidance and sense of community than former surrogates themselves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every day, I have the pleasure of introducing other women to surrogacy and creating supportive communities for surrogates. In my role, I’m able to answer questions for surrogates in Virginia and elsewhere in the country who are facing the same misconceptions and misinformation surrounding surrogacy that I did. In the process, I hope that I’m also helping normalize surrogacy as the way some people become parents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I remain close with the family that I helped to create and feel so much joy from witnessing their happiness over the years. Now, 10 years after the twins were born, our families still video via Skype and send updates through email, and I have the chance to see the twins grow. In 2017, I was even able to see the twins in person when I traveled abroad for a work conference. That meeting will always hold a special place in my heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mothers like me are in a unique position to consider whether surrogacy is one way they will choose to give back. I continue to tell my surrogacy journey story in the hopes that it will inspire other moms in my Virginia community to consider becoming surrogates and help someone else grow their family. </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Democrats are again backing a proposal to create a universal paid family and medical leave program that would be run through the Virginia Employment Commission. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation carried by </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb373" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB737" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Briana Sewell, D-Prince William</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, would adopt the general model used for unemployment insurance to cover the costs of up to 12 weeks of leave in a year for the birth of a child, care for a family member or a serious health condition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the federal Family and Medical Leave Act requires employers with 50 or more workers to provide up to 12 weeks of leave for similar reasons — known as qualifying events — it does not require that employees be paid during that time. Boysko and Sewell’s proposal would guarantee that workers who meet the criteria for the benefit would receive 80% of their wages during leave.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For far too long people have been forced to make the incredibly difficult decision of caring for someone they love or skipping a paycheck,” said Sewell during a press conference on the proposal Monday. “And women in particular are hard hit by this challenge because we also often are the de facto caregivers for our families and for our loved ones.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program would be funded by contributions from both employers and employees. Boysko and Sewell estimate the cost would equal roughly 0.5% of a worker’s paycheck; for a worker earning $50,000 annually, Sewell said earlier this month that would equate to $4.57 per week, or about $238 per year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presenting the bill in committee, Boysko said Virginia workers shouldn&#8217;t have to face the &#8220;cruel choice&#8221; between staying gainfully employed and taking time away for pressing family priorities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t have to be this way. And it&#8217;s not like this in the rest of the world,&#8221; Boysko said. &#8220;Virginia can be a family-friendly place for workers.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the legislation passes, the commonwealth would join 12 other states, including Maryland and Delaware, and the District of Columbia in providing paid family and medical leave. But while Democrats have the numbers to push the proposal through both the House of Delegates and the Senate, they will need to gain the approval of Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin to get it across the finish line. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/08/mid-session-update-whats-still-alive-and-whats-dead-or-on-the-way-there/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">last year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> succeeded in killing the legislation in the House, and they have unanimously opposed it at the committee level this year. Several influential business groups have also spoken out against it, saying it would interfere with employers’ ability to make their own decisions about what’s doable for their workplace. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s our stance that employers should be able to craft benefit packages appropriate to their industry,&#8221; said Travis Smiley, a lobbyist for the grocery store-focused Virginia Food Industry Association. Grocery stores usually see high employee turnover, Smiley said, which brings &#8220;unique challenges.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few business groups such as the Virginia Small Business Council, however, have said a state insurance pool would help smaller businesses with fewer resources offer workers a valuable benefit that could improve retention and drive down employee turnover.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is leveling the playing field, giving small businesses an opportunity to compete with the huge corporations,” said Shirley Modlin, the owner of a small manufacturing company in Powhatan and a member of Small Business Majority&#8217;s Virginia Small Business Council. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin has so far been silent on the proposal. Asked about his stance, spokesman Christian Martinez said only that the governor would review any legislation that comes to his desk. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They have not spoken in opposition,” said Sewell. “They have not spoken in support.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both she and Boysko are pitching the plan as aligned with priorities voiced by the governor in his December </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/12/20/youngkin-budget-calls-for-income-tax-cuts-sales-tax-increases/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">budget proposal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about the need to “empower working parents” and to address child care shortfalls that have caused women, in particular, to drop out of the workforce.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The governor has talked about his desire to unleash opportunity here in the commonwealth of Virginia,” said Sewell. “I think it’s time that he unleash opportunity for workers who need to care for their families.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both bills will now be reviewed by the chambers’ money committees.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why Virginia should join a handful of pioneering states that provide free breakfasts and/or lunches to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">all</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> K-12 schoolkids, regardless of family income. Those states include</span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/school-lunch-free-colorado-districts-want-meal-benefits-applications/#:~:text=Colorado%20voters%20approved%20Prop%20FF,income%20earners%20in%20our%20state" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Colorado</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/01/11/schools-swamped-by-lunch-debt/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">California and Maine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia state Sen. Danica Roem, a Manassas Democrat who’s authored several successful bills involving school meals since joining the General Assembly in 2018, has sponsored</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb283" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 283</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this General Assembly session.

The proposal would cost $346 million over the next two years.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s likely many wealthy and middle-income families would decline the assistance. That’s no problem: The school meals legislation provides an opt out clause for parents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other families, though, would welcome the help. News stories from recent years of individual schools or divisions piling up debt because families either couldn’t pay, or because students ambled through meal lines not knowing their accounts were overdrawn, are easy to find.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prince William County Public Schools – the state’s second largest behind Fairfax County – ended the 2022-23 school year</span><a href="https://www.princewilliamtimes.com/news/prince-william-students-end-the-year-with-nearly-350k-in-school-meal-debt/article_c3fcc952-f4ee-11ed-ae4c-c38e0e0fa484.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">with almost $350,000 in school meal debt</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Students in Henrico County public schools</span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/school-meal-debt-racks-up-in-virginia-after-federal-aid-ended/article_c515ced8-db12-11ed-ae96-2b759ce6b3d5.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">had accrued more than $50,000</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> halfway through that year, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">School divisions then have to take money from other categories – such as funding for books or additional teachers –</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/01/11/schools-swamped-by-lunch-debt/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to make up the shortfall</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concerned residents in Virginia, like</span><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Food/1-woman-helping-settle-school-lunch-debt-advocating/story?id=99956257" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Adelle Settle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and teacher</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/02/11/school-meal-debt-teacher/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Gabe Segal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, have pitched in to help schools eliminate their debt and end so-called “lunch shaming.” The former’s nonprofit, aptly named</span><a href="https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/food/story/1-woman-helping-settle-school-lunch-debt-advocating-99956257" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“Settle the Debt,”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has even been featured on national television. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such citizen philanthropy shouldn’t be necessary, though. We can all help in much the same way that our tax dollars support teacher pay, school buses and books. Roem is fond of saying no one gets upset when students in richer communities use school buses; it’s an expected cost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 283 passed 11-4 in the Senate Committee on Education and Health. One committee member, Sen. Mark Peake, R-Lynchburg, said wealthy counties shouldn’t need free meals. But Roem noted that even in those localities, there can be pockets of low- and middle-income families who could use the lunch-line help.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I tried reaching the four Republicans who voted against the bill on the panel. None of them responded to my emailed questions. (Two Republican senators voted for the measure.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My inquiries included whether the opponents favored the pending</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/15/capitals-wizards-potomac-yard-arena-finances-virginia-dc/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$1.35 billion taxpayer subsidy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would go to building a Northern Virginia sports arena to lure the Washington Capitals and Wizards from the District of Columbia. If approved, the funding would be the largest-ever public subsidy for a project of its kind, The Washington Post reported. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know we’re not talking an apples-to-apples comparison with school meals. But the two initiatives are worth examining together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a question of priorities. What kind of government spending do legislators favor? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The arena deal includes a</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/13/capitals-wizards-move-alexandria-potomac-yard/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">12-acre mixed-use complex</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, bond offerings and all sorts of financial projections. Monumental Sports &amp; Entertainment, the group that would bring the teams to Virginia, would pay $403 million up front and rent starting annually at $29.5 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The potential tax dollars from the complex make politicians salivate.</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/15/capitals-wizards-potomac-yard-arena-finances-virginia-dc/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Youngkin has said the public money</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> being offered would mostly come from revenue that wouldn’t exist without the project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind, though, that Ted Leonsis, managing partner of Monumental, has a net worth of</span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/theodore-leonsis/?sh=610d2e3a6e84" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$2.8 billion, according to Forbes.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He’s among the richest people in the world. And Virginians could be shelling out a lot of bucks for the privilege of saying: “We host major league teams!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">True, free meals to students is a net revenue “loser.” But they’re an investment in human capital – akin to public libraries and recreation centers. They improve children’s lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We shouldn’t be the last state to sign on to free school meals. Our children will thank us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And they won’t risk embarrassment by asking for something to eat.</span></p>

(Photo courtesy of Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bill that would provide free meals for all public school students in Virginia passed the Senate Education and Health Committee Thursday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is about making sure that every kid who goes to school gets fed — no questions asked,” said Sen. Danica Roem, D-Manassas, the patron for </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB283" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 283</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, earlier this month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal would cost </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2024/1/SB30/Introduced/MR/125/29s/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an estimated $346 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the next two years.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Republicans including Sen. Mark Peake, R-Lynchburg, balked at the cost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I just obviously do not want any child to go hungry and do not want any child who cannot afford a meal to go hungry, either breakfast or lunch, but I just think at this point, I&#8217;m not quite ready to say that the commonwealth is going to pay for breakfast and lunch for every child in the commonwealth when you got [wealthy] counties,” Peake said. “I just don&#8217;t see that we should take general fund dollars to pay for breakfast and lunch in some of the wealthiest counties in the commonwealth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roem noted even Virginia’s wealthiest counties, such as Loudoun, have schools that qualify for federal school lunch programs and have significant school meal debt. Furthermore, she said,  many families fall just outside the eligibility limit for free and reduced meals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Catherine Ford, a lobbyist representing the School Nutrition Association of Virginia, contended the state should be putting funds toward universal meals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe that just like textbooks, just like school buses, just like desks, that meals should be provided to children at school,” Ford said.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Proposal</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If passed, all public school divisions in Virginia would be required to make meals available for free to any student unless their parent had notified the school board to not do so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state would reimburse schools for each meal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, only schools that qualify for the federal Community Eligibility Provision can offer all students free meals. Schools qualify for the CEP if a certain percentage of their students are classified as low-income.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previously the federal government set that threshold at 40%, but this September the U.S. Department of Agriculture lowered it to 25%, a change it said would </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“give states and schools greater flexibility to offer meals to all enrolled students at no cost when financially viable.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roem’s measure would expand free meals to even those schools that don’t qualify for the CEP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation would also require school boards to adopt policies to maximize their use of federal funds for free breakfast and lunch and create a workgroup to study the potential impact of offering guaranteed school meals.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A step beyond earlier legislation</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roem said this year’s proposal is an extension of </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?202+sum+HB5113" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a 2020 bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> she successfully carried that required divisions to apply to enroll any schools in CEP that qualified for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally, Roem said school breakfasts in Virginia cost $34 million per year, while lunches cost $138 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a Jan. 11 hearing on her newest proposal, Roem said that because of the 2020 legislation, 44 schools in Prince William County, which lies in her district, have zero school meal debt compared to more than 50 schools that just enrolled in the CEP this year and had together collected $291,256 of school meal debt in the first semester of the prior year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not every single student who attends a CEP school can&#8217;t afford their own breakfast and lunch,” Roem said. “A lot of them come from families that can, but most of the students … have enough insecurity at home financially that they need help, and collectively, we&#8217;ve decided it&#8217;s in our interest, it&#8217;s in the student&#8217;s interest and it’s the parent&#8217;s interest to make sure that we are taking care of everyone at the school.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adelle Settle, founder of nonprofit Settle the Debt, which raised roughly $250,000 last year to pay down the lunch debt for students in Prince William County, said she often hears from parents “who earn just over the threshold to receive free or reduced meals for their students, but they&#8217;re still struggling and they need help to pay for those school meals.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meal debt, Roem also said, is “money that could’ve gone into other areas such as a classroom or computer lab.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And frankly, if the federal government isn&#8217;t going to do its job, as far as I&#8217;m concerned, of fully funding universal free school meals for all, then we&#8217;ve got to step in and take care of our student constituents,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill now goes to the Senate Finance and Appropriations Committee for consideration.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Addressing food insecurity in higher education</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roem is also carrying </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB318" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 318</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would create a grant program to address food insecurity among students at public colleges or universities in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill is also heading to Senate Finance and Appropriations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With college enrollment still lower than it was pre-pandemic, addressing food insecurity can help students afford tuition and housing so they can stay in school and graduate on time,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the program, public institutions could apply for grants to address food insecurity.</span></p>

(AP Photo/John Bazemore)</p><p>A federal program built to improve nutrition for new mothers and kids is growing for the first time in over a decade, thanks to changes made during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Since its pilot program began in 1974, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children — better known as WIC — has provided food, nutrition support and education to pregnant and postpartum women, toddlers and infants through states, tribes and territorial governments.</p>
<p>But difficulties accessing WIC, including frequent in-person appointments for education and monitoring, have long suppressed participation. On average, only half of the people eligible for WIC enroll, and between 2010 and 2021 nationwide caseloads fell 32%, <a href="https://fns-prod.azureedge.us/sites/default/files/resource-files/wisummary-12.pdf" target="_blank">according to</a> the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the program.</p>
<p>That appears to be changing in most states, however — much to the relief of women&#8217;s and children’s health advocates, who say WIC has a proven track record of improving the health of women and children. In 2023, WIC experienced significant growth for the first time since the Great Recession of 2008, outpacing federal projections and reaching an estimated 6.6 million Americans.</p>
<p>“There are lots of opportunities right now, and we’re accomplishing things that I never thought we’d be able to get done,” said Ali Hard, the policy director for the National WIC Association, which advocates on behalf of state and local WIC agencies, and a former senior policy adviser at the Agriculture Department. “It’s terrible circumstances, of course — but I do think the pandemic led to a lot of really exciting innovation.”</p>
<p>But the expansion comes at a moment of enormous uncertainty for WIC. Many of the technology changes that made it easier to participate were authorized by temporary federal waivers during the pandemic, and Congress would need to change the law to extend them. And some Republican lawmakers argue that because the extra federal money during the pandemic was meant to cover the emergency, spending should return to earlier levels.</p>
<p>The innovations include sweeping changes to WIC benefits and services, which moved online in many states during the pandemic. The Agriculture Department authorized state and tribal agencies to conduct nutrition screenings and education by phone or video, and more than doubled funding for fruit and vegetable vouchers. Federal COVID-19 relief measures also funneled $390 million to WIC projects aimed at improving outreach and access.</p>
<p>Even states that have traditionally lagged in WIC enrollment, such as Missouri, Utah and Wyoming, saw upticks in participation last year as policymakers and administrators moved to make the program more accessible.</p>
<p>“It’s wonderful news,” said Anne Strope, the administrative coordinator for Missouri WIC, which in early December reported a preliminary annual participation increase of more than 7%, to <a href="https://fns-prod.azureedge.us/sites/default/files/resource-files/26wifypart-12.pdf" target="_blank">about 90,000 residents</a>, for the 2023 fiscal year. “We’re really excited about the changes we’re making to get services back to Missourians who need them.”</p>
<p>But continuing to pay for the additional participants may be difficult. Unlike food stamps or Medicaid, WIC is not an entitlement program — it can only support additional participants if Congress allocates funding for them.</p>
<p>The program has traditionally enjoyed strong bipartisan support, and both Democratic- and Republican-controlled Congresses have funded WIC in full, covering everyone who applies and qualifies, for more than 25 years. The White House says that, due to rising food costs and increased participation, the program will need an additional $1 billion to continue covering everyone who qualifies in fiscal year 2025.</p>
<p>As federal budget negotiations drag on, however, some House Republicans have signaled a desire to hold WIC funding steady, with no increase to cover new participants. A series of continuing resolutions, passed to buy Congress time as it works out a comprehensive budget deal, also have maintained prior funding levels.</p>
<p>In a new <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/about-2-million-parents-and-young-children-could-be-turned-away-from-wic" target="_blank">analysis</a>, the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimated that states would need to reduce WIC participation by roughly 2 million people by September if Congress does not budget more. That could lead some agencies to create waitlists.</p>
<p>“Those cuts would be devastating,” said Pennsylvania state Sen. Judith Schwank, a Democrat, who recently sponsored bipartisan legislation aimed at improving WIC enrollment in her state. “With need as high as it is right now, we must not let that happen.”</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A ‘really important’ program</h4>

	</h4>
<p>WIC is unique among federal food aid programs in that it provides both resources to help households buy groceries and a suite of additional health and nutrition services. To qualify for WIC, applicants must not only meet federal income guidelines, but also show that they have a medical condition or diet that puts them at “nutritional risk.”</p>
<p>Qualifying participants must undergo a baseline nutrition screening, which typically includes bloodwork and a limited physical exam. They then receive a debit-type card that can be used to buy WIC-approved food items from participating retailers.</p>
<p>State agencies specify which brands and items families can buy, and in what quantities. WIC participants must check in periodically for ongoing nutrition education, counseling and monitoring.</p>
<p>Multiple studies have linked maternal WIC participation with improved birth outcomes, lower infant mortality and better child cognitive development. WIC participation also is associated with healthier diets for mothers and kids.</p>

<p>“It’s a really important source of nutrition support for low-income pregnant women, children and families, because it provides both nutrition education and the funds to purchase nutritious food,” said Dr. Aditi Vasan, a pediatrician at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, where she has conducted research on participation in WIC.</p>
<p>But while WIC’s intensive model yields real health improvements, it also has created some barriers to participation, Vasan said. A mother with two young children might have to visit her WIC clinic as often as three times a month to maintain her status in the program.</p>
<p>Participants frequently report problems scheduling appointments, taking time off work and accessing transportation to WIC offices. Once they receive benefits, they may face challenges finding stores that accept WIC or that stock adequate WIC-approved products.</p>
<p>In Arkansas, for instance — where only 35% of eligible mothers and children participate in WIC — more than a dozen counties have just one authorized WIC store. Determining which brands and sizes of food items are eligible for WIC can confuse participants.</p>
<p>“There’s an awful lot of in-person reporting, a lot of difficulty in using benefits,” said Schwank, the Pennsylvania state senator. “We want to make sure families have access to WIC — but why can’t it be more convenient?”</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Pandemic changes</h4>

	</h4>
<p>For policymakers and agencies working on that question, the pandemic proved both a blessing and a curse. The sudden closure of government offices exacerbated WIC’s long-standing challenges — and forced the country’s 89 WIC state agencies to rapidly adapt their services.</p>
<p>At the federal level, pandemic stimulus bills funneled $390 million to WIC modernization projects, including dozens of state and local efforts to improve WIC outreach and digital services. In 2021, Congress temporarily boosted the value of WIC benefits, granting as much as $41 additional per person per month to cover fruit and vegetable purchases.</p>
<p>Most importantly, said Hard, of the National WIC Association, Congress and the Agriculture Department permitted WIC offices to conduct health screenings and other appointments via phone or video call and issue benefits entirely by mail or electronic transfer.</p>
<p>“The continuing increase in participation is a testament to this model,” said Shannon Whaley, the director of research and evaluation at the Public Health Foundation Enterprises WIC program, which serves 180,000 people in Southern California.</p>

<p>“You can come in once or twice a year instead of four times a year or six times a year,” Whaley said. “You can get your services on your phone. You don’t have to leave your job to go to a WIC clinic — we can schedule your appointment during your lunch break. It has really transformed the program.”</p>
<p>But some states struggled to switch to telehealth and remote services — a consequence, in many cases, of the system’s technology. Since 2009, most states have adopted online or “mag stripe” processing systems that allow staff to load benefits to participants’ cards remotely.</p>
<p>Nine states, however — Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah and Wyoming — still use an older offline or “smart card” system, which requires that participants physically present their card at a WIC office to receive benefits, according to a research paper Vasan co-authored.</p>
<p>Participation plummeted in offline states during the pandemic. The 2021 <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2783501" target="_blank">paper</a> by Vasan and four colleagues, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, found that offline states experienced a 9.3% drop in WIC participation compared with states using online systems. In Missouri, enrollment fell a startling 19% between 2019 and 2021, federal data <a href="https://ixd-studio.wesdemo.com/fns/" target="_blank">shows</a>.</p>
<p>“It was frustrating,” said Strope, who oversees Missouri WIC. “Every step, every setback in the past three years, it was like, ‘OK — we just need to get to online as fast as we can.’”</p>
<p>Missouri is one of at least four “offline” states (Pennsylvania, Utah and Wyoming are the others) transitioning to an online system, according to representatives for each state’s respective WIC agency. The Department of Agriculture is encouraging other states to follow suit.</p>

<p>“The pandemic killed the smart card,” said Johnny Sena, the vice president of product development at Custom Data Processing Inc., a contractor that provides technology services to more than half of the country’s WIC agencies. “When COVID shut everything down, states came up with interesting workarounds for the deficiencies they had — but it still put a damper on that [offline] model. It showed its disadvantages.”</p>
<p>Sena said the pandemic also yielded other innovations, such as new digital portals that WIC staff use to chat or text with participants, and a series of pilot projects to introduce online shopping to the WIC program. In February, the Agriculture Department proposed a new rule that would allow participants nationwide to shop online with their benefits. The department is currently reviewing public comments.</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The future of WIC</h4>

	</h4>
<p>But it’s unclear whether all the recent changes to WIC will remain long term. Many of WIC’s pandemic adaptations, including telehealth and remote appointments, were authorized under temporary federal waivers. By September 2026, when <a href="https://www.nwica.org/press-releases/usda-grants-wic-providers-remote-flexibilities-in-response-to-public-health-emergency-ending" target="_blank">waivers end</a>, Congress will need to change the statute underlying WIC to make those changes permanent, said Hard, of the National WIC Association.</p>
<p>The Agriculture Department also would need additional funding from Congress to continue issuing enhanced fruit and vegetable vouchers, which advocates say are both extremely popular and critical to meeting participants’ nutritional needs. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine <a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2017/01/revisions-to-wic-program-needed-changes-would-save-money-over-time" target="_blank">recommended</a> well before the pandemic that WIC boost its produce offerings, as part of a congressionally mandated review of the program in 2017.</p>
<p>In budget negotiations last year, however, House Republicans sought to claw back funding for the additional fruit and vegetable benefits, arguing they were intended to address an emergency need. Congressional Republicans didn’t increase dollar amounts for WIC in both their proposed 2024 budget and in short-term funding bills passed to avert a government shutdown this fall. The latest short-term bill runs out Jan. 19.</p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Andy Harris, a Maryland Republican who chairs the House subcommittee that oversees WIC’s budget, told fellow lawmakers in June that the USDA could draw on contingency funds to cover increased demand if needed. A spokesperson for Harris did not return requests for comment.</p>
<p>“It’s finally time to be responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars by rescinding these new government giveaways,” Harris told the subcommittee. “We must work to right-size programs, especially since the pandemic is over and President Biden has ended the public health emergency.”</p>
<p>Advocates and researchers fear, however, that the introduction of waitlists and other cost-cutting measures would undermine the progress WIC has made over the past three years. Far from growing too large, they argue, WIC is only just beginning to reach many of the women and children who need it.</p>
<p>“The reality is that this is not really the right time to talk about how to get more [eligible residents] coming into WIC,” said Whaley, the California researcher. “We need to shore up funding just to make sure that current participants can stay on the program.”</p>

<p>Low-income families will now receive $40 each month for each eligible school-aged child, up to $120, to buy groceries beginning in the summer of 2024. The cash will come via electronic benefit transfer, often called EBT, and will be added to food assistance debit cards.</p>
<p>Congress authorized the program’s permanent status in December 2022.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that the program will reach 21 million children — or around 70% of U.S. children eligible for government meal programs — in the states, tribes and territories that signed on to be part of the initial launch.</p>
<p>A list of implementing agencies in those states, tribal lands and territories will be available in the spring of 2024, according to the USDA. USDA is encouraging families to check for updates at <a href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/sebt/household" target="_blank">www.fns.usda.gov/sebt/household</a>.</p>
<p>Notably the participating four tribes have lands in Oklahoma, Texas and Mississippi, three states that are not part of the launch.</p>
<p>The USDA said other states that will not provide the new grocery benefits for low-income children include: Alabama, Alaska, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Louisiana, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming.</p>
<p>Some states are preparing to launch the program in 2025, but the USDA did not identify which ones. Agency language in a press release Wednesday noted that “(w)orking with future implementers is a top priority.”</p>
<p>“No kid should have to spend their summer hungry, or without nutritious food,” USDA Deputy Secretary Xochitl Torres Small said in the press release.</p>
<p>“Summer EBT is a giant step forward in meeting the needs of our nation’s children and families throughout the year, and especially in the summer months.”</p>
<p>Schools are typically where low-income children can access free or reduced breakfast or lunch when classes are in session. Those children become vulnerable to hunger during the summer months, according to the USDA and several organizations that monitor child nutrition assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Pilot programs</strong></p>
<p>USDA cites success during several <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/sfsp/summer-electronic-benefit-transfer-children-sebtc-demonstration-summary-report" target="_blank">pilot programs</a> conducted during the summers of 2012 to 2013 as the basis to recommend the new benefit. During the test programs, amounts ranging from $30 to $60 were provided during summers for families already enrolled in other summer nutrition assistance or the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, otherwise known as WIC.</p>
<p>The new program will expand the reach of already established <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/summer" target="_blank">summer meal programs</a>, according to the USDA. Those programs include free summer meals via delivery or at designated community sites. Private nonprofits, local government agencies and youth sports programs are often the sponsors and played a significant role as the program expanded beyond summer during pandemic school closures.</p>
<p>Participation in those programs has decreased since the pandemic, according to an <a href="https://frac.org/wp-content/uploads/summer-report-2023.pdf" target="_blank">analysis</a> by the Food Research and Action Center, or FRAC. The advocacy organization attributes the decrease in part to Congress’ delay in greenlighting community sponsors to operate the programs in 2022.</p>
<p>Top-ranking states for participation in the summer lunch programs in 2021 and 2022, according to FRAC’s analysis, included New Jersey, New York, Vermont, New Mexico and Maryland. The lowest-ranking states for average daily participation were Texas, Alaska, Oklahoma, North Dakota, Louisiana and Nebraska.</p>

(Getty Images)</p><p>Candy Murnion remembers vividly the event that pushed her to open her first day care business in Jordan, a town of fewer than 400 residents in a sea of grassland in eastern Montana.</p>
<p>Garfield County’s public health nurse, one of few public health officials serving the town and nearly 5,000 square miles that surround it, had quit because she had given birth to her second child and couldn’t find day care.</p>
<p>“My primary goal was to give families a safe place to take their children so they could work if they needed to,” said Murnion, 63. She started in 2015 with eight slots, the maximum she could cover herself, and slowly grew. Then, during the COVID-19 pandemic, a surge in federal aid to child care programs helped her raise wages for her workers and expand to a second facility.</p>
<p>Today, her day care programs, the only ones in Jordan, can serve up to 30 children, ranging from 6 weeks old to school age. But after that pandemic-era funding support ended in September, Murnion began to wonder how long she could sustain her expanded capacity, or whether she’d need to raise prices or lower enrollment.</p>

<p>And she isn’t alone.</p>
<p>Data collected prior to the pandemic shows that <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/americas-child-care-deserts-2018/" target="_blank">more than half</a> of Americans lived in neighborhoods classified as child care deserts, areas that have no child care providers or where there are more than three children in the community for every available licensed care slot. <a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/hrsa/advisory-committees/rural/nac-rural-child-care-brief-23.pdf" target="_blank">Other research shows</a> parents and child care providers in rural areas face unique barriers. Access to quality child care programs and early education is linked to <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hpb20190325.519221/" target="_blank">better educational and behavioral outcomes</a> for kids and can also help link families and children to immunizations, health screenings, and greater food security by providing meals and snacks.</p>
<p>Policymakers and researchers now fear that inequitable child care access threatens the sustainability and longevity of rural communities.</p>
<p>“If we want to keep rural parts of this country alive and thriving, we need to address this,” said Linda Smith, director of the Early Childhood Initiative at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank.</p>
<p>According to an <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/download/?file=/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/BPC_ECI-Rural-Child-Care-Framework_R05.pdf" target="_blank">October report</a> that Smith co-authored, there is a 35% gap between the need for and availability of child care programs in rural areas, compared with 29% in urban areas, based on data from 35 states.</p>
<p>The report echoed concerns local, state, and national experts have raised for a number of years.</p>
<p>A report published last year by the National Advisory Committee on Rural Health and Human Services found that, per capita, more parents rely on family members or friends for child care in rural areas than in urban areas. This isn’t sustainable for parents, said Cara James, CEO and president of Grantmakers in Health, a nonprofit that helps guide health philanthropy.</p>
<p>“Right now, we have a system that’s very expensive for people who can afford it and for people who can access it, not necessarily available to all those who need it,” James said. “That’s leading us to rely on other workarounds that are not ideal or ones that are giving the children the best support that they need to grow into healthy adults.”</p>
<p>For example, according to a state report, Montana’s total child care capacity <a href="https://lmi.mt.gov/_docs/Publications/LMI-Pubs/Special-Reports-and-Studies/ChildCareDesertsWhitePaper-FINAL.pdf" target="_blank">met 44% of estimated demand</a> in 2021 and infant care capacity met only 34% of estimated demand. Garfield County had only 23% of potential demand for children under six. Nationally, the rural health advisory committee has found, child care deserts are most likely to be located in “low-income rural census tracts.”</p>
<p>The dearth of child care in many rural communities exacerbates workforce shortages by forcing parents, including those who work in health care locally, to stay home as full-time caregivers, and by preventing younger workers and families from putting down roots there.</p>
<p>Eighty-six percent of parents in rural areas who are not working or whose partner is not working said in a <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/download/?file=/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/BPC-Rural-Parents-Analysis-9.14-Additional-Analysis-min.pdf" target="_blank">2021 Bipartisan Policy Center survey</a> that child care responsibilities were a reason why, while 45% said they or their spouse cared for at least their youngest child. Staying home to care for children is a responsibility that disproportionately falls on women, affecting their ability to <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2021/beyond-bls/has-covid-19-affected-mothers-labor-market-outcomes.htm#:~:text=Because%20of%20the%20duration%20of,them%20to%20work%20from%20home." target="_blank">participate in the workforce</a> and make an independent living.</p>
<p>A report from the rural health advisory committee shows that when center-based care is readily available in a community, the percentage of mothers who use that type of care and are employed doubles from 11% to 22%.</p>
<p>According to the Biden administration, pandemic emergency funding increased maternal labor workforce participation, stabilized employment and increased wages for child care workers, tempered costs for families, and helped providers afford their facilities.</p>
<p>That funding included <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-106833" target="_blank">$52 billion in emergency aid</a> allocated by Congress for child care program owners and low-income families. Murnion’s day care was one of an estimated 30,000 in rural counties that received federal grants.</p>
<p>She said the roughly $100,000 she received in federal aid allowed her to raise wages for her workers to $13 an hour and expand her facility space. She said she doesn’t take a paycheck from the business and instead relies on income from a family ranch and trucking business.</p>
<p>Now that the federal aid programs have expired, Murnion and other child care operators nationwide are wrestling with how to sustain those wages without hiking the cost of care for parents.</p>
<p>The Biden administration <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/briefing-room/2023/11/02/state-breakdown-the-biden-harris-administrations-funding-request-would-help-prevent-families-across-the-country-from-losing-child-care/" target="_blank">requested congressional approval</a> of $16 billion to extend the pandemic-era child care stabilization program but doesn’t have enough support to continue the funding, despite <a href="https://www.ffyf.org/resources/2023/07/july23poll/" target="_blank">nearly 80% of voters supporting</a> increasing federal funding for states to expand their child care programs.</p>
<p>According to the administration, the funding would support more than 220,000 child care providers in the U.S. that collectively serve more than 10 million kids. Montana would receive an estimated additional $46 million if Congress approved the request.</p>
<p>Although federal aid helped Murnion get through the pandemic, she said she doesn’t want to rely on the government forever. She charges parents $30 a day for one child and $22 a day each for siblings. And she doesn’t charge parents for days their children don’t attend. If she does need to raise prices, Murnion said, she’ll increase the per-sibling cost.</p>

<p>The pandemic provided some meaningful lessons, said Smith of the Bipartisan Policy Center. “Those stabilization grants were, I think, a key to what we actually need to do with child care down the road.”</p>
<p>The number of child care programs has <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/71981d3ec3a1d02537d86d827806834b/Child-Care-Trends-COVID.pdf" target="_blank">grown since before the pandemic</a> in most states, but the employee count per facility has decreased. The federal cash infusion helped child care employment rebound after a 35% dip at the beginning of the pandemic. By November 2022, the number of workers in child care jobs had climbed to 92% of the pre-pandemic level.</p>
<p>In the best circumstances, Smith said, parents would pay more for child care, and the corresponding supply or availability of programs would increase. But because parents are struggling to keep up with the rising costs, which in some places can be more than in-state college tuition, supply is stagnant.</p>
<p>Smith said the end of federal aid programs kicked the issue back to state and local governments. “I think most people would agree that what we need is some type of funding that goes to the programs to keep it so that they can do what they need to do and not charge the parents for it,” she said.</p>
<p>Some state and local governments are doing so. In Alabama, lawmakers <a href="https://www.alabamaschoolreadiness.org/alabama-advocates-celebrate-historic-42-million-increase-in-state-early-childhood-education-investments/#:~:text=Through%20bipartisan%20consensus%2C%20legislators%20approved,care%20rating%20and%20improvement%20program." target="_blank">approved $42 million</a> last year in the state budget for child care. The Missouri state legislature <a href="https://martincitytelegraph.com/2023/09/12/missouri-approves-record-funding-for-early-childhood-education/" target="_blank">approved $160 million</a> for child care. Voters in rural Warren, Minnesota, <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2022/12/14/rural-town-tries-innovative-solution-to-child-care-crisis" target="_blank">narrowly approved</a> a half-percent sales tax to support a child care center that was struggling to stay open.</p>
<p>During last year’s legislative session, Montana lawmakers and Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte <a href="https://montanafreepress.org/2023/06/14/new-childcare-laws-expand-subsidies-deregulate-small-home-based-daycares/#:~:text=Efforts%20by%20Montana%20legislators%20and,daycares%20from%20state%20licensing%20requirements." target="_blank">approved new laws</a> to improve child care access, including removing state licensing requirements for small in-home day cares and expanding a program that helps lower-income families pay for child care.</p>
<p>“You can’t sit here in Washington, D.C., and figure out how you’re going to get child care out in eastern Montana,” Smith said. “It just doesn’t work.”</p>

Glenn Youngkin posing with children for a photo following a press conference in Richmond on Dec. 7, 2023. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the last pandemic-era expansions of federal child care aid to states set to end next year, Gov. Glenn Youngkin is proposing to put $448 million into the commonwealth’s early learning and child care system in each of the next two years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The reality is that in March 2024, without significant reforms to improve this long-term viability of our child care programs, we would otherwise see children simply being kicked out of these most important collaborations that enable families to realize their dreams and so we can&#8217;t leave families, parents and their children without options,” said Youngkin at a press conference for his “Building Blocks for Virginia Families” initiative Thursday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The funding will be part of Youngkin’s proposal for the state budget over the next two years, which he is scheduled to present to lawmakers Dec. 20. The General Assembly, which Democrats will narrowly control when the session begins this January, will use that proposal as the jumping-off point for their own spending plan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the administration has not yet provided a detailed breakdown of how all of the $448 million would be spent, a document provided to reporters includes a list of priorities. They include the desire to “ensure every low-income working family that currently receives public support continues to have access to early childhood and afterschool programs,” “accelerate parent choice, from home-care providers and public school preschools to community co-ops and private day centers,” and require all early childhood programs to “annually measure and report unmet parental demand and preference.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few priorities have dollar figures attached: The proposed investment includes $25 million to develop public-private partnerships in areas with child care shortages, $10 million in educator incentives and $1 million to launch early learning and child care accounts on a digital wallet platform for families with children under five. Families can use the wallets to accept funds from such groups as employers, local governments and family members. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, the plan calls for streamlining teacher licensure requirements and “rightsizing” student-teacher ratios.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is about an opportunity for success,” Youngkin said, “and it starts with success for families.”</span></p>
<p>Kathy Glazer, president of the Virginia Early Childhood Foundation, called the proposal “a remarkable commitment to Virginia’s children and families.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By sustaining access to quality, affordable early childhood care and education services, these investments will help unlock the potential of all children and keep Virginia on the path to economic success,” she said in a statement.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An October report by Virginia’s Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission found approximately 1.1 million children in Virginia aged 12 and younger need child care, and the majority of Virginia families find care to be unaffordable.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="vr8OmJ8Os2"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/16/state-report-finds-child-care-is-unaffordable-for-most-virginia-families-with-young-kids/">State report finds child care is unaffordable for most Va. families with young kids</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;State report finds child care is unaffordable for most Va. families with young kids&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/16/state-report-finds-child-care-is-unaffordable-for-most-virginia-families-with-young-kids/embed/#?secret=NXrlsxXtSg#?secret=vr8OmJ8Os2" data-secret="vr8OmJ8Os2" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The situation is set to worsen. Over the past three years, Virginia has used federal relief funds to help meet child care demand. However, the commonwealth is in jeopardy of being unable to support services when American Rescue Plan Act child care funds expire at the end of the federal fiscal year 2024. JLARC has estimated that 25,000 Virginia children could lose their child care slots as a result of the end of pandemic child care subsidies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As other pandemic relief programs wind down, legislative staffers have told lawmakers that signs are increasingly pointing to the U.S. entering a slowdown or mild recession next year as high revenues over the past few years begin running dry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor has asked state agencies to begin looking at cuts for the July 1, 2024 to June 30, 2026 budget, </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/youngkin-looking-at-potential-spending-cuts-to-save-money-for-next-budget/article_005d09de-7a7d-11ee-838c-a32118694e37.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Richmond Times-Dispatch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has reported. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Child care advocacy groups on Thursday said they hope lawmakers will see the need to keep parents and providers afloat with stable funding and investments. Allison Gilbreath, senior director of policy and programs for Voices for Virginia’s Children, said the proposed investments are “desperately needed.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As a mom, my career begins and ends with access to early childhood that is affordable and accessible for my family,” she said. “So it&#8217;s going to be so meaningful for families across the commonwealth.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Costs</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Child care is unaffordable for most Virginians, especially for low-income families, JLARC found in its recent study.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The October report showed child care is unaffordable for 85% of Virginia’s families with infants, 82% with toddlers and 74% with preschoolers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the </span><a href="https://tcf.org/content/report/child-care-cliff/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Century Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a progressive think tank, the average annual cost of child care currently is more than $10,000 for one child, and in some states, it’s as much as $15,000 to $20,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JLARC’s estimates put the cost of full-time formal child care in Virginia at between $100 and $440 per week per child, or $5,200 to $22,880 annually. Many child care providers charge fees on top of base tuition rates, which further increase the cost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low-income families have relied heavily on Virginia’s Child Care Subsidy Program, which uses federal and state funds to reimburse providers for care services. Last year, the commonwealth received a boost of federal funds for the subsidy program, which JLARC said led to an increase in the number of families receiving subsidized child care and a reduction in copayments for families. Still, demand for subsidy slots remained.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forty-two percent of the state’s licensed child care providers are subsidy vendors, or providers that service children in the program, JLARC reported.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr">RICHMOND, Va. — As a teacher and mother to a child with autism, Elizabeth Callahan is all too familiar with flaws in the Virginia mental health care system.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I see the longevity of it, and there’s just so many holes,” Callahan said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Callahan’s son was diagnosed by a developmental pediatrician at the onset of his symptoms, which included speech issues, she said. He went to occupational therapy for years until COVID-19 halted in-person visits.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Her child’s therapist quit during the pandemic because “she said she would make more on unemployment,” according to Callahan.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Callahan watches her students struggle to be seen by psychiatrists for diagnoses. Though schools provide some resources for students, they cannot provide an official diagnosis.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I just see it taking forever for families to get appointments,” Callahan said. “It takes months.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">There is a significant shortage of practicing child and adolescent psychiatrists, or CAPs, across the United States, according to data from the <a href="https://www.aacap.org/aacap/Advocacy/Federal_and_State_Initiatives/Workforce_Maps/Home.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.aacap.org/aacap/Advocacy/Federal_and_State_Initiatives/Workforce_Maps/Home.aspx&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1701807177606000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0nbynzCE7u-iomlYWvEeCz">American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry</a>. These physicians specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of mental and behavioral patterns that affect children. They complete medical school and have a three-year residency.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The AACAP data classified states into four groups: States with a sufficient supply of CAPs, a high shortage, a severe shortage and no CAPs. Virginia is in a severe shortage, with just 264 CAPs in the state as of 2019, the most recent data available.</p>
<p><iframe id="datawrapper-chart-DiAuO" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" title="Virginia localities without CAPS" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/DiAuO/3/" height="435" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" aria-label="Map" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script></p>
<p dir="ltr">That means on average there are 14 CAPs available per 100,000 children in Virginia, which is also the national average. The academy defines a “mostly sufficient supply” as more than 47 per 100,000 children. Nationwide, few counties meet that standard.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For example, the city of Richmond has 22 CAPs and almost 40,000 children under the age of 18. By the AACAP ranking, the city has 55 CAPS per 100,000 children — considered a sufficient supply. It is 1 of 9 localities in Virginia that does, out of 133. Eighty-five counties in the state have no CAP.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Children have been unable to receive timely mental health care because of the shortage, according to Callahan.</p>

There are nine measures in the ranking, which include adults and youth who did not receive or could not afford treatment and mental health workforce availability.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Why are there so few CAPs?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Emily Moore, policy analyst with Voices for Virginia’s Children, said there is a lack of mental health care for children due to a system that is not “structured and designed with young people in mind,” and because COVID-19 exacerbated workforce issues.</p>
<p dir="ltr">People enter the field because they want to make change, she said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“They’re realizing that they are up against a system that is not designed to support people the way that they need to be supported,” Moore said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Moore encouraged families on long waitlists to look into nonprofit agencies in Virginia designed with mental health in mind, though they are not substitutes for treatment, according to Moore.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Until we can truly transform the system rather than just patch it up and put Band-Aids on it, resilience is a part of our work,” Moore said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">She also said the state legislature needs to provide adequate funding for children’s mental health care, and that early mental health intervention should be prioritized and normalized to avoid mental health crises. The crisis system should not be the entry point to the mental health system, Moore said.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What is Virginia doing to fix it?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Mental health-related emergency room visits at the beginning and height of the pandemic went up, while physical-related visits went down, according to Dr. Bela Sood. Emergency room doctors and pediatricians were not prepared for the mental health emergencies they faced, she said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sood is lead CAP for the Virginia Mental Health Access Program, or VMAP, and oversees the work of all child psychiatrists involved in the program.</p>
<p dir="ltr">VMAP is a statewide <a href="https://vmap.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://vmap.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1701807177606000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3pnbr03sPbUeklVgOidmYc">initiative </a>that strives to give kids greater mental health access by teaching pediatricians to function like psychiatrists. Pediatricians are taught how to screen, diagnose, manage and treat mental health in children.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It’s amplifying the knowledge that we have as child psychiatrists into the world of general pediatrics,” Sood said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sood had tried to pitch programs like VMAP to the state since 2001, but said the program didn’t receive funding until 2018. The Virginia Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services is the umbrella funding agency for programs like VMAP.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Her biggest concern with the shortage is the lack of therapists.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Even as a practicing child psychiatrist, when I refer for therapy, I have no idea who’s going to be treating the child I’m sending them, and what kind of treatment they’re going to deliver,” Sood said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia needs to design a platform that can be sustained through collaboration and shared resources, or else child health care will remain fragmented, according to Sood.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“As rich a country as the United States, the manner in which health care delivery is spun out into a place is shocking and unconscionable,” Sood said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">She also said Virginia needs to “ramp up” its ability to train therapists and saturate them across the state to help with the understaffing issue.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Child mental health is one of those arenas where people are naturally collaborative,” Sood said. “The collaboration really yields very good results.”</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Mitigating the CAP shortage</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The Richmond Behavioral Health Authority, or RBHA, provided behavioral and primary medical services to <a href="https://www.rbha.org/about/history.aspx" target="_blank">over 5% of the population of Richmond in 2019</a>. The agency states that one-third of its clients cannot pay for vital services.</p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;A shortage of workers is hindering efforts to improve mental health care in Virginia&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2021/10/27/a-shortage-of-workers-is-hindering-efforts-to-improve-mental-health-care-in-virginia/embed/#?secret=Xe2u01ckc4#?secret=NDG8C8bWJf" data-secret="NDG8C8bWJf" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p dir="ltr">RBHA serves adults and children. It has attempted to mitigate a CAP shortage through telehealth options, increased caseload for staff and temporary staff hired from temp agencies, according to John Lindstrom, RBHA chief executive officer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The RBHA has tried to “get pretty creative” with solutions but cannot meet all the need, he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The community health agency has to occasionally “turn off the spigot” if they get overloaded in terms of capacity and certain service areas, Lindstrom said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Ideally we should not be running the vacancy rates that we run if we want to offer a robust set of services to anybody that needs them,” Lindstrom said. “That is really our goal.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The child and adolescent behavioral health staffing shortage is part of a nationwide health care staffing shortage, Lindstrom said. There are incredible pressures on the system.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The RBHA is focused on immediate problems they can address, such as hiring incentives, job retention and recruitment efforts.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Funding mental health</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Another way to increase mental health access is to increase their services in schools, said Moore, with Voices for Virginia.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Our young people are asking explicitly for more support in the school system, and it really is both a matter of making it happen from a legislative standpoint and putting those laws and budget funding in place,” Moore said.</p>

The amount was bumped to $7.5 million this year after lawmakers passed the budget in September.</p>
<p dir="ltr">More than <a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/item/2023/2/HB6001/Chapter/1/313/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/item/2023/2/HB6001/Chapter/1/313/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1701807177607000&amp;usg=AOvVaw07Tmgv3AUU19aqszm2lzom">$12 million</a> was allocated for child psychiatry and children’s crisis response services, to be divided throughout the state based on current services already offered. The funds can be used to hire or contract child psychiatrists to provide clinical services, or to train. Mental health advocates have <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2023/10/03/virginia-state-budget-allocates-millions-towards-mental-health-care-training-for-professionals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pilotonline.com/2023/10/03/virginia-state-budget-allocates-millions-towards-mental-health-care-training-for-professionals/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1701807177607000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0X0QPhwozJysh-2LM8RsFb">said</a> the budget makes “significant investments” in mental health services across the state.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite the recent urgency behind the issue, Virginia still doesn’t have an adequate number of school psychologists or licensed professional counselors, Moore said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We're very lucky that there is now an urgency behind changing the system and also realizing at the same time that that doesn't mean tomorrow,” Moore said. “I hate to have to ask families to be resilient. It's not fair. They shouldn't have to be resilient.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Families should continue to share stories with local leaders and lawmakers to illustrate the urgency behind needed changes, Moore said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Callahan, who has taught for 15 years, does not know how things got this bad, but is ready for a solution.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I eat, sleep and breathe this every day,” Callahan said. “The year that we’re in, how are we not having more resources readily available to families? Why is this taking months and months?”</p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In between the sprawling lawns of Loudoun County and the riverside lofts of Alexandria lie clusters of struggling, predominantly non-white neighborhoods that are increasingly left out of the success and prosperity experienced by Northern Virginia as a whole, recent research notes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, conditions in some of those neighborhoods — called “islands of disadvantage” — have been in decline for years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a new </span><a href="https://novahealthfdn.org/resources/lost-opportunities-persistence-of-disadvantaged-neighborhoods-in-northern-virginia" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Center on Society and Health at Virginia Commonwealth University, poverty, rates of people without health insurance, educational attainment, job opportunities and overcrowding all worsened in those neighborhoods between 2013 and 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, the report notes the economic progress seen in some areas was also accompanied by gentrification and displacement of people of color. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What is otherwise a healthy and wealthy area is also home to areas of concentrated disadvantage,” said Dr. Steven Woolf, lead author of the VCU report. “This is not something that is widely known, that people are living in deep poverty just a short distance away from the McMansions and golf courses.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_37105" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:811px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Islands_of_poverty.png" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-37105 size-full" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Islands_of_poverty.png" alt="" width="811" height="693" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Islands_of_poverty.png 811w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Islands_of_poverty-300x256.png 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Islands_of_poverty-768x656.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 811px) 100vw, 811px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A map showing Northern Virginia&#8217;s &#8220;islands of disadvantage.&#8221; These neighborhoods rank in the bottom decile &#8212; or have the worst possible outcome &#8212; in at least one socioeconomic indicator like poverty rate, education, and overcrowded housing. (Courtesy of the Northern Virginia Health Foundation and the VCU Center on Society and Health)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report, “Lost Opportunities: The Persistence of Disadvantaged Neighborhoods in Northern Virginia,” compares census data from 2009-13 and 2017-21 for Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun and Prince William counties and the city of Alexandria to understand the social and economic changes the region has experienced over time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report, commissioned by the Northern Virginia Health Foundation, builds upon previous research led by Woolf that showed the disproportionate amount of non-white residents that make up struggling neighborhoods experience </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/07/03/report-race-ethnicity-and-address-biggest-predictors-of-premature-death-in-nova/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">substantially higher rates of premature death</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> compared to Northern Virginia as a whole. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest research found that between 2009-13 and 2017-21, 92% of Northern Virginia census tracts saw an increase in median income, 73% had a rise in residents with a bachelor’s degree and 59% experienced gains in the proportion of adults with a high school diploma. Poverty and uninsured rates decreased in 52% and 78% of the region’s census tracts, respectively. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, some “islands of disadvantage” experienced opposite trends during those time periods. One section of Bailey’s Crossroads in Fairfax County saw median household income decrease by about $10,000, child poverty rates nearly double to 63% and the overall poverty rate climb to 30%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In one census tract in the Bull Run area of Prince William County where the Hispanic population increased by 53% while the white population fell by 38%, median household income increased by only $2,140, the poverty rate increased by 60% and overcrowded housing increased by 187%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some struggling neighborhoods saw a slight increase in median household income, Woolf said those gains have not risen proportionately to keep up with the cost of inflation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s not enough to keep people out of poverty,” Woolf said. “We live in a time with rising health care costs, rising costs for child care and inflation that’s causing increased prices for food and other necessities.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, economic progress in some areas was accompanied by increases in the size of the white population, suggesting gentrification and displacement of people of color may have also been underway. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers pointed as one example to the Courthouse area of Arlington County, where median household income increased from $87,233 to $132,603 and the poverty rate plummeted from 19% to 5%. However, at the same time the share of the population that was white grew from 48% to 68%, while those of the Black and Asian populations declined by 42% and 72%, respectively. Similar displacement trends were also seen in Old Town Alexandria, areas of Annandale and the historically Black neighborhood of Green Valley/Nauck.</span></p>

        </a>
        
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report said it is unclear if the relief programs instituted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, like economic assistance and eviction moratoriums, accounted for some of the progress seen in certain areas, like increases in median income — or if that progress was only temporary. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some might argue that economically struggling Northern Virginia residents should move away from an area where the cost of living is so high, Woolf said it&#8217;s not that simple. Not only is moving unaffordable for many of these families, Woolf said, but “economists and others have shown that regions thrive when there is diversity and when there is equity and opportunity across the population.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So systematically displacing low-income families and people of color from a region is not a healthy strategy for trying to give an opportunity for everyone to thrive,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving forward, Woolf said policymakers need to invest more into marginalized communities and commit resources to improve their living conditions and health. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fairfax County Board of Supervisors Chair Jeff McKay said the county’s </span><a href="https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/topics/one-fairfax" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One Fairfax Policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which was passed in 2016 with the intent of combating racial and social disparities seen in some neighborhoods, aims to address many of the problems identified in the study.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whether it be through building more affordable housing units, creating more public transit options, or fully funding our school budget, we are constantly working towards breaking cycles of poverty and expanding our resident’s access to basic needs,” McKay said in an email. </span></p>

But that doesn’t mean  they can’t use some help. After all, raising a family is not always easy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the director of Early Impact Virginia, I work alongside more than 500 family support specialists in the commonwealth, trained professionals who go into homes every day to support pregnant and parenting families.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its simplest form, home visiting works to ensure parents have the resources and skills to be their child’s first and most important teacher. You’ll find family support specialists in thousands of homes across the country; they sit at kitchen tables and on family room couches, even on living room floors playing with toddlers as they work side by side with caregivers. Their goal: to improve parenting skills and enhance early childhood development. </span><a href="https://homvee.acf.hhs.gov/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tells us it’s one of the most effective strategies for strengthening families and improving maternal and infant health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A multi-state partnership is making home visiting even more effective by equipping home visitors with the skills they need to support today’s families. In 2018, Virginia, Iowa and a coalition of higher education partners launched the</span><a href="https://institutefsp.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Institute for the Advancement of Family Support Professionals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Institute provides a nationwide online training program for home visiting professionals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the surface, Virginia and Iowa may seem like unlikely partners. With more than 1,100 miles separating our state capitals, with contrasting economies and divergent geographies, the two states can seem worlds apart. Yet, thanks to strong bipartisan support and a shared commitment among innovative human service professionals, the Old Dominion and the Hawkeye State recognize the promise that home visiting holds for unlocking a family’s strengths and a child’s potential. And as a byproduct, the two states are investing in smart, efficient strategies to build their workforces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is sound research undergirding this investment in home visitation. In 2010, the </span><a href="https://mchb.hrsa.gov/programs-impact/programs/home-visiting/maternal-infant-early-childhood-home-visiting-miechv-program" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (MIECHV) program was authorized by Congress to improve health and development outcomes for children through evidence-based home visiting programs. The legislation funneled millions of dollars to states to bolster proven home visiting models. But until the launch of the Institute, there was no centralized training program to support the thousands of home visitors entering the industry. Both Virginia and Iowa quickly recognized this need and came together in a unique partnership to realize a shared vision for home visitors. By pooling resources, our two states accomplished what we could not do alone: provide a fully accessible training and credentialing system for home visitors working in our two states. This pioneering model, validated in real-world situations during the pandemic, has led to national recognition and has emerged as a crucial resource for other states. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the training system is used by more than 34,000 human service providers across the country. Home visitors enter the profession with different strengths and starting points, and the Institute helps them fill knowledge gaps. Created by home visitors for home visitors – and with technical and production support from the University of Kansas and James Madison University – the no-cost tool is helping improve the quality of home visitor services while reducing turnover. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And we continue to learn. The lessons shared through the Institute are helping create a fuller understanding of how public funding can be used differently, in ways that address shared needs and build a strong home visiting workforce. Congress is helping accelerate the momentum by investing in comprehensive workforce development strategies through the creation of the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Home Visiting Workforce Development Center. We are proud to be part of this effort, which honors the late Congresswoman Jackie Walorski, whose passion and advocacy for home visiting propelled national attention to the issue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Home visiting works, and its ripple effects have been transformational, helping strong, resilient families and the communities they live in reach their full potential. Let’s make sure we continue investing in smart, innovative approaches to equip our workforce with all the knowledge and skills needed to bring this invaluable support to more families. It’s a goal that will benefit not only the families themselves, but us all.</span></p>

(Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are nearly through the first semester, with Thanksgiving break around the corner. This year, Virginia students and teachers have had to bear in mind new policies – policies that have divided communities. Unfortunately, barriers and biases against transgender and nonbinary youth have persisted in the ongoing debate as to whether they have a right to belonging and inclusion within educational institutions at all levels. Yet, it is an issue that these students have little to no say in. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite transgender and nonbinary youth only accounting for </span><a href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Trans-Pop-Update-Jun-2022.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1.18%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Virginia’s population, there were </span><a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2023/03/31/whats-happening-with-anti-trans-bills-in-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">12 anti-trans bills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> introduced during the 2022 legislative session. These bills ranged from barring transgender and nonbinary students from participating in school-sponsored sports teams congruent with a student’s gender identity, to forcefully outing students. As a transgender student, I am concerned for my peers because I know the real impact of these bills. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be transgender in public schools means operating in discomfort. It means fearing how your friends will react when you tell them. It means feeling anxious to come to school every day. It means dreading roll call attendance. It means fearing for your safety. It means avoiding risks. It means surviving. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In September 2022, the Youngkin administration announced an updated draft of Virginia public schools’ policy for transgender students. Previously, Virginia public schools had been operating under model policies released by the Virginia Department of Education during Governor Ralph Northam’s tenure. These policies adhered to nondiscrimination laws and acknowledged ways in which LGBTQ+ students could be better supported, as advised by psychologists. All local school boards were required to adopt policies consistent with these model policies for the 2021-2022 school year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For me, the 2021-2022 school year was my senior year of high school. I was one of the few transgender students that I knew in Franklin County, Virginia. Of my peers, I had by far received the greatest amount of support and gender-affirming care. In fact, I was among the slim minority of trans youth in Virginia with family support, access to mental health resources and access to gender-affirming care. According to the</span><a href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/The-Trevor-Project-2022-National-Survey-on-LGBTQ-Youth-Mental-Health-by-State-Virginia.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">2022 National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health by State</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conducted by the Trevor Project, “57% of transgender and nonbinary youth who wanted mental health care in the past year were not able to get it” and only “38% of LGBTQ youth identified home as an LGBTQ-affirming space.” I had experienced firsthand how life-saving this care was and I was looking forward to my future for the first time in a long time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During July 2021, as students were enjoying their summer break, Franklin County and surrounding areas began to discuss the new policies. While the public comments were at times dehumanizing and brutal, the unity and support of allies was undeniable. I even had a former teacher who made a public comment condemning the hateful rhetoric towards trans and nonbinary youth. Perhaps the most revolutionary change that came from this meeting was a new gender-inclusive, single-stall restroom. Considering I spent the first three years of my high school career with only one restroom on an eight-building campus, this change was invigorating. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Devastatingly, the new model policies rescind the progress that the previous model policies implemented. Youngkin’s policies, known as “</span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/parents-students/for-parents/model-policies-on-ensuring-privacy-dignity-and-respect-for-all-students-and-parents-in-virginia-s-public-schools" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Privacy, Dignity, and Respect for All Students in Virginia’s Public Schools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” require that students are addressed by the name that is present in the student’s official records as well as the pronouns that correlate to the student’s sex assigned at birth. These new policies only allow exceptions to be made with consent from a student’s parents. Not only are these policies intrusive, but they are personally detrimental to transgender and nonbinary students. For those who do not have supportive or accepting parents/guardians, this sort of overstep is potentially harmful. These policies seem to be detached from the reality of what it is like to be a transgender student, which is not surprising considering the draft was absent of public input, </span><a href="https://www.acluva.org/en/press-releases/virginia-department-education-ignores-public-opposition-and-greenlights-anti-lgbtq" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">despite thousands of comments in opposition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, the updated model policies and similar anti-trans bills create additional responsibilities for teachers and staff. These policies assign teachers the new responsibility of scrutinizing their students’ identities. Implications from these policies insist that public schools insert themselves in student-parent relationships. Beyond establishing a concerning precedent, teachers’ morals are disregarded. Kimberly Irvin, a current Roanoke public school teacher weighed in on the matter, telling me in an email: “For teachers like myself, these policies violate my belief system that all humans deserve equal and fair treatment, to include the right to be called by a preferred name and recognized by pronouns with which they best identify.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organizations such as the </span><a href="https://www.leaninproject.org/new-page-58" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lean in Project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, based in Southside Virginia, and </span><a href="https://vakids.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voices for Virginia’s Children</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, based in Richmond but serving the state, are among many of the amazing groups protecting transgender youth like me. </span><a href="https://equalityvirginia.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equality Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shares their “</span><a href="https://equalityvirginia.org/issues/score-card/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">candidate scorecards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” making it even easier to know how candidates have supported and voted for (or against) LGBTQ+ students and youth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With no say in the matter, students need help from voting Virginians to have their voices heard. Allies can support political candidates who are prepared to support all students. Allies can also volunteer for community initiatives that support LGBTQ+ youth. There are opportunities now to oppose harmful legislation and to show your support through action.</span></p>

Virginia joins other states across the country with the issue. Nationally, only 19% of centers are within a toddler’s walking distance of 0.2 miles.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With low-cost changes — like bringing bus stops within walking distance of Head Start centers — transit dollars can double as Head Start dollars,” said Abigail Seldin, co-founder of the </span><a href="https://www.civicmaps.org/head-start-transit-map" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Civic Mapping Initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a transit research organization that collected the data on Head Start centers across the country, including in Virginia, and worked with the national Head Start leaders in hopes of improving accessibility for children and families.</span></p>
<iframe loading="lazy" 0 id="datawrapper-chart-ZuN1Y" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" title="Distance of Virginia Head Start Centers to nearest transit stop" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ZuN1Y/1/" height="160" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" aria-label="Bar chart" 1="data-external=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&quot;" width="100%" class="iframe-class"></iframe>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1965, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services launched Head Start to provide all-inclusive health, nutrition and education services to children, including those whose families fall below the federal poverty line, which is currently around $30,000 for a family of four.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Head Start offers transportation for children across most of the country. However, in some areas, transportation is not available to allow families to commute to the centers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data collected by the Civic Mapping Initiative found that 42% of Head Start sites nationwide have a public transit stop within 0.2 miles or about a thousand feet of the center, concluding that almost three out of every seven locations have a transit stop within walking distance for a small child.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 37% of Virginia’s 337 Head Start centers are within 0.2 miles of public transit, compared to top-ranked Washington D.C., which has the highest national rate of Head Start centers located close to transit stops, 98%. </span></p>
<iframe loading="lazy" 0 src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1rO36W8FQeOoyc2R8_43Mj9Kt8g_1So8&amp;ehbc=2E312F" width="640" 1="height=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&quot;" height="500" scrolling="yes" class="iframe-class" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">City of Alexandria leaders and area bus service DASH “are working on a number of projects to improve access to bus stops for Alexandria residents,” said Martin Barna, director of planning and marketing for DASH. “After some coordination from Abigail and her Civic Mapping initiative, DASH and the City were able to prioritize relocations and improvements at two bus stops near Head Start centers” at Cora Kelly Elementary and Fairlington United Church, Barma said in an email to The Mercury. DASH buses will begin serving the two stops within the next couple of weeks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To meet the needs of families, Civic Mapping Initiative researchers recommended transit planners in Virginia localities include a list of current Head Start locations and engage with providers in transit planning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another recommendation is for federal leaders and agencies to make access to Head Start facilities a component of transit funding grant applications. State agencies could also invest in free transportation for certain populations, and to incentivize partnerships between public schools, local municipalities and Head Start programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Civic Mapping Initiative has also provided analysis and mapping tools for transit leaders to help in their decision-making.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our national Head Start Transit Map has kindled new discussion between transit agencies and Head Start centers across the country, yielding quick and positive changes in Tennessee, and in Virginia,” Seldin said. “Local collaboration will be the real driver of success across the country. Transit accessibility extends beyond stock proximity to a focus on affordable figures, safety, routes and schedules — all of which need to be informed by community members directly.”</span></p>

(Ariel Skelley/Getty Images) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Child care is unaffordable for the majority of Virginia families with young children and nearly all low-income families with young children, a study by the state’s legislative watchdog found. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the report by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, child care is unaffordable for 85% of Virginia families with infants, 82% of families with toddlers and 74% of families with preschoolers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those percentages are even higher among low-income Virginians, with child care being unaffordable for 98% of families with infants, 98% of families with toddlers and 97% of families with preschoolers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Infants are generally defined as children ages 0 to 15 months, with toddlers ages 16 to 23 months and preschoolers ages 2 to 4 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Recent literature indicates that without child care, parents are often forced to reduce their work hours, take lower-level or lower-paying jobs or drop out of the workforce altogether,” said Stefanie Papps, a JLARC staffer who led the study, during a presentation Monday. “Although this can be a significant barrier to self-sufficiency for lower-income families, lack of affordable child care can be a significant barrier to employment for any family.” </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_36640" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1151px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/JLARC-child-care-affordability.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-36640" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/JLARC-child-care-affordability.jpg" alt="" width="1151" height="666" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/JLARC-child-care-affordability.jpg 1151w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/JLARC-child-care-affordability-300x174.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/JLARC-child-care-affordability-1024x593.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/JLARC-child-care-affordability-768x444.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1151px) 100vw, 1151px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Child care affordability in Virginia. (Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In arriving at those figures, JLARC relied on the federal government’s definition that child care is unaffordable if it costs more than 7% of household income. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In some areas of the country, including the Northeast and South, child care can be a family’s largest household expense — more expensive than even their rent or mortgage,” the commission wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statewide, researchers found Virginia families spend $100 to $440 per week, per child on care, with the highest expenses found in Northern Virginia. Care is generally most expensive when children are youngest, both because parents tend to be younger and earning less pay and because required staffing ratios at licensed facilities are higher for younger children, who need more intensive care and supervision. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Annual incomes need to be approximately 13 to 38 percent higher to afford care for infants and toddlers in child care centers, depending on the region of the state,” JLARC wrote. “These incomes would be necessary to afford care for one child; higher incomes would be needed to afford care for more than one child.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The situation could worsen. Pandemic-era expansions to a federal child care subsidy program expired this Sept. 30, and an additional $15 billion in child care grants to states that target low-income families is set to end Sept. 30, 2024. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia, has previously warned the end of the expanded subsidies </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/09/13/democrats-push-to-extend-child-care-grant-program/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">could cause 80,000 children in the commonwealth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to lose their child care slots, in line with </span><a href="https://tcf.org/content/report/child-care-cliff/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">estimates by the Century Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a progressive think tank. JLARC on Monday put the figure at 25,000 children.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The commission concluded it would cost the state almost $320 million annually to extend all of the pandemic-era expansions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s a significant gap between available funding and funding that’s needed to continue to meet family demand for child care,” said Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, during Monday’s meeting. “So it falls to the General Assembly to meet this demand.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Barry Knight, R-Virginia Beach and chair of the House Appropriations Committee, said lawmakers “knew it wasn’t going to last” and noted that Virginia’s Democratic Sens. Kaine and Mark Warner “understand this is a problem.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They’re the ones who kind of put a mandate on the state of Virginia, because they, Congress, gave us this money to help us in a time when we needed help,” he said. “Sometimes it’s hard to fund the problem and pull the plug on it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an Oct. 10 letter in response to JLARC’s findings, Virginia Secretary of Health and Human Services John Littel wrote that the impending drop in child care subsidy funding “should receive a disproportionate share of attention.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Littel further said it was “imperative” that Virginia “analyze the full ecosystem of child care programming” and “facilitate a more extensive dialogue around solutions that address the full spectrum of cost-driving factors.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This review must include reducing regulatory burdens that impede flexibility and fostering discussions about private sector innovation to build sustainable capacity,” he wrote. “Additionally, increasing home-based care options and expanding opportunities provided by houses of worship and other community partners will be critical to expanding choices for families.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While JLARC found that regulations do influence child care costs, it concluded that “most of Virginia’s regulations appear appropriate.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, Papps said that staffing ratios — the number of children a child care worker is allowed to oversee — are the most significant regulation impacting costs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“However, when compared to staffing ratios in other states, Virginia’s ratios were relatively similar to ratios in other states,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, Virginia requires licensed providers to have one staff member for every four infants, every five toddlers or every eight to 10 preschoolers. Amendments to the state budget temporarily relaxed those ratios for centers that participate in the federal subsidy program through June 30, 2024 in an effort to help with staffing shortages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A JLARC survey of child care providers found that most “do not believe that regulations seem too stringent or not stringent enough.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Just one-third of providers reported at least some regulations are too stringent,” the commission wrote. “Further, most child care providers and other relevant stakeholders interviewed reported that the state’s regulations seem appropriate to maintain children’s health and safety, and the staffing ratios create manageable working conditions.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the commission noted that Virginia’s background check requirements are stricter than those in other states and federal guidance, and that materials included in required staff training aren’t always relevant. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Papps pointed to staffing challenges as “the root of the child care access and affordability issue.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Child care workers are generally earning relatively low wages — wages that would put many of these workers below the self-sufficiency standard,” she said. JLARC found that on average, “lead teachers” in child care centers earned $16 per hour in fall 2022, while assistants earned $13 per hour. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Higher compensation leads to more staff, increasing the availability of care but increasing the cost and decreasing the affordability of care,” Papps said. “Lower compensation decreases operating costs, lowering the cost of care paid by parents, but can lead to staffing shortages that limit providers’ capacity.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Bobby Orrock, R-Spotsylvania, called the situation “a catch-22.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In order to have more availability, you’re going to have to increase the cost, ergo making it less affordable,” he said. “So y’all’s recommendation is: ‘Good luck.’” </span></p>

(Leah Willingham/Associated Press)</p><p>State efforts to prop up child care might spare some providers from the worst effects of last month’s expiration of pandemic-related aid — at least temporarily. But the unraveling of a system plagued by a lack of affordability and access, low wages, staffing turnover and burnout will continue, experts say.</p>
<p>“The basic business model of child care, where it costs more to produce than parents can afford, is further complicated when there is a gap in the workforce where very few receive a reasonable pay for a demanding job,” said Linda Smith, director of the Early Childhood Initiative at the Bipartisan Policy Center think tank.</p>
<p>“Child care has widely been seen as a classic example of market failure,” Smith said. “It’s worth understanding because it was bad before COVID, and it has gotten worse since then.”</p>
<p>The 2021 American Rescue Plan Act included <a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/media/press/2021/child-care-funding-released-american-rescue-plan" target="_blank">$24 billion to stabilize</a> child care centers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Child care providers used the money to keep their doors open when the pandemic scrambled many families’ child care arrangements. Some providers used it to raise salaries to attract workers. States, tribes and territories also were allowed to use the money to help low-income families and essential workers cover child care costs. But the ARPA money stopped <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-coming-end-of-federal-child-care-funding-threatens-working-mothers-gains/#:~:text=The%20American%20Rescue%20Plan%20Act,to%20the%20child%20care%20sector." target="_blank">flowing on Sept. 30</a>.</p>
<p>The federal government in 2021 also pumped an additional $15 billion into <a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/occ/fact-sheet" target="_blank">existing child care grants</a> to states, to be used to help eligible low-income working families pay for child care. That extra money will expire in September 2024.</p>

<p>The end of the ARPA money could force more than 70,000 child care programs to close, leaving more than 3 million children without care, according to <a href="https://tcf.org/content/report/child-care-cliff/" target="_blank">a June report</a> by The Century Foundation, a left-leaning think tank based in New York City. The group estimates that parents — disproportionately women — would lose more than $9 billion in annual earnings if they can’t find affordable child care and decide to leave the workforce.</p>
<p>In five states — Arkansas, Montana, Utah, Virginia and West Virginia — plus Washington, D.C., the end of ARPA aid could cut the number of licensed child care programs by half or more, according to the report. In another 14 states, the number of licensed programs could be reduced by a third.</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">States step in</h4>

	</h4>
<p>But in the past few years, some states have increased their own investments in child care, providing a cushion against the end of the federal aid.</p>
<p>“We’re going to lose some child care in this country. We’re going to see increased turnover because the wages are still lower than what any big box store retailer can offer,” Smith said. “But I don’t think it’s going to be this cliff where everybody falls off next week.”</p>
<p>For example, New York last year <a href="https://www.budget.ny.gov/pubs/press/2022/fy23-enacted-budget-highlights.html" target="_blank">more than doubled</a> its spending on child care to $7 billion over four years. The money will allow the state to raise the income limit for child care subsidies to 300% of the federal poverty level (or $90,000 for a family of four), extending eligibility to more than half of young children in the state, according to Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul.</p>
<p>In New Mexico, voters last November <a href="https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2022/11/14/new-mexico-childhood-education" target="_blank">approved a constitutional amendment</a> devoting a portion of the state’s Land Grant Permanent Fund — fees the state collects from oil and gas development on public land — to early education and child care. The change will generate an estimated $150 million per year for early childhood programs. Since August, the state has made <a href="https://www.nmececd.org/2023/07/20/ececd-finalizes-child-care-regulations-to-make-child-care-affordable-for-most-new-mexico-families/" target="_blank">child care free</a> for all families making up to 400% of the federal poverty level, or $120,000 for a family of four.</p>
<p>And in March, the Washington state Supreme Court <a href="https://dor.wa.gov/about/news-releases/2023/capital-gains-excise-tax-ruled-constitutional" target="_blank">upheld a 7% capital gains tax</a>, approved in 2021, that will pay for early education, child care and public school construction projects. Expected to bring in $500 million per year, the state announced in May that it had <a href="https://washingtonstatestandard.com/2023/05/25/washington-collects-nearly-850-million-in-capital-gains/" target="_blank">collected $850 million</a> from the tax in its first year.</p>
<p>Washington used most of its <a href="https://washingtonstatestandard.com/2023/10/04/washington-may-avoid-child-care-cliff-but-many-providers-are-still-struggling/" target="_blank">$390 million</a> in federal child care stabilization money to support child care providers beyond the pandemic, which also may help the state avoid a sudden drop-off in services. Even officials from some of the states highlighted in the Century Foundation report as being most at risk told Stateline that they aren’t perched on the edge of a funding cliff.</p>

<p>West Virginia officials said they are confident that children there, a quarter of whom <a href="https://westvirginiawatch.com/2023/09/18/new-census-data-shows-a-quarter-of-wv-kids-were-living-in-poverty-in-2022/" target="_blank">live in poverty</a>, will not lose access to child care subsidies. In May, the state pulled $24 million from its Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program to pay for the subsidies, enough to continue them through next August.</p>
<p>Arkansas<a href="https://dese.ade.arkansas.gov/Offices/communications" target="_blank"> Department of Education</a> officials told Stateline that the state’s “cautious approach” to using the federal pandemic aid will minimize the impact of the end of the program.</p>
<p>“Providers who applied and received the funds were encouraged to use them to pay for one-time projects, such as improving facilities,” Kimberly Mundell, a spokesperson for the Arkansas Department of Education, wrote in an email. “Because of the proactive, conservative approach to distributing these funds, the expiration of funds won’t have a dramatic impact on providers in Arkansas.”</p>
<p>But child care advocates assert that most, if not all, states eventually will need federal help.</p>
<p>“Some of these states like Washington, New York, New Mexico are going to be in a better position because they sought to use policy to address the short-term child care crisis,” said Lauren Hipp, the national director of early learning for MomsRising, a group that advocates on behalf of women, children and families.</p>
<p>“But it’s important to note that even in those states, it’s very clear that they cannot sustain that on their own. Federal investment and policy are what’s needed.”</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Providers reach a breaking point</h4>

	</h4>
<p>Bronx, New York, native Angela Gonzalez studied early childhood education at Bronx Community College and then became licensed for her home-based care business in 2019.</p>
<p>But Gonzalez last accepted children in February, after months of losing clients and volunteer workers. She has put her dream of being a licensed child care provider on hiatus so she can contend with the realities of paying New York City rent, she said.</p>
<p>“I recently applied to McDonald’s. They pay 15 dollars an hour. I also applied to a [Manhattan restaurant] and might get that job,” she said. “Is it what I spent my life wanting to do? No. But I don’t see how I can care for others’ children and also myself and my kids.”</p>

<p>BriAnne Moline, who owns the <a href="https://wildwondersearlylearning.com/" target="_blank">Wild Wonders Early Learning Program</a> in Missoula, Montana, said she received $10,000 in federal assistance each quarter over 15 months. She used the money to retain her skeleton crew with holiday bonuses and higher wages and took a pay cut to keep her employees.</p>
<p>But after receiving her last round of funding in January, Moline told Stateline, all her employees found better pay elsewhere, and she’s had to downsize the number of kids she serves from 12 to four. She said it’s been hard to find quality child care workers to replace the staff members who left.</p>
<p>Moline now works 10- to 12-hour days at Wild Wonders but must subsidize her income with part-time jobs to support her own four children.</p>
<p>“I can’t operate at full capacity because I don’t have staff,” she said. “I can’t keep up with the cost of running a business, giving my all to these wonderful children, and the cost of living for myself and my kids.”</p>
<p>Black and Latina women are <a href="https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/us-child-care-system-relies-women-color-structural-barriers-systematically-disadvantage" target="_blank">overrepresented in the child care workforce</a>, which is one reason why the pay is so low and the work is undervalued, said Camille Bennett, who owns and operates three child care centers in northern Alabama. Bennett said her state’s existing child care shortage will only be made worse by its strict abortion ban. But she hopes the end of federal aid will be the impetus for child care workers to mobilize.</p>
<p>“When that federal money dries up, and [the government] stops supplementing our income based on inflation, then you will see people take to the streets and rally because we will have no choice,” she said.</p>
<p>That’s beginning to happen in some states. For months, the California Child Care Providers United union rallied and marched for higher pay. In June, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom <a href="https://www.kpbs.org/news/economy/2023/07/10/california-child-care-providers-get-historic-deal" target="_blank">signed a state budget</a> with $600 million to increase subsidy rates for providers contracted by the state. The new two-year contract will give them a 20% pay raise.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Terms like volley llamas, flabjacks and dillballs sound like a bad joke, but are actually terms used in pickleball, a sport that&#8217;s a smash hit in Virginia.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In fact, there are three upcoming pickleball tournaments in October alone and new facilities opening.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pickleball is the fastest-growing sport across the nation as of 2022, according to the national governing authority, <a href="https://usapickleball.org/about-us/organizational-docs/pickleball-annual-growth-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://usapickleball.org/about-us/organizational-docs/pickleball-annual-growth-report/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1696898291396000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3G6ZrRyQEp0lKkJhTf_rqr">USA Pickleball</a>. The sport has taken hold in the South Atlantic region, which includes Virginia.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia ranks No. 10 in the nation for pickleball courts, as determined by the Pickleheads <a href="https://www.pickleheads.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pickleheads.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1696898291396000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3oLOkCq2w88_coEK8BXZ-Z">website</a>. The site, a 101-level sport resource and a hub for finding players, courts and groups, reports <a href="https://www.pickleheads.com/courts/us/virginia" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pickleheads.com/courts/us/virginia&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1696898291396000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1RNlO9FyuMb3ZKBvBl3Qo4">428</a> pickleball courts in Virginia.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The sport is a hybrid of badminton, tennis and Ping-Pong that can be played on an indoor or outdoor court.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.bangersanddinks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.bangersanddinks.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1696898291396000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3sdYAwXCFuMlFfftorcMzy">Bangers and Dinks</a> recreational pickleball facility opened in Chesterfield County in July. Nicole Thompson and husband Jack are co-owners. The spot, named after two of the sport’s terms, is central Virginia’s first indoor pickleball facility, according to Nicole Thompson.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The facility offers floors with <a href="https://www.pro-cushion.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pro-cushion.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1696898291396000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1iBo53bTqIQP84lRmQ-gqi">Pro-Cushion</a> surfacing, specialized lighting, changing rooms and drink and snack options.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I think pickleball is popular because it’s easy to learn but hard to master,” Thompson said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Competitive camaraderie is a part of the game, according to Thompson: The pickleball culture encourages laughter and fun when playing.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://ppbrva.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ppbrva.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1696898291396000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1rLFtSD7lD5mW_TQ5OrLlC">Performance Pickleball RVA</a> will open in Henrico County on Dec. 1. The facility plans to be the largest indoor pickleball space in the region, according to chief operating officer Jon Laaser. There are 18 total courts: 12 indoor courts and six outdoor courts.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Laaser wound up falling in love with pickleball, despite his initial indifference. He and his wife joined the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/390898654655805/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/groups/390898654655805/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1696898291396000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1tHeCUmKgV0NZy3NAxE_rC">Western Henrico Pickleball group</a> shortly after. His background in tennis and Ping-Pong helped him learn the game quickly.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I think there’s kind of a misconception because of the name, that it&#8217;s, you know, a goofy sport,” Laaser said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pickleball is a sport for all ages, cultures and backgrounds, Laaser said. The sport offers people the chance to connect with strangers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The game has really skewed younger, and the older players that loved it in the beginning are still playing, but you really see it run the gamut age wise,” Laaser said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Laaser’s soon-to-open facility was inspired from feedback after he hosted a few pickleball tournaments with his wife. This year they hosted two pickleball tournaments: <a href="https://usapickleball.org/event/ladybug-pickleball-classic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://usapickleball.org/event/ladybug-pickleball-classic/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1696898291396000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2bgyWQVsuqat_9lqUvhzKx">Ladybug Classic</a> and <a href="https://pickleballbrackets.com/ptd.aspx?eid=6e5c5aa2-a7be-48b1-8d90-5036795b0004" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://pickleballbrackets.com/ptd.aspx?eid%3D6e5c5aa2-a7be-48b1-8d90-5036795b0004&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1696898291396000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3aqPdIf39a17ipuj_rfYOe">Body Armor 804</a>. Ladybug Classic had 300 participants and Body Armor 804 offered approximately $10,000 in prize money.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Performance Pickleball RVA will host a grand opening celebration, <a href="https://ppbrva.com/the-pickle-ball/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ppbrva.com/the-pickle-ball/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1696898291396000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2Sl1MZRSH_L59kx2EZMa95">The Pickle Ball</a>, on Dec. 20.

<p dir="ltr">Jonathan Medina Alvarez, a Richmond-area pickleball player, will be the club’s resident professional, according to Laaser. Alvarez is the No. 3 ranked singles player in the Association of Pickleball Players. The association is officially sanctioned by USA Pickleball, which formed in 2005. Alvarez will lead instruction, clinics and crossfit training.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The number of pickleball players increased 159% in the last three years, according to USA Pickleball. There are approximately 70,000 official members and an estimated 4.8 million players in the U.S. The largest total demographic for pickleball players is ages 18-34.</p>

<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">To begin the game the score must be called aloud. The server calls the serving team’s score first, then the receiving team’s score, lastly the server’s number. The first call will always be “zero-zero-two,” as the original server is referred to as the second server.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">A serve is underhanded, and cannot be above the waist. A serve is made diagonally crosscourt. At the start of the game the server is awarded only one serve.For the remainder of the game, if the serving side faults then their partner has one more opportunity to serve.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Volleys are initiated outside of the non-volley zone. A player can be in the non-volley zone as long as their opponent is not volleying the ball. A player can stay inside the non-volley zone before or after returning a bounced ball.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">The receiving team must let the ball bounce once after a serve. After the initial serve, the receiving side can hit the ball out of the air or choose to allow it to bounce.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">The ball cannot bounce twice. If it does it is considered a “fault,” any faults in the game means the opponents gain possession of the serve. Until another fault occurs and then the possession of the serve is switched again.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">If the serving side holds serve (serving players continue gaining points), after each point the server will alternate serving from the left to right side.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">When the servers advantage is even numbers they will serve on the right side, when the servers advantage is odd numbers they will serve on the left side. The receiving team returns the ball in the diagonal court of the server.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Similar to tennis, the ball must stay inside of the lines. The opponent can call “out,” if they believe the ball from their opponent is out of bounds.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">The most commonly used scoring option is best 2 of 3 games to 11 points. Players must win by 2 points.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">After each game, players switch sides.</p>
</li>

<p>WASHINGTON — As Congress barrels toward a partial government shutdown, the White House Monday warned that a program that helps millions of low-income families afford healthy food could see substantial cuts.</p>
<p>The White House released a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/09/25/extreme-house-republicans-chaos-is-marching-america-toward-a-shutdown-that-would-jeopardize-vital-nutrition-assistance-for-nearly-7-million-vulnerable-moms-and-young-children/" target="_blank">state-by-state breakdown</a>, estimating that nearly 7 million people who rely on the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, also known as WIC, could be at risk of losing funds to purchase select food and receive vouchers for vegetables and fruit.</p>
<p>The program provides financial support for those who are low income and pregnant or nursing, as well as for children up to 5 years old.</p>
<p>U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said during a Monday White House briefing that WIC recipients could feel the impact of the shutdown within days.</p>
<p>“Millions of those moms, (babies) and young children would see a lack of nutrition assistance,” he said.</p>
<p><iframe id="datawrapper-chart-xWXMu" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" title="WIC recipients affected by a government shutdown" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/xWXMu/1/" height="695" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" aria-label="Table" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script></p>
<p>Vilsack, Iowa’s former governor, said some states have leftover WIC benefits and “could extend (WIC) for a week or so.”</p>
<p>“The vast majority of WIC participants would see an immediate reduction and elimination of those benefits, which means the nutrition assistance that’s provided would not be available,” he said.</p>
<p>In Virginia, over 127,000 WIC recipients including more than 72,000 children and 28,000 infants could lose their benefits.</p>
<p>Additionally, new eligible participants could face a backlog.</p>
<p>“Without the urgent investment of additional funds, state WIC offices could soon be forced to consider waiting lists for prospective participants — a drastic step not seen in nearly 30 years,” Kate Franken, board chair of the National WIC Association, which is the non-profit advocacy arm of WIC, said in a statement.</p>
<p>The impending shutdown comes after President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/05/31/u-s-house-approves-debt-limit-package-sending-it-to-senate-with-just-days-until-default-deadline/" target="_blank">made a deal</a> with Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy earlier this year to raise the debt ceiling. <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/05/31/debt-limit-deal-hits-turbulence-in-congress-as-leaders-prep-for-vote/" target="_blank">That deal </a>set maximum spending levels for the next fiscal year.</p>
<p>However, only one of the 12 appropriations bills has been passed by the House, and a handful of far-right Republicans are <a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2023/09/21/shutdown-inches-closer-as-u-s-house-gop-fails-to-pass-defense-bill-lawmakers-exit-d-c/" target="_blank">pushing for steeper cuts</a>, even if it means a partial government shutdown.</p>
<p>“House Republicans have turned their backs on the bipartisan budget deal that a large majority of them voted for just a few months ago and proposed a continuing resolution (CR) that makes devastating cuts to programs that millions of hardworking Americans count on,” the White House said in a press release.</p>
<p>A continuing resolution, or CR, is regularly used to keep the government funded for weeks or a couple of months while the House and Senate finish work on the 12 annual spending bills.</p>
<p>Without a CR by Saturday, the end of the fiscal year, a partial shutdown will occur and programs that have discretionary funding, like WIC, will lapse.</p>
<p>Funding for WIC is not mandatory spending, meaning the program won’t be automatically funded regardless of a government shutdown. It’s funded through the Agriculture appropriations bill, which has not been passed by Congress.</p>
<p>The White House criticized the Agriculture appropriations bill the House passed out of its committee that did not include the supplemental funding the Biden administration requested.</p>
<p>“Without the Administration’s funding request, states could soon be forced to institute waiting lists for WIC, causing mothers and children to lose access to the vital nutrition assistance,” the White House said.</p>
<p>WIC funding is distributed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service to states through a formula. The share of eligible people who participate in WIC can vary between states — <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/wic/eligibility-and-program-reach-estimates-2020" target="_blank">for example</a> California, Massachusetts, and Minnesota, have a coverage rate for WIC by over 60%.</p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce for The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite stiff winds, drenching rains and coastal storm surges, Virginia pulled through Tropical Storm Ophelia relatively unscathed this weekend. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeff Orrock, chief meteorologist for the National Weather Service’s Wakefield office, which covers most of central and eastern Virginia, said Hampton Roads saw the most severe storm impacts Friday night into Saturday morning, with central Virginia feeling the brunt on Saturday through the evening. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was kind of a weird one-two punch,” he said. “It pretty much went from Friday afternoon all the way through Saturday evening.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ophelia, which strengthened from a potential tropical cyclone into a tropical storm on Friday, made landfall near Emerald Isle in North Carolina early Saturday morning before moving up the East Coast through Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Weather Service measured winds of 45 to 60 mph in coastal areas and 35 to 40 mph in central Virginia as the storm weakened over the course of its northward march. The gale caused downed trees and power outages, and exacerbated the effects of tidal flooding along the state’s rivers, but no fatalities or major destruction were reported. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This was a significant event for us that caused disruptions, but it’s not the worst that we have seen,” said Ben McFarlane, chief resiliency officer for the Hampton Roads Planning District Commission. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeremy Slayton, a spokesperson for Dominion Energy, the primary electricity provider for much of eastern and central Virginia, said about 170,000 utility customers had outages over the weekend, but all service was restored by Sunday afternoon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Any time you have a storm like that with a combination of heavy rain and heavy wind, we have to contend with branches falling,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In preparation for Ophelia’s arrival, Gov. Glenn Youngkin </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/09/22/youngkin-declares-state-of-emergency-ahead-of-tropical-storm-ophelia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declared a state of emergency Friday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a move that gave state agencies more flexibility to deploy resources to respond to the storm. The Virginia National Guard staged roughly 35 soldiers at Virginia Natural Gas facilities in Hampton Roads to assist with transporting people through potential high water or removing debris. The Virginia Emergency Operations Center and Virginia Emergency Support Team were also activated, although the state Department of Emergency Management was unable to speak with the Mercury Monday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forecasts by the National Hurricane Center predicted coastal areas could see storm surge of between 2 to 4 feet above ground level, with 3 to 5 inches of rain in Hampton Roads and 2 to 4 inches of rain through the Interstate 95 corridor in central Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orrock of the National Weather Service in Wakefield said storm impacts played out in line with predictions. The eastern portion of the state saw about 3 feet of storm surge, and both Hampton Roads and central Virginia received between 3 and 5 inches of precipitation. A <a href="https://www.weather.gov/media/akq/briefings/LatestBriefing.pdf" target="_blank">Monday briefing from the Wakefield office</a> noted while many area rivers rose due to Ophelia&#8217;s rainfall, they remain below flood stages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Luckily the rivers were low,” said Orrock. “They were able to absorb the rainfall pretty easily.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McFarlane said there were reports of some roadways and cars flooding in Norfolk and Portsmouth, but the timing of the high tides over the weekend helped reduce impacts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We got the high tide at kind of a fortuitous time, because it was in the middle of the night,” he said. “This could have been a lot worse.” </span></p>

Walker and her family qualified for the expanded child tax credit that was part of a pandemic relief package. Elise Amendola/The Associated Press</p><p>The federal pandemic-era child tax credit expansion lifted millions of children out of poverty in the second half of 2021. But Congress allowed it to expire at the end of that year, and new U.S. census data shows the child poverty rate <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/press/statements/record-rise-in-poverty-highlights-importance-of-child-tax-credit-health-coverage" target="_blank">more than doubled</a> in 2022, erasing the record gains that were made.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t surprising because we knew this was coming,” said Megan Curran, policy director at <a href="https://www.povertycenter.columbia.edu/" target="_blank">Columbia University’s Center on Poverty and Social Policy</a>. “But still, when you see the magnitude of the change, and you know how many kids that represents, it’s still shocking.”</p>
<p>Now states are stepping in. Since the federal enhancement ended, several states have launched or expanded their own child tax credits.</p>
<p><a href="https://itep.org/state-tax-credits-have-transformative-power-to-improve-economic-security/" target="_blank">Six states have created new child tax credits</a> (New Jersey, New Mexico and Vermont in 2022, and Minnesota, Oregon and Utah this year), while five more have expanded their existing credits, <a href="https://itep.org/state-tax-credits-have-transformative-power-to-improve-economic-security/" target="_blank">according</a> to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a nonpartisan tax policy nonprofit. Currently <a href="https://itep.org/states-are-boosting-economic-security-with-child-tax-credits-in-2023/" target="_blank">14 states</a> offer child tax credits, and several others saw bills introduced this year.</p>
<p>“Child poverty has often been thought of as this status quo that can’t change,” said Curran. “But one of the most powerful lessons to take out of the horrible pandemic is that our policy decisions really matter, and we can make a huge difference in a short amount of time. We know what works and we know how to do it. This is a solvable problem.”</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A new approach</h4>

	</h4>
<p>In 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act temporarily expanded the federal child tax credit, increasing the maximum credit to $3,000 per child ages 6-17 and $3,600 per child under age 6. It was a significant bump from the previous $2,000-per-child credit.</p>
<p>The temporary expansion gave the credit in monthly cash payouts to about 6 in 10 U.S. households with children, rather than as one lump sum after taxes. And it <a href="https://www.niskanencenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Measuring-the-Child-Tax-Credits-Economic-and-Community-Impact.pdf#page=2" target="_blank">made the full credit available</a> to all low- and middle-income families making less than $150,000 for married couples ($112,500 for single parents). The previous credit excluded income earners at the lowest end of the spectrum.</p>
<p>After the payments began, the nation’s child poverty rate dropped by half in 2021 to a historic low of 5%, <a href="https://www.aecf.org/blog/new-data-show-that-the-child-tax-credit-fueled-a-substantial-reduction-in-child-poverty" target="_blank">primarily thanks to the expanded child tax credit</a>, according to researchers at the Annie E. Casey Foundation, a charitable organization focused on child well-being. The expansion <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/working-papers/2022/demo/SEHSD-wp2022-24.html" target="_blank">helped lift 3 million children out of poverty</a>, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, which found that most parents said they used the credit payments on <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/10/nearly-a-third-of-parents-spent-child-tax-credit-on-school-expenses.html" target="_blank">child care, rent, utilities, food and school expenses</a>.</p>

<p>“You saw this whole host of data coming from all sorts of places, showing these payments were having a positive and immediate effect on families’ basic needs, and how they were able to care for their children,” Curran said. “You were seeing particularly significant gains for families with lower incomes.”</p>
<p>While the federal tax credit expansion did lift children out of poverty in the short term, some analysts argue it could have had negative long-term effects if made permanent.</p>
<p>“What we worry about, with good reason given the evidence, is that a lot of families will receive that extra money and it will cause them to work less or to not work at all,” said Scott Winship, senior fellow and director at the Center on Opportunity and Social Mobility at the <a href="https://www.aei.org/" target="_blank">American Enterprise Institute</a>, a center-right public policy think tank. Winship said a permanent expanded child tax credit also might discourage marriage and result in more families headed by single parents.</p>
<p>Two pieces of <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w29366" target="_blank">2021</a> <a href="https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/voices.uchicago.edu/dist/a/3122/files/2021/12/CID-Research-Note-Child-Tax-Credit.pdf" target="_blank">research</a> from economists at the University of Chicago concluded that if the expanded child tax credit were made permanent, between 1.3 million and 1.5 million workers would exit the labor force. A 2021 analysis of census data from Columbia University researchers found that the temporary expanded benefits during the pandemic didn’t discourage parents from working, but Winship said the results <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/20/opinion/child-tax-credit-basic-income.html" target="_blank">might have been different</a> if people thought the expanded credit was going to be permanent.</p>
<p>“It takes time for a lot of these behavioral changes to develop,” he said. “I don’t think 2021 is a very good test of what would happen in the long run.”</p>
<p>Winship added that he doesn’t think state-level child tax credits are a good idea, but that he’d rather see states experiment with different approaches to reducing child poverty than the federal government.</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Who’s left out?</h4>

	</h4>
<p>Now that eligibility for the federal credit has reverted to its pre-pandemic rules, low-income families are no longer receiving the full tax credit afforded to middle-income families.</p>
<p>For example, a married couple with two children <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/610831a16c95260dbd68934a/t/6500c378fd58e53a638e72ff/1694548886479/Children-left-behind-by-Child-Tax-Credit-in-2022-CPSP.pdf#page=7" target="_blank">must earn at least $35,900</a> per year to qualify for the maximum $2,000 child tax credit; a single parent with two children would have to earn $29,400 to qualify, according to the Center on Poverty and Social Policy. That means children whose parents get paid at or near the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour don’t qualify for the maximum credit.</p>

<p>About a quarter of children nationwide do not qualify for the maximum $2,000 credit because of their parents’ income. That includes a third of rural children; half of kids with a single parent; 40% of Black and Hispanic kids; and 90% of kids in households below the federal poverty level, which is about $30,000 per year for a family of four.</p>
<p>“We have programs for folks who struggle financially, but nothing replaces having your own funds to solve your own problems,” said Mercedes Elizalde, director of advocacy at <a href="https://www.latnet.org/" target="_blank">Latino Network</a>, a Latino-led advocacy organization based in Portland, Oregon.</p>
<p>Her organization advocated for Oregon’s new child tax credit, which gives an annual benefit of up to $1,000 per child up to age 5 for families who earn up to $30,000 per year. She said the Latino communities her organization supports tend to have a high proportion of families with young children.</p>
<p>“Having a tax credit that is specific to lower-income families and specifically helps families with multiple children is really beneficial when we know a two-kiddo household in our community is still pretty common,” Elizalde said.</p>
<p>She said she expects to see families use the funds for basic needs like food, clothes for school and utility bills.</p>
<p>“This is a way of buying shoes when their kiddos outgrow them or being able to cover a copay for a doctor’s visit,” she said. “It’s those little bits of money that are hard to plan for because you’re not always sure when you’re going to need them.”</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Helping low-income families</h4>

	</h4>
<p>Several states creating or expanding child tax credits have specifically targeted low-income families that fall through the gap in federal eligibility requirements.</p>
<p>“It’s a proven intervention,” said Minnesota Democratic state Rep. Aisha Gomez, who chairs the House Taxes Committee. Her committee put forward the child tax credit bill that became law earlier this year. “Poor people aren’t poor because they don’t work hard. Giving a little bit of extra money to folks who are experiencing poverty and aren’t being taken care of in our economy works, so we were happy to pick up where the feds unfortunately left off.”</p>
<p>Minnesota now offers a tax credit of $1,750 per child under 18 for single parents with incomes below $29,500 per year and married parents making below $35,000. The credit was passed as part of an omnibus tax bill that received no Republican support, but Gomez said she’d like to think if the tax credit had been a stand-alone bill that it would have received some GOP votes.</p>

<p>“Child poverty is one of those issues where I think there’s pretty widespread agreement that we have a role as the government to intervene when our system is failing families so acutely,” she said.</p>
<p>“What we’ve noticed is not only is there a huge explosion of interest [from states] in creating child tax credits in the last two years,” said the Center on Poverty and Social Policy’s Curran, “but there’s been interest in trying to craft them in a way that fixes some of the gaps the federal credit has historically had.”</p>
<p>Curran said her organization has been contacted by lawmakers in several states who said they were interested in child tax credits because they saw the significant poverty reduction that came from the federal expansion: “That really caught peoples’ attention.”</p>
<p>In nearly every state, a combination of the existing federal tax credit and a state credit up to $2,000 would slash child poverty rates by at least a quarter, <a href="https://itep.org/state-child-tax-credits-and-child-poverty-50-state-analysis/" target="_blank">according</a> to an analysis from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.</p>
<p>Elizalde said Latino Network will focus its efforts now on making sure people know about the new tax credit so they can take full advantage.</p>
<p>“This is going to be very impactful,” Elizalde said. “In a couple of years, we hope we can go back to the legislature and say, ‘Let’s increase that income cap and help more families.’”</p>

<p>The internet has become a part of our daily life. Whether you access it on a computer, or a mobile device such as a cell phone or tablet, the internet has opened doors for us. Unfortunately, there can be scary surprises behind some of those doors.</p>
<p>We pay a price to access this wealth of knowledge. This day and age, it’s important to remind everyone that nothing is free. If something appears to be free, you are the product.</p>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of how the internet works, for those of us who didn’t grow up with it. Let’s think of the internet as an amusement park. Let’s make it King’s Island.</p>
<p>You, the consumer, pay for internet service.That’s your fee to get into The Kings Island Internet. You have to pay your Comcast, your Frontier, your Suddenlink first. That’s your ticket inside the park.</p>
<p>Once you’re in, it’s up to you where you go. But once that door is open, you have opened many other doors as well.</p>
<p>Every website you go to is a ride. Just like every ride has security cameras, websites do too. They can track their visitors through IP addresses. And if you want frontsies, well, you can use a token. Just provide your email! Every time you go to a site, you are giving your data. These are companies, and data is currency.</p>
<p>For adults, that’s fine. But when it comes to children, things can get a little murky can’t it? Especially when it comes down to their safety.</p>
<p>It’s back to school time and it’s so exciting for everyone, especially beaming parents. We are so proud to send our children off on their new adventure. But it’s important to remember what you post means it can be seen by everyone on the internet. It can also be tracked.</p>
<p>And even if you have your settings on private, everything is hackable. Everything is traceable.</p>
<p>For instance, I can see the exact location of everyone who visits my website. Because I pay for the space on the internet, I am allowed to see my analytics. And I own everything that is on my site. By me paying for my web address, that is like me paying rent. And everything on my website belongs to me. I pay for my space on Kings Island Internet.</p>
<p>But let’s say you post your things on Facebook. Or Instagram. You are then giving your information, data, and pictures of your kids to somebody else. Now they own it. When you sign up for these user agreements, you allow this.</p>
<p>Those “I DO NOT GIVE PERMISSION” posts on Facebook that Grandma keeps posting do not matter.</p>
<div class="newsroomSidebarContainer">
<div class="newsroomSidebar "><a href="https://www.justice.gov/coronavirus/keeping-children-safe-online#:~:text=Adjust%20privacy%20settings%20and%20use,not%20know%20in%20real%20life" target="_blank">Tips to keep kids safe online</a></div>
</div>
<p>The world has gotten smaller indeed. It is incredible and makes so many opportunities for us all. But it is a double-edged sword, and we need to be careful how much of ourselves we share.</p>
<p>I personally know how hard it is when you want to share all those pictures of your kids doing the hilarious cute things. I used to, as a matter of fact. These days, I have to be more careful. I don’t even have a Facebook. And it’s not just people with a global audience who should be taking this into account.</p>
<p>Because once it’s on the internet, it has the ability to go global. That means everyone in the world can know where your child is. Every child predator you ever tried to make sure didn’t live close to you — now they have access to your child at all times, on the world wide web. They can even download photos from Facebook.</p>
<p>Do you want everyone knowing where your child goes to school? Do you want every person to know your child’s schedule? Drop off time? What about their activities and interests? Because that’s what you’re doing.</p>
<p>You’re giving precious data about minors away to a business. And schools utilizing Facebook should be looked at carefully. It’s a safety issue for students.</p>
<p>The armed forces have always benefited from the data of children with the army being <a href="https://iecc.edu/solomon#:~:text=Under%20a%20federal%20law%20entitled,students%20age%2017%20and%20older." target="_blank" rel="noopener">able to access public school information after all</a>. It makes me nervous that the schools want us to rely on Facebook so much when Facebook isn’t the safest place.</p>
<p>So think before you post. And it’s important to remember that every app you sign up for, every email, that’s your data you are giving to a company. So proceed with caution and thought.</p>
<p>Because it doesn’t matter how big your audience is. Everyone’s watching.</p>

Due to the continuing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, many schools continue to hold practices with a plan for a limited season of 6 games total with restricted access to only coaches and relatives of players able to attend. (Photo by Matthew Hatcher/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember the thrill of getting ready for Friday night’s football game against your archrival? The pep rallies. A bonfire. Players wear their jerseys to school on game day. Storefronts in small towns are festooned in school colors. Occasionally, even a parade!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then it’s almost game time. As the setting sun bathes the field in a golden hue, the bands enter, colorfully regaled and marching in time to the rattle and clicking of snare drums and the resonant thud of the bass. The aroma of concession stand popcorn mingles with that of freshly mown grass as the teams finish their warmups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast forward to today’s high school games; in the student body section of the stands, there’s just a  smattering. Way more empty seats than classmates. That’s even truer for the area reserved for the visiting team’s students across the way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Things are unusually sedate in the parking lot, too. In past years, before this ancient annual grudge match that stirred the school pride of grandparents and maybe even great-grandparents of current students, there was usually tailgating outside the stadium in the hour or so leading up to kickoff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not tonight. Just a trickle of grim-faced people walking briskly to the gate and displaying tickets purchased online well in advance, rendering walk-up ticket sales obsolete. They pass through magnetometers or get wanded before they’re allowed to proceed through the gate, lest someone try to smuggle in a weapon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Henrico County’s Hermitage and Highland Springs high schools </span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/local-news/henrico-county/hermitage-high-school-changes-spectator-policy-after-fights-at-football-games/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced such security protocols</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for all home football games that took effect last week. The new rules forbid anyone under age 18 — even students — from entering the game unaccompanied by an adult. All ticket sales are online and none will be sold after noon on game day. They forbid gathering and loitering before or after the games in parking areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s what we’ve come to in an era of escalating gratuitous violence and bloodshed that now threatens some of the events we hold dearest and that have long bonded our communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, excess school pride might boil over and get settled with fistfights or, worse, gunfire. A disagreement over a referee’s questionable call might require postgame police escorts for the officiating crew. A callous remark about a player’s performance or a majorette may end up with one person departing the stadium in an ambulance and another leaving in handcuffs. Moms and dads intrude onto fields of play  to verbally —</span><a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/soccer/virginia-youth-soccer-coach-suffers-facial-fracture-bruising-after-alleged-attack-by-parent/ar-AA1fXibB" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">sometimes physically</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — accost youth sports coaches and officials as their children watch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What the hell?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not as though we couldn’t see it coming with the steady breakdown of civility in society, even before the pandemic. We are a society that increasingly assumes license to act out its bloodiest impulses. Then COVID-19 disrupted life as we knew it and demolished the remaining moral guardrails we all had respected as part of life in a civilized society.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One measure of the problem is reflected in a nationwide study of bodies that sanction high school sports and other interscholastic competitions. A 50-state survey by the National Federation of State High School Associations found that about</span><a href="https://www.nfhs.org/articles/with-loss-of-50-000-officials-nfhs-organizes-consortium-to-find-solutions/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">50,000 sports officials</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had quit in the past three years. Part, but not all, of the blame went to oratorical and actual abuse and threats they endure from fans, snarling with rage and unable to control themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, the problem became so acute that many prep football games — once as synonymous with Friday nights as church is with Sundays — are being scheduled for</span><a href="https://www.wtvr.com/sports/a-record-low-of-officials-could-have-a-major-impact-on-high-school-football" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Thursday nights or Saturdays</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because there aren’t enough officials to field full seven-member crews for all games on one night of the week. Now, many amateur sports officials work multiple nights each week to cover all the games.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Threats and boorish fans are one thing. Bullets are another.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In just the past month, games were interrupted and ended early because of shootings near high school games in</span><a href="https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&amp;&amp;p=1c95e572faefaf3fJmltdHM9MTY5NDM5MDQwMCZpZ3VpZD0wYTcxMmYwZi03NzdjLTY5YzItMzYxOS0zYzhjNzZjYjY4MDgmaW5zaWQ9NTQ0Mg&amp;ptn=3&amp;hsh=3&amp;fclid=0a712f0f-777c-69c2-3619-3c8c76cb6808&amp;psq=recent+shooting+in+utica+ny&amp;u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGltZXN1bmlvbi5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlL3RlZW4tYXJyZXN0ZWQtYWZ0ZXItYS1ndWFyZC1zaG90LWJyZWFraW5nLXVwLWEtMTgzNTkyODkucGhw&amp;ntb=1" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Utica, New York</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/09/02/port-allen-football-game-shooting-leaves-one-dead-in-louisiana/70750281007/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Baton Rouge, Louisiana</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the</span><a href="https://www.actionnews5.com/2023/08/11/3-minors-1-adult-charged-cordova-high-school-jamboree-shooting/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Memphis suburb</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Cordova in Tennessee, and</span><a href="https://youtu.be/1ulTtM-x8b0?feature=shared" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Choctaw, Oklahoma</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it’s heartbreaking, it should come as no surprise that wanton, life-threatening violence now stalks school sports arenas. In June, a gunman outside</span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/crime-courts/huguenot-graduation-shooting-vcu/article_bf96f2aa-04d1-11ee-b449-af6d054fe55b.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Huguenot’s graduation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> killed a graduate and another man. In January, a 6-year-old boy smuggled a gun from his home into his classroom, </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/virginia-school-shooting-boy-6-zwerner-richneck-eeeac96418220aee71cdd296c0089821" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shot his first grade teacher</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a Newport News elementary school and allegedly bragged about it afterward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security measures once considered draconian are becoming the new normal at what has always been among the safest public gatherings possible: Our children’s school events. Don’t blame school administrators. Lawless choices others have made left them no choice, and they are to be lauded for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not clear how many schools have enacted safety protocols similar to those the two Henrico schools announced last week. There is no central repository for cataloging such protective initiatives, officials at the Virginia High School League and the Virginia Association of School Superintendents said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going forward, expect more of it, not less, said Scott Brabrand, who was superintendent of Virginia’s largest school district in Fairfax County before he became executive director of the VASS last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is going to become part of the landscape,” he said in an interview last week. “No event can be held now without putting the security lens on.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Principals and superintendents are seeing the same increasing threats that police are. It’s a problem for which there are few, if any, remedial templates, so schools are having to innovate somewhat to protect students, parents, fans and officials at their events.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new rules may feel burdensome, but the alternative is to surrender these treasured events and venerated traditions in the life of a school and its students. Spectators may not relish the changes, Brabrand said, “but they don’t want to be looking over their shoulders all the time to make sure they’re safe.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don’t have an easy answer,” Brabrand said. “There just don’t seem to be barriers any more to when and where these things might happen.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your doctor said, “There are comorbidities that will affect your outcome,” many people would not understand what that means or what they need to do to change their outcome. Fortunately, Virginia has an important group of people making health care services more accessible and understandable: community health workers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week was the inaugural Community Health Worker (CHW) Awareness Week, a first-ever national observance to raise awareness about the role of CHWs in the healthcare system and their impact. These caring and committed professionals – also known as outreach workers, family advocates and promotores de salud and other titles – are making a positive mark in Virginia and beyond. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CHWs are not clinicians, nor are they social workers. They are one part advocate, one part coach, and one part teacher. Most importantly, as they are acting in all of these parts, CHWs are considered a trusted source of information. CHWs serve as invaluable connectors. They bridge the unspoken gaps between people and the services they need. CHWs are helping Virginia patients navigate the health care system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, about 200 certified CHWs work at free clinics, hospitals and other nonprofits. Through shared experiences of race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, gender identity, lived experiences, and other attributes, CHWs work to connect under-resourced communities and individuals to health care and safety net resources. Their work is most effective when integrated with a broader care team and community partners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CHWs are making a profound difference in people’s lives and our communities. </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4785041/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studies show</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that CHWs help reduce barriers to health care, improve health knowledge and chronic disease management and reduce overall medical costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Institute for Public Health Innovation (IPHI) has long recognized the essential value that CHWs provide in local communities. More than $12 million in grants from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has allowed us to support the hiring and training of 31 CHWs in the commonwealth. Having a sustainable network of CHWs across Virginia helps ensure a strong, seamless safety net of support and that care is accessible to assist communities to be at their healthiest state. The funds from this grant are going a long way toward doing just that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have had the pleasure of working with CHWs over the years. Their stories are moving and inspirational and highlight how a trusted advocate can improve a person’s health outcomes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claudia Artero Miranda doesn’t take “no” as an answer. Whenever her clients experience a roadblock when receiving services – whether it’s troubles finding insurance, food assistance or housing – she always seeks another place to go for support. She has created action plans to help low-income families dealing with the challenges of asthma; her plans consider everything from proper medication to environmental triggers to reduce asthma attacks. Today, she mentors others CHWs through her role at IPHI. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breanna Burke, a CHW at the Healing Hands Health Center in Bristol, Virginia, secured new housing for a woman who had been kicked out of public housing over a domestic violence dispute. Breanna noted that finding housing for this client was like being in a foreign country without a passport. She knew of a program where a person could not be denied housing as a result of domestic circumstances. Using this loophole and her resources, Breanna got the client into public housing and helped her get needed health care resources. As the saying goes, all in a day’s work.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In many situations, CHWs help identify the root causes of a person’s problems through candid conversations. Sometimes the cure or need is not a prescription or doctor’s visit. Clients might just need someone to point them in the right direction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Janice Sykes-Powell, a CHW at Pathways in Petersburg, knows the power of listening. Whether it takes hours or months of meetings, Janice takes the time to patiently sit down with clients to learn and understand their needs because she knows how basic needs like housing, food or access to a cell phone can impact a person’s quality of life and health. Working alongside her patients, she makes sure they get the services they need to live healthier lives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CHWs are undertaking heroic work in plain sight every day. These compassionate health advocates are helping to ensure everyone understands their health care options and can access care. In reflecting on the first CHW Awareness Week, I’m especially grateful for the work they’re accomplishing in the commonwealth and across the country. They’re people whom we should all be proud are a part of our community. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Odds are, by now you’ve heard about that </span><a href="https://youtu.be/sqSA-SY5Hro" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">song</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from a country singer in Farmville, Virginia, who performs under the stage name Oliver Anthony.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he belts “Rich Men North of Richmond,” Mr. Anthony raises an important issue that we here at VPLC care about and work hard to change: working class and lower-income people work hard and yet still struggle to make ends meet in a country (and a state!) that boasts a lot of wealth.   </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve been sellin’ my soul, workin’ all day. Overtime hours for bullsh-t pay.”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">  And later, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a damn  shame what the world’s gotten to, for people like me and people like you. Wish I could just wake up and it not be true.”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mr. Anthony, we wish the same! But we are not sleeping on it. We’re working hard to make positive change here in Virginia so that people can raise up their families without worrying about where their next meal comes from. (If you would like to learn more, here are some examples of our recent work on unemployment insurance and the </span><a href="https://vplc.org/navigating-unemployment-insurance/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Employment Commission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://vplc.org/changes-to-snap-benefits/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SNAP </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and family nutrition, </span><a href="https://vplc.org/enroll-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medicaid and affordable healthcare</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://vplc.org/utility-fairness/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">utility fairness</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the </span><a href="https://vplc.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Advance-Child-Tax-Credit.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">child tax credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://vplc.org/2022-session-update-whats-in-the-budget/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">earned income tax credits, </span></a><a href="https://vplc.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/HB-1814-Garnishment-Fact-Sheet-2.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">income protections,</span></a> <a href="https://www.wtvr.com/rebound/coronavirus-investigations/how-a-new-law-protects-virginians-from-predatory-lending#:~:text=The%20consumer%20protections%20under%20the%20new%20Fairness%20in,Poverty%20Law%20Center%E2%80%99s%20Predatory%20Lending%20Helpline%20at%20866-830-4501." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">predatory lending</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as well as </span><a href="https://housing.vplc.org/evictions/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">evictions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the current </span><a href="https://vplc.org/vplc-issues-to-watch-housing-affordability-stability/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">housing crisis, </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and our work to help </span><a href="https://vplc.org/reimagining-virginias-mobile-home-parks/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mobile home owners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> keep their homes.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One reason people feel their wages are unfairly taxed is that those in higher income brackets are not taxed proportionally or have ways to shield their money from taxation. Over the last several decades the inequalities between the top 5% and the middle class have only </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/06/opinion/income-tax-rate-wealthy.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increased</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with the top earners outpacing the earnings of the lower and middle classes. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Cause your dollar ain’t sh-t and it’s taxed to no end. ‘Cause of rich men north of Richmond.”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One thing that could help workers keep more money in their pockets would be to reinstate the expanded and inclusive child tax credits. The monthly child tax credit was implemented for six months in 2021, reducing childhood poverty by about 30%. In December 2021 alone, 3.7 million children were </span><a href="https://www.povertycenter.columbia.edu/news-internal/monthly-poverty-december-2021" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">kept out of poverty</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> due to the child tax credit. Many families indicated that the extra money helped them pay for the costs of working and allowed them to work more. Congress failed to act to make the changes to the child tax credit permanent. Instead, some members of Congress introduced bills to provide tax cuts to the wealthiest of Americans, furthering the gap between the wealthy and middle and lower classes. Mr. Anthony’s song illustrates an all-too-common misconception: that poor people take resources away from working-class people. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lord, we got folks in the street, ain’t got nothin’ to eat.  And the obese milkin’ welfare.” A</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">nd </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, God, if you’re 5-foot-3 and you’re 300 pounds, taxes ought not to pay for your bags of fudge rounds.” </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We agree, it is not OK for people to go hungry. It is not ok that our elders are supposed to survive on $23 a month in SNAP benefits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Mr. Anthony: do you begrudge a poor kid having a cookie now and again? The amount of support that SNAP provides to families is so low — on average less than $6 per person per day — families must try to stretch their SNAP assistance by buying the cheapest food they can afford. We’ve had clients with heart disease who can only afford prepackaged foods high in sodium. You may think “this could never be me.” But more than half of all Americans will experience at least one year of poverty in their lifetimes. No matter what a person’s circumstances may be, we all deserve the dignity of being able to make our own choices about the food we put on the table for our families.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_36124" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:892px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/NorfolkHungerAdvocacy.png" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-36124 size-full" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/NorfolkHungerAdvocacy.png" alt="" width="892" height="592" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/NorfolkHungerAdvocacy.png 892w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/NorfolkHungerAdvocacy-300x199.png 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/NorfolkHungerAdvocacy-768x510.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 892px) 100vw, 892px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  The Virginia Poverty Law Center&#8217;s Valerie L’Herrou meeting with community members of the Foodbank of Southeastern Virginia in Norfolk. (VPLC)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, Mr. Anthony: you have fallen for that false narrative that people on public benefits such as SNAP (food stamps) and TANF (welfare) don’t work. Over 84% of SNAP households are working and there are strict time limits for individuals who do not work and do not meet an exemption. Those individuals can only receive SNAP benefits for three months out of a 36-month period. The requirements for TANF are even stricter: people must work or be in school or job training. Even those who are working cannot receive TANF benefits for more than two years at a time (or five years in their lifetime). These families have their personal lives put under a magnifying glass just so their children don’t go hungry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your song, Mr. Anthony, has successfully raised to the forefront something a lot of people have been feeling for a long time. VPLC has spent more than forty years working to make improvements in people’s lives and to reduce the influence of the millionaires and billionaires whose money talks — giving them the power to sway our elected officials in Washington AND Richmond.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mr. Anthony, we would love to have you visit us here in Richmond — not too far from Farmville! – and tell you about the people we have helped, what we’re working on, and where we need to go so “people like me and people like you” will have the dignity, respect and ability to raise their families in a better world. </span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>In response to growing public concern over crime, cities and counties throughout the United States are returning to a familiar tool: curfews for young people.</p>
<p>Proponents argue curfews curb crime and protect youth by keeping them off the streets. But research suggests curfews are ineffective, and some juvenile justice advocates and experts warn of unintended consequences such as increased racial profiling and strained relationships between police and teens.</p>
<p>More than a dozen cities and counties have reinstated or enforced juvenile curfews this year, including Washington, D.C.; Memphis, Tennessee; New Smyrna Beach, Florida; Sea Isle City, New Jersey; and Fulton County, Georgia. Philadelphia and Chicago made their curfews permanent last year.</p>
<p>Vicksburg, Mississippi, recently reinstated its curfew following a shooting in January that killed a 13-year-old and left two others injured. The city also has implemented a community policing program and allocated $200,000 in funding for a center where children and their families can receive mentoring, tutoring and mental health support.</p>
<p>“If you limit the opportunity for youth to be out at 11 o’clock, 12 o’clock, one o’clock and two o’clock in the morning, you limit and control that exposure, and then you put it back where it ought to be — in the home,” Vicksburg Mayor George Flaggs Jr. told Stateline. “I’m a stern believer that you can’t be too punitive. … You have to deal with it from a holistic point of view and that is, include the family, the school and the community.”</p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virginia youth curfews</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Virginia law allows localities to impose a youth curfew. Specifically, <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title15.2/chapter9/section15.2-926/" target="_blank">the law</a> says they may &#8220;prohibit minors who are not attended by their parents from frequenting or being in public places, whether on public or private property, at such times, between 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m., as the governing body deems proper.&#8221; In 1999, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a legal challenge brought by the American Civil Liberties Union <a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/supreme-court-turns-down-challenge-virginia-teen-curfew-ordinance" target="_blank">over the constitutionality of Charlottesville&#8217;s youth curfew</a>.</p>
<p>Numerous cities and counties have long-standing youth curfews in their ordinances. Variations are common even between adjacent localities. <a href="https://library.municode.com/va/richmond/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=PTIICICO_CH19OFMIPR_ARTVIIICUMI" target="_blank">Richmond&#8217;s curfew</a>, for example, runs from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. and applies to youth under age 18. <a href="https://henrico.us/assets/Curfew-Compliance-flyettes-Final-for-Website.pdf" target="_blank">Henrico County</a>&#8216;s runs from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. and applies to youth 16 and under. <a href="http://chesterfieldcounty-va.elaws.us/code/coor_ptii_ch14_sec14-19" target="_blank">Chesterfield County&#8217;s</a> runs from 11 p.m. to &#8220;daylight of the following day&#8221; and applies to youth under 18. All have exceptions for various activities like going to and from work.</p>
<p>Most recently, Roanoke officials voted to expand the city&#8217;s youth curfew in response to concerns about violence. <a href="https://www.wdbj7.com/2023/06/05/curfew-minors-amended-roanoke-through-summer/" target="_blank">The broader curfew</a>, which will be in place through Aug. 31, runs 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. Sunday to Thursday and midnight to 5 a.m. Friday and Saturday for youth aged 14-16. For youth aged 13 and younger, it runs 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. Sunday to Thursday and 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. Friday and Saturday. Citing the same concerns, <a href="https://wset.com/news/local/lynchburg-curfew-what-parents-need-to-know-anyone-under-18-juvenile-violence-violent-crime-ordinance-city-council-police-chief-ryan-zuidema-virginia-may-2023" target="_blank">Lynchburg instituted its first youth curfew</a>, which will run through Dec. 1 and will last from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. for all youth.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
    </div>

	
<p>Both he and police Chief Penny Jones said crime rates in the community have decreased since the curfew started.</p>
<p>“Kids will get use [sic] to it and it will become the norm. We just want to be sure our youth are safe,” Jones wrote in an email.</p>
<p>But some elected officials moved in the other direction. In June, Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott signed into law a <a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=88R&amp;Bill=HB1819" target="_blank">statewide ban</a> on curfews that prohibits both cities and counties from implementing them. The ban will take effect in September.<br />
<i></i></p>
<p>Texas state Rep. David Cook, a Republican who wrote the bill, said he hopes to see “a better relationship between juveniles and law enforcement agencies” as a result of the statewide ban on curfews. Cook also raised concerns that curfews could violate constitutional rights.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot that we can do as a state to improve the juvenile system,” Cook said in an interview with Stateline. “The more that we can have community-based programs, the better off juveniles are going to be with regard to trying to reform their behavior for a better future.”</p>
<p>The <a href="https://mayor.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/mayormb/release_content/attachments/Mayor_Bowser_Public_Safety_Situational_Update_08-17-23-reduced.pdf" target="_blank">District of Columbia</a> is one of the latest cities to enforce a juvenile curfew. The city’s curfew targets seven specific areas and prohibits those under the age of 17 from being outdoors past 11 p.m. on weekdays and midnight on weekends. Minors who violate the curfew will be taken to the Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services, where they will be reunited with their families and provided with rehabilitative services and support.</p>
<p>“Our goal isn’t to arrest our young people, but we want to ensure the safety of our youth here in the District of Columbia,” said Pamela Smith, the city’s police chief, during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnqVLIKLGdE" target="_blank">news conference</a> this month.</p>
<p>Some cities, including <a href="https://monse.baltimorecity.gov/curfew" target="_blank">Baltimore</a> and <a href="https://atlantacityga.iqm2.com/Citizens/Detail_LegiFile.aspx?Frame=None&amp;MeetingID=3752&amp;MediaPosition=6950.245&amp;ID=32832&amp;CssClass=" target="_blank">Atlanta</a>, likewise are changing how they handle curfews — opting to reduce or eliminate fines and other penalties and instead provide violators with educational and community-based programs, such as counseling, mentoring and recreational activities. In other jurisdictions, parents and guardians can still receive fines or even go to jail if their kids violate curfew.</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Are curfews effective?</h4>

	</h4>
<p>In 1996, President Bill Clinton <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/31/us/politics-juvenile-curfews-clinton-backs-plan-to-deter-youthful-violence.html#:~:text=Keeping%20up%20his%20tough%2Dlove,violence%20and%20promote%20family%20stability." target="_blank">called on cities and towns to impose nightly curfews</a> on teenagers. Today more than 400 towns, cities and counties have enacted youth curfew laws, according to the <a href="https://www.youthrights.org/issues/curfew/curfew-laws/" target="_blank">National Youth Rights Association</a>.</p>
<p><span style="text-align: right;">But U.S. juvenile curfews are “ineffective at reducing crime and victimization,” according to </span><a style="text-align: right;" href="https://www.campbellcollaboration.org/better-evidence/juvenile-curfew-effects-on-behaviour.html" target="_blank">a review</a><span style="text-align: right;"> summarizing the findings of 12 studies that was published in 2016 by the Campbell Collaboration, an international social science research network. The review also found a slight increase in crime during curfew hours and no effect on non-curfew hours.</span><br />

<p>A <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2486903" target="_blank">paper published in 2014 by the Social Science Research Network</a> measured the effect of the District of Columbia’s juvenile curfews on gun violence by analyzing ShotSpotter data from January 2006 through June 2013. The authors found that gunfire incidents increased by 150% when the curfew was in effect. The authors also suggested that curfews keep bystanders and witnesses from the streets, reducing their deterrent effects on crime.</p>
<p>But some local officials have said curfew enforcement led to a decrease in crime within their jurisdictions.</p>
<p>In Prince George’s County, Maryland, where local leaders enforced a juvenile curfew last year, officials reported a 20% decrease in overall crime during curfew hours in the first month of enforcement.</p>
<p>Experts also worry that curfews will disproportionately affect young people of color.</p>
<p>Juvenile curfews may result in increased racial profiling, said William Carbone, a lecturer and the executive director of the Tow Youth Justice Institute at the University of New Haven.</p>
<p>“I don’t have a lot of faith in curfews at all,” Carbone said in an interview with Stateline. “When you implement a measure like curfews, you run the risk of creating worse relationships between the youth and the police, and run the risk of profiling. … It’s just one of the areas where kids of color are disproportionately disadvantaged.”</p>
<p>Carbone said curfews may also move crime from one area to another because “kids don’t obey geographic boundaries.”</p>
<p>“If there’s a curfew in one location, [minors] could move to another location. It doesn’t stop the crime,” Carbone said.</p>
<p>Curfews are more likely to harm youth of color because of existing disparities in law enforcement interactions, Candice Jones, the president and CEO of the Public Welfare Foundation, a justice advocacy group, wrote in an email.</p>
<p>“They could be doing something legitimate — coming home from a game late or friend’s house studying — but now a curfew has given cause for them to have an interaction with law enforcement, which we know can be particularly dangerous for Black and Brown youth.”</p>
<p>At least 11,680 children under the age of 17 were arrested in 2020 for curfew violations or loitering, according to statistics released by the Department of Justice’s Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. Federal data shows that for decades, Black minors have been arrested for curfew and loitering charges at two or three times the rate of their white counterparts. The overall juvenile arrest rate, which includes all offenses, <a href="https://www.ojjdp.gov/ojstatbb/crime/JAR_Display.asp" target="_blank">peaked in 1996 and has since declined</a>.</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Alternative solutions to youth crime</h4>

	</h4>
<p>Some curfew opponents point to approaches such as cognitive behavior therapy, a type of talk therapy that helps identify thought patterns and tries to change them, and tailored drug or mental health treatment programs as more effective strategies, Carbone said.</p>
<p>“Treatments and interventions, and as little contact with police and courts as possible, are very important ingredients in trying to prevent juvenile crime,” Carbone said.</p>
<p>Carbone asserted that diversion — approaches that redirect youth away from the juvenile justice system — works as a proactive measure to engage and prevent youth crime.</p>
<p>“It’s very powerful to a young person when they go into a courtroom and the person on the bench, for example, wearing the long black robe, pounds a gavel and says, ‘I find you delinquent.’ Kids tend to internalize that and then live up to it,” Carbone said.</p>
<p>To counter this, advocates suggest communities should prioritize comprehensive yearlong programs that allow children to engage in sports, cultural, arts and other social activities.</p>

<p>In Maryland, the Department of Juvenile Services in June launched the Safe Summer initiative, which aims to direct additional resources to counties grappling with higher rates of youth violence and create youth employment opportunities. Connecticut lawmakers <a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/asp/cgabillstatus/cgabillstatus.asp?selBillType=Bill&amp;bill_num=HB06888&amp;which_year=2023" target="_blank">passed a bill</a> that expands diversionary programs in the state and encourages police to direct children to juvenile review boards instead of court proceedings.</p>
<p>In Tacoma, Washington, city leaders launched the city’s first free summer youth program, offering recreational activities such as basketball tournaments, video games, art and music.</p>
<p>Rather than punishing children and their families with fines for curfew violations, communities should invest in social services and address the root causes of juvenile delinquency, said Dafna Gozani, a senior policy attorney with the National Center for Youth, a nonprofit law firm and juvenile justice advocacy group.</p>
<p>“We see that communities that have access to resources have the least amount of youth crime, and that’s not by coincidence,” Gozani said. “We also see that it is incredibly expensive to support the carceral system and that’s at the expense of investing in things like education, health care, pro-social activities — all the things that actually prevent kids from coming into the system.”</p>
<p>Axl, a 19-year-old Kentucky resident who requested to be identified by only his first name for privacy reasons, found immense value in participating in the program offered by Youth Advocate Programs, a national nonprofit that provides community-based alternatives to out-of-home placements.</p>
<p>He said the program helped him develop healthy coping mechanisms, strengthen his communication skills and embrace his transgender identity.</p>
<p>“I did have a lot of support in the program and it helped me learn not to be scared to be who I want to be. It showed that I can be different and not have to blend in with everyone else,” Axl said.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Virginia Paternity Establishment Program, the state has been exceeding these requirements for at least a decade, even as </span><a href="https://www.dss.virginia.gov/geninfo/ldss_profile/births/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over one-third</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of all births in the commonwealth continue to come from unmarried women. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VPEP program manager Yesenia Peiker said in 2022, Virginia had a 92% paternal establishment rate. While the commonwealth’s average rate in hospitals is 77%, Peiker said factoring in births that occur outside of hospitals is what puts Virginia ahead of the curve.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, Peiker said Virginia’s paternal establishment rates remained high during the COVID-19 pandemic as other states’ rates plummeted. After those states received “warning” </span><a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/css/policy-guidance/final-rule-paternity-establishment-percentage-performance-relief" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">letters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the U.S. Office of Child Support Services in 2020 that they could be subject to financial penalties if they didn’t get their percentages up, the federal threshold was lowered to 50% through the end of the 2022 federal fiscal year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s performance is especially notable, Peiker said, considering its program is structured around people reporting paternity on a voluntary basis — unlike some states that require a DNA test or court order to establish paternity for any child born to unmarried parents. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why does the government care about paternity? Peiker said the reason is that “babies who are born to unmarried parents do not have the same rights as babies born to married parents in the commonwealth of Virginia unless paternity is established.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, “if paternity was not established, if the father died, the baby does not have automatic rights to death benefits like life insurance,” Peiker said. “Any kind — like if he was in the military, the military benefits, or if he hit the lottery and you know, won a billion dollars, if paternity was not established, they have no access to that money.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Children without established paternity, she said, also do not have access to their father’s health records.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To encourage greater legal identification of fathers, the federal government in 1996 included a requirement in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families block grant, which provides benefits and services to families with children in need, that states promote the maintenance of two-parent families. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the </span><a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-CPRT-105WPRT37945/html/GPO-CPRT-105WPRT37945-2-8.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Child Enforcement Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, this was because prior to 1970, the majority of children who needed financial assistance required it because their fathers had died. By the 1970s, the majority needed aid because their parents were separated, divorced or never married.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, health and human services consulting company Veritas-HHS operates the Paternity Establishment Program through a contract with the Department of Social Services. The program encourages unmarried fathers to voluntarily establish paternity of their newborn child during the mother and child’s stay at the hospital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An unmarried woman who gives birth at any of the 53 birthing hospitals around the state can have the father of her child acknowledge his parenthood by filling out an Acknowledgement of Paternity form. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The father must then fill out another legal document outlining that the father essentially has all of the rights and responsibilities to his child that a married father would have. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yesenia said it&#8217;s an easy and fast process that doesn’t have a statute of limitations, so paternity can be established even after the hospital visit by downloading the Acknowledgement of Paternity form — found on the websites for </span><a href="https://www.vapaternity.com/about/the-aop-process/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VPEP’s website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the </span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/content/uploads/sites/125/2017/05/Acknowledgement_of_Paternity_VS22_07-04.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Department of Health</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or the Virginia </span><a href="https://dss.virginia.gov/family/dcse/establishing_paternity.cgi" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Department of Social Services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — filling it out, getting it notarized by a birth registrar and submitting it to the state’s Office of Vital Records. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia has designed it in such a way where it makes it easy for parents to go ahead and add the dad,” Peiker said. “These rates are spectacular, but I would love for more people to know about — especially for their children — again, that their kids don’t have the same rights as children born to married parents.”</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin. (Sarah Vogelsong  / Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to a request by Gov. Glenn Youngkin, Attorney General Jason Miyares released <a href="https://www.oag.state.va.us/files/Opinions/2023/23-042-Youngkin-issued.pdf" target="_blank">an official advisory opinion</a> today concluding the state’s model policies concerning the treatment of transgender students comply with federal and state anti-discrimination laws and reiterating the administration’s stance that school boards must adopt policies in line with them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is my opinion that the model policies comply with the Equal Protection Clause, Title IX, and the [Virginia Human Rights Act], and that … local school boards are required to adopt policies that are consistent with them,” Miyares wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 10-page document mainly focuses on the potential conflict between federal and state anti-discrimination laws and the policies’ guidelines regarding athletics, student identification and bathroom use. </span></p>
<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trans_official_opinion.pdf" class="pdfemb-viewer" style="" data-width="max" data-height="max" data-toolbar="bottom" data-toolbar-fixed="off">Trans_official_opinion</a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a press release announcing the opinion, Miyares said the policies are about parents’ rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Parents, not government, are in the best position to work with their children on important life decisions, and no parent signs up to co-parent with the government,” the statement said. “The Model Policies ensure that all students are treated with dignity and that parental involvement remains at the center. These policies are fully compliant with the law, and school boards across the Commonwealth should support and implement them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The opinion notes the inaugural set of model policies produced in 2021 under former Gov. Ralph Northam was withdrawn because the Department of Education under the Youngkin administration concluded they “promoted a specific viewpoint aimed at achieving cultural and social transformation in schools.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The revised model policies were designed to correct the failure of the prior policies to recognize that … ultimately, ‘the education of the youth of this [Commonwealth] is the responsibility of the parents of the students,’” Miyares wrote. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Education’s 2023 “Model Policies on Ensuring Privacy, Dignity, and Respect for All Students and Parents in Virginia’s Public Schools” were first drafted in 2022 and add steps students and parents must take when seeking gender-affirming changes to the student’s identity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The policies prohibit students from using school facilities or participating in sports activities that don’t align with the sex on their official school record. Changes to that designation require students and their parents to submit school divisions legal documentation like a new birth certificate or passport. A parent must provide written permission in order for a student to go by a different name or pronouns at school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Because the manner in which a child is addressed by school officials is inextricably tied to the educational upbringing of that child, parents’ fundamental rights necessarily encompass the prerogative to decide how their child will be addressed while at school,” the opinion said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Students who wish to be referred to by certain pronouns without the approval of their parents are not a protected class under any relevant federal or state law,” the opinion continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That conclusion drew swift criticism from the ACLU of Virginia, which issued a statement from Legal Director Eden Heilman calling the policies “part of a coordinated, national effort to erase transgender and nonbinary students from the classroom.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At best, they invite discrimination; at worst, they require it,” Heilman said. “Attorney General Jason Miyares’ opinion defending the policies is every bit as cruel and misguided as the policies themselves.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares, however, argued in his opinion that discrimination on the basis of sex is different from discrimination on the basis of gender identity and that the Fourth Amendment, Title IX and the Virginia Human Rights Act allow for the separation of sexes in certain contexts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Both sides of the classification — biological males and biological females — include transgender students and treat them identically to all similarly situated students of the same sex,” the opinion said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The opinion also stated the model policies do not conflict with the 2020 Grimm v. Gloucester County School Board decision. In that case, the Richmond-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit upheld a previous ruling that the local school board had violated Title IX by preventing transgender student Gavin Grimm from using a boys’ bathroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grimm</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> does not impose a blanket rule forbidding sex-separate facilities in all situations,” the opinion said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, Miyares wrote, the model policies “expressly address situations where federal law or a binding decision interpreting federal law may require a departure from the model policy’s default rule.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The model policy addressing bathrooms requires students to use ‘bathrooms that correspond to [their] sex, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">except to the extent federal law requires otherwise</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,’ and expressly cites </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grimm</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as an example of a federal law that may require otherwise,” the opinion continues. “A model policy that instructs school divisions to follow federal law, including </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grimm</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, cannot possibly conflict with federal law and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grimm</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because there is not a conflict with state or federal law, the opinion concluded, then school boards are required to adopt the model policies under Virginia code. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the opinion does not comment on what enforcement tools the state has to take action against school boards who do not comply. Several school divisions, including Fairfax, Arlington and Richmond, have </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/08/22/as-virginia-school-districts-split-on-updated-transgender-policies-state-enforcement-tools-appear-limited/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">openly stated they do not plan to adopt the model policies. </span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a press conference Wednesday, Gov. Youngkin responded to a question about steps the state could take besides telling school boards to follow the law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I just ask you to stand by,” Youngkin said. “Just like they initially pushed back when we issued an executive order empowering parents to make decisions for their children, while they are pushing back now, eventually we got to the right place. And I expect us fully to get to the right place.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ACLU of Virginia Thursday said that “like all attorney general opinions, today’s is only advisory, not binding.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia courts are not required to follow it,” the group said. “School boards continue to have an obligation to create safe, inclusive school environments for all students in compliance with state and federal law.”</span></p>

(Getty Images)</p><p><strong>By Eduardo Zelaya</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a parent, time can move fast and slow </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">simultaneously. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A year ago, Frederick Torres and his wife were preparing to send their little boy to kindergarten. Now, he’s about to be a “big boy” first-grader. The baby boy they carried in their arms when they fled Nicaragua is now a walking, babbling 2-year-old. The family also includes a 7-year-old son. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A year in their childrens’ lives passed in an instant. But a year in the couple’s lives felt like a century. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Torres family was forced out of Nicaragua after the government brutally confiscated the land they owned and relied on for survival. The Ortega regime has been on a rampage against its own citizens, jailing priests and human rights defenders, closing the offices of community aid groups and destroying the lives of families like the Torreses.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_36027" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:177px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/169084301511015057.jpeg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-36027" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/169084301511015057-177x300.jpeg" alt="" width="177" height="300" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/169084301511015057-177x300.jpeg 177w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/169084301511015057.jpeg 516w" sizes="(max-width: 177px) 100vw, 177px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Frederick Torres, in background with fist raised, shown with his wife and two sons.</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Frederick Torres and his family moved to Richmond, he hoped his anxiety wouldn’t follow. But President Biden still has not redesignated </span><a href="https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/temporary-protected-status" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">temporary protected status</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (TPS) for Nicaragua. If he did, Frederick and his family could apply for work permits, and the fear of deportation would subside. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I met Frederick through <a href="https://wearecasa.org/virginia/" target="_blank">CASA</a>, a community-led immigrant rights organization in Virginia where I lead organizing. We work with immigrants from many different countries, helping them learn about their new home and how to set themselves up for success. We teach English and financial literacy, and engage our members in grassroots campaigns to strengthen our communities, building people power for social change. Frederick quickly moved from just a member to an active community leader, eager to spread his story for immigrant justice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of those initiatives is calling on President Biden to re-designate TPS for people from Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nepal, and designate TPS for Guatemala. TPS is an immigration program the presidential administration can initiate when a country is in crisis and it would be unsafe to send people back there. TPS allows people from a designated country who are already in the U.S. to apply for work permits and not have to worry about deportation, for a while. Congress passed the law authorizing the president to designate countries for TPS in 1990 and each president decides how to use it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Bill Clinton first designated TPS for Nicaragua after Hurricane Mitch; it was </span><a href="https://www.history.com/topics/natural-disasters-and-environment/hurricane-mitch" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the deadliest Atlantic Ocean hurricane since 1780</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Presidents Bush and Obama extended TPS for Nicaragua, but importantly did not “re-designate” it, meaning that only those Nicaraguans who came to the U.S. before the hurricane in 1998 were eligible to benefit. President Trump tried to end TPS for all Nicaraguans,  but the community organized, filed a lawsuit, and prevented him from deporting our friends and loved ones. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, Biden extended TPS for Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nepal. But he didn’t take the opportunity to also re-designate TPS, something that is very much needed so that people who have come here more recently can apply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the Biden administration extended TPS for Nicaragua, it admitted the political and safety crisis there is worsening. </span><a href="https://www.refworld.org/country,,UNHCR,,NIC,,63bc17264,0.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More people are fleeing the nation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than at the height of the Cold War, with Frederick being one of them and fleeing to Virginia for protection. This dangerous situation is clearly stated in the government’s own </span><a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2023-06-21/pdf/2023-13246.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">notice extending the program.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it’s dangerous to send someone to Nicaragua, it doesn’t matter if they arrived in the U.S. years ago or last week. Danger is danger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something Frederick said recently really stuck with me. He said, “President Biden knows what it’s like to be a father. He knows about a parent’s duty to take care of their kids.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that is why he, and I, believe President Biden still has a chance to do the right thing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have another name for TPS, one that I think really fits: Together, Protected and Safe. That’s what TPS is for Virginians who have it, and that’s what it is for Frederick and others who also need it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, an analysis by the Virginia Mercury shows the majority of these websites are not using age verification methods as mandated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, since the law went into effect, data shows that an increasing number of Virginians are using technology that can easily grant access to these websites from locations in the commonwealth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation passed the General Assembly on a nearly unanimous vote this March. Bill patron Sen. Bill Stanley, R-Franklin, </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/03/09/bill-to-require-additional-proof-of-age-for-porn-sites-in-virginia-heads-to-youngkins-desk/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told the Mercury</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the proposal aimed to curb children’s access to harmful adult content. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the law, websites must verify users’ age and identity but can select the specific method of verification, such as requiring users to upload copies of government-issued identification or adopting other unspecified commercial technology. The law also allows people to sue pornographic websites that don’t use proper age and identity verification methods “for damages resulting from a minor’s access to such material.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some pornography websites — most notably Pornhub — have opted to </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/06/29/ahead-of-new-age-verification-law-pornhub-blocks-access-in-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">block</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> users from accessing their platforms altogether in Virginia in protest of the new law, residents can still easily access adult content through a plethora of unrestricted, lesser-known websites. </span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="vYo7JnWQKJ"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/06/29/ahead-of-new-age-verification-law-pornhub-blocks-access-in-virginia/">Ahead of new age verification law, Pornhub blocks access in Virginia</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Ahead of new age verification law, Pornhub blocks access in Virginia&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/06/29/ahead-of-new-age-verification-law-pornhub-blocks-access-in-virginia/embed/#?secret=Ob5qMMcRyP#?secret=vYo7JnWQKJ" data-secret="vYo7JnWQKJ" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get an understanding of how many websites are complying with the law, the Mercury attempted to access the 65 “top porn tube sites” listed on toppornsites.com. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of Aug 15, only one website, xHamster, is using age verification methods mandated by the law. Ten websites are blocked altogether, and 54 remain entirely unrestricted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Free Speech Coalition Executive Director Alison Boden said a big reason why a lot of websites aren’t complying with the law is because their companies are not based in the United States, which makes it difficult to hold them accountable for breaking it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The actual legal jeopardy that an international company might face, especially since it would be like a private lawsuit from an individual, is not terribly high compared to what a U.S. company would face if sued by a person in Virginia,” Boden said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorney General Jason Miyares’ office did not respond to a request for comment on whether he is aware of websites not complying with the law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boden also emphasized that less-mainstream websites, unlike Pornhub, often lack adequate </span><a href="https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/articles/4419900587155-Community-Guidelines" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">guardrails</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that ensure content uploaded on their platforms is consensual and legal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People are “definitely at risk of going to the site where they aren’t as stringent about verifying who’s uploading content, that it belongs to them, that it’s legal and consensual,” Boden said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Virginians can still easily access blocked websites like Pornhub through virtual private networks, or VPNs — encryption methods that allow easy access to websites regardless of location. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/local/virginia/new-pornography-verification-virginia-ranks-highest-vpn-searches/291-7cc45c63-060a-4ad0-ac02-690e3d476a45#:~:text=Google%20Trends%20data%20changes%20over,seven%20days%2C%20and%2030%20days." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">13NewsNow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Virginia had the highest number of searches for “VPN” or “virtual private network” of all states from June 29 through July 5.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NordVPN Public Relations Manager Darija Grobova said there was a 14% growth in VPN downloads from Virginia between June and July.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A representative from ExpressVPN said its website has seen a 15% increase in traffic from Virginia in the last two months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ExpressVPN Digital Privacy Advocate Lauren Hendry Parsons said there are potential privacy concerns associated with uploading personal information through required age-verification methods. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Across the United States, we are seeing a concerning trend of diminishing digital freedoms due to legislation,” Parson said. “We call upon legislators and the community to pursue better safeguards that prioritize the online safety of children without compromising an individual&#8217;s right to digital privacy and freedom.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the past three years, anyone enrolled in Medicaid was allowed to keep their coverage regardless of whether or not they still met eligibility requirements. According to the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services’ Medicaid unwinding renewal </span><a href="https://www.dmas.virginia.gov/data/return-to-normal-enrollment/eligibility-redetermination-tracker/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dashboard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, nearly 400,000 enrollees reviewed so far have kept their coverage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This “unwinding” process is meant to terminate coverage for enrollees who are no longer eligible due to reasons such as exceeding </span><a href="https://coverva.dmas.virginia.gov/learn/our-programs/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">monthly income limits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, </span><a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/medicaid-enrollment-and-unwinding-tracker/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from health care nonprofit KFF, formerly known as the Kaiser Family Foundation, shows 43% of people who had lost coverage in Virginia as of June lost it for procedural reasons other than ineligibility. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Procedural reasons for termination of coverage include cases when enrollees don’t submit necessary paperwork to the state on time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If DMAS doesn’t have enough information to automatically renew an individual’s coverage, the agency may mail him or her a renewal package asking for additional information. Individuals who do not complete and submit the package within 30 days will have their coverage terminated for failing to renew.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Virginia Poverty Law Center analyst Eleanor Sullivan said some Medicaid members have contacted the organization saying they received their renewal package only a few days before the 30-day deadline. This, she said, has made it difficult for them to return the necessary information before their coverage is terminated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are in the process of asking the state how widespread these mailing delays may be, as they affect Virginians’ access to care,” Sullivan said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra urged the nation’s governors in a June 12 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">letter </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to take advantage of federal flexibilities to minimize avoidable coverage losses, especially for people who are still eligible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nobody who is eligible for Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program should lose coverage simply because they changed addresses, didn’t receive a form, or didn’t have enough information about the renewal process,” said Becerra.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia applied for three flexibilities that were </span><a href="https://www.medicaid.gov/resources-for-states/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/unwinding-and-returning-regular-operations-after-covid-19/covid-19-phe-unwinding-section-1902e14a-waiver-approvals/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">approved </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">July 27 by the federal Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, which oversees state and federal Medicaid benefits. These flexibilities allow enrollees to designate an authorized representative to assist them with completing their renewal form over the phone, let Medicaid managed care plans help enrollees with the renewal process and reinstate coverage for people who are found to be eligible after losing coverage for procedural reasons. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Individuals who lose coverage after failing to renew within the 30-day window may still submit their paperwork for renewal during the 90 days following the date that their package was sent. Anyone who renews within that 90-day grace period may have their Medicaid reinstated if they’re still eligible, with coverage being retroactively applied through the date of termination to eliminate any gaps. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“However, to our knowledge, neither termination notices nor renewal packages mention the 90-day grace period,” Sullivan said. “We are concerned that Virginians who still qualify for Medicaid won’t seek to regain coverage because they are unaware that they can still renew past the 30-day deadline.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Individuals who lose coverage due to not completing the renewal process also won&#8217;t be referred for coverage through </span><a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal Marketplace</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> insurance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DMAS did not provide answers to specific questions about the redetermination process and potential delays, but pointed the Mercury to several resources, including help on </span><a href="https://coverva.dmas.virginia.gov/media/2076/understanding-the-renewal-calendar_final_3152023.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">understanding the renewal calendar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and information on the </span><a href="https://coverva.dmas.virginia.gov/return-to-normal-enrollment/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">return to normal enrollment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An Aug. 9 </span><a href="https://www.medicaid.gov/sites/default/files/2023-08/Virginia-may-2023-unwinding-data-ltr.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to DMAS stated only 6% of Virginia Medicaid enrollees had had their coverage terminated because of procedural reasons as of May. However, KFF Vice President Robin Rudowitz and research associate Sophia Moreno said that figure was in comparison to the total pool of over 200,000 Virginians whose cases were reviewed at the time and include those who have lost and retained their coverage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rudowitz and Moreno said their 43% figure, by contrast, reflects the pool of people who have lost coverage after redetermination. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to DMAS’ </span><a href="https://dmas.virginia.gov/media/5725/dmas-r2n-town-hall-faqs-accessible-march-2023.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an enrollee who is no longer eligible for Medicaid benefits will receive a letter notifying them of their termination of benefits. If the termination occurs on or before the 16th of the month, their coverage will end on the last day of the same month. If the termination occurs from the 17th through the end of the month, their coverage will end at the close of the next month. </span></p>
<p><em>This story was updated to clarify statements from Rudowitz and Moreno on the percentage of Virginia enrollees who had their coverage terminated because of procedural reasons.</em></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its doors will swing open. The driver will greet the small people and beckon them aboard. The big kids will clamber inside and take their seats. For the smallest, however, it will be a moment of frightful uncertainty. The 5-year-old child’s grasp will tighten on the parental hand; together they approach the bus door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One last glance upward. The child looks for the loving assurance needed to take the singular step that decisively delineates life as it has been from a forever different life ahead. It ends the hazy comfort of daycare or, for some, years spent in the cocoon of home. Counting pre-K, it begins a 13- to 14-year educational journey designed to end someday with a cap and gown, a diploma, hugs, photographs and big smiles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet on this morning, tears will gather and spill, even from the wariest of eyes. Grown-ups will try to conceal it from their children — failing more often than not — in hopes that the first day of school will be remembered more as the start of a joyful and fulfilling odyssey than one of the unsettling times the child saw mom or dad cry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s morning on the first day of a new school year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a world gone awry, our public schools remain the essential bulwark and common bond of our communities and of Virginia broadly. Battered and bruised, the system still works. And it works primarily because of the professionals at the heart of it all: teachers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It works, even with such sobering and unprecedented challenges as Virginia’s dreadful levels of pandemic-related </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/08/29/four-takeaways-from-virginias-post-pandemic-standardized-test-results/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">learning loss</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and mass shootings, seemingly at random, across the nation in classrooms filled with children.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="etF2T6bPyM"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/08/29/four-takeaways-from-virginias-post-pandemic-standardized-test-results/">Four takeaways from Virginia’s post-pandemic standardized test results</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Four takeaways from Virginia’s post-pandemic standardized test results&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/08/29/four-takeaways-from-virginias-post-pandemic-standardized-test-results/embed/#?secret=h6RzHdZ0Ys#?secret=etF2T6bPyM" data-secret="etF2T6bPyM" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It works, even as many teachers — burned out by meager pay, the erosion of their professional discretion and creativity, a slavish institutional fealty to standardized testing, a caustic political environment and ebbing public and administrative support — abandoned the profession in an exodus exacerbated by the pandemic. It created acute shortages in some</span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/state-board-data-funding/data-reports/statistics-reports/interactive-data-dashboards/teacher-school-staffing-vacancy-dashboard" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia districts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It works, even as more parents choose alternatives to public schools such as private or religious schools and homeschooling. Projected enrollment in Virginia this fall is down by just over 65,000 students from the fall statewide enrollment of nearly 1.3 million in 2019, according to</span><a href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d22/tables/dt22_203.20.asp" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">National Center for Educational Statistics data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It works because of the teachers, the counselors, the administrators, the school nurses, the bus drivers, the coaches, the custodians — the people who show up every day to provide the instruction, socialization and structure that prepares kids for adulthood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If ever there were a time to dedicate a school year to restoring the luster of teaching and appreciation for teachers, 2023-24 should be it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We should do it just because it’s right and it’s a smart investment. Always has been.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those parents or guardians or other caregivers who walk their little ones to those school bus stops (or to the front door of the school building itself) during these closing weeks of summer, the contributions of a teacher at some point in life remain very real. Most will recall a special teacher who just </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">clicked</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who reached out; who saw a struggle and stepped in to lend encouragement and impart understanding; who saw promise and leaned in to help grow and polish it to its brightest potential.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ve seen stories of</span><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/education/4135876-back-to-school-sales-boom-as-teachers-dig-into-their-own-pockets-for-classroom-supplies/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">teachers</span></a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/16/us/teachers-school-supplies.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">using</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> personal funds to help supply classroom materials, even though average pay for K-12 faculty in Virginia</span><a href="https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/how-much-do-teachers-get-paid-see-new-state-by-state-data/2023/04" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">trailed the national average</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by more than $6,000 in the 2022-23 school year, according to Education Week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The General Assembly made some progress toward boosting teacher pay closer to the national average by appropriating a 5% raise for the current fiscal year. It could have been 7% had the General Assembly</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/07/31/willful-neglect-of-virginias-second-year-budgets-must-not-become-our-new-normal/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">bothered to finalize amendments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the second half of the biennial budget by its June 30 deadline.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is, however, a more practical and pressing reason to restore our cadre of educators: because we have too few of them now to optimally instruct the children we entrust to their care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to state</span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/state-board-data-funding/data-reports/statistics-reports/interactive-data-dashboards/teacher-school-staffing-vacancy-dashboard" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Department of Education data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the commonwealth was about 3,573 vacancies, or 3.9%, short of its full complement of just over 92,000 teachers last October. That’s up from an average of 870 vacancies from 2015 to 2020, according to a scathing</span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt575-3.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">recent report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the General Assembly’s research and analysis arm, the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission. In 2021, that number vaulted to about 2,600 and continued climbing, JLARC reported.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problems driving teachers out of the classrooms, however, aren’t all about pay and they’re not exclusive to Virginia.</span><a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/shortage-of-teachers/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">A study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published in December by the Economic Policy Institute found that salary was tied for fourth among reasons teachers bailed. The top reason given (by 43%) of the 958 departing K-12 public school teachers EPI surveyed: “The stress and disappointments of teaching weren’t worth it.” Twenty-four percent cited insufficient pay, just behind “I did not get enough support from my school district” (29%).<iframe loading="lazy" 0 src="https://www.epi.org?p=255717&amp;view=embed&amp;embed_template=charts_v2013_08_21&amp;embed_date=20230801&amp;onp=254745&amp;utm_source=epi_press&amp;utm_medium=chart_embed&amp;utm_campaign=charts_v2" width="100%" height="460" 1="frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&quot;" scrolling="yes" class="iframe-class" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After COVID-19 was deemed sufficiently controlled for classroom instruction to resume, teachers reported a sharp increase in outright insubordination, defiance and threats by students. It reached a horrifying ultimate conclusion when a 6-year-old boy allegedly shot and gravely wounded his first-grade teacher in Newport News with a handgun he smuggled into school from his home,</span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/08/us/newport-news-student-shot-teacher-warrant" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">then bragged about it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stress and disrespect don’t end at the classroom door, either. As administrators made greater demands on teachers’ time, support for them ebbed among the public, parents and elected officials as public education became a major wedge issue in the 2021 governor’s race with teachers and curricula caught in the middle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a well-accepted fact in the world of child psychology: children thrive when they are cared for by their families and feel immersed in their culture, heritage and community. Deprived of these supports, children can feel lost and are at severe risk of long-term psychological harms that have lifelong detrimental consequences. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now, we’re seeing an astonishing </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/afghanistan-baby-marine-adoption-joshua-mast-295673fb358cf30abd243995cd846c99" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">custody battle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> unfold before our eyes right here in Virginia. The case concerns the safety and well-being of an Afghan child who was taken from her family by a U.S. Marine, and is now at risk of being separated from her loved ones forever, unless action is taken immediately to reverse course.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The first 1000 days</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the moment a child is born, they begin absorbing cultural norms like a sponge. From the sounds and voices they hear around them, to the rituals of their family, to the smells and taste of food, their culture and heritage are communicated through all their senses. These experiences and memories are often what support children as they reach developmental milestones in their first 1,000 days of life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was the case for Baby Doe, a little girl, now 4 years old, who finds herself at the center of a critical custody battle between her Afghan family and a United States Marine. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a U.S.-led raid in 2019 killed Baby Doe’s parents and five siblings, this child was taken in and cared for by the few remaining Afghan relatives in her home country. She quickly grew attached to them as her caregivers. The nurturing family environment she was surrounded by supported her continued development despite the trauma she endured from the raid, and she began to walk and crawl like any healthy baby would, even making her first attempts at babbling words and phrases in Pashto, the local language.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then everything changed on September 3, 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just after her second birthday, Baby Doe was torn from her family’s arms by U.S. Marine Joshua Mast, who was deployed to Afghanistan at the time of the raid that killed Baby Doe’s parents and siblings. After learning about Baby Doe, Joshua Mast decided to pursue a formal adoption of her in the U.S. without her Afghan family’s knowledge. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A devastating rupture</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When children are separated from their families, they experience confusion, trauma and extreme destabilization due to the loss of significant attachment to their primary caregiver. This is particularly traumatic for babies and toddlers in the early stages of development, with the loss of familiar cultural surroundings &#8211; the food, language, rituals, smells, sounds and people who have been supporting their critical early steps in life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This violent rupture at such a crucial stage in a child’s development is not only confusing, but it is also frightening for the child. Living in an entirely new environment disrupts their understanding and they are forced to try to adapt without any familiar people to help them cope. This process of acculturation (adapting to a new culture) is considered challenging enough for adults who are already functioning independently and able to problem solve and make decisions. For young children, it can fundamentally disrupt their developmental process and the natural experience of attachment and identity development. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, we have seen the effects of the deep-rooted legacy of violently removing children of color from their families, both within the U.S. and in other countries. There is more than enough evidence from previous cases to tell us that Baby Doe is likely to face insurmountable challenges as she moves through the stages of social, emotional and identity development in her teenage years and into adulthood. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the turn of the 21st century, thousands of Guatemalan children had been illegally removed from their families and adopted by foreign parents, many in the United States. </span><a href="https://radioambulante.org/en/translation/translation-tell-me-who-i-am" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Osmin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Guatemalan child who was adopted by a white family in Philadelphia, describes what it was like being taken from his home and growing up in a culture completely foreign from his own: “I’ll carry the day I left with me for my whole life. … I cried every night … I just wanted to go back to my mom, where I couldn’t go.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much like Osmin and other children separated from their families, Baby Doe is likely to experience what child psychologists often call “silent trauma.” Her unresolved and complicated grief throughout her life with the Masts will likely be something she internalizes. This trauma will deepen as she gets older and begins to understand that her Afghan family was robbed of the chance to raise her and that she was deprived of the opportunity to be able to embrace her cultural heritage, her religion and her language with pride. This loss of cultural identity, heritage, and agency shapes every aspect of a child’s life moving forward and can make it difficult to grapple with adolescence and adulthood. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nelson Fox is one of the thousands of Native American children who was taken from his family and tribe and placed in the custody of a white foster family before the landmark </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/07/12/the-indian-child-welfare-act-is-a-cornerstone-of-virginia-tribal-sovereignty/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indian Child Welfare Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (ICWA) was passed in 1978. Fox recounts the pain he felt when he was forcibly taken from his loved ones and placed in this unfamiliar culture and family for 18 years. “I tried suicide. I tried slicing my wrist,” </span><a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/10/14/20913408/us-stole-thousands-of-native-american-children" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fox said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;The Indian Child Welfare Act is a cornerstone of Virginia tribal sovereignty&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/07/12/the-indian-child-welfare-act-is-a-cornerstone-of-virginia-tribal-sovereignty/embed/#?secret=Vqy4y55JE1#?secret=Ien9jA7Q3Z" data-secret="Ien9jA7Q3Z" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As child psychologists and physicians, we witness the devastating long-term consequences of these ruptures in the lives of children like Osmin, Nelson, and Baby Doe. We strongly believe that children have better outcomes if they can grow up in a home where they are connected to their family, culture, religion and heritage. These connections are vital to supporting their healthy physical, social, cognitive, academic, emotional, and identity development. Without this fundamental grounding to help them understand who they are, and where they come from, it can be impossible for some to find their place and purpose in the world. </span><a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/10/14/20913408/us-stole-thousands-of-native-american-children" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jane Harstad</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, another Native American stolen from her land, tribe and family by forcible adoption said: “When you’re adopted, you know you’re missing something. I’ve likened it to when someone has a 500-piece puzzle. They have all the pieces to make this pretty picture, except one.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Right to family</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All children should have the right to be raised within their own family of origin and culture, when the opportunity is available. From her earliest days of life, beginning with the U.S.-led raid, Baby Doe has faced traumas that will forever affect her understanding of herself and her family. Losing her parents and five siblings all in the same day during a raid in her hometown is a significant trauma for any child. When disaster strikes and circumstances prevent it, coping with and healing this trauma requires significant support. Her Afghan family was providing the support, care, and love needed to raise Baby Doe and help her deal with that trauma until her forcible adoption disrupted that process and disregarded her rights as a child and the rights of her family. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Masts&#8217; intentions have always been focused on taking Baby Doe and bringing her to their home in the U.S., regardless of the consequences or the additional trauma they would be putting her through. They have gone to extreme lengths to rupture her connection to her Afghan family and culture, and they appear to have no consideration for how their actions will impact her long-term development and health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March 2023, a federal judge vacated the Masts&#8217; adoption order and confirmed that the Afghan relatives who were raising her before she was taken are her “</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/afghanistan-baby-marine-adoption-joshua-mast-295673fb358cf30abd243995cd846c99" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">de facto</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” parents. However, the Masts refuse to return Baby Doe to her rightful family, and to this day, they are holding the little girl in their home while they appeal the court’s ruling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her rightful family are watching from afar as their child is being raised by people who took her. Baby Doe will be speaking English instead of Pashto, celebrating holidays like Christmas instead of Ramadan, and learning American customs and traditions in place of her own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the Masts continue to put this child’s long-term health and safety at risk, there is an opportunity to right this wrong. The Virginia courts should immediately return this stolen child to her rightful family. Ensuring that Baby Doe is able to grow up with her Afghan family isn’t just about this one child; it is about protecting every child’s fundamental right to grow up connected to their family, heritage, culture and community.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin and Sen. Siobhan Dunnavant, R-Henrico, hold a "Parents Matter" discussion at a Henrico County elementary school. (Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the latest of three “Parents Matter” town halls he’s hosting around Virginia ahead of pivotal General Assembly elections this fall, Gov. Glenn Youngkin hit on his usual themes of giving parents a bigger role in schools, raising expectations for student achievement and finding “multiple pathways” for young Virginians to start careers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But one of the biggest topics of discussion over the roughly hour and a half Youngkin spent interacting with a crowd at a Henrico County elementary school was one that defies easy policy solutions: the impact of social media on children and teenagers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I do think this topic of social media and the … destructive influence that it is having on our children is one we all need to run to,” Youngkin said. “We have to run to educate ourselves. … Parents want more information so that they can engage more productively and more restrictively with their children on what’s happening in their social media life. That’s going to be a collective effort that we&#8217;re going to have to work on together.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Youngkin and Sen. Siobhan Dunnavant, R-Henrico — the co-headliner for the event at Crestview Elementary School — linked social media to the broader issues of bullying and youth mental health struggles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dunnavant, whose blue-tilting district in the Richmond suburbs has made her one of the most endangered Republican incumbents of the 2023 election cycle, said the solution to parental concerns about social media will probably be “a multitude of things,” including anti-bullying hotlines and a closer look at the data-driven algorithms popular apps like TikTok use to serve up images and videos to young viewers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the two political figures took questions from parents concerned about strangers contacting their children on Instagram, the challenge of disappearing messages on Snapchat and the seeming futility of trying to control what kids do online, Dunnavant and Youngkin repeatedly returned to the overarching message of parental empowerment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Parents have to know the things to which their kids are being exposed so that they can guide their children in their understanding of those things and their determining right and wrong,” said Dunnavant. “Because that is a parent&#8217;s duty and prerogative.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Youngkin won the 2021 gubernatorial race against former Gov. Terry McAuliffe, his “parents’ rights” platform centered largely on ending COVID-19 mask mandates and giving parents more control over what their children are learning and reading in K-12 schools. Two years later, as Youngkin and his Republican allies look to take full control of a General Assembly where Republicans and Democrats are currently splitting power, the series of “Parents Matter” events Youngkin is hosting this summer offer a glimpse into how that message is being refined and redeployed in 2023.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the Henrico gathering, parent-themed town halls, organized by the governor’s office instead of his political team, have been held in the Roanoke area and Prince William County, with another coming up in the Fredericksburg area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuesday’s event in Henrico also showed some of the rougher edges of what social conservatives mean by “parents’ rights” when a man in the audience stood and urged Youngkin to take further action to restrict LGBTQ-themed books and lessons in schools and ban medical treatments for minors pursuing gender transition care. The man, who did not announce his name but described himself as a father, grandfather and great-grandfather, said the process of challenging books in Henrico was too complicated and asked Youngkin to address an “epidemic going in our country today of gender dysphoria and gender confusion.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Amanda Chase, R-Chesterfield, introduced </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB791" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during the 2023 General Assembly session that would have banned medical transitions for minors. That proposal, which mirrored laws passed by several other Republican-led states, was swiftly voted down in a Democratic-controlled Senate committee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to the question Tuesday, the governor did not say directly whether he intends to seek additional restrictions on books or the use of puberty blockers and surgeries for transgender youth. Instead, Youngkin noted that he had signed a law requiring parental notification for sexually explicit reading assignments and rolling back transgender-inclusive school policies approved by former Gov. Ralph Northam’s administration. The governor emphasized that his administration’s new policies on transgender students, which several school divisions have indicated they don’t intend to follow, require schools to inform parents about “life-changing” gender identity issues involving their child.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A parent must be in the room. And it should not happen without them,” Youngkin said. “Of course there are moments where there are sincere concerns about neglect or abuse at home. And there are clear protections for this in federal law and in state law.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats and transgender rights advocates have denounced the new policies as punitive and cruel, arguing they could expose students to harm from unsupportive parents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of addressing the very real issues we have ahead of us, Governor Youngkin’s response is to escalate a culture war and drop a policy that harms kids, removes resources for teachers and ignores the rights of parents in Virginia,” Narissa Rahaman, executive director of LGBTQ rights group Equality Virginia, said in a statement last month responding to Youngkin’s school policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While speaking to reporters after the event, Youngkin did not give a direct answer when asked whether he would support banning gender transition care for minors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“First we have to get parents at the table,” Youngkin said. “The previous administration&#8217;s policy did not require parents to be at the table. This is our first stop.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At other points during the event, both Youngkin and Dunnavant stressed that their view of parental rights also means parents have a responsibility to set firm boundaries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I always took great pride when one of our children came up to us and said, ‘You&#8217;re the meanest parents ever,’” Youngkin joked. &#8220;We&#8217;d hug and say, ‘My job is not to be your friend. It&#8217;s to be your parent.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dunnavant, who said she “looked at everything” her children did on their phones, said young people need structure and guidance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don&#8217;t know how we got this off track,” said Dunnavant, a doctor facing a tough electoral challenge this year from Del. Schuyler Van Valkenburg, D-Henrico, a high school civics teacher. “When I grew up, the scariest authority unit in my life was the parent-teacher team.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two Republicans largely focused on policies they had already championed as opposed to laying out new, untested proposals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin touted a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1072" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bipartisan law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> he signed this year that requires schools to report bullying incidents to affected families within 24 hours. He also noted his unsuccessful </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-04-11/general-assembly-civil-liability-internet-minors-bill" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">attempt to limit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tech companies’ ability to gather data on social media users under 18. The crowd applauded when Youngkin reminded them an online age-verification bill, mainly aimed at blocking minors from accessing pornography websites, resulted in the popular site </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/06/29/ahead-of-new-age-verification-law-pornhub-blocks-access-in-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pornhub cutting off access</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the discussion on social media, Youngkin said he thinks the state and federal government can play a policy role, while indicating that the most immediate step could be to offer parents more resources and education on how social media and cell phones work and how potential harms can be avoided.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s some fear,” Youngkin told reporters afterward when describing what he’s heard from attendees at the town halls. “And you can see it and hear it as to what the ramifications are if they don&#8217;t get this right.”</span></p>

Solis)</p><p>In some states, new laws banning gender-affirming care for transgender youth are dissuading health care providers from offering mental health services and other medical care that isn’t explicitly banned by those laws.</p>
<p>In the first few weeks after Mississippi’s law went into effect in February, nurse practitioner Stacie Pace said she was fielding calls and emails from parents of trans youth who said their children’s pediatricians would no longer see them for routine care. Pace offers gender-affirming care at a clinic in Hattiesburg.</p>
<p>“[Parents] weren’t able to bring their kids to the pediatrician they were seeing before because the ban scared the pediatrician,” said Pace. She said the vague language in Mississippi’s law scared primary, mental health and other providers from seeing trans youth and even adults. One parent told her their child needed a refill on asthma medication and their doctor refused to see them.</p>
<p>In Texas, a <a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/88R/billtext/html/SB00014F.htm" target="_blank">new law</a> banning gender-affirming care for minors is pushing some providers, including the pediatrician who led a program that <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/05/12/transgender-gender-affirming-care-genecis/" target="_blank">offered mental health services and hormone treatments</a> to transgender children, to leave the state. Dr. Ximena Lopez, a pediatric endocrinologist, has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eet2wvh9JeA" target="_blank">said</a> <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2023/07/17/texas-gender-affirming-care-doctors-hospitals/" target="_blank">publicly</a> she is leaving Texas out of concern for the safety of herself and her family.</p>
<p>And in <a href="https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/55leg/2R/bills/SB1138P.pdf" target="_blank">Arizona</a> and <a href="https://www.senate.mo.gov/22info/BTS_Web/Bill.aspx?SessionType=R&amp;BillID=71259876" target="_blank">Missouri</a>, advocates worry that new state laws barring medical practitioners from referring transgender youth to other providers for “gender transition procedures” might curb access to counseling and therapy.</p>
<p>The new laws do not focus on mental health services. In fact, some state lawmakers who have sponsored bans on surgery or hormone therapy have stressed their support for mental health care.<i></i></p>

<p>Indiana state Rep. Michelle Davis, a Republican who sponsored <a href="https://iga.in.gov/legislative/2023/bills/senate/480/details" target="_blank">Indiana’s new law</a> prohibiting gender-affirming care for minors, <a href="https://stateline.org/2023/02/09/republicans-have-filed-dozens-of-bills-to-disrupt-transgender-youth-health-care/" target="_blank">told Stateline</a> earlier this year: “We should continue to support children who may be struggling by ensuring they have access to compassionate mental health care.”</p>
<p>But state bans on services such as hormone therapies and surgery can create a climate of fear and confusion for trans youth, families and care providers that can have a chilling effect on all types of care, said Elana Redfield, federal policy director at UCLA School of Law’s Williams Institute, a public policy think tank focused on sexual orientation and gender identity issues.</p>
<p>“If you’re a young person who is trans or a parent of that young person, you might feel concerned about asking for any kind of care for fear it might come back to hurt you or your family,” Redfield said.</p>
<p>Heather Stone, a licensed counselor in Huntsville, Alabama, who sees trans patients, saw that chilling effect after Alabama passed its law last year, even though a court order is currently <a href="https://www.al.com/news/2023/07/alabama-attorney-generals-office-to-spend-nearly-1-million-defending-gender-affirming-care-ban.html" target="_blank">preventing it from taking effect</a>.</p>
<p>“Mental health treatment for trans youth is not illegal in Alabama,” said Stone, “but the law is so vague that it makes parents and children more hesitant to even seek mental health treatment because they’re confused whether” that treatment has been banned.</p>
<p>Across the country, legislators in at least 21 Republican-led states have passed laws <a href="https://www.mapresearch.org/img/maps/citations-youth-medical-care-bans.pdf" target="_blank">banning or restricting gender-affirming care for minors</a>, according to the Movement Advancement Project, a nonprofit think tank that tracks LGBTQ+ state policies. Similar laws have been considered in at least seven other states this year.</p>
<p>The raft of new legislation is part of a recent nationwide effort by GOP-led state legislatures to place new restrictions on transgender people. Multiple states have enacted laws that bar transgender girls from competing on girls sports teams, prohibit discussions of gender identity in classrooms and outlaw drag shows when minors are present.</p>

<p>The laws restricting gender-affirming health care vary by state, but mainly prohibit hormone therapy and gender-affirming surgery for transgender minors. Implementation has been patchy, as many of the laws face court challenges and some aren’t scheduled to go into effect until later this year.</p>
<p>Legislators sponsoring the bills have cited a lack of information on the long-term effects of hormone therapy on adolescents. Republican state Rep. Jim Olsen of Oklahoma, who <a href="http://webserver1.lsb.state.ok.us/cf/2023-24%20SUPPORT%20DOCUMENTS/votes/House/SB613_VOTES.HTM" target="_blank">voted for</a> his state’s law banning gender-affirming care, <a href="https://www.okhouse.gov/posts/news-20230228_1" target="_blank">said</a> that he hoped to spare teens from undergoing “irreversible procedures” they might later regret.</p>
<p>“Even one child who undergoes a life-altering procedure and later laments their decision is one too many,” Olsen said.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services describes gender-affirming care as a spectrum <a href="https://opa.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/2022-03/gender-affirming-care-young-people-march-2022.pdf" target="_blank">of medical and non-medical services</a> that can include social affirmation, hormone therapy, mental health services and surgery.</p>
<p>Gender-affirming surgery is rarely performed on patients under 18. Puberty-blocking drugs and hormone treatments are prescribed by physicians to some children and adolescents struggling with gender dysphoria, a condition in which a person’s gender identity doesn’t align with their sex assigned at birth.</p>
<p>Major U.S. medical organizations — including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychiatric Association — oppose bans on gender-affirming care and support care for minors when administered appropriately.</p>
<p>However, some European countries, including <a href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-norway-not-ban-gender-affirming-care-956221436313" target="_blank">Norway</a> and the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/uk-transgender-puberty-blockers-abd9145484006fea23de6b4656c937da" target="_blank">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuacohen/2023/06/06/increasing-number-of-european-nations-adopt-a-more-cautious-approach-to-gender-affirming-care-among-minors/?sh=606ebdc97efb" target="_blank">recently changed</a> or have considered changing medical guidelines on gender-affirming care for minors. Data analyzed by public health officials in England, Finland and Sweden found long-term studies <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11930-023-00358-x" target="_blank">failed to show improvements</a> in mental health and suggested puberty blockers could hinder bone development.</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A ‘chilling effect’</h4>

	</h4>
<p>Johnathan Gooch of Equality Texas, a statewide organization that advocates for LGBTQ+ rights, said rhetoric and legislation from Texas lawmakers on transgender issues already have eroded health care options for both trans youth and adults.</p>
<p>“Because we’ve seen such a sustained attack on trans youth, there are a lot of trans-focused health providers that have closed up shop over time,” he said, citing the <a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/patient-safety-outcomes/texas-childrens-to-end-transgender-care.html" target="_blank">closure</a> of gender-affirming services for adolescents at Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston. “The options have been consistently narrowing since February 2022.”</p>
<p>That’s when Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott directed the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services to investigate reports of children undergoing gender-affirming care <a href="https://gov.texas.gov/news/post/governor-abbott-directs-dfps-to-investigate-gender-transitioning-procedures-as-child-abuse" target="_blank">as potential child abuse</a>. Gooch said some mental health providers at the time were concerned that they’d be required as mandatory reporters to turn in parents who brought their children in for mental health visits related to gender-affirming care.</p>
<p>“We did see a chilling effect among mental health providers, who would prefer to end their client relationship rather than being forced to report them to authorities, even though that was a misunderstanding of the law,” he said.</p>
<p>Stone, the licensed counselor in Alabama, said she knows providers who are afraid to treat trans youth and adults since the state law passed last year.</p>
<p>“We have to ask [ourselves], am I providing gender-affirming care, and is that illegal?” she said. “My reading of it, and I’m not an attorney, is that supportive mental health is not illegal. But you never know. But I’m not going to stop providing it at this point because I think that would be ethically wrong and there’s a huge need in the community.”</p>
<p>Oliver Hall is the trans health director at the Kentucky Health Justice Network, which connects trans clients with gender-affirming health resources and provides guidance on insurance coverage. A federal judge recently lifted an injunction on Kentucky’s ban on gender-affirming care for trans youth, allowing it to take effect.</p>
<p>“There is a lot of misunderstanding about what the law does with regard to mental health care,” Hall said in a statement to Stateline. While the current law does not ban mental health services, <a href="https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/recorddocuments/bill/23RS/hb470/orig_bill.pdf" target="_blank">a different bill</a>, which did not pass, would have explicitly banned gender-affirming mental health care for minors.</p>
<p>“This has also obviously added to the chilling effect for mental health care providers treating trans youth,” Hall said.</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Issues with affordability</h4>

	</h4>
<p>Some states, including Arizona, Arkansas, Mississippi and Missouri, prohibit the use of public funds, such as Medicaid, to cover gender-affirming care for minors and in some instances for all trans people regardless of age.</p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Republicans Have Filed Dozens of Bills to Disrupt Transgender Youth Health Care&#8221; &#8212; Stateline" src="https://stateline.org/2023/02/09/republicans-have-filed-dozens-of-bills-to-disrupt-transgender-youth-health-care/embed/#?secret=OnbUWHxSKV#?secret=vBTvizifwO" data-secret="vBTvizifwO" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>The state laws don’t explicitly prohibit coverage of mental health services, but they create legal uncertainty for providers, said Redfield, of the Williams Institute.</p>
<p>For example: A mental health visit that’s linked to a prohibited treatment might also not be covered by public insurance, she said.</p>
<p>Gender-affirming care, even when prescribed and overseen by medical professionals, can be expensive. And trans people are <a href="https://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/demographics-insurance-coverage-and-access-to-care-among-transgender-adults/" target="_blank">more likely to be uninsured</a> and report cost-related barriers to care than cisgender adults, according to a KFF analysis from 2020.</p>
<p>Medicaid policies that exclude transgender-specific care were <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-0009.12467" target="_blank">associated with less use of therapy and counseling</a>, according to a 2020 analysis, while trans-inclusive Medicaid policies were associated with more use of therapy/counseling.</p>
<p>In Texas, Gooch said Equality Texas has partnered with Campaign for Southern Equality to offer small grants to families who ask for financial assistance in accessing gender-affirming care.</p>
<p>“Texas is a big state, and most of the places out of state [that offer gender-affirming care] are going to take you a five- to seven-hour drive or a flight,” said Gooch. “There’s a financial burden, a time cost, and making all of that simpler for the families is something important to us.”</p>
<p>The Campaign for Southern Equality, which advocates for LGBTQ+ rights across the South, recently launched the <a href="https://southernequality.org/styep/" target="_blank">Southern Trans Youth Emergency Project</a>, a regional effort to provide emergency grants and guidance to families of trans youth impacted by the gender-affirming care laws.</p>
<p>“As bans are passing and laws are changing, we’re working to do town halls and partnering with folks on the ground to make sure we’re getting out good, accurate information on what the law does and doesn’t say,” said Ivy Hill, director of gender justice for the group. The organization’s <a href="https://southernequality.org/resources/transinthesouth/#provider-map" target="_blank">directory</a> lists more than 500 trans-affirming health and legal service providers located across the South, about half of which see adolescents.</p>
<p>Pace also keeps a list of trans-affirming providers — from counselors to neurologists — available for people who call her clinic in Mississippi.</p>
<p>“These are people who deserve to have their basic health care needs met, just like anyone else,” Pace said.</p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services recently released </span><a href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/ViewNotice.cfm?GNid=2618" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">revised guidelines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for state Medicaid disability waiver programs which would allow certain family members who provide caregiving services for their child or spouse with disabilities to be paid directly by the state.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This option has been available in Virginia since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, but is set to end this fall because of DMAS’ concerns that it wouldn’t follow federal guidelines in a post-COVID world and fell short of oversight standards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State officials told the Virginia Mercury later in May that the department planned to study whether a Maryland program allowing this option could be adopted in the commonwealth in response.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rebecca Dooley, Senior Communications Officer with DMAS, said the new changes “address stakeholder concerns and are currently in a public comment period.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disability advocates and families say they agree with DMAS’ decision to allow family caregivers of minors and spouses the option to be paid directly by the state for their services – instead of exclusively through a private home care agency under the department’s current plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, concerns still remain that the new guidelines continue to place “unreasonable” restrictions on these individuals – like a reduction in the hours they can be paid for and the mandated use of electronic visit verification, among others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost all of the nearly </span><a href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/comments.cfm?GeneralNoticeid=2618" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">200 public comments submitted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so far on the proposal echo similar concerns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Tonya Milling, executive director of disability advocacy group The Arc of Virginia, agreed these new guidelines don’t address all of the concerns raised by families, she said certain restrictions have to be put in place to follow federal standards set by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We understand that because that’s required … as part of just fiduciary responsibility for public funds,” Milling said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not all flexibilities currently granted to family caregivers because of the COVID-19 pandemic will remain for those who opt for direct state pay – also known as the “consumer direct” option.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;‘Godsend’ caregiver program for Virginians with disabilities set to end this fall&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/05/08/godsend-caregiver-program-for-virginians-with-disabilities-set-to-end-this-fall/embed/#?secret=vEhWFHrtka#?secret=ASC21MDb5G" data-secret="ASC21MDb5G" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Family caregivers choosing to be directly paid by Virginia to care for their minor child or spouse with disabilities will have to comply with new restrictions starting Nov. 12 – such as their pay being capped at 40 hours a week, mandated use of electronic visit verification and limitations on who their employer of record can be. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teri Morgan, executive director for the Virginia Board for People with Disabilities, said the restrictions stem from federal guidelines in place to cut down on fraud. This also includes establishing whether parents and spouses are providing “extraordinary care” for their minor children and spouses with disabilities that should be paid, rather than care that is legally mandated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Supports that are typical for [a]15-year-old like cooking and cleaning aren’t considered” extraordinary, Morgan said. “Those are considered natural supports that any parent would give any child. So how do you come up with the limitation? Our recommendation to DMAS was to go to 56 [hours] but they selected the 40 hours.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kelly Kiser, who identified herself as the paid caregiver for her daughter who has disabilities, expressed concerns on the proposal’s public comment forum about the limitation, as her daughter is currently approved for 50 hours of caregiver services a week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is no one I can hire to meet her needs and no family members willing to care for her while I work because of these needs, Kiser said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By limiting the hours below what has been determined that she currently needs would place a hardship on us,” Kiser said. “Leaving my employment to care for her was an extreme hardship. I went through our entire savings, and was using credit to pay for day to day needs until we were approved for the waiver.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morgan believed this is also why the state is now mandating spouses and parents clock in and out through electronic visit verification systems usually done through an app. This is one of the Board’s biggest concerns, Morgan said, because it’s “unrealistic and not all states require it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Cooking meals is natural support and not reimbursable but feeding is, so I have to log in for this half hour and then log back out and then log back in when I’m assisting you in your bath,” Morgan said.“You don’t need to have parents stopping and starting throughout the day to log in and log out when they’re caring for their child.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another concern Morgan raised is the limitations on who can be a family caregivers’ “employer of record” if they are being paid directly by the state. The state defines an employer of record as a person responsible for monitoring the caregivers’ work, verifying the hours worked and handling any disciplinary actions that need to be taken, among other duties. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, a parent could be the paid caregiver for their child with disabilities and the other parent their employer of record. The new guidelines prohibit any family member that is legally responsible for the spouse or minor receiving disability caregiving services from being the employer of record, as well as anyone who lives more than 50 miles away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morgan said this can be especially troublesome for military families who move and may not know anyone in their area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The employer of record is a non-paid position,” Morgan said. “So it’s difficult to get somebody to do that and then they are concerned about releasing private information – health information, social security number, that kind of information – to somebody who may just be a neighbor or may just be another military family they don’t know that well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the initial proposal submitted by DMAS earlier this year was a more robust update to the entire Family and Individual Supports (FIS) and Building Independence (BI) disability waivers, the new guidelines amend the section in the waivers specifically pertaining to certain family caregivers who opt for direct state pay and would also apply to Community Living (CL) and Commonwealth Coordinated Care Plus (CCC+) waivers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Milling emphasized The Arc of Virginia is “very pleased with the change, but we will want to continue [to be] that watchful eye for parents to make sure that they’re still able to access services and have their needs taken care of for their family.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DMAS declined to answer follow-up questions and multiple interview requests, but provided the Mercury with this statement:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The original waiver amendments were submitted to address a General Assembly mandate to continue to allow legally responsible individuals to provide care to individuals under the waiver after the Appendix K expires. Those amendments only included an agency directed option which were approved by CMS. DMAS has since developed guidance that would allow for members to use the consumer directed option as well as the agency directed option. Subsequent waiver amendments that are consistent with this new guidance and address stakeholder concerns and are currently in a public comment period.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The public comment period will remain open until 5:00 p.m. on July 27.</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Supreme Court of the United States last month </span><a href="https://alaskabeacon.com/2023/06/15/u-s-supreme-court-upholds-indian-child-welfare-act-in-7-2-decision/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">upheld the Indian Child Welfare Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (ICWA), a federal law designed to protect Native American children and keep them connected to their heritage. Four Virginia Indian tribes that signed on to a brief supporting the ICWA in the face of a challenge to its constitutionality say it is still a vital tool for the preservation of their communities and culture and is a cornerstone of tribal sovereignty in the state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four of Virginia&#8217;s </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/trump-signs-bill-recognizing-virginia-indian-tribes/2018/01/30/8a46b038-05d4-11e8-94e8-e8b8600ade23_story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seven federally recognized</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Indian tribes — the Monacan Indian Nation, the Pamunkey Indian Tribe, the Rappahannock Tribe and the Upper Mattaponi Indian Tribe — signed the amicus brief supporting the ICWA in the 2022 Haaland v. Brackeen lawsuit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The case emanated from a white couple in Texas who argued that the law — which says that if Native American children need to be adopted or placed in foster care, every effort must be made for them to remain in the care of their extended family or tribal community — was racially discriminatory and overrode state laws governing child welfare. On June 15, 2023, in a 7-2 decision, </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-376_7l48.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the justices overturned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a Texas federal court&#8217;s decision that the ICWA was unconstitutional and cemented the law as a bedrock protection for some of the nation&#8217;s most vulnerable children. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ruling was a critical recognition of the tribes&#8217; right to decide what is in the best interest of their children, said Chief Robert Gray of the Pamunkey Tribe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We signed onto the brief because we believe the issue is important to tribal identity and respect for our culture and our sovereignty,” said Gray. The Supreme Court&#8217;s decision “affirmed our belief. We would say we see our sovereignty and tribal status as the chief issue. It&#8217;s not a racial issue, it&#8217;s a tribal issue.&#8221;</span></p>

(The Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Pamunkey was the first of Virginia&#8217;s Indian tribes to gain federal recognition, in 2015. This status grants tribes full control over legal affairs and governance within their communities and mandates that federal agencies consult them about regulatory policies that might impact them. But while that consultation is mandatory at the federal level, Virginia has lagged in granting Native Americans full sovereignty: Current state law </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/03/07/house-republicans-torpedo-bills-giving-virginia-tribes-state-consultation-rights/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">does not require</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Virginia agencies to consult with any of the tribes on projects and development plans that might affect them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislation to institute that consultation right has been introduced twice, in 2022 and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB2004" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2023</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But it has died both times in the House of Delegates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It takes an unimaginable amount of gall to invade people&#8217;s homeland, take control and nearly eradicate them in body and spirit and then, several centuries later, say — as Del. Lee Ware, R- Powhatan, did during the 2022 session — you&#8217;re not </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/03/07/house-republicans-torpedo-bills-giving-virginia-tribes-state-consultation-rights/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;comfortable yet&#8221;</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with passing laws to give them a say in protecting what few lands and rights they have managed to claw back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tenuous nature of Virginia Indians&#8217; tribal sovereignty is part of what makes the ICWA&#8217;s protections for Indian children so consequential, said Gray.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;These children are citizens of the tribe; it&#8217;s a sovereignty issue,” he said. “I would liken it to, if there&#8217;s a French citizen in the U.S. that was being put up for adoption, the country of France would have a say in that adoption. You can kind of see how it works with adoptions from Russia, Romania and other countries; those governments have a say in those adoptions. Indian nations are looking for that same respect.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Pamunkey, Virginia tribes and other Indian nations have earned that respect a thousand times over. It takes just a quick survey of Virginia&#8217;s and America&#8217;s early history to see why the ICWA was desperately needed and remains important. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The European settlers who came to Virginia&#8217;s shores often </span><a href="https://www.dhr.virginia.gov/blog-posts/indians-a-d-1600-1800/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">harmed the health and culture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the Indian communities they encountered, bringing disease and dis-ease wherever they ventured. Colonists reneged on treaties with the tribes, leading to the loss of most of their ancestral homelands and even their languages and instigating centuries of bitter, violent relations in the fledgling state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then came other government-born horrors far and near: Thousands of tribal members were  forcibly relocated west through the Trail of Tears. Educational institutions designed programs to strip Native American children of their heritage and assimilate them into Western society and ideologies; they include one founded in </span><a href="https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=73794" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1878 at Hampton University</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to “christianize and civilize” </span><a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/mnhs-org-support/mn_history_articles/51/v51i03p082-098.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Indians</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is particularly disappointing coming from a college created by and for marginalized Black Americans. Eugenicist Walter Plecker, as head of Virginia’s Bureau of Vital Statistics, physically erased the heritage of countless tribal members on official birth and death certificates, which made it difficult for tribes in the commonwealth to prove their identities and gain federal recognition. Our vital records office is </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/14/in-righting-wrongs-former-state-registrar-helped-create-a-more-equitable-inclusive-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">still untangling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> some of the mess Plecker made of Virginia Indians&#8217; ethnic and cultural heritage. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Social Services is responsible for making sure the Indian Child Welfare Act is enforced in the state. The agency performs a bimonthly search of its child welfare information system, known as OASIS, for children identified as American Indian and/or Alaskan Native. If any children are identified, the agency works with the local social services department where the child lives to find nearby federally recognized Indian tribes and ensures they are aware of the child&#8217;s foster or adoption needs and can give input and guidance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;VDSS also serves as liaison for Virginia’s seven federally recognized tribes for any issues or concerns regarding a child welfare case involving their tribal citizens,&#8221; agency spokesman Will Hockaday said via email. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It appears that the ICWA is functioning as intended in Virginia, thankfully. Just one Native American child was placed for adoption or foster care outside their tribal community in 2022, according to Hockaday, and the process was approved by a tribe in the area. Gray also says the Pamunkey have only been involved with one ICWA case recently, and it was resolved satisfactorily. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The larger struggle for the full benefits of tribal sovereignty, however, continues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re constantly under attack; there are constant little things that are always threatening bits and pieces of our sovereignty,&#8221; said Gray. &#8220;We are always on the lookout, and we will always remain vigilant.&#8221; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts with the General Assembly’s Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission told lawmakers the 18-month review showed the state allocates “far less than needed to sufficiently fund Virginia’s school system.” The formula that determines how much money each local school division gets from the state, officials found, “needs to be significantly improved and modernized.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In brief, we found that Virginia school divisions receive less funding per student than divisions in other states,” JLARC Chief Legislative Analyst Mark Gribbin said as he presented the results of a lengthy study the General Assembly requested in 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s school divisions receive 14% less funding from the state than the 50-state average, JLARC found, equal to about $1,900 less per student. It also spends 4% less than the more localized average for the South Atlantic region as defined by the U.S. Census. The review concluded Virginia spends comparatively more on K-12 schools than neighboring North Carolina and Tennessee, but less than Kentucky, Maryland and West Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of Virginia’s lagging status can be attributed to the state’s complicated Standards of Quality funding formula, which JLARC found routinely underestimates how much funding schools actually need to fulfill the government’s responsibility to provide every Virginia child with a quality education. In fiscal year 2021, for example, the SOQ formula indicated Virginia schools needed $10.7 billion in state and local funds. To fund their operations that year, schools actually spent $17.3 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Janet Howell, D-Fairfax, who chairs JLARC, called the 163-page school spending report a “very important study,” going on to reference an election season in which Republicans are pushing for tax cuts and Democrats are calling for bigger increases in school funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would advise all candidates, not just for the General Assembly but also for school boards and county boards, to read this study and be informed about it and grapple with the implications,” Howell said at Monday’s meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Jeremy McPike, D-Prince William, said the problem has been “pretty apparent” for anyone who has sent their children into classrooms that might have 30 students for each teacher.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This report is not surprising to this parent,” McPike said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SOQ formula estimated school divisions needed 113,500 full-time instructional, support and administrative staffers in fiscal year 2021, according to the report. In reality, divisions employed 171,400 people to perform those duties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If we just funded at SOQ level, it would be a catastrophe,” an unnamed school administrator told JLARC.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commission staff made several recommendations for how Virginia could overhaul its school funding benchmarks to be more in line with national averages. Though analysts stressed they were not suggesting all the changes could be made at once, the proposals collectively add up to about $3.5 billion in new spending.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Appropriations Chairman Barry Knight, R-Virginia Beach, who serves on JLARC and is currently trying to negotiate a budget bill with Howell, said the new report doesn’t appear to take into account roughly $3.2 billion in new funding allocations to Virginia schools “over the last couple of years.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re both in concurrence that we want to put hundreds of millions of more dollars in there that may get us a whole lot closer to getting whole,” Knight said of Howell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But he cautioned that money isn’t the only driver of educational success. The city of Richmond, he noted, spends significantly more per pupil than neighboring Henrico County, which generally has higher-rated schools than Richmond but less entrenched poverty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sometimes throwing money doesn&#8217;t always solve the problem,” Knight said, adding that Virginia school divisions still have about $1.5 billion in federal pandemic aid that they need to spend before September of 2024.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration struck a similar tone in an official response attached to the JLARC report.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secretary of Education Aimee Rogstad Guidera and Superintendent of Public Instruction Lisa Coons wrote that the report shows the complexity of an “indecipherable state funding formula” that should be “more student focused and outcome driven.” The new report, Youngkin’s education team continued, does little to connect spending to “the educational needs of students” and fails to account for recent spending increases that produced “the largest education budget” in Virginia’s history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nevertheless, the report makes it clear that without reforms, increased investments in K-12 spending likely will not translate to improved student outcomes,” the Youngkin administration wrote, referring back to its proposals to change the state’s school accreditation system, boost expectations for standardized tests, improve math and reading performance and provide more career and technical education opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specific flaws in the funding formula identified by JLARC include underestimating salary costs by underweighting salaries in the largest school divisions (many of which are located in high-cost Northern Virginia); not effectively taking into account how many higher-needs students a school division has due to poverty, special education needs and immigrant students learning English; failing to account for steep labor cost differences in different parts of the state; and overlooking the difficulties faced by very small, mostly rural school divisions that can’t achieve the same “economies of scale” as their larger counterparts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report found the local composite index portion of the formula, which measures a city or county’s ability to pay for its own schools by assessing the local tax base, is a “reasonable measure” but prone to dramatic swings based on local trends. For example, Richmond recently saw a $5 million drop in its state school funding due to big increases in local property tax assessments. Analysts recommended changing the LCI to look at a three-year average, which would smooth out year-to-year fluctuations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the near term, JLARC recommended that the state make about $1 billion in changes to boost funding for schools. The biggest near-term changes include better tracking students living in poverty and funding schools accordingly ($250 million), ending cost-saving measures instituted during the Great Recession such as capping support positions ($515 million), and changing how the state calculates salaries by using division averages instead of a formula that underweights higher salaries at the biggest school divisions ($190 million).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another $2.5 billion in long-term recommendations include changing the formula to reflect actual staffing levels ($1.86 billion), better aligning the funding formula with local labor costs ($595 million) and providing extra funding to small school divisions with fewer than 2,000 students ($80 million).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the roughly $20.1 billion that currently funds Virginia’s K-12 public schools, approximately 39% comes from the state, 52% comes from localities and 9% comes from the federal government, according to JLARC’s presentation. Commission staffers repeatedly noted that regional differences can skew the statewide numbers, emphasizing that Fairfax County alone accounts for $2.5 billion of the local funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia could simplify its school funding system, the report found, by switching to a student-based formula like the ones most other states use instead of a staffing-based formula.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A well-designed student-based funding model would be more accurate, more transparent and easier to maintain over time than Virginia’s current staffing-based formula,” the report said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Minority Leader Tommy Norment, R-James City, asked what would happen if Virginia made major new investments in schools only to see those schools have fewer and fewer children to educate due to declining birth rates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is no way, no way that divisions are going to cut back substantially once those numbers of declining students appear,” Norment said. “What do we do about that from a formula basis?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gribbin, the JLARC analyst, said every funding formula takes into account how many students a particular division serves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That would theoretically track up or down depending on what happens to the number of students,” he said.</span></p>
<p>Even as legislators signaled agreement the state could allocate significantly more money to public schools, both parties siezed on the report to fire partisan shots.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is our children who are suffering because extremists in the Virginia GOP would rather fund corporate giveaways than their education,&#8221; said House Minority Leader Don Scott, D-Portsmouth. &#8220;It is well past time the Republicans got serious about protecting and supporting our children and worked with us to make sure that our students have access to the best teachers, the best resources, and the best education possible.”</p>
<p>In a statement, Youngkin said his proposed budget included about $427 million in new funding for schools and called the report &#8220;a wake-up call&#8221; for &#8220;those who haven&#8217;t been listening to parents.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Today&#8217;s JLARC report lays plain that the previous two administrations failed to provide adequate funding in K-12 education and more importantly, never sought to reform the system to ensure that funding supports students and teachers in the classroom,&#8221; Youngkin said.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1515" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requires pornography websites to use age verification technology to more stringently determine whether a person is 18 or older to gain access to the site. The legislation passed the General Assembly on a nearly unanimous vote this March. Sen. Bill Stanley, R-Franklin, the patron of the bill, </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/03/09/bill-to-require-additional-proof-of-age-for-porn-sites-in-virginia-heads-to-youngkins-desk/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told the Mercury this March</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> his legislation aims to address the “epidemic” of childhood exposure to pornography.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the law, websites must verify users’ age and identity but can select the specific method of verification, such as uploading copies of government-issued identification or other unspecified commercial technology. </span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="simLf5frZH"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/03/09/bill-to-require-additional-proof-of-age-for-porn-sites-in-virginia-heads-to-youngkins-desk/">Bill to require additional proof of age for porn sites in Virginia heads to Youngkin’s desk</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Pornhub, in a message posted to its site Thursday, is arguing the law is not the most effective solution for protecting people visiting its site, and puts children and user privacy at risk. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Until a real solution is offered, we have made the difficult decision to completely disable access to our website in Virginia,” wrote Pornhub. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia now joins Utah, which has a similar age verification law, as states where Pornhub has </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/05/07/1174631536/a-new-utah-law-led-pornhub-to-ban-access-to-its-site-for-everyone-in-the-state" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blocked residents’ access</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to content due to legislation.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, the law applies to any website where 33.3% or more of the content is “material harmful to minors,” such as websites exclusively containing pornography. Social media sites like Twitter and Reddit, which allow adult content on their platforms but are not predominantly made up of adult content, would not be subject to the law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, the law will allow people to sue pornographic websites that don’t use proper age and identity verification methods “for damages resulting from a minor’s access to such material.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Beth Waller, attorney and chair of the cybersecurity and data privacy practice at Woods Rogers Vandeventer Black law firm, said technology limitations could make it difficult for pornography websites to follow the requirements. She also questioned Virginia’s ability to enforce the law in the first place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waller said Louisiana, which has a similar law, allows adult content websites to access the state’s central driver’s license online database to verify age and identity. Virginia, she said, doesn’t have a similar system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That means websites will have to use third-party verification methods from other companies that don’t have access to a central state database, she said, raising questions about how identification will be processed and verified.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s not like walking into a bar where somebody can take the ID and use an ID reader to see if it’s valid,” Waller said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares’ office did not respond to multiple requests from the Mercury for information about how officials plan to enforce the new law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Free Speech Coalition Executive Director Alison Boden said the laws in Louisiana and Utah haven’t been enforced despite going into effect months ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Because the laws are so poorly written, it&#8217;s impossible to know whether a site could be held liable for violating the law even when it’s made a good-faith effort to comply,” she said. “Website owners certainly worry that even though they&#8217;re following the law as they understand it, they could still end up being sued because young people understand technology like VPNs much better than politicians do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VPNs, or virtual private networks, are encryption methods that allow easy access to websites regardless of what state they live in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uploading personal information through non-state verification methods also runs the risk of the information being exposed in a cybersecurity data breach, said Waller. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The intention behind the law is good,” Waller said. However, she added, “I do think that anyone who wants to bypass a law like that, they are properly motivated and tech savvy and will find a way to do so.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The message shown on Pornhub.com as of June 29:</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Dear user,</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you may know, your elected officials in Virginia are requiring us to verify your age before allowing you access to our website. While safety and compliance are at the forefront of our mission, giving your ID card every time you want to visit an adult platform is not the most effective solution for protecting our users, and in fact, will put children and your privacy at risk.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, mandating age verification without proper enforcement gives platforms the opportunity to choose whether or not to comply. As we’ve seen in other states, this just drives traffic to sites with far fewer safety measures in place. Very few sites are able to compare to the robust Trust and Safety measures we currently have in place. To protect children and user privacy, any legislation must be enforced against all platforms offering adult content.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The safety of our users is one of our biggest concerns. We believe that the best and most effective solution for protecting children and adults alike is to identify users by their device and allow access to age-restricted materials and websites based on that identification. Until a real solution is offered, we have made the difficult decision to completely disable access to our website in Virginia.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please contact your representatives before it is too late and demand device-based verification solutions that make the internet safer while also respecting your privacy.”</span></i></p>

(AP Photo/Marta Lavandier)</p><p>The median age rose in almost every state last year, census estimates show, continuing a long-term trend that is pushing states to prepare for aging populations.</p>
<p>Seventeen states had median ages over 40 in 2022, according to new U.S. Census Bureau estimates of the age at which half of residents are older and half are younger. That’s up from 12 states in 2020 and just seven in 2010.</p>
<p>Nationwide, the median age <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/241494/median-age-of-the-us-population/" target="_blank">was below 30 until 1980</a>, but it rose to 38.9 as of 2022, according to the bureau estimates.</p>
<p>That leaves more states planning for future health and housing challenges for older residents. Some states have issued or are considering executive orders, agency plans and legislation to assist state residents who need more help with health crises, housing and long-term care as they live longer.</p>
<p>Millennials started turning 40 last year, and the youngest baby boomers are quickly approaching 60.</p>
<p>“As the nation’s median age creeps closer to 40, you can really see how the aging of baby boomers, and now their children — sometimes called echo boomers — is impacting the median age,” said Kristie Wilder, a Census Bureau demographer, in a statement.</p>
<p><a href="https://stateline.org/2023/05/11/low-fertility-rates-high-housing-prices-mean-fewer-children-in-most-states/" target="_blank">Lower birth rates also play a role</a> and will likely continue to drive median age slowly but steadily higher, Wilder added. Some states have passed legislation requiring that health insurers cover fertility treatments in response to lower fertility rates, according to a University of California, Irvine study <a href="https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(22)01752-6/fulltext" target="_blank">published last year</a>. New York state’s <a href="https://www.dfs.ny.gov/apps_and_licensing/health_insurers/ivf_fertility_preservation_law_qa_guidance" target="_blank">2020 law</a>, for example, requires coverage of in vitro fertilization in some cases.</p>
<p><iframe id="datawrapper-chart-Q4WFM" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" title="Median age by state in 2022" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Q4WFM/13/" height="547" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" aria-label="Map" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script></p>
<p>No states saw a drop from 2021 to 2022, and states with unchanged medians were Alabama, Maine, Tennessee and West Virginia, along with the District of Columbia. The largest increase in median age in recent years was in Delaware, where it rose three years since 2010 to age 41.8.</p>
<p>The portion of Delaware residents over 60 will jump from a quarter to more than a third of the state population by 2040, according to a 2020 state report, creating new challenges for state services. A <em>Delaware Journal of Public Health</em> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8482973/" target="_blank">report</a> published in 2021 said a growing number of Delaware’s older residents suffer from dementia, requiring more expensive help from the state and family caregivers.</p>
<p><a href="https://dail.vermont.gov/sites/dail/files/documents/FY24%20Budget%20Presentation~2-8-2023.pdf" target="_blank">Vermont held six public listening sessions</a> around the state last year to help prepare recommendations this year for <a href="https://www.healthvermont.gov/wellness/brain-health-dementia/age-strong-vermont-our-roadmap-age-friendly-state" target="_blank">Age Strong Vermont</a>, its road map for an “age-friendly state.”</p>
<p>“Vermont had this older demographic for a long time but it’s taken a while for the state broadly to really reckon with that,” said Angela Smith-Dieng, Vermont’s Adult Services Division director. Part of the challenge is that older Vermont residents tend to live in big rural houses and need help with in-home health care, renovations for mobility and transportation on demand, she said.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/executive-order/no-23-establishing-new-york-state-master-plan-aging" target="_blank">New York executive order</a> in November also calls for a statewide plan on aging.</p>

<p>Vermont and New York joined other states already planning comprehensive strategies for aging populations: California, Colorado, Massachusetts and Texas, according to a <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/state-legislatures-news/details/supporting-older-adults-with-approaches-spanning-multiple-policy-areas" target="_blank">January report </a>by the National Conference of State Legislatures.</p>
<p>California’s <a href="https://mpa.aging.ca.gov/" target="_blank">Master Plan for Aging</a>, released in 2021, aims to create an “age-friendly California” by 2030, including housing and health care strategies. A <a href="https://openstates.org/ca/bills/20232024/AB1006/" target="_blank">bill currently progressing</a> in the state legislature would create a statewide system of respite providers by 2025 to help give primary caregivers of older adults enrolled in Medi-Cal, the state's Medicaid program for low-income residents, a break.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, an Oregon <a href="https://openstates.org/or/bills/2023R1/SB99/" target="_blank">bill</a> to study long-term care needs for older residents has passed both chambers of the legislature.</p>
<p>Only North Dakota is younger now than it was in 2010, down 1.2 years from age 37 to 35.8. The state’s burgeoning oil industry has drawn younger workers to jobs that pay well and don’t require four-year college degrees.</p>
<p>Energy counties in other states have seen similar influxes of young people. Loving County, Texas, for example, saw its median age decrease from 52.7 in 2010 to 35.3 in 2022, a difference of more than 17 years.</p>
<p>Skeet Lee Jones, county judge there, said the tiny county has work camps for more than 1,000 oil workers and hundreds more young workers living in recreational vehicle camps, with good-paying jobs that create their own challenges for county government.</p>
<p>“We’ve had to start paying our own county workers what we call ‘oil-field wages’ just to get things done, about four or five times minimum wage,” Jones said.</p>
<p>The oldest state in the country remains Maine at 44.8. It also was the oldest in 2010, at 42.7.</p>
<p>Other states with median ages at 40 or above in 2022: New Hampshire (43.3), Vermont (43.2), West Virginia (42.8), Florida (42.7), Delaware (41.8), Pennsylvania and Connecticut (40.9), Hawaii (40.7), Rhode Island (40.6), Wisconsin (40.4), New Jersey, Oregon and South Carolina (all 40.3), Montana and Michigan (40.2), and Massachusetts (40.1).</p>
<p>The youngest states and the only ones with median ages below 37 were Utah (31.9), the District of Columbia (34.8), Texas (35.5), and Alaska and North Dakota (35.8).</p>
<p>On the county level, the median age in 2022 was as low as 20.9 in Madison County, Idaho, home of Brigham Young University-Idaho, where <a href="https://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/economy/2014-06-26/how-madison-county-idaho-became-the-youngest-place-in-america" target="_blank">many young students are also starting families</a>.</p>
<p>The median age was as high as 68.1 in Sumter County, Florida, part of the sprawling The Villages retirement community. In 2010 Sumter County’s median age was 62.7, the only county with a median age of 60 or higher in the nation at the time.</p>
<p>In 2022 there were six others: Catron County, New Mexico (62.1); Jeff Davis County, Texas (61.7); Harding County, New Mexico (60.5); Jefferson County, Washington (60.4); Charlotte County, Florida (60.2); and Highland County, Virginia (60.0).</p>

Robert Bolling</em></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not again. We’ve witnessed another senseless death of a child as a result of violence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent events at the Huguenot High School graduation ceremony were devastating — seven gunshot victims, two of whom passed away and several with life-altering injuries. Shawn Jackson, 18, had just graduated. He was with his stepfather, Lorenzo Smith who also died as a result of the shooting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Huguenot High School is one of the sites for ChildSavers school-based services. It is the location where we see the largest number of clients. Our collective heart aches for the families who lost loved ones, and for the children, families and staff of Richmond Public Schools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, and for the near future, our on-site therapists are reaching out to existing Huguenot clients and their families for safety checks as our Immediate Response therapists are on-call through our </span><a href="https://www.childsavers.org/immediate-response/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">24/7 hotline</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, providing a supportive response to those who were affected. We have already seen a significant increase in calls to our hotline. We are working closely with our partner, Richmond Public Schools, to engage with their </span><a href="https://www.rvaschools.net/engagement/family-community-engagement/family-resources" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Family Support Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and provide additional resources as necessary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This nightmare of violence and death is leaving a legacy of trauma, grief, and gut-wrenching pain for too many families. One child dead from gun violence is far too many. We must act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can no longer close our eyes or turn our backs. Richmond Public Schools Superintendent Jason Kamras’ words at an initial press conference were poignant, “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This just needs to stop.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This type of tragedy cannot define normal for greater Richmond. Imagine if this was your child shot dead on their graduation day. What would you do? What would you want to happen so no one else ever has to feel the pain of that loss? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We owe it to each of the families who experienced this type of loss to change the path of escalating violence and death into one where every person can live and thrive. Our prayers, well-wishes and support gathering for those impacted by this needless trauma are appropriate and provide a level of support. Yet they are woefully insufficient to stop the death.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is our moment to turn the tide. But we must attempt to understand the root of the problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The causes of gun violence are complex. These root issues did not start overnight, and they will not be solved overnight, but we must acknowledge the factors contributing to this escalating violence among our youth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of our communities in Richmond have experienced decades-long cycles of </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-03-28/richmond-city-poverty-demographic-changes-ocwb" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">poverty</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, criminalization, and disinvestment. Our children have witnessed and experienced trauma from a young age. They live in low-opportunity areas, ones where access to education, healthcare, and jobs are limited. They go to under-resourced schools, and their parents and guardians confront the same </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9407706/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">structural and socioeconomic barriers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to prosperity. The </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9407706/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">social media age</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is impacting our children’s </span><a href="https://childmind.org/awareness-campaigns/childrens-mental-health-report/2017-childrens-mental-health-report/smartphones-social-media/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mental health</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in ways researchers do not yet fully grasp, but that is causing increased rates of anxiety, depression, and suicidality among youth. Combine those factors with the ready availability and access of firearms in our community, and it becomes a pressure cooker for violence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can lower the pressure and correct the course for our community’s children by focusing on three areas. Each can be divisive points for many of us and often raise the ire so that we are unable to reason, or even hear the voice on the other side of the debate. Still, we must do this:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create economic opportunity and prosperity for all our communities, and particularly Black and Latino communities with histories of disinvestment.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strengthen our community-based mental health support and care.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Address the ready availability of guns in our community.</span></li>
</ul>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Economic prosperity</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond is a growing region that is attracting new arrivals to complement those of us whose families have lived here for generations. This new energy combined with the strength of “from here” citizens brings innovations in business and new amenities for personal and family enjoyment. It also exacerbates existing challenges for our community, like affordable housing and disparity in economic prosperity. The Richmond region’s history of racial residential segregation still leaves a </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/11/19/911909187/in-u-s-cities-the-health-effects-of-past-housing-discrimination-are-plain-to-see#:~:text=hence%2C%20%22redlining.%22&amp;text=Digital%20Scholarship%20Lab-,A%20federal%20government%20map%20of%20Richmond%20in%20the%201930%27s%20outlined,lenders%20to%20offer%20loans%20to.&amp;text=Posner%20for%20NPR-,Redlining%20made%20it%20difficult%2C%20if%20not%20impossible%2C%20for%20communities%20of,meant%20houses%20fell%20into%20disrepair." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">visible imprint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the demographics of our neighborhoods and access to socioeconomic opportunity. We must envision a Richmond region that works for everyone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating new opportunities means we must think differently about how and where we incentivize economic development. On a recent InterCity visit to Kansas City with ChamberRVA, we learned that the build out of the $1.5 billion new airport included intentional involvement of vendors of color. During one panel discussion, the general contractor and a Black subcontractor advanced tools like improved terms to pay sooner and better interest rates on loans for capital to make it possible for the subcontractor to participate in the project. This not only helped the subcontractor with the airport project but established a foundation of quality work that could be used to go after the next project.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s a great idea that could be applied to Richmond and expanded upon. We could be a leader in this area and build investment in education into big and small economic development packages. That might look like this: Developers get tax breaks, and as part of the project build a replacement school for the locality, or fund teacher’s salaries for a couple of years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These economic development opportunities must be done in collaboration with and in the service of our most disinvested communities, like the ones that send students to Huguenot, Wythe and Armstrong High Schools. As the saying goes, a chain is no stronger than its weakest link. We build a more prosperous Richmond region by ensuring opportunity for all.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Community mental health support</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s public policy recognizes mental well-being as a critical health care issue in the country. We have seen in children </span><a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/headed-back-to-school-a-look-at-the-ongoing-effects-of-covid-19-on-childrens-health-and-well-being/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an increase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in anxiety, depression, isolation, and harm to self and others. </span><a href="https://mhanational.org/issues/2023/mental-health-america-youth-data" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mental Health America ranks Virginia 48</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the nation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the rate of youth mental health challenges and access to care. Our kids are not okay. They are hurting.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/12/14/youngkin-proposes-230-million-behavioral-health-overhaul/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent efforts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have focused on expanding adult inpatient care, particularly hospital-based beds, improving access to help during </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/09/in-virginia-people-suffering-mental-health-crises-too-often-become-felons-when-police-intervene/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mental health crises</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and growing the behavioral health workforce. These efforts are to be applauded but more is necessary to achieve a system of care that supports all of us, especially children.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the case of child mental health, and particularly outpatient services and crisis care during times like a shooting, it is the community-based providers that are delivering much of the care without adequate funding or payment for services. Providers like ChildSavers are invested in communities and schools where children live and are educated as they experience toxic trauma and face a lack of resources. Let’s prioritize and invest deeply in these places and those providers.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Access to guns</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This issue causes us to attack and hurl insults at one another as we argue the right to own firearms for collection, sport and protection versus the use of weapons with the intent to commit crime and cause harm. Yet, the simple fact that guns exist and are available to the general public makes death by firearm possible. </span><a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/2/16399418/america-mass-shooting-gun-violence-statistics-charts" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statistically speaking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the more firearms that exist in a society, the more gun deaths there are.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">It is inevitable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will never eliminate firearms in America. There are just too many, especially when the number of guns outnumber the population of our country. Yet, we must stem the tide of firearms flowing into our country and into our hands, and our children’s.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I ask that we reframe the issue: How do we stop the unlawful access to and possession of firearms? How do we stop them from getting into the hands of our community’s children? Some of the answers exist today in current gun laws. Store unloaded guns and ammunition separately in locked cases. Limit access to guns by those experiencing mental health issues. Require training and registration before the completion of the gun purchase. Require registration for firearm purchases. These are easy and effective methods to reduce violence. I realize that some may consider these examples unrelated to or too simplistic for a complex issue. But every action to limit unlawful firearm possession saves lives. Our children depend on it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The harder actions, like banning weapons, cause us to retreat to our embedded views. No one has come up with a solution to stop the flow of illegal guns that usually end up maiming or killing someone. We have to find answers by believing and acting to rid our community of these guns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We must do this for the benefit of our children and the entire community. We may not all agree on what needs to be done, but we all know that something must be done.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are truly difficult and unbearable times that will no doubt leave a legacy of pain for families directly impacted, and for children and adults across our community. Let’s begin now to change this trajectory.</span></p>
<p><br style="font-weight: 400;" /><em>L. Robert Bolling is the Chief Executive Officer at ChildSavers, a 99-year-old nonprofit agency that provides child mental health and child development services.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, the conversation surrounding the acknowledgment and celebration of <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/juneteenth" target="_blank">Juneteenth</a> has gained traction across the nation. But while we are honoring the end of chattel slavery in America, another conversation has been simultaneously picking up steam in the background: burdensome fines and fees facing young people in the juvenile and criminal justice systems. The Commonwealth Institute and RISE for Youth are working with our partners on uplifting this conversation and raising awareness around the impact fines and fees have on our youth and families, especially on Black and Latino youth. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://debtorsprison.jlc.org/documents/JLC-Debtors-Prison.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the youth faced with these costs come from low-income families</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and with </span><a href="https://thecommonwealthinstitute.org/the-half-sheet/the-60-year-shadow-of-court-fines-fees/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s 30- and 60-year statutes of limitations on court debt</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, our youth can be stuck with these costs for a lifetime. This creates long-standing harm for children who enter the system and their families, with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black teenagers most often being </span><a href="http://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt558-1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">swept into the youth criminal legal system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and therefore facing the greatest financial and family harms.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cjcj.org/history-education/juvenile-justice-history" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout U.S. history</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, juvenile justice policies have repeatedly failed to adequately consider the culpability differences between kids and adults, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">thus leading to practices and policies that didn’t </span><a href="https://law.asu.edu/sites/default/files/pdf/academy_for_justice/14_Reforming-Criminal-Justice_Vol_1_Juvenile-Justice.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">appropriately treat kids as kids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With youth crime rates declining since the &#8217;90s, juvenile justice reformers are seeking to evolve from the </span><a href="https://www.cjcj.org/history-education/juvenile-justice-history" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">punitive beginnings of juvenile justice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fines are intended to function as </span><a href="https://www.vera.org/downloads/publications/the-high-price-of-using-justice-fines-and-fees-virginia.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">punishment for the underlying offense</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, most court assessments charged to young people in Virginia are not fines meant to discourage or “punish” harmful behavior, but instead </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ETdKyg58sjohxAD2t_bazCfv1ukDXWlS/edit#gid=153189838" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">court fees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> meant to cover costs for operating Virginia’s court system</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So if the state isn’t assessing fines for punishment, why are kids paying in the first place? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analyses of these fines and fees’ economic and social impacts on Black and Latino teenagers highlight the pressing challenges these children and their families can face. In Virginia, </span><a href="https://thecommonwealthinstitute.org/research/set-up-to-fail-how-court-fines-fees-punish-poverty-and-harm-black-communities-in-virginia-2/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fines and fees are assessed at the highest rates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the courts serving localities with the highest share of Black residents and residents with incomes below the poverty line. While detailed Virginia data on the impact of juvenile court fines and fees by race is not available, there is evidence from other states that Black youth pay the highest amount in fines as a result of courts sentencing Black youth to </span><a href="http://64.166.146.245/docs/2016/BOS/20161025_813/27510_PAC%20High%20Pain%2C%20No%20Gain.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a greater frequency and duration of average probation conditions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than their white peers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The high cost of these </span><a href="https://debtorsprison.jlc.org/documents/JLC-Debtors-Prison-dane-county.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fines and fees can financially harm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a family and alter family dynamics. The financial burden forces families with low incomes to </span><a href="https://debtorsprison.jlc.org/documents/JLC-Debtors-Prison.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">choose between paying for necessities and paying fees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It can also heighten tensions within already strained familial relationships and fuel feelings of anger and resentment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the rising awareness of the harm that court-assessed fines and fees can have on kids and their families, organizations across the country are calling for the courts to end this harmful practice and instead step into </span><a href="https://www.arnoldventures.org/stories/a-nationwide-campaign-to-end-juvenile-fines-and-fees-is-making-progress" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a new era of true youth justice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Many localities and states are already taking steps toward a more</span><a href="https://www.arnoldventures.org/stories/a-nationwide-campaign-to-end-juvenile-fines-and-fees-is-making-progress" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> youth-centered juvenile justice system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Five states have completely abolished all fines and fees in the juvenile justice system, with an additional four eliminating juvenile court fees. This year the state legislature in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington considered a bill that would establish a <a href="https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2023/feb/13/washington-legislature-considers-bill-to-eliminate/" target="_blank">state-funded restitution program</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are great examples that Virginia can look to on its path to providing meaningful justice for young people and communities. Virginia legislators have an opportunity to make sure that the youth criminal legal system connects young people — no matter what they look like or how much money their family has — to the support and resources needed to reach their full potential, rather than placing additional barriers in their path.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we celebrate Juneteenth this year, let it also be a time to reflect on the harms that still disproportionately impact Black and Latino kids in Virginia. May the conversations about the harms of fines and fees on our youth become louder and louder. May we not forget our children who are bound to the court system through fines and fees. </span></p>

(JW Caterine for the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After months of delay, Virginia on Thursday released over $6 million in U.S. Department of Agriculture funds to procure food products from local farmers to distribute to food-insecure populations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The root cause of the slowdown in fund disbursement is unclear, as </span><a href="https://www.agweek.com/business/locally-produced-food-to-grace-the-shelves-of-the-great-plains-food-bank" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">other states began using grant funds as early as March</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but one contributing factor was language in the budget that prevented the governor from authorizing grant funds linked to American Rescue Plan Act dollars after the General Assembly session started. Because the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services made the request for appropriation authority in January, the funds had to be authorized as part of the budget amendment process, which still remains under negotiation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were staring down a scenario where basically the state has millions of dollars to buy food directly from small Virginian socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, [and] distribute to food insecure families,” said Tom McDougall, founder and CEO of 4P Foods, a company that distributes food from local and regional farmers and is one grant recipient. “And yet there’s this legislative accident preventing the money from flowing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022, the USDA through the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Program made available up to $900 million in federal funding to states, territories and federally recognized tribal governments for state purchases of local and regional foods with the goal of supporting socially disadvantaged farmers and food relief programs and organizations.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ams.usda.gov/press-release/usda-announces-its-local-food-purchase-assistance-cooperative-agreement-virginia" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">USDA announced its cooperative agreement with Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through the program in July 2022. At the time, VDACS estimated it would use the funding to buy food from 166 local farmers and distribute it to 164,000 individuals across the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VDACS did not respond to questions concerning the months-long gap between its agreement with the federal government and its request to begin spending the money but did provide a written statement following the release of the funds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are pleased to be able to extend the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement funding to Virginia Food banks and other organizations to improve food access in underserved communities. In addition, the funds help build and expand economic opportunities for Virginia producers,” the statement said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The delay caused alarm to both grant recipients that had already been placing orders with farmers and farmers who were making plans for the coming season. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We didn’t find out until late January that there was potentially a problem,” said McDougall. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislative approval also proved difficult because of the Democratic-controlled Senate and Republican-controlled House’s continued failure to reach a compromise on amendments to the two-year budget. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the funds could not be released through the General Assembly, grant recipient plans were postponed by months. For example, McDougall said another grant recipient had made an agreement with a local farmer to plant strawberries in the spring with the intention of shipping them in May with LFPA funds. The strawberries were planted, but because of the hold up, there was nowhere for them to go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LFPA awardees then reached out to Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s office to see if it was possible for him to authorize the funds following adjournment of the session. Last week, they received word that the governor had signed off on appropriating the funds, but budget language required that the House and Senate appropriations committees be given five business days to weigh in before they could be released. The five-day waiting period ended Wednesday, allowing the money to be distributed starting Thursday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The funds come at a critical time for food-insecure populations in Virginia, who lost income for food when Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) emergency allotments expired in February. During the pandemic, all people eligible for SNAP received the maximum amount of the benefit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without the emergency allotments, SNAP recipients are seeing drastic cuts, said Cassie Edner, an attorney with the Virginia Poverty Law Center. </span></p>
<p><em>[<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/04/27/more-southwest-virginia-families-turn-to-food-banks-with-end-of-extra-snap-benefits/" target="_blank">Read more: More Southwest Virginia families turn to food banks with the end of extra SNAP benefits</a>]</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;ve seen a lot of individuals that are 60 and above that went from $281 a month to $23 dollars a month,” she said. “They&#8217;re calling us up in tears saying, ‘How can I afford my food? How can I afford rent?’ You have to choose sometimes, rent or food, you know, medications. It&#8217;s a hard choice.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dina Archer, a senior citizen who recently visited the Colonial Heights Food Pantry in Petersburg, said she had been receiving over $400 a month from SNAP before the emergency allotments ended. Now she said she only gets $23 a month. She has depended on the assistance since she lost her husband to COVID-19 several years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People shouldn’t have to feel embarrassed about this,” Archer said. “I still have to spend money in the grocery store. It’s not like you’re not gonna go back to the grocery store, but [at the food pantry] you get the opportunity for vitamins and minerals, all the things that you need instead of eating the same thing every day because you can’t afford it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warren Hammonds, the pantry’s only full-time staff person, said his facility had been seeing more demand since inflation started to spike last summer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve had to search for emergency grants to cover costs of additional shelf-stable food that we have to have on hand for these vulnerable populations,” Hammonds said. “It’s been very demanding financially.”</span></p>
<p><em>[<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/09/virginia-suspends-covid-19-emergency-allotment-snap-benefits/" target="_blank">Read more: Virginia suspends COVID-19 emergency allotment SNAP benefits</a>]</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Virginia Department of Social Services reports, 900,313 people in Virginia, including children, benefited from SNAP in April 2023. Eddie Oliver with the Virginia Federation of Food Banks said that the average household lost $95 a month after emergency allotments ended.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By some measures [it’s] the largest cut to the nutrition safety net in history,” Oliver said. “It’s a massive amount of money that has suddenly dropped out of the program at a time when food prices are still very high.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that the federal funds have been released, some extra assistance will be available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have been eagerly anticipating the nutritious products that will be made available to our food bank network through the LFPA,” Oliver said in a statement on Friday. “The fresh produce and culturally familiar items we are expecting from our friends at 4P Foods will enable us to better serve low-income seniors and communities suffering from low food access. This support could not come at a more urgent time.”</span></p>

For some, that milestone is cut short by tragedy.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">When a high school student dies before graduation, it can be difficult for a family to obtain a posthumous diploma.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">State lawmakers this recent General Assembly session passed <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1514" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231%2Bsum%2BHB1514&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1684259607901000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2oJZZ1Y-GzyO56pSJzHy0D" target="_blank">House Bill 1514</a> to require the Board of Education to waive certain graduation requirements for senior students who die before graduation. The bill allows posthumous diplomas to be awarded at the request of parents if the student was in good standing in their senior year.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">However, these waivers can still be considered on a case-by-case basis, according to the bill.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Previously, <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/22.1-253.13:4/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/22.1-253.13:4/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1684259607901000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3c9XjLYiUuNMDe2CtSOBqj" target="_blank">state code</a> only required such diplomas to be awarded if they were initiated by the Board of Education or requested by a local school board.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Dawn Adams, D-Richmond, introduced the measure after the mother of a murdered Thomas Jefferson High School <a href="https://www.nbc12.com/2022/03/22/thomas-jefferson-hs-students-protest-demand-diploma-murdered-classmate/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nbc12.com/2022/03/22/thomas-jefferson-hs-students-protest-demand-diploma-murdered-classmate/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1684259607901000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3qPmITsGihCPiAwlByp-l4" target="_blank">student</a> reached out for assistance with her son&#8217;s goal to receive his high school diploma, Adams stated. Daveon Elliot was fatally shot in November 2021.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The family was told the school could only award a certificate of completion because he had not met the outlined graduation <a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/parents-students/for-students/graduation/diploma-options/standard-diploma-graduation-requirements" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.doe.virginia.gov/parents-students/for-students/graduation/diploma-options/standard-diploma-graduation-requirements&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1684259607901000&amp;usg=AOvVaw26w5apoxrNRuaVy_FJYFvE" target="_blank">requirements</a>, Adams stated.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Elliot’s senior yearbook picture had already been taken, the mother told WWBT <a href="https://www.nbc12.com/2022/03/22/thomas-jefferson-hs-students-protest-demand-diploma-murdered-classmate/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nbc12.com/2022/03/22/thomas-jefferson-hs-students-protest-demand-diploma-murdered-classmate/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1684259607901000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3qPmITsGihCPiAwlByp-l4" target="_blank">NBC 12</a>, so she said he should also receive the diploma.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Adams thought a line in the state code could be used for an exception to the requirements. But she said her appeals to the school division superintendent, governor and secretary of education were unsuccessful.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As the bill progressed, Adams said she heard from other families who were thankful for the bill, which unanimously passed both chambers of the General Assembly.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Amber Holsinger-Staton is the mother of Nicholas Coleman, a Prince George High School student who died in August 2021, right before his senior year started. Coleman was diagnosed with brain cancer a year prior. He completed work through an <a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/programs-services/special-education/iep-instruction/individualized-education-program-iep" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.doe.virginia.gov/programs-services/special-education/iep-instruction/individualized-education-program-iep&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1684259607901000&amp;usg=AOvVaw309OYEWl0Imd5tnZw9QQfF" target="_blank">individualized education program</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“He was very sick and he did what he could,” Holsinger-Staton said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Her family did not get the closure they deserved at Coleman’s would-be graduation, she said. The school told Holsinger-Staton that graduation was a time for celebration and they did not want it to be a memorial, which she said upset Coleman’s peers.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">School administrators sometimes worry that commemorative activities could upset students and staff, according to the <a href="https://grievingstudents.org/about-us/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://grievingstudents.org/about-us/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1684259607901000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0WNBv0lReDgFfYcSm65vIG" target="_blank">Coalition</a> to Support Grieving Students, a part of the National Center for School Crisis and Bereavement. But the death itself is what upsets students most, not discussions about the death, according to the coalition, which argues students need to be allowed to plan the activities to honor their lost friends as part of the grief process.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“I get that graduation is a time of celebration, but these kids also lost somebody,” Holsinger-Staton said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Peers can heal through the honoring of deceased students, Adams stated. Commemoration would “add to the occasion and make it more meaningful for all.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">After Coleman’s girlfriend went to <a href="https://www.nbc12.com/2022/06/08/prince-george-community-pushes-back-after-pghs-may-not-leave-seat-graduation-late-student/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nbc12.com/2022/06/08/prince-george-community-pushes-back-after-pghs-may-not-leave-seat-graduation-late-student/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1684259607901000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0EDmycgr5lMpvj7xfKrnUC" target="_blank">the news</a>, Prince George High School offered to leave a seat with flowers and a cap and gown for Coleman at his would-be graduation. Students also had a moment of silence.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Holsinger-Staton was denied what she really wanted — an honorary diploma. The diploma would have given her some closure, she said, adding something should be in place for students who die junior or senior year. She also believes it would be beneficial if the bill was retroactive.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The bill could be expanded to other high school grade levels in the future, Adams stated.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“If nothing else, for the families going forward, I think it’s the most important thing,” Holsinger-Staton said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Tammy Gweedo McGee’s son Conner Guido died in a car crash on the night of his homecoming dance in October 2019. He was a junior. His mother adapted the spelling of her last name to reflect her son’s nickname, “Gweedo.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Guido maintained a 3.7 GPA and was active in many school sports at Tabb High School in Yorktown. It was “heart-wrenching,” she said, to know he could not graduate with his friends.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Gweedo McGee hopes “parents who have been robbed of the opportunity to see their child at graduation” can benefit from posthumous diplomas, as well as empty chairs at graduation to honor their children.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The school had a celebration of life for Guido on the school soccer field. There were other recognitions that Gweedo McGee requested. She asked to pay for a bench on the soccer field or to plant a tree in her son’s honor, but the school told her they wanted to be consistent with commemorative actions, she said. A friend of Guido’s was also denied a request to allow “honor tassels” similar to club tassels like the National Honors Society and Key Club.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Coalition to Support Grieving Students <a href="https://www.schoolcrisiscenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Guidelines-Graduation-Commemoration.pdf" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.schoolcrisiscenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Guidelines-Graduation-Commemoration.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1684259607901000&amp;usg=AOvVaw25WM4eRpSy6YhlvEydZDzv" target="_blank">suggests</a> commemorative actions such as reading names at graduation, possibly followed by a moment of silence, or the designation of a yearbook page in honor of the student. The coalition suggested schools avoid things like <a href="https://www.schoolcrisiscenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Guidelines-Death-Student-or-Staff-Booklet-Format.pdf" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.schoolcrisiscenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Guidelines-Death-Student-or-Staff-Booklet-Format.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1684259607901000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2Q5cFGe75_3EZUbVg9-7Q7" target="_blank">naming buildings</a>, planting trees or placing plaques in school hallways to honor students if they are unable to apply these measures consistently to future deaths.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The school ultimately offered memorial pins for students to wear on their caps and gowns, but they would not allow an empty seat at graduation in case it retraumatized students, Gweedo McGee said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m not sure that there’s a great adjective for the pain that I felt inflicted upon me unnecessarily by a simple request to honor my deceased son at what would have been his graduation,” she said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Any student who dies in good standing should be recognized, Gweedo McGee said. She was disappointed in the school district, she added, but turned to advocacy to make a difference.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Gweedo McGee has helped pass two bills. <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+SB78" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221%2Bsum%2BSB78&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1684259607901000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3OXK5QQHOatYQF3qY2uIci" target="_blank">Senate Bill 78</a> required an additional 90-minute parent and student driver education component to the classroom portion of its driver education program. The <a href="https://www.dmv.virginia.gov/drivers/#cdts/90min.asp" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.dmv.virginia.gov/drivers/%23cdts/90min.asp&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1684259607901000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0GNESGuAbWlpSKAIPpofdq" target="_blank">requirement </a>is for the Northern Virginia area but encouraged outside of that planning district. The bill also requires education around the dangers of distracted driving.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+sum+HB1918&amp;212+sum+HB1918" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212%2Bsum%2BHB1918%26212%2Bsum%2BHB1918&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1684259607901000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1oR4wKGw1F_JZzxb6Jzpvn" target="_blank">HB 1918</a> requires driver education to cover the dangers of distracted driving and speeding. It also requires students to provide evidence of a valid driver’s license when applying for a school parking permit, and a standardized application form was created.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Gweedo McGee also created a <a href="https://ifyouseesomethingsaysomething.org/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ifyouseesomethingsaysomething.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1684259607901000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1NqN4Ut-fzdPVb-hL151K4" target="_blank">website</a> to allow teenagers to anonymously report unsafe behavior of peers in an effort to save lives.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“While I’m left on this Earth, I will never stop honoring my son and using his tragedy to help others,” Gweedo McGee said.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Virginia recorded about 10,000 homeless youth in public schools annually. Those numbers dropped by nearly 3,000 students in the 2020-21 school year. Since then, however, they have steadily increased, reaching about 9,000 students, as pandemic-era protections and extra funding for programs like rental assistance and food assistance have expired. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">School divisions and advocates are now swiftly moving to address the rise in homeless students as relief measures unwind for students and families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barbara Duffield, executive director for the nonprofit SchoolHouse Connection, an organization that combats homelessness, said actual cases could be even higher than what school officials have identified.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s hard to know if a child is experiencing homelessness,” said Duffield. “But when children aren&#8217;t even in school or coming on a regular basis, then that really requires proactive outreach to the community — putting posters up in motels, talking to the service provider community, word of mouth, all of those things — to let families who aren&#8217;t in school know that they can come to school, and they can get the help to do that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loudoun County, one of the </span><a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/healthiest-communities/slideshows/richest-counties-in-america?slide=15" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most affluent counties in the country</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, reported the highest number of homeless students in Virginia at the start of the 2022-23 school year, with 1,240 cases, according to the Virginia Department of Education. That equates to nearly one in seven homeless students in Virginia attending school in Loudoun County.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dan Adams, a spokesperson for Loudoun County Public Schools, did not respond to a request for an interview. However, he said that 36% of the division’s McKinney-Vento students — a reference to the federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, which defines homeless students as those “who lack a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence” — were identified as chronically absent during the 2021-22 school year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chronic absenteeism is defined as missing 18 or more days of the academic year.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“LCPS staff, notably the Office of Student Services, is working hard to address this concerning trend,” Adams said in an email to the Mercury.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Virginia Department of Education data, Fairfax, Henrico, Prince William and Chesterfield counties round out the top five localities in Virginia with the most homeless students during the current school year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student absences have recently come under scrutiny in Virginia after the Board of Education decided to </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/04/25/board-of-education-will-again-consider-chronic-absenteeism-in-school-accreditation-decisions/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">resume considering chronic absenteeism</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a factor in school accreditation last month. The decision went against a request by Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration, which had asked that a pandemic policy suspending consideration of the measure in accreditation reviews be continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chronic absenteeism is one of </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/admincode/title8/agency20/chapter131/section380/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nine factors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the state looks at when determining whether a school meets the state’s educational standards. Researchers with Virginia’s Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission have linked school accreditation and student academic performance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Board of Education previously suspended the use of the absenteeism factor due to the sharp increase in </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/10/31/around-virginia-respiratory-illnesses-surge-among-children/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">respiratory illnesses among youth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the COVID-19 pandemic. The absenteeism rate in Virginia schools has been more than four times higher in the 2022-23 school year than in the two years before the pandemic, according to a Virginia Association of School Superintendents survey.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Addressing the rate</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youth advocates said that nationally, almost 42% of students who were homeless were chronically absent from school in 2021, twice the chronic absenteeism rate seen among non-homeless students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While many homeless students are accompanied by at least one adult family member, some are unaccompanied. In Henrico, for example, the number of McKinney-Vento students classified as unaccompanied reached a high of 18% in 2021-22, but has fallen to its pre-pandemic level of 13% this school year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, several programs are aimed at helping homeless students. </span><a href="https://education.wm.edu/centers/hope/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">William &amp; Mary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which administers Virginia’s Program for the Education of Homeless Children and Youth for the Virginia Department of Education, tracks homelessness in public education, uses public awareness efforts to help improve homeless student attendance and success, and awards grants to school divisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, Duffield said SchoolHouse Connection has been helping divisions determine how best to use COVID-19 relief funds to address student absences and learning losses. Fairfax County, for example, is looking to hire an attendance specialist to focus on connecting with families experiencing homelessness and help get their children to school regularly. And other funds can help with hygiene, clothing and other basic needs that can prevent a child from not coming to school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That money can meet some of these critical needs right now,” Duffield said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lisa Ann Abernathy, a Henrico education specialist and school liaison for McKinney-Vento services, said students facing homelessness can develop trauma as a result of being shuffled around from place to place. Students can also develop a fear of being bullied and anxiety because of difficulties with hygiene or wearing the same clothes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All of the trauma can affect a child’s willingness, ability and preparedness — both their emotional and physical well-being — to be able to go to school, and that’s where the cycle of chronic absenteeism and homelessness go hand-in-hand,” Abernathy said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Henrico reported 501 cases of homelessness at the start of the 2022-23 school year. However, Abernathy said staff identified about 1,100 students who are eligible for McKinney-Vento. She said about 200 students were already chronically absent before being identified.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Couch surfing’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homeless students face a range of living situations, from emergency or transitional shelters to homes of relatives or family members to public places such as bus or train stations or abandoned buildings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experts refer to the constant movement from place to place that many homeless people experience as “couch surfing.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For students facing homelessness, the lack of a fixed regular residence isn’t the only challenge. Transportation can be an issue getting to school. Duffield said federal funds have been used to provide gas vouchers and funding to repair cars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">School divisions can also have difficulty identifying students in need because they are moving around from different homes to shelters and, in some cases, are alone. Under federal law, children identified as homeless have the right to stay enrolled in the same school district even if they’re living elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some districts are attempting to expand their aid to students in need as homelessness levels return to pre-pandemic rates. Starting in July, Henrico schools will have a full-time social worker who will focus on attendance and identify any barriers for families.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We know that if a student completes high school, that is the number one factor that determines whether or not they&#8217;re going to break out of homelessness as a young adult,“ Abernathy said.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Funding and legislative efforts</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advocates fighting to address homelessness said one of the chief concerns moving forward is the end of relief funding for school divisions in September 2024.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It has been a lifeline for schools,” said Rachael Deane, CEO of the child advocacy group Voices for Virginia’s Children.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As more relaxed pandemic rules expire, families and students facing economic insecurity have also started to lose protections and assistance with rental relief, health coverage and food benefits. Advocates are also concerned about students, particularly those from economically disadvantaged homes and those who identify as transgender or nonbinary, in need of mental health services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The funding is running out, but the challenges have not ended,” Deane said. “So we are very much concerned about schools having enough resources and the right resources to support students and families coming in through their doors.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Duffield said SchoolHouse Connection is advocating for Congress to continue providing relief funding to support homeless children and youth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, the General Assembly passed </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+mbr+H229" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2022 allowing youth over age 14 to access shelter without a guardian. And in February, lawmakers passed </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1300" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> changing the state’s guidance on addressing childhood trauma to help schools manage students in need, including those who are homeless. However, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+oth+HB1967F122+PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to require school divisions to make meals available to all students at no cost failed in a House subcommittee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voices for Virginia’s Children and others say they are monitoring the General Assembly’s decisions on budget amendments, including $230 million in proposed behavioral health investments that would increase funding for school-based mental health services for students facing challenges including homelessness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group is also following a proposal to fund more nursing and psychologist positions to help with increased behavioral issues among students. Advocates say the instability surrounding homeless students is one of several factors contributing to the rise in disruptive behaviors in schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers have not provided a timetable for when a budget agreement is expected to be reached.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving forward, Abernathy said people should drop any bias they have against individuals who are homeless. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People&#8217;s lives can turn upside down in a heartbeat,” she said. “Homelessness is not a choice. It is real, and it&#8217;s the kids who suffer. Our idea is to put that bias away, pack that baggage somewhere else, and just focus on moving these children forward.”</span></p>

(Catherine Rey)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Young, in love and ready to take on the world together, former U.S. Army sergeant Shane Phillips and Emily Siddens tied the knot in 2000 – unaware that a year later, a severe brain injury resulting from a car accident would leave Emily bedridden and completely dependent on others for day-to-day living.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the past 22 years, Phillips has been struggling to care for his wife. He left the army and lived off savings while looking for a home care worker for Emily who wasn’t a “nightmare.” After years of searching, he found one and returned to full-time work, but still remains his wife’s primary caregiver due to the challenges of her condition. The overwhelming stress of it all finally caught up to him last year, landing him in the emergency room six times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think I’ve been treading water while holding her head above water for 22 years, making no progress, with no hope or light at the end of the tunnel,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ironically, the COVID-19 pandemic provided some relief: New rules linked to the federal public health emergency meant he could get paid by Virginia for being his wife’s caregiver — an arrangement Virginia approved this March.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When I finally got the option to be her paid caregiver, it’s like I could breathe,” Phillips said. “Maybe things were gonna be okay, and maybe we could actually get back to some decent quality of life again, which we haven’t had since she was 19, since I was 21.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, a recent decision by the Department of Medical Assistance Services, which oversees the state’s Medicaid program, means this option is set to expire this November – despite state law allowing it to become permanent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Virginia has directly paid parents and spouses to provide personal care services for disabled children under 18, as well as disabled husbands or wives, through certain Medicaid waivers. This emergency provision meant people with serious disabilities could continue to receive care from family living in the same house instead of relying on outside caregivers who could potentially spread the virus. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting Nov. 12, spouses and parents of people whose disabilities require long-term care will have to meet new requirements to provide that care, including employment and training by a home care service agency. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That has left people like Kim Lieberman, a recently widowed mother and paid caregiver of a 12-year-old and 14-year-old with disability waivers, worried about how they will care for their families in the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Virginia officials say the change will provide necessary oversight and help the state comply with federal rules in a post-COVID world, many parents and spouses who have benefited from the paid care approach say being forced to work through an agency simply doesn’t make sense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don&#8217;t even know how agency [care] would address people like me who have multiple kids,” Lieberman said. “I’m already so stressed out about so many things with the kids.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How Virginia’s system of disability waivers works</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disability waivers, formally known as Virginia Developmental Disabilities Home and Community-Based Services waivers, fund services for people with long-term care needs, such as those with developmental disabilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those services can include home care attendants, group home support and workplace assistance services, all aimed at keeping individuals in a home or community setting rather than requiring them to be transferred to a facility. Funding for the waivers is split equally between the state and federal government, which must approve any changes states make to their programs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, demand for disability waivers is high: According to a recent state </span><a href="https://vacsb.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/DBHDS-2022-Annual-Report-FINAL-DRAFT-1.docx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, roughly 16,500 Virginians had been assigned a disability waiver as of Aug. 1, 2022. Nearly 14,000 individuals are on a waitlist for one. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to the pandemic, neither parents of minors with disability waivers nor spouses of waiver-holders could be paid for personal caregiving. While other extended family members like aunts or grandparents could be reimbursed for personal care, the state has considered parents and spouses to be legally responsible for providing a certain level of services to minor children or partners, preventing them from being paid for that care. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That changed with COVID-19, when the federal government approved a </span><a href="https://www.dmas.virginia.gov/media/5610/legally-responsible-individual-reimbursement-fact-sheet-02-27-2023.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allowing both parents and spouses to be paid for personal caregiving services such as bathing, dressing and feeding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Catherine Rey took advantage of these flexibilities to become the paid caregiver for her two sons, Louie, 8, and JP, 10, both of whom have genetic disorders and require constant care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For a lot of years I was essentially a coworker to the attendants that we hired, but unpaid,” Rey said. “This was sort of the missing link that was actually really beneficial to our family.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_35203" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1039px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Crotts_600days.jpeg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-35203" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Crotts_600days.jpeg" alt="" width="1039" height="1015" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Crotts_600days.jpeg 1039w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Crotts_600days-300x293.jpeg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Crotts_600days-1024x1000.jpeg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Crotts_600days-768x750.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1039px) 100vw, 1039px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Sarah Crotts celebrating 600 days of being seizure free. (Margie Crotts)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Family members could step into the paid caregiver role either under the oversight of an agency or through what’s known as the consumer-directed route, where a family member decides what caregivers are needed and oversees their hiring. They also had to demonstrate they were providing “extraordinary care” beyond what they are legally obligated to provide as a parent or spouse and facing “extraordinary circumstances” that meant they had exhausted their options for getting care services elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new opportunities were popular. According to DMAS, almost 1,900 parents and spouses of people with disability waivers provided personal care for their family members during the first two months of 2023. And in 2022, the General Assembly </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2022/2/HB30/Introduced/CR/304/23c/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">amended</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the state budget to allow the new family caregiving options to become permanent under state law — but only if DMAS and the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services approved it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In early April, however, DMAS submitted plans to the federal government that would only allow paid family caregivers under agency oversight, ending the ability of family members to both oversee the provision of personal care services and be paid directly for it. The change could impact up to 4,500 Virginians who hold what are known as Building Independence and Family and Individual Supports waivers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No changes have been made to other waivers known as Community Living and CCC Plus yet, but DMAS Communications Director Rebecca Dooley said the agency plans to amend them to allow paid family caregivers. She did not specify if parental and spousal caregivers for the nearly 11,500 Virginians who hold these waivers would only be allowed through an agency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the new plan, family carers would have to go through 40 hours of initial training plus 12 hours every year after, document all of the services they provide every day and be supervised by a registered nurse every 90 days. They would also only be eligible to get paid for 40 hours of care, instead of being eligible for more on a case-by-case basis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal sparked an immediate backlash, with hundreds of family caregivers and disability organizations submitting </span><a href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/ViewNotice.cfm?GNid=2561" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">public comments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> opposing the change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This program has allowed us to have an almost normal life,” wrote Elizabeth Bagby, who identified herself as the paid caregiver for her paraplegic husband with disabilities. “My husband &amp; I should not be forced to get a divorce in order to qualify under the same terms as any Tom, Dick or Harry from off the street.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being able to be paid by the state through the consumer-directed option rather than going through an agency “has been a godsend,” wrote Sandra Phillips, the paid caregiver for her son who has disabilities. “There are days when I am so stressed I feel like giving up. I am on high alert all the time. This has given me some peace of mind and security.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Necessary or ‘insulting’ oversight</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tammy Whitlock, a deputy director with DMAS, said keeping all of the pandemic-era policies in place could run the risk of the federal government rejecting the state’s program because of federal guidelines strongly suggesting additional oversight of paid caregivers and compensation limits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We wanted to raise our odds of getting the waiver approved the first time around because CMS has a 90-day clock that they can stop any time during that review process, which can push out the approval, &#8221; Whitlock said. “We didn’t want there to be a period where the parents who are providing [agency caregiving services] now would no longer be eligible to provide it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, agency officials say the new requirements provide critical safety nets for families facing the “extraordinary circumstances” and providing the “extraordinary care” that justify family caregiving.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It makes sense to us to have an agency oversee that situation with the nurse available to that family because if it&#8217;s an extraordinary situation, there are other things going on other than ‘Hey, I just can&#8217;t find a caregiver’ because the caregivers are out there now, they&#8217;re becoming more plentiful,” said Whitlock.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked if DMAS has seen more instances of fraud that would indicate the need for additional guardrails, Nichole Martin, director of DMAS’ Office of Community Living, said while there are active investigations of fraud within both the consumer and agency routes, it isn’t widespread.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disability groups and many parents say the push for agency oversight is insulting and unnecessary, given the documentation they are already required to submit to prove they should be a paid caregiver. </span><a href="https://nashp.org/medicaid-structured-family-caregiving-enabling-family-members-to-make-caregiving-their-primary-focus/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some other states</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they point out, are already directly paying spouses of disabled people and parents of disabled minors to act as caregivers. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking care of a child with disabilities is already hard enough as a parent, said Deanna Plebuch, whose husband is the paid caregiver for her two children with disabilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then on top of that, to be questioned as if we’re criminals trying to steal money from other people when that’s just simply not the case —we’re just trying to get the bare minimum of equity,” said Plebuch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other parents and spouses of disabled people say there’s no need for the state to mandate training for services they’ve been providing their family members for years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It feels insulting that instead they would have to go through all these hours of training on how to care for someone with a disability when it’s their own child,” said Milling. “They really are the expert on how to care for that child.” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Caregiver shortage</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s shift away from paid parental and spousal caregivers comes as the caregiving industry faces dire shortages nationwide that were exacerbated by the pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A March 2022 congressional </span><a href="https://www.macpac.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MACPAC-brief-on-HCBS-workforce.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found a turnover rate in the home care workforce of 40% to 60% annually. The prior year, 77% of care agencies reported turning away new referrals, while 58% said they had discontinued certain programs or services and 84% said they had delayed programs due to staffing shortages. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem is also evident in Virginia. Teri Morgan, executive director for the Virginia Board for People with Disabilities, said there is “absolutely a direct care workforce crisis” in the commonwealth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Margie Crotts, a paid caregiver for her adult daughter Sarah, who holds a different type of disability waiver than the ones affected by the new policy, said she waited more than a year to get a caregiver from an agency after Sarah was awarded her waiver but never received a call back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even families who have found caregivers can face difficulties if the caregiver becomes sick, quits or otherwise can’t come to work. Rena Bumbray-Graves, who has helped care for two sisters with disabilities both as a paid caregiver and in concert with an agency, said “the agency never has a backup.” That means when a carer is absent, Bumbray-Graves often has to step in to fill the gap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course I don’t get paid for that. But because she’s in my home and she’s family, I’m going to take care of her whether anybody shows up or not,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of the problem, say people working in the care industry, is that many caregiving jobs have low wages and lack health insurance, paid family and medical leave and retirement plans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So many of our care workers are forced to live in poverty because of the low wages we pay, and so it hurts the care workers and it hurts the people who rely on them,” said David Broder, president of SEIU Virginia 512, a union representing home care and government workers in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, DMAS reimburses agencies providing home care services for people with disability waivers at a </span><a href="https://vamedicaid.dmas.virginia.gov/bulletin/personal-care-rate-update-effective-july-1-2022" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of $21 per hour in Northern Virginia and $16.45 per hour in the rest of Virginia. After taking a cut of the pay, agencies then pay their caregivers at whatever rate they choose as long as it meets or exceeds the state minimum wage of $12 per hour. Caregivers retained under the consumer route are reimbursed $16.45 per hour in Northern Virginia and $12.70 per hour in the rest of Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those rates mean a consumer-directed caregiver working 40 hours a week would make $34,216 a year in Northern Virginia and $26,416 a year in the rest of the state. Agency caregivers may receive more depending on their employer, but those paid minimum wage would make $24,960 a year regardless of where they live. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">State costs</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What fiscal impact the shift toward agency oversight will have remains unclear. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the hourly </span><a href="https://vamedicaid.dmas.virginia.gov/bulletin/personal-care-rate-update-effective-july-1-2022" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> listed by DMAS, one hour of personal care provided through an agency would cost $5.34 more in Northern Virginia and $5.81 more in the rest of Virginia than one hour paid directly to a family member through the consumer route. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If we extrapolate that out over 40 hours per week, 52 weeks per year, it means that agency-directed care would cost the state $12,085 more in [the rest of Virginia], and $11,107 more in [Northern Virginia], per year,” Broder said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, DMAS has said requiring family caregivers to go through agencies shouldn’t raise any financial concerns because other expenses linked to the direct provision of care by family members — such as the use of service facilitators and other liaisons — mean consumer-directed and agency services end up costing the state roughly the same amount. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DMAS did not respond to a follow-up question asking for a full list of expenses associated with consumer-directed services. The department also did not answer if there are any indirect costs associated with agency-directed services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. George Barker, D-Alexandria, who co-chairs the Senate Finance Committee, said he couldn’t say for certain whether one route costs Virginia more than the other but said he thought continuing to allow parents and spouses to be paid directly wouldn’t likely cost as much as people might expect. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s really targeted at the parents, the family members, who are being paid, and I think that’s the biggest issue here,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some family carers also said paying parents or spouses to provide care comes with greater benefits because their loved ones are more comfortable with them and agencies can set limitations on what services their workers can provide, like transportation or administering medication. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before James Shea’s daughter Lydia died in 2022 due to complications stemming from a rare genetic disorder, either he or his wife had to be at home with registered nurses in case she needed medication or transportation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It ruined my working life,” Shea said. “Running around to appointments, taking care of her scheduled things like it was a full-time job, and we needed that income to survive as a family.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shea eventually left his job as a freelance writer at the start of the pandemic to become a full-time paid caregiver for Lydia.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Ongoing disability service shortfalls</h4>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia isn’t a stranger to controversy over services for people with disabilities. In 2011, the U.S. Department of Justice </span><a href="https://dbhds.virginia.gov/assets/doc/settlement/indreview/final-edva-order-and-settlement-agreement.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">found</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the state had violated the federal Americans with Disabilities Act by segregating hundreds of individuals with disabilities in large, hospital-like state-run facilities called training centers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A settlement reached in 2012 called for Virginia to transition its then-segregated system into one involving community-based services, a process the state had already begun. Among the requirements was one ordering Virginia to add an additional 4,170 disability waiver slots. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While disability advocates say Virginia has made large strides in transitioning people out of facilities into community settings, some argue DMAS’ recent decision hinders this progress.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joy Spencer, CEO of service facilitator organization Moms in Motion, said part of the 2012 settlement “is that individuals receiving services are supposed to have provider choice.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How is the parent of a minor child going to continue to be allowed to make a choice about when and how their services are provided if they’re being forced to use agency-directed [care]?” Spencer said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The settlement agreement is </span><a href="https://assets.nationbuilder.com/thearcofva/pages/130/attachments/original/1678808845/2023.03.09-_Stakeholder_powerpoint_%281%29.pdf?1678808845" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">anticipated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to expire Dec. 31 after two extensions due to federal courts finding Virginia had not achieved full compliance with all DOJ requirements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, waitlists remain long.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brigid Klein said while her daughter Elizabeth, who has an intellectual disability, qualified for a waiver when she was 8, she has been on a waitlist to receive services for 20 years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My husband and I, her parents and also now her legal guardians, are aging, and we get a little more anxious about are we ever going to get waiver services?” Klein said. “How can they close [the settlement] when we have this situation? It’s not been resolved.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Martin, the director of DMAS’ Office of Community Services, said the agency has no control over adding slots, which the General Assembly must decide to fund in the state budget. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, she said, “You can’t just throw slots at the equation. You have to have providers to fill and meet the needs of members.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022, for example, lawmakers sought to add funding for an extra 600 waiver slots into the budget before </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2022/2/HB30/Introduced/CR/304/7c/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">delaying</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the money because a shortage of care providers meant the state couldn’t guarantee that hundreds more people could actually receive services. As a result, no additional slots were added in 2023, according to a February </span><a href="https://dbhds.virginia.gov/developmental-services/waiver-services/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both the General Assembly and Gov. Glenn Youngkin have taken some steps to address the situation. The legislature in 2022 </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2022/2/HB30/Introduced/CR/304/11c/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> DMAS reimbursement rates for personal care worker rates by 7.5%, bringing them to the current level. And while Virginia is set to finally add the 600 additional slots this July, </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/item/2023/1/HB1400/Introduced/1/304/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin has proposed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> raising the total to 1,100 as part of his “Right Help, Right Now” plan to improve the state’s behavioral health system. Under that plan, the slots would be intended for those on the “priority 1” waitlist, meaning they need services in a year or less.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed Senate </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2023/1/SB800/Introduced/CA/485/1s/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">budget</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also includes an additional 500 waiver slots to be added this July. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Crotts said she recognizes Virginia is taking steps to provide more services for its residents with disabilities, she said she and other parents and spouses shouldn’t be overlooked in the state’s efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’d love for someone from DMAS to come to my house and stay with Sarah for when you want me to hire somebody,” she said. “How about you come for eight hours? You try it, you take a shift and I’ll go get my nails done, go to the movies and go out. I don’t think they’ll come back.” </span></p>

(Janae Blakeney / VCU Capital News Service)</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>By Janae Blakeney / Capital News Service</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">A single mother wheeled her cart around a Roanoke Food Lion on a recent Saturday night, plucking a few staples off the shelves for her and her daughter to eat.</p>
<p dir="ltr">She selected some eggs, milk, frozen Kid Cuisines and other items for the week and headed for the checkout line. She swiped a plastic card for payment, like most customers do, but unlike other customers she used an electronic benefit transfer card, known as food stamp benefits.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The card does not have as many funds on it now as it did two months ago, since a COVID-era support program ended in <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/changes-2023-benefit-amounts" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/changes-2023-benefit-amounts&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1682634926592000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2lZTVwjtgZ_h3RxgketITH">early March</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Alyssa Leftwich works part time at the Food Lion deli. She is a single mother to her almost 2-year-old daughter.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Leftwich is one of approximately 78,000 households with a mother or caregiver who provides for a child alone and receives food stamps in Virginia. There are over 3.5 million such households in the U.S., according to 2021 data estimates from the <a href="https://data.census.gov/table?q=Income+and+Poverty&amp;g=010XX00US_040XX00US51&amp;tid=ACSST5Y2021.S2201" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://data.census.gov/table?q%3DIncome%2Band%2BPoverty%26g%3D010XX00US_040XX00US51%26tid%3DACSST5Y2021.S2201&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1682634926592000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3xXPZIBcRrF2LKFH2bI1qE">U.S. Census Bureau</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The benefits are a huge help on a low income, Leftwich said, adding, “You feel overwhelmed and stressed trying to run a household on your own and make sure your child has everything they need.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program provides food stamp benefits that can be used like cash to buy groceries from authorized retailers, according to the <a href="https://www.dss.virginia.gov/benefit/snap.cgi" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.dss.virginia.gov/benefit/snap.cgi&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1682634926592000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1Af1oXh1a6D7kxexYviI9B">Virginia Department of Social Services.</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">The emergency allotments increased existing monthly benefits to the maximum amount based on household size, not income limits. The program in April 2020 gave $95 extra to households that received the monthly maximum, according to the <a href="https://www.dss.virginia.gov/benefit/emergency_allotments.cgi" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.dss.virginia.gov/benefit/emergency_allotments.cgi&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1682634926592000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2-Ucu4sSeWSYfFg7FGlZCx">Virginia Department of Social Services</a>. Congress passed the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2617" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2617&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1682634926592000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3FiKMv_3oBKn7bBu-KtEm0">Consolidated Appropriations Act</a> this year, which ended emergency allotments after the last February distribution.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It was able to help me get more food and larger amounts for me and my child,” Leftwich said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some families are finding now they do not have enough to cover food expenses.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Being a single mother is hard; sometimes you don’t have other resources,” Leftwich said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Leftwich likes to buy half a gallon of milk at the grocery store but said it seems to go pretty quickly. She has turned to other resources to help feed her daughter and stretch out the food stamp allotment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Food banks in Roanoke said they are helping more residents — from young mothers to veterans to senior citizens — after the extra benefits ended. But the food banks also face a decrease in donations due to rising food costs and lack of funds to buy more costly food.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Food banks see need increase</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Christian Soldiers Food Pantry of Roanoke is a partner agency of Feeding America, according to Rayma Mills, director and manager of the food pantry. The pantry started 25 years ago from the back of a pickup truck with two pastors, according to Mills, and now occupies a large area upstairs in an old industrial building. They receive donations almost daily from Food Lion, Kroger, Walmart and Sam’s Club.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On an early Friday morning in April, visitors shopped the pantry and chose from shelves stacked with produce, meat, dry goods, bread, desserts and more. That day rotisserie chicken was also offered.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We serve clients Tuesday through Saturday,” Mills said. “They can come one time a week.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">More people have come to the food bank since emergency allotments ended, according to Mills. They serve thousands of people a year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“They’ve taken benefits away, but they’re not putting a net there for nobody,” Mills said. The food pantry helps people who “fall through the cracks.”</p>
<p><iframe title="A look at poverty level throughout Virginia" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-a90aD" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/a90aD/6/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="508" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script></p>
<p dir="ltr">“I have people coming through here that say if they could not come to this pantry, they would not be able to eat, and I know it’s the absolute truth,” Mills said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Friendship House has operated for 85 years, according to owner Aaron Dowdy. In addition to a food pantry, the house runs an after-school program for elementary school children and a housing program for refugees and immigrants, Dowdy said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We’ve had several families mention that’s the reason why they’re coming more often now,” Dowdy said about the end of emergency SNAP benefits.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Friendship House served approximately 115 families a week before 2023. The organization now serves approximately 150 families a week.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The pantry gives each family at least two grocery bags of food. One bag has canned goods and the other has fresh food, according to Dowdy.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Food banks struggle to help those in need</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">United Christian Inner-City Ministry Food Distribution Center of Roanoke has served the community for 23 years, according to owner Billie English.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Food Distribution Center has had an increase in phone calls since emergency benefits ended, but also due to the rising price of food products, English said. The center also serves people who don’t receive SNAP benefits.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The number of donations to the center has decreased due to the increase in food prices, according to English.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Our donations have gone down because people are having to spend more money to buy food,” English said. “They’re not able to help donate so that we can go get food.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Feeding America is a network of food pantries and food banks around the U.S., with seven main locations in Virginia. It <a href="https://www.feedingamerica.org/about-us/press-room/hunger-crisis-worsens#:~:text=Feeding%20America%20projects%20that%20the,overall%20food%20donations%20are%20down." target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.feedingamerica.org/about-us/press-room/hunger-crisis-worsens%23:~:text%3DFeeding%2520America%2520projects%2520that%2520the,overall%2520food%2520donations%2520are%2520down.&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1682634926592000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0eg-ZUrAPqe7LVjx3y6zcj">projected</a> a 20% decrease in donations from manufacturers and a 45% decrease in “federal commodities” for last year. The organization stated last year that 55% of its food banks reported a decrease in donations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Food banks now have to purchase more food to keep up with need but are paying higher costs, according to Feeding America. The organization estimated a 40% increase in food costs last year.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Rising food costs</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The U.S. Department of Agriculture <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-price-outlook/summary-findings/#:~:text=Egg%20prices%20are%20predicted%20to,experienced%20consistent%20growth%20throughout%202022." target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-price-outlook/summary-findings/%23:~:text%3DEgg%2520prices%2520are%2520predicted%2520to,experienced%2520consistent%2520growth%2520throughout%25202022.&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1682634926592000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3PYB9o-KsfONOkb2y5NzWU">forecast</a> the price of eggs would increase almost 30% this year. Other categories would increase in price also, including meats, poultry, dairy, fats and oils, processed fruits and vegetables, sugar and sweets, and cereals and bakery products.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Food prices are anticipated to increase more slowly this year but remain at above-historical average rates, <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-price-outlook/summary-findings/#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20all%20food%20prices,of%204.5%20to%2011.7%20percent." target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-price-outlook/summary-findings/%23:~:text%3DIn%25202023%252C%2520all%2520food%2520prices,of%25204.5%2520to%252011.7%2520percent.&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1682634926592000&amp;usg=AOvVaw12YfFLT4UD11xrgIFXDq8r">according to the USDA</a>, which predicted a 7.5% increase in all food costs this year for the U.S. The Consumer Price Index, a measure of economy-wide inflation, was up 6% in February from last February. Grocery store food prices increased by over 10% from February this year to February 2022.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Many people in the region do not have the extra money to spare.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The poverty level is an annual income of $14,580 or less for a household of one person in Virginia. The poverty level increases by $5,140 for each additional person in a household of eight, according to the <a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/content/uploads/sites/10/2023/01/FY-2023FPL_500NVM.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/content/uploads/sites/10/2023/01/FY-2023FPL_500NVM.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1682634926592000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3_xpGQxlPfrRd2hJ2Y1afj">Virginia Department of Health</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Over 18% of households in Roanoke live in poverty. The median Roanoke household income, in dollars adjusted for inflation, is under $49,000, according to data from the <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/roanokecityvirginia/LND110220" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/roanokecityvirginia/LND110220&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1682634926592000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0zZt_FX4VBeTW-AxldmrA8">U.S. Census Bureau.</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Food is a necessary but significant expense, Leftwich said. Local food banks are beneficial for single mothers like her, she said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The food bank has helped me get things I need because the food prices have gone up,” Leftwich said. “They helped me get access to nutritious foods like fresh produce and helped me reduce a financial burden.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WASHINGTON —  Every public school kid in the United States was eligible for free school meals during the COVID-19 pandemic, regardless of family income, thanks to the federal government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While that’s now ended, a growing number of states across the country are enacting universal school meal laws to bolster child food security and academic equity. With little prospect of action soon in Congress, the moves by states show an appetite for free school meals for all developing beyond Washington.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nine states have passed a temporary or permanent universal school meal policy in the past year. Another 23 have seen legislation introduced during the past three years, according to</span><a href="https://frac.org/healthy-school-meals-for-all" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recent data from the Food Research and Action Center. </span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">​​”As a former teacher, I know that providing free breakfast and lunch for our students is one of the best investments we can make to lower costs, support Minnesota&#8217;s working families, and care for our young learners and the future of our state,&#8221; Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, said when </span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/gov-tim-walz-signs-universal-school-meals-bill-into-law/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">signing his state’s universal school meals bill </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">on March 17.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we feed our children, we’re feeding our future,” said New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, also a Democrat, when </span><a href="https://www.governor.state.nm.us/2023/03/28/governor-signs-senate-bill-4-making-universal-free-and-healthy-school-meals-the-law-of-the-land/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">she signed her state’s policy into law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on March 28. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How it works</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/nslp" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National School Lunch Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/sbp/school-breakfast-program" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">School Breakfast Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> authorize the Department of Agriculture to subsidize school meals for low-income students. Schools are reimbursed for meals that meet federal nutrition standards and incorporate U.S.-grown foods. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The programs accounted for </span><a href="https://fns-prod.azureedge.us/sites/default/files/resource-files/cncost-4.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$18 billion in annual expenditures in 2019</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, serving roughly</span><a href="https://fns-prod.azureedge.us/sites/default/files/resource-files/slsummar-4.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 30 million students</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at lunch and </span><a href="https://fns-prod.azureedge.us/sites/default/files/resource-files/sbsummar-4.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">16 million </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">at breakfast. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal government enacted a policy that ensured access to school meals for all public school students, which teachers and families say supported kids’ wellbeing during the health crisis. </span></p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">School meals in Virginia</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>While Virginia has not passed legislation providing universal school meals, the state&#8217;s two-year budget signed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin in June 2022 includes funding for local school divisions to cover the cost of breakfast and lunch for students eligible for reduced-price meals under the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program. <a href="https://state.nokidhungry.org/virginia/2022/06/22/approved-state-budget-increases-school-meal-access/" target="_blank">No Kid Hungry Virginia estimates</a> the provision will help roughly 64,500 additional Virginia students access free meals.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
    </div>

	
<div id="modal-ready">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet the program was sunsetted in 2022, given objections to its roughly $29 billion estimated annual price tag and a desire among conservative members of Congress to </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/weekly-agriculture/2022/09/19/boozman-a-no-on-universal-school-meals-in-cr-00057434" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“go back to normal.” </span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are pieces to this program that are badly damaged,” said Jonathan Butcher, the Will Skillman Senior Research Fellow in Education Policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation. “You&#8217;re not solving anything by making it a universal program.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under current federal law, only students with families who have incomes at 130% of the poverty line are eligible for entirely free school meals. That would be a family of four that makes roughly $36,000 or less. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Families with income between 130% and 185% below the poverty line pay a reduced price for meals. Students whose families have income above 185% of the poverty line must pay full price. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Party divisions</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Policy experts say that despite growing interest in some states, federal universal school meals legislation would be a non-starter in the current Congress, where Republicans in the House majority aim to reduce federal spending.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">States led by Republicans might be less eager to move ahead as well, with </span><a href="https://legiscan.com/MT/bill/HB863/2023" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bills in those states stalled in committee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://www.ndlegis.gov/assembly/68-2023/regular/bill-actions/ba1491.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">failing to pass by slim margins</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Costs for the program range from $30 million to $40 million annually in states like Maine to $400 million over two years in Minnesota. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the nine states that have passed universal school meals, all have Democratic majorities of both chambers of state legislatures and control the governor’s office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last legislation introduced at the federal level was the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/1530" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Universal School Meals Program Act of 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sponsored by Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Minnesota Democrat, and independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. The bill failed to make it out of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I certainly don&#8217;t have a whole lot of hope with Republican control of the House that they’ll do much, in those terms,” said Marcus Weaver-Hightower, professor of educational foundations at Virginia Tech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, there is optimism about universal school meals over the long term at the federal level after the trial run during the pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The resistance isn&#8217;t as loud as it might seem,” said Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Michigan Democrat and advocate for universal school meals. “I know it&#8217;s going to be able to move with urgency because the community outside of the Capitol bubble is moving with urgency, talking about this more and more.” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">An experiment in the lockdown</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As communities locked down in March 2020 with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the economy weathered mass layoffs, the Department of Agriculture authorized the provision of free school meal waivers for all students and raised the per-meal reimbursement rate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program grew to support </span><a href="https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=372#:~:text=Preliminary%20data%20for%20fall%202021,students%20(source%2C%20source)." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">roughly 50 million students </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">during the health crisis. Food-insecure households with children decreased by 2.3 percentage points between 2020 and 2021, </span><a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2022/november/food-insecurity-decreased-for-u-s-households-with-children-in-2021-but-increased-for-households-without-children/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to the USDA. </span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was kind of a natural experiment,” Weaver-Hightower said. “Everybody was suddenly getting them for free.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeanne Reilly, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the director of school nutrition at Windham Raymond Schools in Maine,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recalled that when schools were closed, school nutrition teams got creative. Lunch staff were meeting parents in parking lots to distribute meals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet as vaccines proliferated at the end of 2021 and students returned to school, the federal universal meals program hit turbulence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conservative members of Congress, including Kentucky Republican Sens. Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul, </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/09/free-school-meals-end-mcconnell-opposition-00015695" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">refused to extend the universal school meal policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as part of the omnibus spending bill passed in March 2022. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bipartisan Keep Kids Fed Act of 2022 passed by Congress in June 2022 allowed some states to extend their free meal programs and provided additional money for reimbursements. Yet school nutritionists say the effects of sunsetting the waivers are lingering. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cohen said that experts now are starting to hear about the return of school meal debt, which can force schools to forgo educational expenses in order to pay the USDA for delinquent meal costs. A recent </span><a href="https://schoolnutrition.org/sna-news/sna-survey-shows-school-meal-programs-face-critical-challenges/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">School Nutrition Association survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that 847 school districts have racked up more than $19 million in debt from unpaid lunches. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">School participation in the meal programs also dropped to 88% in fall 2022, compared to 94% in March 2022, according to </span><a href="https://www.k12dive.com/news/smaller-percentage-schools-participate-school-meals/638030/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Department of Education.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">States take action</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Five states have passed laws that will provide free universal school meals in the 2023-24 school year and beyond, including Minnesota, New Mexico, Maine, California and Colorado. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vermont, Connecticut and Massachusetts are providing universal school meals for the 2022-23 school year, through a combination of federal and state funds. Nevada is providing universal school meals through the 2023-24 school year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twenty-three other states have seen universal school meals legislation introduced in the past three years, including Arizona, Louisiana, Montana, Maryland, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Punam Ohri-Vachaspati, a professor of nutrition and leader of the Arizona State Food Policy and Environmental Research Group, said offering free school meals reduces the </span><a href="https://ucanr.edu/blogs/blogcore/postdetail.cfm?postnum=56451" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">social stigma for low-income students</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, increasing participation and nutritional benefits for those who need it most. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, a cardiologist and the Jean Mayer Professor in the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University, cited a </span><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2778453?utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_term=040921" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Journal of the American Medical Association study</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that found school meals are among the most nutritious meals students eat anywhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other studies have shown that universal school meals p</span><a href="https://schoolnutrition.org/about-school-meals/school-meal-statistics/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">roduce positive overall effects</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on school attendance and academic performance across grades. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tlaib says she benefited firsthand from participating in the National School Lunch Program when she was a child growing up with 13 siblings, an immigrant father who worked the night shift at Ford Motor Company and a mother who was still learning English. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As our family grew larger, I&#8217;ll tell you that I don&#8217;t think my family would have ever been able to provide us food for lunch,” Tlaib said. “When you have a parent tell me that&#8217;s the only place their child eats twice a day, this is so incredibly important.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Others say that the policy would be a waste of taxpayer dollars and push the school lunch program further from its original purpose. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Free and reduced price school meals are for those who need the assistance,” said Republican Arkansas Sen. John Boozman, who declined to extend universal school meal waivers in a stopgap spending bill in September, in a statement to States Newsroom. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Universal school meals isn’t about increasing access for hungry children — it’s about taxpayers subsidizing meals for those who do not need it.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Butcher, of the Heritage Foundation, said the National School Breakfast and National School Lunch programs are on the high-priority list for the government watchdog Government Accountability Office, </span><a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-19-389" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accounting for over $1 billion in untracked spending</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as </span><a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/plate-waste-in-us-cafeterias-could-total-530-000-tons-per-year" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">food waste grows in school lunchrooms. </span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baylen Linnekin, a food policy analyst for the libertarian think tank Reason Foundation, said that nutritional quality of the meals has improved “slightly” since the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But he said </span><a href="https://www.canr.msu.edu/foodsystems/uploads/files/cost-of-school-lunch.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two-thirds of the costs of the program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> go to overhead expenses, and with the variety of diets and allergies emerging, he said there is “no way” one school meal program can account for the needs of all children. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Origins of free school meals </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the build-up to World War I and World War II, a significant number of men who signed up for military service were disqualified due to nutritional deficiencies. This, combined with the economic pressures of the Great Depression, fueled the development of federally subsidized meal programs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Harry Truman signed the </span><a href="https://fns-prod.azureedge.us/sites/default/files/resource-files/NSLP-program-history.pdf#page=12" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National School Lunch Act in 1946,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> formally enshrining the National School Lunch Program. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The preamble is that it has a military function: the nation&#8217;s defense of the welfare of children and the protection of our agricultural system,” Weaver-Hightower said.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 1970s and 1980s, Republicans in Washington began denouncing inefficiencies in the meals program and pushing policies that dropped participation by millions of children. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn&#8217;t until 2010 that the idea of nutritious school meals for all children gained steam, and Congress ultimately passed the </span><a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/Child_Nutrition_Fact_Sheet_12_10_10.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act in 2010. </span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation enacted more rigorous nutrition standards to combat the rise of childhood obesity while boosting federal meal reimbursement rates. It also created the </span><a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/cn/community-eligibility-provision" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community Eligibility Provision, or CEP,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which allowed schools with more than 40% of students in means-tested federal nutrition programs to offer free meals to all students. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the CEP has improved outcomes for students in low-income areas, nutrition experts say the provision has not eliminated child food insecurity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What a lot of people don&#8217;t realize is that there are a lot of families that are not eligible for free school meals that are struggling,” said Juliana Cohen, director of the Center for Health Inclusion, Research and Practice at Merrimack College in Massachusetts. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Some things states and localities can do</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Congress may not act on universal school meals, policy minds said there are numerous alternatives for state and local governments to improve student food access. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cohen said</span><a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-education/2022/12/16/arizona-to-invest-6-75-million-to-expand-free-school-meals/69729309007/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Arizona just got rid of its reduced-price tier for school meals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2022, folding it into the free lunch tier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mozaffarian said he believes the best return on investment at the federal level is by expanding the Community Eligibility Provision so public schools can provide free meals to all students if they have 25% or more of their studentse on means-tested nutrition assistance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that </span><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/03/23/2023-05624/child-nutrition-programs-community-eligibility-provision-increasing-options-for-schools" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack proposed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this change earlier this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mozaffarian also suggested increasing the reimbursement rate for low-income schools, as well as improving federal school lunch nutrition standards and investing in scratch kitchens, where chefs make food from fresh ingredients, at low-income schools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Butcher suggested using the money for universal school meals to create </span><a href="https://www.edchoice.org/school-choice/types-of-school-choice/education-savings-account/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">education savings accounts,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which allow parents to “design” their child’s educational experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reilly noted that she hopes to see federal universal school meal legislation, because “everyone needs it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I do think it&#8217;s feasible in the next five or 10 years federally,” Mozaffarian said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tlaib said that we as a society have a “moral obligation” to ensure students do not worry about where their next meal comes from. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Something like this — something that our country can afford — we should do it,” Tlaib said. “There should be no hesitation.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now the state’s Health Insurance Reform Commission is weighing whether this coverage should be mandated for commercial insurers as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a speech during a ribbon-cutting ceremony for a new maternal hub at maternal care organization Urban Baby Beginnings in Petersburg on April 11, Gov. Glenn Youngkin said his administration is committed to improving maternal and child health outcomes in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fostering maternal and infant health is one of the true cornerstones of making Virginia the best place to live and work and raise a family,” Youngkin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to providing a wide array of resources to mothers, the maternal hub recognized Tuesday also offers state-certified doula services.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If our goal is to improve outcomes across the board across the state, we have to remember that there are other people that still have a coverage gap, but they may not necessarily be on the Medicaid product,” Spencer said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A doula is a non-medical professional who is trained to provide a broad range of support services during and after pregnancy. Several studies, including </span><a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/dfcd768f1caf6fabf3d281f762e8d068/ASPE-Doula-Issue-Brief-12-13-22.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published last December by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, indicate doulas positively impact maternal and infant health outcomes, especially for women of color.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people — “more than you would think,” Spencer said — have reached out to Urban Baby Beginnings asking if the organization accepts commercial insurance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has already begun considering whether the state should require commercial insurance to cover the service. This session, Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, and former Del. Nadarius Clark, D-Portsmouth, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1538" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">introduced</span></a> <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1273&amp;231+sum+SB1273" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bills </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">making coverage mandatory. </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/30-343/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under state law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, all bills mandating health insurance benefits must first be reviewed by the Virginia Health Insurance Reform Commission.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the body finds doula services should be a mandated benefit and legislators decide to resurrect the proposal, a bill requiring commercial insurers to offer coverage could be signed into law as early as next year, although HIRC has up to two years to complete its assessment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin spokesperson Macaulay Porter didn’t answer a question about whether the governor supports mandated doula service coverage for commercial insurance. However, she noted in an email that “under Governor Youngkin, Virginia is leading the nation in certified doulas. As of April 7, 2023, there are 107 doulas certified in Virginia and 56 who are enrolled in Medicaid [managed care organizations].” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Representatives from insurance company Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield who attended the Petersburg ribbon cutting did not respond to comment requests from the Mercury asking if they support mandated doula service coverage.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin, U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, and Virginia Sen. Joe Morrissey cut the ribbon on a new maternal hub in Petersburg on April 11, 2023. (Meghan McIntyre / Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, Medicaid enrollees now have doula service coverage for nine prenatal and postpartum visits after an </span><a href="https://www.dmas.virginia.gov/media/4080/va-spa-21-0013-approval.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">amendment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the state’s plan went into effect last year. Each visit can last 60 minutes, except for the initial prenatal visit, which can last up to 90 minutes, and the doula can be present at delivery. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The doulas have to be state-certified, meaning they have to complete training approved by the Virginia Board of Health, as a result of </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+HB687&amp;201+sum+HB687" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> passed in 2020. Certified doulas are eligible to apply for reimbursement of the costs of their services through the Department of Medical Assistance Services, which oversees Virginia’s Medicaid program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though commercial insurance coverage for doula services did not become mandatory this year, several other pieces of legislation aimed at providing additional support for mothers, infants and families were recently signed into law by Youngkin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those include </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB2290" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Del. Emily Brewer, R-Isle of Wight, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1314" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Sen. Siobhan Dunnavant, R- Henrico, requiring that in a case of child support, the responsibility for expenses incurred by a mother before and after the delivery of a child should be shared with the other parent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dunnavant, an OB-GYN, also passed bills </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1254" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">requiring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Virginia Maternal Mortality Review Team to report data on maternal mortality rates every year instead of every three years and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1531" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">directing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Secretary of Health and Human Resources to assess how Virginia could improve perinatal and infant health. Those proposals cleared both chambers unanimously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This bipartisan approach that it takes to get everything done in Richmond today brought solutions to help tackle the challenges facing expectant mothers and their families, especially those that are lacking the resources to find and get the care that they need,” said Youngkin.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin is recommending changes to a pending state </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1515" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would require a parent to approve whether or not their child can set up accounts on social media and other websites that process or sell data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The extra layer of permission would be on top of the requirements of the original bill, which would order pornography websites to more stringently verify whether a person is 18 before granting them access. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Under the governor&#8217;s amendments, the current protections for online privacy for children under the age of 13 would be extended to all children,” said Youngkin spokesperson Macaulay Porter in an email. “In addition, his amendments require parental approval for children who set up accounts on social media or other sites that process or sell data.&#8221; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Porter said parental approval would be needed for websites regulated under the new </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title59.1/chapter53/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (VCDPA), which went into effect this year and gives consumers the right to access personal data that has been collected by businesses and request that it be deleted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regulated businesses include those that process the personal data of at least 100,000 consumers in a calendar year or process the personal data of at least 25,000 consumers while deriving over 50% of their gross revenue from the sale of that data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Youngkin’s amendments, major websites and social media platforms such as Instagram and Twitter would need verifiable parental consent for children to set up an account. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Websites or entities would need to make “reasonable efforts” to obtain parental approval by either a signed consent form, government-issued identification or credit card or online payment system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sites would be required to provide the parent with the option to consent to the collection and use of their child’s personal data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recommendation would also extend online privacy protections allowed by the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act from those under the age of 13 to all children under the age of 18.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The governor is committed to empowering parents and protecting Virginia&#8217;s children from dangerous material on the internet, as well as ensuring that children&#8217;s data is not sold or used for targeted advertising or profiling purposes,” Porter said.</span></p>
<p>The Virginia Attorney General is responsible for enforcing the VCDPA. Businesses that violate these new restrictions have 30 days to come into compliance or face a $7,500 civil penalty per violation.</p>
<p>The General Assembly will convene in Richmond next week on April 12 to debate the governor’s amendments.</p>

(Graham Stokes / States Newsroom)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natalie Bell was thinking about a career in art after college when a welding class and a delivery of four pizzas changed her career trajectory. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was taking a delivery out to a construction site and I met an ironworker who I was taking the delivery to,” said Bell, who lives in Columbus, Ohio. “I asked him, I said, ‘Hey, are you looking for apprentices? I don&#8217;t want to do college anymore, but I&#8217;m a welder.’ He said, ‘Yeah,’ and he gave me the number to the ironworkers union.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bell, now 23, said she was worried at first about being accepted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I took my interview and I was so scared because I was like, ‘They&#8217;re not going to accept me. I&#8217;m a woman trying to do construction.’ I didn&#8217;t know how things worked at all,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bell, who entered the industry in 2019, said working in construction has its challenges but the money provides her with a decent lifestyle and good health insurance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I live very comfortably … I&#8217;m going to Iceland in July just because I can,” she said. “I can go do that. I can take a vacation every year. I don&#8217;t have to worry about medical bills because I have phenomenal insurance.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration is counting on more women like Bell seeing the value of jobs in the construction industry. Over the next decade, the administration wants to add a </span><a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/blog/2022/10/secretary-raimondo-calls-more-women-construction-industry-nabtu-tradeswomen-build" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">million more</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> women in construction jobs to aid in infrastructure projects across the country, including its effort to increase semiconductor manufacturing. The success of that effort will depend on the federal policies now being put in place and changes to an industry that&#8217;s not known for being welcoming to women. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Bureau of Labor Statistics data, 1.2 million women were employed in construction in 2020, and a University of Michigan </span><a href="https://poverty.umich.edu/2023/03/10/february-jobs-report-job-growth-shows-no-signs-of-slowing/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">analysis of the data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that women have gained jobs “at three times their share of the industry” since the beginning of the pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women were slowly but surely entering more male-dominated occupations before the pandemic, said Betsey Stevenson, an economist and professor of public policy and economics at the University of Michigan who did the analysis with Benny Docter, a senior data and policy analyst at the university. Women lost jobs in education and in the service industry during the pandemic, and as they returned to work many shifted to new occupations that reflect changing market conditions, according to their analysis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think that the important takeaway is that women can be an important source of labor for the construction industry,” Stevenson said in an email. “While child care is important for women, it is equally important to note that construction as an industry risks losing more male workers due to childcare conflicts. The childcare requirements in the CHIPS Act is there to help ensure a sufficient workforce is able to take on the work that is being funded.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CHIPS and Science Act, signed into law by President Joe Biden last year, aims to increase the country’s production of chips that are seen as essential for the military and for the economy because of their use in autos and all manner of electronics. The bill provides roughly $40 billion to build or expand plants, and already Intel is </span><a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2022/09/12/intel-breaks-ground-at-silicon-heartland-in-licking-county/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">building a megaproject</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> near Columbus, Ohio. But to receive federal subsidies the law requires companies to ensure that the workers they hire, including construction workers building the plants, </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/28/business/economy/chips-act-childcare.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have access to affordable and high-quality child care</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding affordable, quality child care is an issue for many parents, but it can be even more of a struggle for construction workers because daycares typically open after they are already supposed to be at work. That can be particularly hard on single parents.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grecia Palomar, a 29-year-old single mother of two in Little Canada, Minnesota, spent seven years hanging drywall at Reshetar Systems, a commercial drywall and carpentry business, before leaving to become a drywall instructor for Finishing Trades Institute of the Upper Midwest. Palomar said she was only able to manage when her children were younger because her employer allowed her to arrive later and work later. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Palomar said that even though she had grown up around job sites because her father worked in construction, she hadn’t considered it as a potential career until she moved back to Minnesota from Illinois with two young children to support. With one child in need of occupational and speech therapies,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Palomar said she</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">needed to make more than the $8 an hour she had earned as a preschool teacher. Her father suggested construction. She made $13 an hour when she started in the industry, and now makes $40 an hour.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Who is turning to construction careers?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bureau of Labor Statistics survey doesn’t explain the employment background of women newly entering construction, but several people working in the construction industry said they have seen women coming from what are considered service jobs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mary Ann Naylor, communications and marketing director for Oregon Tradeswomen, an apprenticeship-readiness program in Portland, said that the women seeking out the program often come from retail, hospitality, restaurants and child care, which often pays low wages and offers few benefits. She added that since the pandemic, she has seen more unemployed people and people leaving health care jobs to look into the skilled construction trades. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the advantages of construction that appeal to new workers are paid training and lack of student debt. Joy Merryman, a plumber and pipefitter who lives in Pickerington, Ohio, and works in Columbus, said she enjoys knowing that her labor will benefit the community, including her work on recreation centers. And she’s so happy with her career choice that she now does outreach — </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">planning </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">events, job fairs and school visits</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — for the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Central Ohio Women in the Trades.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_34789" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2400px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Joy-Merryman-.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-34789" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Joy-Merryman-.jpg" alt="" width="2400" height="1601" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Joy-Merryman-.jpg 2400w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Joy-Merryman--300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Joy-Merryman--1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Joy-Merryman--768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Joy-Merryman--1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Joy-Merryman--2048x1366.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2400px) 100vw, 2400px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Joy Merryman, a fabrication shop steward for U.A. Plumbers and Pipefitters Local 189, poses for a portrait after work, March 23, 2023, in Columbus, Ohio. (Graham Stokes / States Newsroom)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Burcaw, director of academic education and CEO of the Finishing Trades Institute of the Upper Midwest in Little Canada, Minnesota, said he’s seen workers come from similar employment backgrounds as Naylor mentioned. He said that there are also more opportunities for people starting a career in construction to possibly become project managers, estimators, entrepreneurs, educators or labor leaders than when he began doing this work 33 years ago.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Harassment still a problem</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there are still challenges with both recruitment and retainment of women in construction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women’s experiences often depend on the kind of support they have inside and outside the job, such as unions, women’s trade groups and foremen who push back against gender-based discrimination. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to child care needs, work sites can still be rife with sexual harassment. All of the women working construction interviewed by States Newsroom said they have faced some kind of sexual harassment on the job, whether it was inappropriate comments on their appearance, nonconsensual touching, or “jokes that go too far.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bell, the welder, said she has walked off jobs and once filed a complaint over sexual harassment, but has also had experiences where she has talked to foremen and had problems taken care of.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;ve been touched on the job site without consent. I&#8217;ve been yelled at in my face. I&#8217;ve been told I don&#8217;t belong there. I&#8217;ve been belittled, and I&#8217;m a minority so I&#8217;ve been made fun of or talked down to in that sense,” Palomar said. “But I had an awesome contractor who always had my back, and if I didn&#8217;t feel safe somewhere, I could just call them and they would be there for me, and I think that helped me get through that. Without their support and their trust and my union backing me up, I don&#8217;t think I would have been able to have the patience and the determination to stay there because it is overwhelming.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merryman, 37, who has worked in construction for 10 years in Ohio, said having supportive people around you helps, and that it’s easy to understand why women without that advantage end up leaving construction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think a big part of the issue with retaining people is you start to feel very alienated, you feel very alone and you question yourself,” she said. “Am I crazy for being grossed out by what that dude just said to me? Am I crazy for not wanting to have to listen to what he thinks about my body while I&#8217;m at work?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are educational efforts to make the workplace more welcoming to women, Burcaw said. The Finishing Trades Institute of the Upper Midwest is starting a program in the fall that advises men on how to be good allies to women in construction when they face gender-based harassment and discrimination.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addressing the federal government&#8217;s ambitious goal to add one million more women in construction jobs at a Tradeswomen Build Nations conference last fall, </span><a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/blog/2022/10/secretary-raimondo-calls-more-women-construction-industry-nabtu-tradeswomen-build" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> she had heard from women about the challenges they faced on sites. She then added, &#8220;Women don’t want to deal with the BS. They just want to do their jobs.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sharita Gruberg, vice president for economic justice at the National Partnership for Women and Families, said there will need to be sufficient monitoring and enforcement from the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to ensure that underrepresented workers aren’t being pushed out of jobs due to sexual harassment and discrimination. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Because of these other barriers, it is in all of our interests to make sure that these investments are supporting good jobs, safe jobs, because we&#8217;re just not going to have the workforce that we need to translate these investments into successful outcomes without also prioritizing equal opportunity enforcement and making sure that women are safe and in these roles,” Gruberg said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This month, the Department of Labor also announced it was launching an </span><a href="https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ofccp/ofccp20230314" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “to promote equal opportunity by federal contractors in the construction trades on large federally funded projects.” The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs is going to work with the General Services Administration and the Department of Transportation to make sure contractors and subcontractors receive no-cost help to improve recruitment and hiring practices to ensure more women and other underrepresented workers are able to join the construction industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The initiative is connected to the OFCCP’s Mega Construction Project Program that </span><a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ofccp/Mega-Construction-Project-Program" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rewards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> projects expected to last for one year and make a positive economic difference in communities. Gruberg said some of the construction work on semiconductor facilities and highways and transportation could qualify.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One exciting thing about the Mega projects are that there are 16 affirmative action steps that are part of these projects to really make sure that on the front end, companies are supported in how they can comply with the equal opportunity requirements of these investments,” Gruberg said. “So making sure that they are increasing representation of qualified workers from underrepresented groups in the construction trades, which includes women.”</span></p>

(Photo by Matt Cardy/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a good bet that an election-year bill to crack down on juvenile access to online pornography, which elected legislators of both parties <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/03/09/bill-to-require-additional-proof-of-age-for-porn-sites-in-virginia-heads-to-youngkins-desk/" target="_blank">passed overwhelmingly</a>, will become law in Virginia. Penalizing smut purveyors plays well on campaign brochures, ads and websites.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Political cynicism aside, however, there is meritorious intent behind</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+ful+SB1515ER" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Bill Stanley’s bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to hold internet publishers of material harmful to children, specifically that of a sexually explicit nature, legally liable if they do not secure documented proof of a user’s age before granting access. That proof would take the form of some sort of government-issued ID.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stanley, R-Franklin County, is correct in calling underage consumption of internet porn an epidemic. Exploitative, graphic and outright gross representations of human sexuality over the past 50 years has proliferated from magazines in sleazy bookstores to instant, on-demand access on smartphones ever-present in the pockets of teens.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/10/technology/porn-teens-online-report.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Common Sense Media released in January found that an alarming three-fourths of teens have viewed online porn by their 17th birthdays with the average first exposure at age 12. So pervasive is internet flesh-peddling that 41% of the minors surveyed reported viewing nudity or sex acts during the school day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Psychologists and organizations that treat addictive behaviors have long warned of the norm-shattering, mind-twisting, lifelong</span><a href="https://www.councilonrecovery.org/how-pornography-affects-the-teenage-brain-an-infographic/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">damage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from exposure to porn at such a vulnerable age. As much as many position the issue as a moral and a societal failure, it is also, unquestionably, a mental health crisis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it’s imminently reasonable to empower people to sue deep-pocketed online smut purveyors for the wreckage they cause in children’s lives, as Stanley’s bill does. The New York Times</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/10/technology/porn-teens-online-report.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that data gathered by XBIZ, an adult-content trade publication, shows  revenues for porn influencers and platforms rose from $5 billion in 2012 to at least $15 billion last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stanley’s legislation, now on Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s desk, would require submission of some form of government-issued identification to prove that users are 18 or older to access nothing-left-to-the-imagination sex sites.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That has caused alarm about entrusting highly sensitive personally identifying data to porn sites, many of which operate in the darkest alleyways of the web and in countries outside the reach of U.S. (and Virginia) law. There is legitimate fear that identity thieves will be the ultimate beneficiaries of porn age-verification measures such as Virginia’s and a similar one that took effect in Louisiana earlier this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to</span><a href="https://www.cyberghostvpn.com/en_US/privacyhub/us-porn-id-laws/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">PrivacyHub</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a newsletter published by privacy advocates, some websites can properly handle the data gathering, but not all would be so adept or scrupulous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“… The additional data handling still opens up new avenues for cybercriminals and government entities to abuse these systems for data harvesting. Using that personal information, cybercriminals can steal your identity or carry out a number of cyber-attacks, including sextortion and spear phishing,” said a PrivacyHub</span><a href="https://d.docs.live.net/2812febced1923cf/RQLewis%20LLC/THE%20READ/the%20additional%20data%20handling%20still%20opens%20up%20new%20avenues%20for%20cybercriminals%20and%20government%20entities%20to%20abuse%20these%20systems%20for%20data%20harvesting.%20Using%20that%20personal%20information,%20cybercriminals%20can%20steal%20your%20identity%20or%20carry%20out%20a%20number%20of%20cyber%20attacks,%20including%20sextortion%20and%20spear%20phishing." target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">article </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">earlier this month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or, you can just bypass your state’s restrictions using a virtual tool people in totalitarian regimes such as Russia, China and Iran use to evade their countries’ internet censors and access news from the West: virtual private networks. Developed to protect people from internet snoops, VPNs conceal a user’s IP address, meaning that a user in, say, Norfolk could appear to be logged in from Phoenix or Seattle or virtually any city.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s children are more tech savvy before they reach kindergarten than most of their parents. My 2-year-old grandson not long ago began playing with his family’s TV remote and, in just a few minutes, had purchased a Disney movie. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Workarounds to the Louisiana law are already being posted online. And there’s the age-old standby of stealing mom’s or dad’s ID to access porn sites.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outright proscriptions of various activities harmful to kids, though necessary, are largely ineffective.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We ban people younger than 21 from buying or consuming alcohol, yet underage drinking contributed to more than 3,900 deaths in that age group annually and cost the U.S. economy $24 billion in 2010,</span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/minimum-legal-drinking-age.htm" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">according to</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We ban vaping by those younger than 18, yet the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration last year reported that underage e-cigarette usage is</span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/teen-vaping-rates-rise-nearing-pre-pandemic-levels-cdc-reports-rcna50994" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">reaching pre-pandemic levels</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, when it was blamed for widespread juvenile nicotine addiction and serious lung ailments among high school and even middle school students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until the government and the economy give a break to parents or other children’s primary caregivers — hopelessly stretched thin and often working multiple jobs to meet rising expenses — there aren’t enough cops, courtrooms and lawyers in the world to ward off pornographers and the other wolves at their doors.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In August of 1975, I started my first teaching job at Martinsville Junior High School in Martinsville, Virginia. Nothing in my education classes, student teaching, or orientation to the school system communicated, “Look out for students who might have a gun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost fifty years later, school systems across Virginia and America are dealing with students bringing guns to school. Countless tragedies have occurred involving students and guns. No matter what we have learned from these tragedies, we still haven’t learned enough. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shockingly, that learning continued for schools and their communities when on January 6, 2023, a first grader at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News, Virginia brought a gun to school and shot his teacher. How does this continue to  happen? Are we as parents, school personnel, and citizens incapable of learning from our past tragedies? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guns aren’t new in schools. In the late 80s and early 90s, I served as an assistant principal at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a large high school in Henrico County, Virginia</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Usually a tip from a caring student alerted administrators that a student had a gun on school grounds. Luckily in those discoveries, we never had a shooting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">School systems have responded to this firearm crisis with assorted tactics. Conduct codes have been revised. New local, state, and federal laws have been implemented to curb firearms on school grounds. Comprehensive safety plans are in place. Budgets support the hiring of school resource officers. Often, budgets include metal detectors for scanning students and visitors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite these interventions, a student can still arrive at school in possession of a gun.  Why?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simple answer: America loves guns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/08/04/wide-differences-on-most-gun-policies-between-gun-owners-and-non-owners-but-also-some-agreement/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">June 2021 survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 10,606 American adults conducted by Pew Research Center found  four-in-ten  adults live in a household with a gun, including 30% who personally own one. That’s a lot of firearms. This doesn’t account for how many firearms are in a person’s ownership without documentation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compare those firearm ownership numbers to this data reported by the Annie E. Casey Foundation in August 2022: nearly 24 million children live in  single-parent families in the United States, or about one in every three kids across America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wonder if there is a correlation in gun ownership and the erosion of American families and the parenting skills within those families? No matter a single parent, a blended family, or a traditional family, parenting is tough, demanding work. How many of the school shooting tragedies and possession of a firearm on school grounds are linked to that erosion and the challenges of parenting? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students, parents, teachers, school system administrators and community leaders have a right to be concerned about school safety, but that safety goes beyond a student bringing a gun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Somewhere in a school today, it’s likely that at least one student will violently disrupt the learning environment. Disruptive confrontations can include  student to student, student to teacher, student to school administrator interactions. A fight involving multiple students can result in injuries to students and the school and security personnel who intervene.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter if a student is in possession of a firearm on school grounds or involved in violent disruptive behavior, both impact morale for non-disruptive students, parents, teachers and administrators. Additionally, that low morale factor seeps into the school’s community when these disruptions are reported in the news and social media. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do these disruptive outbursts push parents to withdraw their children from unstable schools and  switch to homeschooling programs or private schools?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same question must be asked when a teacher resigns; was that resignation grounded in fear of violent students and personal safety concerns?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meeting the educational needs of our children is challenging work. At this very moment, I think the tension, stress and pressure on teachers in our schools to deliver quality instruction while managing the classroom environment has become unbearable. Despite their valiant efforts, respect and support for teachers are  absent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do we address these challenges?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acknowledging the erosion of our families is an important step. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, in my career in public education, I worked with many supportive single parents. Sadly, that isn’t always the case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vicious generational cycles linked to poverty, inadequate housing, low employment, poor physical and mental health, insufficient nutrition and lack of safety are at the heart of this family and community instability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In acknowledging these shortcomings, we must ask this question: are our current education templates and essential community services at local, state, and federal levels effective in meeting the needs of students and their families? If these templates are ineffective, we must have the courage to do our homework and initiate overdue changes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most critical is realizing that our divides, differences, incivilities and inadequate listening skills will only continue to hurt children. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pat Conroy, the late American novelist and former educator, wrote: “I want you to know how swift time is. There is nothing as swift. A heartbeat, an eye blink, this is the way life is. It is the only great surprise in life.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mr. Conroy is correct; time isn’t on our side.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are overdue to acknowledge our public education challenges, but schools cannot be the sole repairer for all that ails our country.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diligent collaboration from every segment of our communities will be needed to improve our schools. If we continue  to align ourselves in denial, distrust, and division, we will likely destroy the schools that helped to build America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That isn’t acceptable.</span></p>

However, some say the legislation raises data privacy concerns while doing little to keep minors out of pornographic websites.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1515" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, verifying the age of a person trying to access these sites would go a step further than simply typing in a date of birth, said patron Sen. Bill Stanley, R-Franklin, during a House subcommittee last month. Websites, he said, would have to implement more advanced methods of their choosing to verify age, such as requiring users to submit copies of government-issued identification, biometric scans or use other forms of commercial age verification software. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we’ve had is the unfettered wild, wild west ability of these pornography sites, such as YouPorn and Pornhub, to have someone who accesses their site without restriction to age,” Stanley said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation aims to address the “epidemic” of childhood exposure to pornography, Stanley said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most children see adult material online by the age of 12, with 15% seeing it by age 10 or younger, according to a 2022 </span><a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/research/report/2022-teens-and-pornography-final-web.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Common Sense Media, a nonprofit media company focused on kids and families.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stanley said that under the bill, a civil cause of action, or a lawsuit, could be brought on behalf of a minor who suffered damages from access to pornographic websites that didn’t use age verification measures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview this week Stanley said he crafted the legislation after talking with parents and doing research, which led him to a similar </span><a href="https://legis.la.gov/legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=1289498" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statute</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that went into effect in Louisiana this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Porn sites were “easily able” to implement age verification techniques in Louisiana so they wouldn’t be exposed to civil liability, Stanley said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A wide range of research has shown that childhood pornography exposure is a form of sexual </span><a href="https://journalofpsychiatryreform.com/2021/12/07/early-exposure-to-pornography-a-form-of-sexual-trauma/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">trauma</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that can lead to lifelong </span><a href="https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7727&amp;context=etd" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">consequences</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> such as trouble forming healthy relationships, depression and body image disorders. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Everybody agrees that we want to address pornography directed at children,” said then-Sen. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, during a Feb. 7 Senate committee meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While acknowledging the harmful impacts pornography exposure can have on children, some say the legislation wouldn’t effectively address these problems and raises concerns of data privacy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Age Verification Providers Association, a global nonprofit trade body representing organizations that provide age verification services, assured Staney that any data collected would not be shared with other parties, he said in an interview. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m pretty confident that it will not put users&#8217; personal information at risk,” Stanley said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, this data can be vulnerable to security breaches, wrote the Free Speech Coalition, a national trade association for the adult industry, in a </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vTbJms6ECIEF54TJdWtb8rT8lqGmzPBKDiBeh_uGFXw/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the House Courts of Justice Committee. The group said it has already received reports from Louisiana of potential identity theft as a result of scammers creating fake adult sites to solicit identification documents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one spoke in opposition when the bill was debated during the session, but some people took to social media to express their concerns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I get the idea of stopping kids from accessing it, but I’m not super comfortable with having to give PornHub my ID,” </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Virginia/comments/11epesc/bill_requiring_id_to_access_porn_sites/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a Reddit user last week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The coalition also wrote that social media websites containing pornographic content wouldn’t be regulated under the bill because it would only apply to sites where more than one-third of the content meets the definition of “material harmful to minors.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2022 </span><a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/research/report/2022-teens-and-pornography-final-web.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">from Common Sense Media also found that 18% of teens aged 13 to 17 who have seen adult content accidentally did so through social media. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MindGeek, the parent company of Pornhub, told the Mercury in an email, “It is vital that any age verification measures implemented preserve user privacy and are easy to use. All regulation must be enforced equitably and effectively across all platforms offering adult material.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent Massachusetts Institute of Technology </span><a href="https://wip.mitpress.mit.edu/algorithmic-rights-and-protections-for-children" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found 41% of children aged 11 to 14 use a virtual private network, an encryption method that allows easy access to pornography sites regardless of what state they live in. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We fear that consumers will at best simply evade the measures, or at worst fall prey to criminals eager to rob and extort them,” wrote the Free Speech Coalition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stanley acknowledged children are more savvy than their parents when it comes to use of the internet, but called the bill a necessary “tool in the toolbox” for parents who can&#8217;t monitor their children all the time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. John Edwards, D-Roanoke, one of two lawmakers who voted against the bill, raised concerns about its constitutionality. He pointed to a similar </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2000/08/10/judge-blocks-va-law-on-internet-porn/c60289db-d04d-4ebf-818e-d6a6a6613f93/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that passed in 2000 but was later struck down by a federal judge in Virginia who ruled that it violated the First Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We should not be passing bills that are unconstitutional,” said Edwards on the Senate floor early last month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Stanley said the harm pornography has on children is too significant to do nothing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think the compelling state interest is the protection of our children,” Stanley said during the House subcommittee meeting. “And I would rather try and have a Supreme Court tell me I was wrong than not to try at all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill now heads to Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s desk for his signature. </span></p>

																						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="800" height="534" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Getty_food_pantry.jpeg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="" style="margin-bottom: 10px;" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Getty_food_pantry.jpeg 800w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Getty_food_pantry-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Getty_food_pantry-768x513.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p style="font-size:12px;">(Maskot / Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forty million people in the U.S. are having difficulty affording household expenses, and a little more than 25 million people say they sometimes or often do not have enough to eat, </span><a href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2023/demo/hhp/hhp54.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the U.S. Census Bureau’s most recent Household Pulse survey data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey is designed to collect data on household experiences during the pandemic as well as its economic recovery. The U.S. Census Bureau, working with other federal agencies to produce the data, started the surveys in April 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most recent survey, which was taken Feb. 1 to Feb. 13, also showed that 16% of those surveyed said it was very likely that they would be evicted in the next two months and 23.7% said it was somewhat likely. That’s up slightly from December, when 14.3% said it was very likely they’d be evicted in that time frame and 28% said it was somewhat likely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data reflects that Americans are continuing to struggle with inflation, a struggle made worse for some by the disappearance of pandemic relief across the country. Although inflation is moderating, it’s still high. The Consumer Price Index, </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">released</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Feb, 14, showed that the price of meats, poultry, fish and eggs rose 0.7% over the month and eggs rose 8.5% over the same time period. The Federal Reserve continues to raise rates in an effort to bring down inflation, which it </span><a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20230201a.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “remains elevated.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, much of the pandemic relief funds have been allocated, with 87% of American Rescue Plan Act funds being appropriated already by December. The </span><a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2023/02/23/rural-hospitals-gird-for-unwinding-of-pandemic-medicaid-coverage/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unwinding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of pandemic Medicaid coverage will likely leave millions of people without coverage. Early in the pandemic, Congress provided a temporary increase in benefits for recipients of SNAP, the federal nutrition assistance program, but that ends March 1. When that happens, the average person will get about $90 less in SNAP benefits a month, </span><a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/temporary-pandemic-snap-benefits-will-end-in-remaining-35-states-in-march#:~:text=The%20Supplemental%20Nutrition%20Assistance%20Program's,end%20after%20February%202023%20issuances." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">SNAP emergency benefits expiring soon</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As SNAP’s emergency benefits go away, the effects may eventually show up in Pulse data, said Lauren Bauer, a fellow in economic studies at Brookings Institution and associate director of the Hamilton Project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current Pulse data shows that since expanded COVID-19 unemployment benefits ended in the fall of 2021, fewer people are relying on unemployment insurance to buy food. When asked how they had paid for food in the past seven days, 13 million said they used SNAP benefits compared to 1.8 million who said they used unemployment insurance benefits. That’s up from 12.7 million who relied on SNAP in January and 12.1 million in December. In the survey from Feb. 17 to March 1, 2021 — before expanded unemployment benefits ended — 11.9 million people used unemployment benefits to buy food and 10.8 million used SNAP benefits.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What part of the safety net is still providing families with a material amount of income given all of the stuff that has gone away? And right now SNAP is the main program that&#8217;s doing that. Everything else is coming out of income, borrowing, spending down savings, etc.,” Bauer explained. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Families of four at 200% of the poverty line are an example of who has the most to lose when emergency SNAP benefits go away, Bauer said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s families who normally, via the formula, would lose 30 cents for every dollar as you tick higher and higher up the income distribution who are going to see the biggest hit. Those are typically low-income workers,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to these benefits drying up, Republican state lawmakers are targeting food stamps in a number of ways, such as adding </span><a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2023/02/08/house-republicans-explore-new-way-to-punish-low-income-aging-kansans-seeking-food/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stricter work requirements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2023/01/26/lawmakers-advance-proposed-snap-changes-but-say-theyll-drop-plans-to-restrict-some-foods/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">limiting the food that qualifies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In Congress, House Republicans are using this year’s farm bill to </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2023/02/16/food-stamps-gop-proposed-cuts/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">restart a discussion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on SNAP’s work requirements and waivers that exempt some recipients from certain SNAP rules. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Economic pain in the South</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Southern states showed higher rates of financial stress in surveys collected in February, January and December. Pulse data shows that in February, </span><a href="https://www.census.gov/data-tools/demo/hhp/#/?measures=FOODSCARCE&amp;periodSelector=54" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">food scarcity rates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were highest in Kentucky, Mississippi and Louisiana, and in January, they were highest in Mississippi, Louisiana and Florida. Mississippi, Kentucky and Texas were the highest in December. Difficulty paying for </span><a href="https://www.census.gov/data-tools/demo/hhp/#/?measures=EXPENSE&amp;periodSelector=54" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">usual household expenses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was highest in Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana in February, followed by West Virginia and Kentucky, and in January, people in Louisiana, Mississippi and Florida said they struggled most with these expenses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In general, a lot of these measures of benefit generosity are lower in the South of the U.S., and it would make sense that at the expiration of the federal expansion, they&#8217;re reverting to a less generous state,” said Alex Bell, a postdoctoral scholar at the University of California’s California Policy Lab. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Leachman, senior vice president for state fiscal policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said a lack of Medicaid expansion in many Southern states and stricter eligibility requirements for benefits may help to explain some of the data. With more pandemic aid ending, Americans all over the country will feel the pain of losing those resources, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The other provisions that were put in place during the height of the pandemic made a huge difference in terms of child poverty and other forms of hardship that people are experiencing,” he said. “About 90% of [state ARPA funds] has already been allocated, and it&#8217;s made a huge difference in the lives of people who were particularly harmed, but with it winding down, even though the job market is relatively strong, the effects of the pandemic are lingering in all sorts of ways.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bills will now go before the Senate Health Insurance Reform Commission, which </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/30-343/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">is charged with studying mandated health insurance benefits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Nadarius Clark, D-Portsmouth, and Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, described their </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1538" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">identical</span></a> <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1273&amp;231+sum+SB1273" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a way to help reduce maternal mortality and alleviate some of the disparities in the care received by women of color and white women during and after pregnancy. </span><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(22)00261-9/fulltext" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have shown doulas — nonmedical professionals who are trained to provide a broad range of support services during pregnancy, birth and the postpartum period — significantly improve outcomes for both parent and child, especially in low-income and minority populations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, the General Assembly passed </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+HB687&amp;201+sum+HB687" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> creating a state certification process for doulas, meaning they have to complete training approved by the Virginia Board of Health. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clark and Boysko’s legislation this year would have required private health plans that include obstetrical services to cover at least eight doula visits for pregnant women during and after pregnancy, as well as support during labor and delivery. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The United States has one of the highest rates of maternal death compared to other developed  countries, Boysko told the Senate Committee on Commerce and Labor last week. Black women are nearly three times more likely than non-Hispanic white women to die from complications related to pregnancy and childbirth, according to the </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/maternal-mortality/2020/maternal-mortality-rates-2020.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are a plethora of data and studies that have shown tremendous benefits and cost savings from providing doula care,” said Galina Varchena, policy director for Birth in Color RVA, an organization focused on providing maternal care for women of color that also worked on Clark’s bill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clark said in an interview that there were complications during his own delivery that he still suffers from. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We know there’s still implicit biases and different things that happen in our prenatal care system and our health care system,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, following study by the Health Insurance Reform Commission, the General Assembly passed </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+HB826&amp;201+sum+HB826" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> making state-certified doula care available for Medicaid users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia currently has 87 state-certified doulas, and around 100 Medicaid members have received doula services so far, said Rebecca Dooley, communications director for the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services, in an email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Douglas Gray from the Virginia Association of Health Plans told a House Commerce and Energy subcommittee last week that “typically in the commercial world we have licensed people rather than certified people, so there needs to be a conversation about how this would work.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The State Corporation Commission and the Virginia Bureau of Insurance will do a preliminary analysis of the costs and benefits of private insurance coverage for doulas before the Health Insurance Reform Commission holds public hearings on the proposal, said Dave Wesolowski, chief of staff for HIRC Chair Sen. George Barker, D-Alexandria, in an email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By “opening up this door to allow private insurance to cover doula care,” Clark said, Virginia can “start giving the people that haven’t had a voice to finally have care.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of replacing the constitutional ban with pro-equality language declaring marriage a fundamental right — as Democrats have tried to do — the Republican critics said they’d be more supportive of simply erasing the ban, without going further into affirmatively pro-LGBTQ territory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HJ460" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GOP-sponsored version</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of that proposal will be on the table for the 2023 General Assembly because of Del. Tim Anderson, R-Virginia Beach, who filed a so-called “clean repeal” plan late last month that only strikes the ban from the state constitution without adding anything else. Because it’s a constitutional amendment, the proposal has to pass the General Assembly two years in a row, then win final approval from voters in a 2024 election referendum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The conservative principle here is less government, more freedom,” Anderson said in an interview last week. “When you&#8217;re talking about gay marriage, there’s pretty much nothing more conservative than supporting the fact that two people should be treated equally.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Adam Ebbin, D-Alexandria, and Del. Mark Sickles, D-Fairfax, both gay men who have worked on LGBTQ equality legislation for years, have said they’re planning to file the same proposal as Anderson. That indicates it could succeed on a bipartisan basis, unless House GOP leadership overrules Anderson and blocks it. That’s not an uncommon maneuver in committees, where just a few strategically placed lawmakers can block legislation that has broad support and would likely pass if put to a full vote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson said he was curious about why his party did just that when it </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/02/08/va-republicans-block-effort-to-scrap-2006-gay-marriage-ban/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rejected the Democratic proposal in February</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a move that drew emotional criticism from gay lawmakers who said they were deeply offended by conservatives’ claims it could lead to legalized polygamy or incestuous marriage, both of which are already illegal under state law. It’s more difficult to raise those arguments against an amendment that, on its own, does nothing but get rid of a marriage restriction already deemed invalid and unconstitutional.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stronger, Democratic-sponsored amendment cleared the state Senate last year with four Republican votes, leaving little doubt about the pro-marriage equality stance of a chamber where Democrats had a 21-19 majority last year. That majority could grow to 22 seats for the upcoming session, depending on the outcome of a Jan. 10 special election in Virginia Beach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson said the version he’s filed is the only one that can get through the House of Delegates, where Republicans are expected to again have a 52-48 majority.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My bill is going to get through. And there&#8217;s going to be a time when Democrats are going to have to vote, should we take the same-sex marriage prohibition out of the constitution, yes or no,” Anderson said. “And if they say no, they&#8217;re going to have some explaining to do to the LGBTQ community. I think that they want it their way, but they&#8217;re not going to get it their way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokesman for House Speaker Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, did not respond when asked if Gilbert supports Anderson’s proposal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Democrats agree that the simplified approach is the correct one given the realities of divided government in Richmond, but they’re pursuing other ways to protect marriage equality in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We tried to get affirming language last year and that didn’t work,” said Ebbin. “So it would still be a step forward to remove the prohibition from the constitution.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ebbin said he’ll also file accompanying legislation to put anti-discrimination language in the state code to ensure Virginia will keep issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples even if the U.S. Supreme Court were to overturn the 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges ruling requiring all states to recognize same-sex marriage. Ebbin said he’d still like to see the constitutional amendment pass, even if the associated bill fails.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Minority Leader Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, said he was inclined to vote against a proposal he saw as a “half-measure.” But he said he’d ultimately defer to LGBTQ lawmakers and advocates on the question. He also praised Anderson, who came to the legislature in January with a reputation as a hard-right figure, for being “one of the few Republicans that will speak with me and talk with me and have conversations.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He was Saul until he got blinded by the light, which was the last election,” said Scott in a reference to a biblical figure who underwent a sudden conversion after a dramatic event. “He’s seen that some of those positions that they have taken are too extreme not only for the country, but definitely for Virginia.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginians approved the same-sex marriage ban 16 years ago by a vote of 57.1% to 42.9%. Given the </span><a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/393197/same-sex-marriage-support-inches-new-high.aspx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">widespread acceptance of marriage equality today</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, advocates believe a repeal measure would pass overwhelmingly if the General Assembly puts the issue on the ballot again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That push was seen as largely symbolic until the Supreme Court’s seismic abortion ruling this year, in which Justice Clarence Thomas suggested the Obergefell decision needs the same type of reassessment that led to the overturning of the Roe v. Wade decision that previously made abortion access a constitutional right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Virginia Democrats pushed to get rid of the state’s same-sex marriage ban earlier this year, the Virginia Catholic Conference raised the possibility the ban could be reactivated in the future due to changes at the federal level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That now appears less likely as Congress </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/11/30/same-sex-marriage-protected-under-bill-passed-by-u-s-senate-with-gop-support/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prepares to pass legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> strengthening federal protections for same-sex marriage with the support of some Republicans who have indicated they’re no longer interested in fighting against marriage equality. If the federal legislation passes as expected, Virginia would have to recognize same-sex marriage licenses from other states, regardless of whether the state does or doesn’t issue such licenses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s unclear if Ebbin’s bill to ensure the state continues to issue those licenses will win Republican support. Even if that measure fails, getting rid of the constitutional ban would effectively move Virginia’s stance on same-sex marriage from hostile to neutral if the Supreme Court were to strike down Obergefell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By strengthening same-sex marriage at the federal level, Anderson said, the pending Respect for Marriage Act reduces the need for Virginia to act immediately to create new state-level protections. Anderson said he personally takes no issue with marriage equality from a government perspective, but he said he doesn’t believe religious institutions should also be compelled to accept it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The problem is that the religious right thinks that the Republican Party is supposed to be talking about morality,” Anderson said. “We&#8217;ve been somewhat hijacked in that context if a Republican comes up and says, ‘Hey you should be against gay marriage because it’s against God&#8217;s law.’ That&#8217;s not the role of the Republican Party or the role of government. That’s the role of the church.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sickles, the House Democrat who sponsored the marriage equality amendment Republicans blocked this year, said he expects Democrats to support the clean repeal plan because it would mean ridding the state of “ugly” constitutional language. He said he doesn’t particularly care if Republicans like Anderson can claim some of “the glory.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I welcome it,” Sickles said. “I hope there’s bipartisan support. And I hope that he can figure out a way to get it out of our Privileges and Elections Committee. It’s a hopeful sign.”</span></p>

<p>“I think we&#8217;re very close,” Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins said Tuesday of efforts to get at least 10 GOP senators on board with the House-passed legislation. Sixty senators in the evenly divided Senate would be needed to advance the bill past a filibuster and to a final vote.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;ve had a number of conversations with my colleagues. And this bill is very straightforward,” Collins continued. “All it does is put in to federal law the protection for the million same-sex marriages that are out there today.”</p>
<p>Wisconsin Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin, tasked by her party with getting the necessary GOP votes, said the bill is gaining more support each day and that she doesn’t expect it would be held over until closer to the election so that Democrats could make a political point.</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t want this to be politicized,” Baldwin said. “I think that we simply have to codify Obergefell because there&#8217;s such uncertainty since Roe v. Wade was overturned about most people&#8217;s marriages. But we&#8217;ll do it when we have the votes and the time.”</p>
<p>Both of Virginia&#8217;s Democratic senators have said they support codifying same-sex marriage protections. Sen. Mark Warner <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkWarner/status/1549438928700157953" target="_blank">tweeted on July 19</a>, &#8220;If the Senate votes to codify gay marriage, I will vote yes.&#8221; On July 22, <a href="https://twitter.com/timkaine/status/1550503394690859008" target="_blank">Sen. Tim Kaine tweeted</a>, &#8220;After Justice (Clarence) Thomas called for the Supreme Court to reconsider marriage equality, Congress must enshrine marriage equality as the law of the land. We cannot go backwards.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Thomas opinion</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling overturning the nationwide right to an abortion last month included a separate opinion from Thomas in which he wrote the justices “should reconsider all of this Court’s substantive due process precedents” that applied the same legal reasoning that was used in Roe v. Wade.</p>
<p>Thomas specified three cases he believes are ripe to be overturned, including Griswold v. Connecticut, which recognized a married couple’s right to use contraception; Lawrence v. Texas, which legalized adult private consensual sexual relationships; and Obergefell v. Hodges, which legalized same-sex marriage.</p>
<p>The Thomas opinion raised alarm bells with women’s rights and LGBTQ groups over how the current 6-3 conservative-dominated Supreme Court might undo other rights and led Democratic lawmakers to bring up legislation that would ensure those rights.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Murkowski absent due to COVID-19 </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Baldwin said on Tuesday the timing of the Senate vote on the marriage equality bill might depend less on when there’s enough bipartisan support and more on the number of Democrats and GOP supporters who are absent due to COVID-19.</p>
<p>Both West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin III and Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski announced Monday they’d be isolating after testing positive. Murkowski, who <a href="https://alaskabeacon.com/2022/07/22/murkowski-favors-congressional-vote-on-same-sex-marriage-protections-while-sullivan-is-noncommittal/" target="_blank">told CNN</a> she is in favor of the legislation, has <a href="https://www.hrc.org/press-releases/senator-lisa-murkowski-endorses-marriage-equality" target="_blank">long supported</a> marriage equality.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said Tuesday the bill remains a priority, though he didn&#8217;t say if he&#8217;d bring it up before the chamber breaks for its August recess at the end of next week.</p>
<p>&#8220;The bottom line is that we care very much about the marriage equality act,&#8221; Schumer said. &#8220;We are working real hard to get 10 Republican senators. Between that and the illnesses, we&#8217;re not there yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>So far, most Senate Republicans are remaining quiet about how they’d vote on the bill.</p>
<p>North Carolina Republican Sen. Richard Burr said Tuesday that he hasn’t decided how he’ll actually vote, even though he said last week that he “was leaning in opposition to” the bill.</p>
<p>When asked what more he needed to know before making a decision, Burr responded: “I don’t even know if it’s coming up. Is that too much to ask?”</p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said Tuesday he didn’t want to make “an observation” on the bill until it’s actually brought to the floor.</p>
<p>Montana Republican Sen. Steve Daines came out forcefully against the bill this week, saying he believes “marriage is between a man and a woman.”</p>
<p>“I’m opposed to this bill and believe it’s another attempt by Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats to distract the American people from the inflation crisis, energy crisis and the southern border crisis they’ve created,” Daines said in a <a href="https://www.daines.senate.gov/news/press-releases/daines-democrats-same-sex-marriage-bill-is-just-a-distraction-from-the-crises-caused-by-biden-the-left" target="_blank">statement</a>.</p>
<p>The U.S. House vote on the bill was broadly bipartisan, with 267 members, including 47 Republicans, voting to <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-bipartisan-vote-passes-bill-protecting-right-same-sex-marriage" target="_blank">approve</a> the measure last week. <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/07/19/u-s-house-on-bipartisan-vote-passes-bill-protecting-right-to-same-sex-marriage/" target="_blank">All of Virginia&#8217;s Republican members voted against the bill</a>.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">States and marriages</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8404?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22H.R.+8404%22%2C%22H.R.%22%2C%228404%22%5D%7D&amp;s=3&amp;r=1" target="_blank">legislation</a>, known as the Respect for Marriage Act, would repeal a 1996 federal law known as the Defense of Marriage Act that defined marriage as between one man and one woman.</p>
<p>The bill would also ensure that if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns the 1967 Loving v. Virginia opinion that legalized interracial marriages or the Obergefell v. Hodges ruling from 2015 that legalized same-sex marriages, states would have to recognize out-of-state marriages from states where same-sex or interracial marriages remained legal.</p>
<p>But the bill wouldn’t ensure same-sex and interracial couples have the exact same rights that they have under the two Supreme Court rulings.</p>
<p>David Stacy, government affairs director at the Human Rights Campaign, said while “Congress can&#8217;t technically codify Obergefell without a constitutional amendment,” the marriage equality bill would do three important things.</p>
<p>It would repeal the Defense of Marriage Act, set a “state of celebration” standard for the federal government to recognize same-sex marriages for federal benefits like Social Security, and try to get states to recognize marriages from other states.</p>
<p>The state recognition issue, however, might be somewhat tricky.</p>
<p>The &#8220;full faith and credit&#8221; clause of the Constitution, Stacy said, requires states to recognize judicial decisions from other states — but there is a public policy exception.</p>
<p>For example, if a state doesn’t allow people to legally marry until 18, a couple can travel to another state where they can legally marry at 16. But after couples return to their home state, the state government can choose not to recognize that marriage under the public policy exception, Stacy said.</p>
<p>“Obviously, the courts would still have to determine whether a state has a valid public policy exception reason for this,” Stacy said. “But [the bill] would provide a mechanism to get an answer to those questions quickly. And we think ultimately the courts would determine that those should be recognized. But obviously it’s not an ironclad guarantee.”</p>
<p>Same-sex couples, he said, would once again be required to travel to get married if the Supreme Court overturns Obergefell and their home state chooses not to allow those marriages.</p>
<p>“You would have to travel, which is obviously suboptimal,” Stacy. “And then, of course, those states would not recognize those marriages, presumably for state benefits. So there&#8217;s lots of obvious benefits that flow from state law, and rights and responsibilities that flow from state law. And so we&#8217;d be back to a patchwork of protections.”</p>
<p>Adoptions could also become problematic, he noted.</p>
<p>“It would be a really complicated legal landscape, and it would depend on the state and what that looks like,” Stacy said. “And that&#8217;s one of the reasons why marriage equality is really so important.”</p>

<p>The 267-157 bipartisan vote stemmed from concerns that the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision last month to <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-overturns-right-abortion-landmark-decision-16" target="_blank">overturn</a> the constitutional right to an abortion may not be the only fundamental right the conservative justices could undo. A total of 47 Republicans voted for the bill.</p>
<p>Virginia&#8217;s House delegation split on the vote by party line, with all Democrats voting in favor of the legislation and all Republicans against it.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8404?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22H.R.+8404%22%2C%22H.R.%22%2C%228404%22%5D%7D&amp;s=3&amp;r=1" target="_blank">Respect for Marriage Act</a>, sponsored by New York Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler, would require state governments to recognize marriages from other states regardless of the sex, race, ethnicity or national origin of the two people in the marriage.</p>
<p>Rep. Steve Cohen, a Tennessee Democrat, urged members to approve the bill, saying during floor debate “it simply says each state will recognize other states’ marriages and not deny a person the right to marry based on race, gender, sexual orientation.”</p>
<p>“The only reason to be against it is because you really don&#8217;t want to go on record as being in favor of those rights,” Cohen continued.</p>
<p>Ohio GOP Rep. Jim Jordan spoke against the legislation, saying that it was “unnecessary and wrong” for the House to take up the bill.</p>
<p>The Democrats’ decision to bring the measure to the floor, he said, was designed for political messaging heading into the November midterm elections.</p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court, Jordan contended, will not overturn any other precedents the way it overturned two cases that kept abortion legal for nearly half a century.</p>
<p>Jordan then read from the majority opinion by Associate Justice Samuel Alito that said: “To ensure that our decision is not misunderstood or mischaracterized, we emphasize that our decision concerns the constitutional right to abortion and no other right. Nothing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion.”</p>
<p>Democrats who took to the floor during debate said the bill is necessary given Associate Justice Clarence Thomas’ <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf" target="_blank">opinion</a> in the abortion case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#8217;s Health Organization.</p>
<p>Thomas wrote that the court should reconsider three cases that stem from the same due process clause under the 14th Amendment that previously included the right to an abortion.</p>
<p>Those cases — Griswold v. Connecticut, Obergefell v. Hodges and Lawrence v. Texas — allowed people to determine if and when to use contraceptives, legalized same-sex marriages and prevented the government from criminalizing adult private consensual sexual relationships.</p>
<p>“The Supreme Court’s recent departure from judicial precedent and Justice Thomas’s concurrence in <em>Dobbs </em>­has left many families worried about their future,” said Virginia Rep. Donald McEachin, D-Richmond, in a statement following the vote.<strong> </strong>“This far-right Supreme Court threatens constitutional rights that millions of Americans currently enjoy. We saw it happen with reproductive health care, and now Justice Thomas has called into question access to contraception, marriage equality, and the legality of same-sex relations. We will not stand idly by why these rights are undermined.”</p>
<p>Virginia Rep. Bob Good, R-Campbell, a self-described &#8220;biblical conservative&#8221; who swept former Rep. Denver Riggleman from his seat in 2018 after the latter officiated a same-sex marriage, earlier in the day tweeted a quote from the Bible about &#8220;God&#8217;s definition of marriage.&#8221;</p>

<p>LGBTQ advocates have <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/same-sex-marriage-and-contraception-risk-after-abortion-ruling-us-house-panel-told" target="_blank">pushed</a> for Congress to enshrine the right to marry, and reproductive rights supporters have encouraged lawmakers to guarantee that women can continue deciding whether to use birth control without government interference.</p>
<p>All are concerned the conservative Supreme Court may overturn those fundamental rights in the future based on the Thomas opinion.</p>
<p>The U.S. House is expected to vote on a <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8373?s=1&amp;r=1" target="_blank">bill</a> Thursday that would ensure women have the ability to choose if and how they use contraception.</p>
<p>That legislation, from North Carolina Democratic Rep. Kathy Manning, has 139 co-sponsors in the House, none of whom are Republicans.</p>
<p>It’s unclear if the marriage bill the House passed Tuesday can garner the GOP support needed to clear the U.S. Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster.</p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, declined to say Tuesday afternoon during a press conference if he&#8217;d vote for the marriage equality bill or whip his members against supporting it.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m going to delay announcing anything on that issue until we see what the majority leader wants to put on the floor,&#8221; McConnell said.</p>

I saw that up close <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/columns/article_c2a2e94b-03fb-53d0-abaf-257a0a1032f2.html" target="_blank">when I rode along with sheriff’s deputies and police officers hunting down scofflaws</a>.</p>
<p>The debtors were frequently tens of thousands of dollars behind in payments.</p>
<p>Stakeouts, admonishments by deputies, and handcuffs were common that day in 2011. Jail was a possibility, but judges were often loath to leave dads behind bars if it prevented them from paying up. That would harm their offspring even more.</p>
<p>I was reminded about that reporting as Virginia begins sorting out what a post-Roe v. Wade society will become. Last month’s anti-abortion, anti-privacy, anti-women <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/06/24/u-s-supreme-court-overturns-right-to-abortion-in-landmark-decision/" target="_blank">ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a half-century</a>-old constitutional right.</p>
<p>Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/06/24/youngkin-vows-to-protect-life-as-supreme-court-overturns-right-to-abortion/" target="_blank">wants to ban most abortions after 15 weeks</a> of pregnancy.  Democrats and abortion rights supporters pledged to fight back. The guv told conservative activists last week he wants to go even further if <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/06/29/youngkin-abortion-life-conception/?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=675cbb27-4742-4343-958a-85e445ffd8af" target="_blank">Republicans hold onto the House of Delegates and flip the state Senate</a> in the 2023 elections.</p>
<p>Republicans now hold a slight majority in the House, 52-48. Democrats have an even narrower edge in the Senate, 21-19; the Republican lieutenant governor, Winsome Earle-Sears, would break tie votes in that chamber.</p>
<p>Fewer abortions will mean more children. Those infants will face a challenging future if both parents aren’t committed to their well-being and growth.</p>
<p>Youngkin, while trumpeting the chance to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/06/29/youngkin-abortion-life-conception/" target="_blank">“happily and gleefully” sign any bill</a> “in order to protect life,” must prove he also cares about children <em>long out of the womb</em> — when the stresses and costs of raising them become all too real for parents.</p>
<p>This issue will become even more critical if more women are forced to bring their pregnancies to term.</p>
<p>Here’s why this is important: <a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/ocse/2021_infographic_national.pdf" target="_blank">Some 20 percent of children nationwide</a> receive child support, federal officials say. Child support, when paid, nearly doubles the average income of recipients below the poverty line.</p>
<p>I spent several days interviewing a state legislator, Youngkin administration officials and a family and child welfare attorney with the Virginia Poverty Law Center about the commonwealth’s child support system. I also reviewed recent news articles.</p>
<p>Among the most notable points is the whopping amount of arrears that noncustodial parents in Virginia owe – and the fact that annual arrearages have gone essentially unchanged since at least 2013. The cumulative total was $3.15 billion at the end of most recent federal fiscal year; the amount has accumulated for decades.</p>
<p>Some caveats:</p>
<p>Not all the outstanding child support owed is due to the custodial parent. The state collects some funding in return for public money it pays for programs, said Valerie L’Herrou, staff attorney with the Virginia Poverty Law Center. They include foster care and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program.</p>
<p>Officials put the debt owed the state at 13 percent, and the portion owed to custodial parents at 87 percent.</p>
<p>The $3 billion-plus isn’t an annual amount, of course. The unpaid support was $239 million for the 2021 federal fiscal year. The state’s Division of Child Support Enforcement collected more than $650 million in child support that year. (The older that arrears get, <a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/css/ocsedatablog/2021/09/most-arrears-were-submitted-ocse-more-five-years-ago" target="_blank">the feds say</a>, the less likely officials will collect them.)</p>
<p>Sen. Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, sits on an advisory group that reviews child support guidelines. Among the challenges in collecting debts, he told me, is the lack of money and jobs for some parents.</p>
<p>“You can’t get blood from a stone,” Surovell said. “Typically, yes, they’re poor.”</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean every debtor is without fault. Attorney L’Herrou, by email, relayed anecdotes of fathers who changed jobs frequently or got paid “under the table,” making it difficult to track their wages.</p>
<p>“Also, many fathers act violently or retributively when they receive a summons for child support,” she added. “So many women avoid filing, or avoid seeking enforcement, for fear of the impact on themselves and/or children.”</p>
<p>When I rode with the Chesapeake deputies a decade ago, they told me one guy owed nearly $185,000 for at least six children. Some of his children had become adults by then.</p>
<p>The state assists parents to lower barriers to employment and promote “positive engagement with their family and children,” Barbara Lacina, director of the state’s Division of Child Support Enforcement, said through a spokeswoman.</p>
<p>Those services include helping with jobs, education, training and housing.</p>
<p>The agency also participates in a program to “provide more cost-effective enforcement alternatives to incarceration, maximize the potential for consistent child support payments by breaking the cycle of noncompliance, reduce jail overcrowding, and promote the involvement of noncustodial parents in their children’s lives,” Lacina said.</p>
<p>If employment and income aren’t readily available from the noncustodial parent, officials can find other ways to get support payments. This includes taking state and federal refunds, seeking orders to withdraw money from bank accounts and taking parts of lottery winnings.</p>
<p>Still, the amount of uncollected child support is virtually the same every year, officials said — within a range of $240 million to $250 million over a recent five-year period.</p>
<p>What will the governor do about the issue? “The governor&#8217;s health and human resources secretary is currently evaluating the best approaches to collect child support and strengthen families,” said Macaulay Porter, Youngkin’s spokeswoman.</p>
<p>I’m curious to see if something that hasn’t been done previously will be implemented. Maybe all the best practices have already been tried. We know millions of dollars, every year, aren’t getting to the children and families who need the money.</p>
<p>Surovell told me the division clearly needs more resources: “Most people who know would agree DCSE is not funded sufficiently.”</p>
<p>The state needs to make this a greater priority before it changes abortion laws.</p>
<p>Because if you want to reduce abortion, you also should bolster families — including our system of child support.</p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce/ For the Virginia Mercury)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday authorized emergency use of two COVID-19 vaccines for children under 5, moving the country one step closer to having shots for all age groups.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-moderna-and-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccines-children" target="_blank">The decision</a> leaves just one hurdle, a recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, before parents can begin getting babies and toddlers vaccinated against the virus. That CDC decision is expected this weekend.</p>
<p>“As we have seen with older age groups, we expect that the vaccines for younger children will provide protection from the most severe outcomes of COVID-19, such as hospitalization and death,” FDA Commissioner Robert M. Califf said in a <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-moderna-and-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccines-children" target="_blank">statement</a>.</p>
<p>“Those trusted with the care of children can have confidence in the safety and effectiveness of these COVID-19 vaccines and can be assured that the agency was thorough in its evaluation of the data.”</p>
<p>The FDA’s decision to grant emergency use requests for a two-dose Moderna shot and a three-dose Pfizer vaccine came two days after its outside panel of advisers <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/fda-outside-advisers-recommend-pfizer-moderna-covid-vaccines-kids-under-5" target="_blank">unanimously voted</a> on Wednesday to recommend use of the two vaccines.</p>
<p>White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator Ashish Jha said earlier this month that the federal government would begin shipping the vaccines to states as soon as the FDA granted the emergency use authorization.</p>
<p>He expects shots can begin next week as long as the CDC issues its recommendation over the weekend.</p>
<p>The Biden administration made 10 million doses of vaccine for kids under 5 available for states during a two-week pre-ordering period that closed Tuesday.</p>
<p>States, tribes, territories, pharmacies and other federal partners ordered 2.5 million Pfizer doses, about 50 percent of those available, and 1.3 million Moderna doses, about 25 percent, according to a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
<p>“Jurisdictions will have an opportunity to order additional doses if and when the vaccines are authorized by FDA and recommended by CDC,” an HHS spokesperson said in a statement</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — A fourth grader who survived the Uvalde, Texas, school shooting where 19 students and two teachers were murdered told lawmakers Wednesday that she is afraid to go back to school.</p>
<p>“I don’t want it to happen again,” 11-year-old Miah Cerrillo said in a pre-recorded video shown to members of the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Reform, as Congress debates whether to enact new gun control legislation.</p>
<p>Miah told lawmakers that after her friend sitting next to her was shot and killed by the gunman, she covered herself in her friend&#8217;s blood and pretended to be dead. She moved toward her teacher, who had been killed by the gunman, grabbed her phone and called 911.</p>
<p>Miah was one of several survivors of horrific mass shootings in New York and Texas who testified about the toll gun violence has taken on their lives. They urged Congress to pass legislation to ban assault weapons and high capacity magazines.</p>
<p>“It is my hope that all my colleagues will listen with an open heart as gun violence survivors and loved ones recount one of the darkest days of their lives,” Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, D-N.Y., the chairwoman of the committee, said in her opening statement.</p>
<p>Kimberly Rubio’s daughter, Lexi, was murdered in the Uvalde school shooting. She told House members that the day of the shooting, Lexi was set to receive a good citizen award as well as be recognized for earning straight As.</p>
<p>To celebrate, Kimberly Rubio told her daughter they would get ice cream after the awards ceremony.</p>
<p>“We told her we loved her, and we would pick her up after school,” she said.</p>
<p>Kimberly Rubio detailed to lawmakers the chaos of trying to find her daughter when the news broke of a shooting at Robb Elementary.</p>
<p>While she and her husband were able to reunite with their 8-year-old son, they searched the local hospital for Lexi.</p>
<p>Still unable to find her daughter, and without a car, Kimberly Rubio took her sandals off — shoes that she planned to wear at the award ceremony — and ran barefoot for a mile to Robb Elementary. She was informed by school district officials that Lexi was among the 19 students killed.</p>
<p>“Somewhere out there, a mom is hearing our testimony and thinking to herself ‘I can’t even imagine their pain,’ not knowing that our reality will one day be hers, unless we act now,” she said.</p>
<p>Zeneta Everhart, the survivor of a mass shooting on May 14 by a White supremacist in Buffalo, New York, told lawmakers that she does not feel safe. <a href="https://www.wkbw.com/news/local-news/buffalo-strong/family-of-buffalo-mass-shooting-survivor-collecting-books-on-racism-and-black-history-to-distribute-to-community" target="_blank">Everhart was at a supermarket in a predominantly Black neighborhood with her son</a>, Zaire Goodman, who was shot in the neck.</p>
<p>“To the lawmakers who feel that we do not need stricter gun laws, let me paint a picture for you: My son Zaire has a hole in the right side of his neck, two on his back and another on his leg caused by an exploding bullet from an AR-15,” she said.</p>
<p>Everhart said there is no reason for someone to have access to an assault weapon like the one used in the shooting and urged lawmakers to pass legislation to ban the firearms.</p>
<p>“If after hearing from me and the other people here today does not move you to act on gun laws, then I invite you to my home to clean Zaire’s wounds so that you may see up close the damage that has been caused to my son and my community,” she said.</p>

    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">School ‘hardening’ argument</h4>

	
<p>Republicans on the committee criticized Democrats for politicizing a tragedy and argued the schools need to be “hardened,” meaning that they have too many doors and need tighter security.</p>
<p>The ranking member, Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., said Democrats were pushing “a radical left-wing agenda” by trying to pass gun control legislation.</p>
<p>Republican Reps. Andrew Clyde of Georgia and Clay Higgins of Louisiana said gun legislation proposed by Democrats would infringe on “law-abiding” Second Amendment users.</p>
<p>But Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., said that firearm injuries are now the <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2201761" target="_blank">leading cause of death</a> for children and adolescents.</p>
<p>“Will we continue to accept the slaughter of innocents, including innocent children, as acceptable collateral damage for loyalty to a completely bogus and distorted misreading of the Second Amendment?” Raskin asked.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">House debates gun control</h4>

	
<p>On Wednesday night, the House passed 223-204 a package of eight bills relating to gun control.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-urges-assault-weapons-ban-us-house-democrats-advance-gun-control-bills" target="_blank">The </a>“Protect Our Kids Act” raises the age of purchasing semiautomatic rifles from 18 to 21, creates new requirements for storing guns in a home with children, prevents gun trafficking, requires all firearms to be traceable and closes the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4168" target="_blank">loophole on bump stocks</a>, devices that increase the rate of fire of semiautomatic weapons, among other things.</p>
<p>Rep. Madeleine Dean, a Pennsylvania Democrat, challenged Republican arguments that regulating guns would violate Second Amendment rights.</p>
<p>“Do these tragedies from guns in the hands of bad actors sound like the well regulated militia explicitly mentioned in the Second Amendment? Of course not. It’s outrageous,” Dean said.</p>
<p>The package of measures is unlikely to advance to a final vote in the Senate, where Democrats are still trying to strike a deal on passable gun control legislation. In an evenly divided Senate, they will need 10 Republicans on board.</p>
<p>The House is also scheduled on Thursday to vote on a bill by Georgia Democrat Lucy McBath known as a <a href="https://mcbath.house.gov/2021/10/legislation-led-by-mcbath-to-enact-federal-red-flag-laws-passes-house-committee" target="_blank">“red flag” bill</a>.</p>
<p>Red flag laws allow the courts or law enforcement to temporarily remove a firearm from an individual who is adjudged to pose a threat to themselves or others.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Senate negotiations extend</h4>

	
<p>Negotiations continued among senators over gun control legislation that could pass there. Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, the Democrats’ top negotiator, said Wednesday morning that he wasn’t going to settle for a bill “that isn&#8217;t substantial, that isn&#8217;t really truly meaningful.”</p>
<p>“The entire nation is expecting us to put our politics aside and get something done: Both to save lives, but also to give peace of mind to this country that we understand the trauma this nation is going through right now,” he said.</p>
<p>Murphy said he wanted his colleagues watching the House panel’s testimony to try to “understand the reality of what it&#8217;s like when you lose a loved one to gun violence” as well as “the trauma that these victims go through and how wide-ranging the trauma is.”</p>
<p>“These communities never recovered from a mass shooting,” Murphy said.</p>
<p>Several Republican senators have said that raising the age from 18 to 21 to buy an assault weapon should be considered. Those senators include Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Joni Ernst of Iowa, according to Capitol Hill pool reports.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said Wednesday morning on the floor that gun safety negotiators &#8220;deserve the space they need to produce meaningful results.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope my colleagues continue to make progress toward an effective agreement — hopefully by the end of the week,” Schumer said.</p>
<p>Urging GOP lawmakers to support a possible agreement between Democratic and Republican negotiators, Schumer said, “the sooner we act, the greater chance we have of preventing another senseless mass shooting in America.”</p>
<p>Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, his party’s top negotiator on gun safety, said Wednesday afternoon that he’s optimistic Congress will be able to enact legislation that can save lives, noting lawmakers are making “steady progress.”</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m optimistic that we could pass a bill in the Senate, it can pass the House, and it will get a signature by President Biden,” Cornyn said. “It will become the law of the land.”</p>
<p>Lawmakers, he said, are discussing ways to encourage states to upload juvenile records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, the database that gun dealers are supposed to check before selling a firearm.</p>
<p>“This is not about creating new restrictions on law-abiding citizens, it’s about ensuring the system we already have in place works as intended,” he said.</p>
<p>Cornyn said he believes the ongoing mass shootings throughout the country represent a “failure” of the mental health system and that the legislation could also address that, though he didn’t get into specifics.</p>
<p>“I think there’s a consensus that criminals and people experiencing severe mental health crises shouldn’t have access to guns,” Cornyn said, noting that’s the goal of the NICS system.</p>
<p>The Texas lawmaker said he is optimistic because of the progress lawmakers have made so far that Congress will be able to enact legislation that can save lives.</p>
<p>“I sense a feeling of urgency and a desire actually to get things done,&#8221; Cornyn said. &#8220;Around here if you know people have the will, there is a way. And I believe there is a collective bipartisan will.”</p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce/ For the Virginia Mercury)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The Biden administration is preparing to ship out to the states millions of COVID-19 vaccines for children under 5 in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator Ashish Jha said Thursday that if the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorizes emergency use of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines for young kids after its June 15 meeting, the federal government would immediately begin shipping the specialty doses.</p>
<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would need to recommend emergency use of the vaccines before health care providers could begin administering them, but Jha said he expects vaccinations for children under 5 could begin as soon as June 21.</p>
<p>Jha said he wasn’t making the announcement as a pre-judgment of what the FDA or CDC would decide on the vaccines, but to detail how the Biden administration has been planning for eventual approval.</p>
<p>“We have asked states to distribute the initial tranche of doses to their highest priority sites, including those serving the highest-risk children and hardest-to-reach areas,” Jha said. “We’ve also asked them to prioritize sites that can handle large volumes, such as children’s hospitals.”</p>
<p>Jha said state governments can begin ordering from the initial 10 million doses on Friday, June 3.</p>
<p>While some vaccinations for children under 5 would begin the week of June 21, Jha said, it would take “some time to ramp up the program and for vaccinations to be more widely available.”</p>
<p>The “good news,” Jha said, is that the federal government has plenty of doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines for young kids.</p>
<p>Approval of vaccines for young children would come more than seven months after the FDA authorized emergency use of a Pfizer vaccine for children between 5 and 11 years old.</p>
<p>Pfizer originally <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-ok-sought-two-dose-covid-vaccine-kids-under-5" target="_blank">asked</a> the federal government in early February to begin the approval process for a two-dose COVID-19 vaccine for children under 5. A third shot was added to its pediatric trial after data indicated a two-shot regimen failed to produce a strong immune response in children age 2-4, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/06/01/coronavirus-vaccine-young-children-pfizer/" target="_blank">The Washington Post reported</a>.</p>
<p>The very next day, then-White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Jeffrey Zients <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/white-house-plans-speedy-delivery-states-covid-vaccine-littlest-kids" target="_blank">detailed</a> how the federal government would ship out vaccines for young kids, saying it would likely take several days or a week before the first shots could begin.</p>
<p>About a week later, the White House <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/covid-vaccine-kids-under-5-delayed-until-least-april" target="_blank">announced</a> that the earliest a COVID-19 vaccine for young kids would be available was in April, giving ​​Pfizer additional time to gather information on a three-dose regimen.</p>
<p>The approval process for the Moderna vaccine for young kids has also had several starts and stops along the way.</p>
<p>At the moment, the Biden administration seems optimistic that it could begin shipping doses of both vaccines for young kids within three weeks, as long as the FDA authorizes the vaccines and the CDC issues a recommendation.</p>
<p>Once that happens, Jha said, ​​the White House expects “that within weeks every parent who wants their child to get vaccinated will be able to get an appointment.”</p>

(Robert Zullo/ Virginia Mercury(</p><p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. government should consider creating a stockpile of infant formula to avoid the possibility of future shortages, the head of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration told a Senate committee last week.</p>
<p>Commissioner Robert Califf said during his third hearing on Capitol Hill about the months-long shortage that his agency and lawmakers really need to consider such an initiative after the current crisis is relieved.</p>
<p>“The big question that, I think, is going to have to be addressed is, do we create a stockpile as a backup in case something doesn’t work in the future,” Califf said.</p>
<p>In about two months, Califf said, he expects infant formula manufacturers will begin to produce a surplus. At that time, the federal government will need to decide if it wants to “maintain that surplus as a government activity for the foreseeable future.”</p>
<p>He and lawmakers did not discuss whether a stockpile would need congressional approval.</p>
<p>The current infant formula shortage began in mid-February after Abbott Laboratories issued a recall of products produced at its Sturgis, Michigan, facility.</p>
<p>In the five months leading up to the plant shutdown, the FDA received a whistleblower report about unsanitary conditions at the facility, four infants became ill with Cronobacter infections, with at least two of them dying, and an FDA inspection of the facility in late January found several violations.</p>
<p>Among the issues at the Abbott infant formula facility were</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Standing water.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Cracks in key equipment that could have allowed bacterial contamination to persist.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Leaks in the roof.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Previous citations for inadequate hand-washing.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Bacteria growing from multiple sites.</li>
<li aria-level="1"> “A disappointing lack of attention to the culture of safety.”</li>
</ul>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">No evidence of malfeasance</h4>

	
<p>Califf <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/fda-chief-cites-egregiously-unsanitary-conditions-michigan-baby-formula-plant" target="_blank">testified</a> before a U.S. House committee on Wednesday that he’s so far found no evidence of intentional delay or malfeasance within the FDA, despite the slow response.</p>
<p>He repeated that statement Thursday while testifying before the U.S. Senate Health Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.</p>
<p>Washington Democratic Sen. Patty Murray, chair of the panel, said the fact she needed to hold the hearing, the fact store shelves continue to be empty and the fact that babies throughout the country are going hungry represented a “massive, unacceptable failure.”</p>
<p>Ranking member Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican, said it was time for Congress to “hold the FDA accountable.”</p>
<p>“This is a sad story about the FDA’s unwillingness and inability to do their job,” Burr said.</p>
<p>Califf testified that “there are systemic issues at FDA and in our interactions with the industry and in our authorities that need to be corrected.”</p>
<p>He then said the FDA has a plan to address those issues, but when pressed by Murray about sharing the plan with Congress, Califf said he couldn’t give her an exact date for when FDA could share the plan since it’s not written down.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Supply chains</h4>

	
<p>In addition to suggesting U.S. lawmakers and the FDA consider creating an infant formula stockpile, Califf said his agency needs better insight into the different infant formula manufacturers’ supply chains.</p>
<p>At the moment, Califf testified, infant formula manufacturers are not required to tell the FDA when they have an impending shortage, or when they find contamination in a sample at their facility that has not yet been shipped out. The companies are also not mandated to have a back-up plan, or a contingency plan to avoid a shortage if the plant goes offline.</p>
<p>“​​If that plant had been hit by a tornado, instead of a quality problem, the same issue would be in front of us now,” Califf said.</p>
<p>If the “FDA had insight into the supply chains and how they fit together,” Califf said, “the likelihood we would need the stockpile would be quite low.”</p>
<p>“Between stockpiling and having a resilient system we should be able to prevent this from happening again,” Califf said.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400">In early 2021, rural communities like Pittsylvania County were struggling.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">A full year of the pandemic had taken its toll on us — some schools were still closed, health care costs were still going up, many people couldn’t return to work, and even more were struggling to make ends meet. The American Rescue Plan Act, which was passed in March 2021, provided a lifeline to families in communities like ours. Thanks to ARPA, rural communities across Virginia survived the worst of the pandemic.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">Most importantly, ARPA put money directly in the hands of millions of rural families through the expanded Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit. Children living in rural counties are more likely than children in big cities and suburban areas to have benefited from last year&#8217;s expansion of the child tax credit. Sadly, the expanded Child Tax Credit expired in January and child poverty has dramatically increased. Congress can and should act today to make that lifeline permanent.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">ARPA also made health care more affordable for all families, while ensuring that rural hospitals and health care providers could keep their doors open to serve their communities. Thanks to the American Rescue Plan Act, families had access to expanded premium tax credits that help make insurance more affordable through the Affordable Care Act. They expire at the end of the year. Again, Congress can and should act to make those expanded credits permanent.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">The health care benefits of ARPA don’t end with families. Health care providers in rural communities like Pittsylvania County were especially hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic too, but these hospitals and clinics have long struggled to stay afloat. In fact, <a href="https://track.bgov.jmsend.com/z.z?l=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGV3dHJ1c3RzLm9yZy9lbi9yZXNlYXJjaC1hbmQtYW5hbHlzaXMvYmxvZ3Mvc3RhdGVsaW5lLzIwMjAvMDcvMjIvcnVyYWwtaG9zcGl0YWxzLWhhbmctb24tYXMtcGFuZGVtaWMtcmVhY2hlcy1zbWFsbGVyLWNvbW11bml0aWVz&amp;j=347928389&amp;e=1&amp;p=1&amp;t=h&amp;&amp;h=334f10b347158549751c1cfb03952fc4" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://track.bgov.jmsend.com/z.z?l%3DaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGV3dHJ1c3RzLm9yZy9lbi9yZXNlYXJjaC1hbmQtYW5hbHlzaXMvYmxvZ3Mvc3RhdGVsaW5lLzIwMjAvMDcvMjIvcnVyYWwtaG9zcGl0YWxzLWhhbmctb24tYXMtcGFuZGVtaWMtcmVhY2hlcy1zbWFsbGVyLWNvbW11bml0aWVz%26j%3D347928389%26e%3D1%26p%3D1%26t%3Dh%26%26h%3D334f10b347158549751c1cfb03952fc4&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1652818138743000&amp;usg=AOvVaw03BXZO6iE60VrrNPn3E2bQ" target="_blank">47 percent</a> of rural providers were operating in the red before the COVID-19 pandemic. The problem isn’t new, but it was definitely made worse by the health crisis.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">Rural providers play an important role in our small towns and rural communities. To help mitigate some of these pandemic-related financial losses, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services began distributing <a href="https://track.bgov.jmsend.com/z.z?l=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaGhzLmdvdi9hYm91dC9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMTEvMjMvYmlkZW4tYWRtaW4tYmVnaW5zLWRpc3RyaWJ1dGluZy1hcnAtcHJmLXN1cHBvcnQtdG8tcHJvdmlkZXJzLWltcGFjdGVkLWJ5LXBhbmRlbWljLmh0bWw%3d&amp;j=347928389&amp;e=1&amp;p=1&amp;t=h&amp;&amp;h=66a8162f4ba0c444a3c12460fecff65a" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://track.bgov.jmsend.com/z.z?l%3DaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaGhzLmdvdi9hYm91dC9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMTEvMjMvYmlkZW4tYWRtaW4tYmVnaW5zLWRpc3RyaWJ1dGluZy1hcnAtcHJmLXN1cHBvcnQtdG8tcHJvdmlkZXJzLWltcGFjdGVkLWJ5LXBhbmRlbWljLmh0bWw%253d%26j%3D347928389%26e%3D1%26p%3D1%26t%3Dh%26%26h%3D66a8162f4ba0c444a3c12460fecff65a&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1652818138743000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3lpdP5s0YQaylTXSCZ0tC7" target="_blank">$7.5 billion in ARPA funds</a> to ensure <a href="https://track.bgov.jmsend.com/z.z?l=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaHJzYS5nb3YvcHJvdmlkZXItcmVsaWVmL2RhdGEvdGFyZ2V0ZWQtZGlzdHJpYnV0aW9uL2FycC1ydXJhbA%3d%3d&amp;j=347928389&amp;e=1&amp;p=1&amp;t=h&amp;&amp;h=6ef8a654eb2e32ec12ef78aecc12192a" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://track.bgov.jmsend.com/z.z?l%3DaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaHJzYS5nb3YvcHJvdmlkZXItcmVsaWVmL2RhdGEvdGFyZ2V0ZWQtZGlzdHJpYnV0aW9uL2FycC1ydXJhbA%253d%253d%26j%3D347928389%26e%3D1%26p%3D1%26t%3Dh%26%26h%3D6ef8a654eb2e32ec12ef78aecc12192a&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1652818138743000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1dgl50oryS6Y4a4elFP9_l" target="_blank">rural hospitals and clinics</a> could keep their doors open, address workforce challenges, and make up for the lost revenues and increased expenses caused by the pandemic.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">We should also celebrate the expansion of broadband made possible through this legislation. Many states used their ARPA funding to <a href="https://track.bgov.jmsend.com/z.z?l=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGV3dHJ1c3RzLm9yZy9lbi9yZXNlYXJjaC1hbmQtYW5hbHlzaXMvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjAyMS8xMi8wNi9ob3ctc3RhdGVzLWFyZS11c2luZy1wYW5kZW1pYy1yZWxpZWYtZnVuZHMtdG8tYm9vc3QtYnJvYWRiYW5kLWFjY2Vzcw%3d%3d&amp;j=347928389&amp;e=1&amp;p=1&amp;t=h&amp;&amp;h=e370a6c7984c16ca11e74549d8bcf263" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://track.bgov.jmsend.com/z.z?l%3DaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGV3dHJ1c3RzLm9yZy9lbi9yZXNlYXJjaC1hbmQtYW5hbHlzaXMvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjAyMS8xMi8wNi9ob3ctc3RhdGVzLWFyZS11c2luZy1wYW5kZW1pYy1yZWxpZWYtZnVuZHMtdG8tYm9vc3QtYnJvYWRiYW5kLWFjY2Vzcw%253d%253d%26j%3D347928389%26e%3D1%26p%3D1%26t%3Dh%26%26h%3De370a6c7984c16ca11e74549d8bcf263&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1652818138743000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0VXc3NZ4gANpT5UcxhhZqJ" target="_blank">address the longstanding digital divide</a>. Several states have also prioritized increasing broadband connections for low-income households through line extensions, which expand connectivity to unserved streets and neighborhoods, as well as other affordability measures. Virginia made this a top priority even before ARPA was signed into law, but the additional funding makes the work faster, meaning more people in more communities across the state will have access to high-speed internet years earlier than expected.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">ARPA also provided mortgage and rental assistance for rural families, saved small businesses from closing, helped keep schools open, and funded important infrastructure projects in rural communities.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">Pittsylvania County Community Action, our local Community Action Agency, also received COVID-19 funds to help citizens during this time. PCCA received funds from a Community Development Block Grant to assist families with utility and rental payments, and from the Older American Act to help seniors meet their daily nutritional needs, and from Health and Human Services to PCCA&#8217;s Head Start program to ensure that children continued to be ready to transfer into elementary schools. Despite the shutdown of most businesses, PCCA continued to meet the needs of the citizens as staff could work from home through updated infrastructure.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">Given all of the ways the American Rescue Plan Act has made a positive difference in our lives, we should take a minute to ask our elected officials to make these programs permanent. Kids should not be slipping back into poverty. Seniors should not have to choose between rent and medicine. Families should not have to worry about the cost of childcare so that parents can go back to work. Our elected officials, including Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, can make this a reality.</p>

<p><em>A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/10/us/baby-formula-shortage.html" target="_blank">baby formula shortage</a> has added to the woes of American parents already confronted with the pressures of <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/03/isolation-becoming-new-parent-during-pandemic/618244/" target="_blank">raising an infant during a pandemic</a> in a country <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/marybethferrante/2019/06/21/unicef-study-confirms-the-u-s-ranks-last-for-family-friendly-policies/?sh=176ff24133ba" target="_blank">ranked low for family-friendly policies</a>.</em></p>

<h2>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">1. Why there is a shortage of formula now?</h4>

	</h2>
<p>There are really two factors that have driven the current shortage. First, we have the <a href="https://theconversation.com/4-reasons-americans-are-still-seeing-empty-shelves-and-long-waits-with-christmas-just-around-the-corner-168635" target="_blank">supply chain problem</a>, which has affected all manner of goods since the onset of the pandemic. It eased off a little, but then at the beginning of 2022 it <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/supply-chain-crisis-data/" target="_blank">became worse</a>.</p>
<div class="slot clear" data-id="17">
<div class="promo">
<div class="MuiBoxroot-0-1-95 MuiBoxroot-0-1-96 makeStylesbox-0-1-94">
<div>Then in February a <a href="https://wwmt.com/news/local/baby-formula-shortage-crisis-intensifies-as-sturgis-plant-remains-shut-down" target="_blank">major baby formula manufacturing plant in U.S. went down</a>. The FDA <a href="https://www.nbcboston.com/news/national-international/fda-to-allow-closed-abbott-plant-to-release-baby-formula-supply-amid-shortage/2717440/" target="_blank">shut down Abbott Nutrition’s factory</a> in Michigan. The closure came after Abbott’s nationwide <a href="https://www.similacrecall.com/us/en/home.html" target="_blank">recall of multiple brands of formula</a>, including routine Similac cow milk-based formulas such as Similac Advance and several specialty formulas for allergic babies, including Similac Alimentum and and Similac EleCare.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Closing the factory had to be done amid an <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/outbreaks-foodborne-illness/fda-investigation-cronobacter-infections-powdered-infant-formula-february-2022" target="_blank">investigation into bacterial infections</a> in connection to powdered formula produced at the plant, and the deaths of at least two babies. The problem is there just isn’t much redundancy in U.S. infant formula production. In other words, there aren’t enough other factories to pick up the slack when one goes down. The Michigan plant is the largest producer in the country, so when it goes down, it put added strain on the entire U.S. formula distribution system, especially for certain formulas for babies with high-risk allergic diseases and metabolic disorders.</p>
<p>Over the last couple of weeks the shortage has gotten worse. I can’t say for sure why this has happened. But I suspect there has been some hoarding going on as parents get anxious. Stores can limit the amount of formula that people can buy, but that doesn’t stop people going online to buy more.</p>
<p>On top of that, the shortage has gained wide publicity in newspapers, on TV and in political speeches. All that publicity feeds into public sense that the system is failing, prompting more panic buying and hoarding.</p>
<h2>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">2. Who is the shortage affecting?</h4>

	</h2>
<p>A majority of parents will feed babies with formula at some point to meet their nutritional needs, especially older infants. At birth and in days immediately after, around 80% of babies receive <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/data/reportcard.htm" target="_blank">all their nutrition through breast milk</a>. But by the age of 6 months, the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/data/reportcard.htm" target="_blank">majority of babies get at least some formula</a>. The proportion of year-old babies receiving formula is even higher. This is largely the result of social dynamics and pressures &#8211; mothers going back to work after giving birth, but not receiving sufficient support to produce and store sufficient amounts of breast milk.</p>
<p>But the shortage will affect some parents more than others. Not surprisingly, the most affected parents are those on the lowest income. The federal food program for poorer women, infants and children, <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/wic" target="_blank">called WIC</a>, provides formula for a majority of babies in low-income families. But costs have gone up and formula has become scarcer.</p>
<p>I’m hearing of some families driving two hours to find stores selling formula. Obviously that will be harder to do for poorer families as there are costs involved. Likewise, more affluent parents may be able to buy more expensive, so-called elite brand formulas.</p>
<p>The other thing to note is that the shortage is affecting both regular infant formula, and <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-takes-important-steps-improve-supply-infant-and-specialty-formula-products" target="_blank">specialized versions</a>. Regular or standard formula is the type most families are familiar with, and around 95% of formula-fed babies get the standard type. Specialized formula is for babies with unusual requirements, due to allergies, damaged intestines or special nutritional needs. Before the Michigan factory closed, it made most of the specialized infant formula used in the U.S. So it is an absolute crisis for families needing that type of formula.</p>
<h2>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">3. What are the potential consequences of the shortage?</h4>

	</h2>
<p>In the first six months, babies should <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/faq/index.htm" target="_blank">only have breast milk or formula</a> – anything else fed to them will be nutritionally incomplete. So there is a risk that a shortage will mean that babies will not be getting the nutrition they need to develop. That could lead to a range of health problems affecting their physical growth and brain development.</p>
<p>Then there are concerns that parents may be using unsafe alternatives, like watering down their baby’s formula. People have been known to try and make their own by mixing powdered milk or vegan milk with vitamins. Not only are these alternatives <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7033a4.htm" target="_blank">not nutritionally complete</a>, they may not be entirely sterile.</p>
<p>After the age of six months, things get a little better once the infant is able to start eating solid food. But even then, formula or breast milk remains the primary source of nutrition. So there may still be a risk of nutritional deficiencies, such as iron deficiencies.</p>
<h2>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">4. Are there any viable alternatives?</h4>

	</h2>
<p>Over the age of six months of age, for only reasonably short periods of time, <a href="https://healthychildren.org/English/tips-tools/ask-the-pediatrician/Pages/Are-there-shortages-of-infant-formula-due-to-COVID-19.aspx#.Ynr6sYw9zEQ.twitter" target="_blank">parents can feed infants whole cow milk</a> and look into iron supplements.</p>
<p>It isn’t ideal, and only applies for older babies. For those under six months old, cow milk is a real problem. It doesn’t have the right protein blend for babies and has next to no iron – risking anemia in very young babies. Cow milk also has a misbalance of minerals, especially for younger babies.</p>
<h2>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">5. So what guidance is there for low-income parents?</h4>

	</h2>
<p>It is challenging and I can’t provide a magic answer. But food banks and the WIC program have been a crucial lifeline. The WIC program in particular has proved itself to be very flexible during this shortage. When Abbott had to recall products and then couldn’t provide enough non-recalled formulas in states in which they were the WIC provider, WIC was able to change providers and reprogram EBT cards to allow low-income parents to buy different brands.</p>
<h2>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">6. What can be done to prevent this situation happening again in the U.S.?</h4>

	</h2>
<p>First we need to help families regain confidence in the formula production and supply system. This will prevent problems such as hoarding or making home brew formulas.</p>
<p>Then we need to look at how to make sure one plant going down doesn’t affect the whole system. The federal government can’t stockpile formula in the same way it might stockpile oil, as formula has a shelf life. But diversifying infant formula production is a possibility. This would involve making sure multiple factories and companies are making the formulas that this country needs. This doesn’t necessarily mean increased costs – competition could potentially drive down prices.</p>
<p>I believe America also needs to look at the country’s breast feeding support system. Don’t get me wrong, some parents will always need formula. But those who want to breast feed need everything possible done to support them. That includes better family leave policies, and help for low-income mothers who want to pump and store milk while they work.</p>

(Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The Biden administration sought to assuage parents’ concerns over an ongoing infant formula shortage Thursday, though officials couldn&#8217;t offer a timeline for when store shelves would be fully stocked again.</p>
<p>White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the administration is working to “cut red tape,” increase imports of formula and broaden what types of formula are available to participants in the Women, Infants and Children nutrition program.</p>
<p>Psaki couldn’t say how soon the Abbott infant formula facility, which halted production after four children contracted bacterial infections, would be able to restart manufacturing. But she noted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration won’t allow production lines to begin running until it’s safe.</p>
<p>“I think it’s also important to note that the reason we’re here is because the FDA took a step to ensure that babies were taking safe formula,” Psaki said. “There were babies who died from taking this formula, so they were doing their jobs.”</p>
<p>The federal government, Psaki said, is calling on retailers to impose purchase limits to prevent people from hoarding baby formula, an issue she said is being driven by scared parents as well as people buying up formula to sell it at a price markup.</p>
<p>The White House is also asking state attorneys general and the Federal Trade Commission to address price gouging or unfair market practices, according to a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/12/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-additional-steps-to-address-infant-formula-shortage/" target="_blank">fact sheet </a>released Thursday.</p>
<p>U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger, D-Henrico, said she talked with White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain about the formula shortage.</p>
<p>&#8220;We discussed all possible avenues for getting formula back on the shelves so that parents who rely on it — as I did to feed my three daughters — know they will be able to feed their babies,&#8221; Spanberger said, adding that conversation included tariff relief, immediate imports and the Defense Production Act.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/RepSpanberger/status/1524809540650377216?s=20&#038;t=9eFYwV_ZhwRXsRo9Qq-pDw</p>
<p>&#8220;Any plan released by this administration must make sure that formula is stocked on our shelves for all Virginia parents, crack down on price gouging, and increase imports of formula from abroad. Quick action is needed, and the White House must take decisive action. In the longer term, I am pursuing legislation to ensure we don’t face this challenge again,” she said.</p>
<p>Psaki said efforts from manufacturers and the Biden administration have led to more infant formula being produced “in the last four weeks than the four weeks preceding the recall.”</p>
<p>However, there wasn&#8217;t much advice Psaki was able to offer parents who cannot find formula for their children and have no idea what to do or where to look.</p>
<p>Psaki said she would “certainly encourage any parent who has concerns” to call their doctor or pediatrician.</p>
<p>Abbott issued a voluntary recall in mid-February for Similac, Alimentum and EleCare infant formula produced in its facility in Sturgis, Michigan, after four children contracted bacterial infections.</p>
<p>The U.S. FDA has <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/alerts-advisories-safety-information/fda-advises-parents-and-caregivers-not-make-or-feed-homemade-infant-formula-infants" target="_blank">issued</a> a warning to parents that they shouldn’t attempt to make their own baby formula, saying that could cause severe health issues in their children.</p>
<p>“The potential problems with homemade formulas include contamination and absence of or inadequate amounts of critical nutrients,” the FDA said in a statement. “These problems are very serious, and the consequences range from severe nutritional imbalances to foodborne illnesses, both of which can be life-threatening.”</p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Bob Good, R-Campbell, said it was time for Biden to &#8220;take responsibility for his lack of leadership and provides a solution to the millions of Americans struggling to feed their infant children.&#8221;</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/RepBobGood/status/1524790409569964033?s=20&#038;t=9eFYwV_ZhwRXsRo9Qq-pDw</p>
<p>FDA Commissioner Robert M. Califf issued a <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-takes-important-steps-improve-supply-infant-and-specialty-formula-products" target="_blank">statement</a> earlier this week saying the agency was “doing everything in (its) power to ensure there is adequate product available where and when they need it.”</p>
<p>Califf will face questioning from U.S. lawmakers next week after being called to testify before the House Committee that oversees the FDA’s funding.</p>
<p>Georgia Democratic Rep. Sanford D. Bishop, Jr., chair of the subcommittee, said in an announcement for the hearing that he’s deeply concerned “that a lapse in infant formula safety has led to the death and hospitalization of at least two babies.”</p>
<p>“This problem is made worse because many families and state nutrition programs rely on the infant formula supplier in question, and the recall has resulted in a shortage,” Bishop said.</p>
<p>Connecticut Democrat Rosa DeLauro, chair of the full committee, said the panel will lead “the way in examining the contaminated infant formula produced at an Abbott facility” as well as “the FDA’s delayed response to this horrific incident, and the subsequent nationwide infant formula shortage.”</p>
<p>“The whistleblower report I submitted for the record details a culture at Abbott of falsifying records, turning a blind eye to safety and product concerns, and retaliating against any employee who brought these issues to light,” DeLauro continued.</p>
<p>“It is not enough to simply focus on supply chain issues. We must examine many states’ reliance on infant formula produced by Abbott. We must ensure federal food safety agencies are doing their job.”</p>

</p><p><strong>By Jenni Bergal</strong></p>
<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, dozens of states have given a boost to struggling restaurants by allowing them to sell cocktails to-go, through takeout, curbside pickup or home delivery. But the expansion of alcohol to-go laws has placed a heavy burden on understaffed alcohol enforcement agencies, which have been hard-pressed to prevent underage drinking.</p>
<p>Before the changes, agents had to make sure servers and bartenders were properly trained, checking photo IDs and not serving intoxicated patrons.</p>
<p>Now, agents also must check whether restaurants and bars are placing cocktails to-go in the proper container with the correct labeling. They have to make sure food is being ordered with alcoholic beverages, as most states require. And they need to monitor whether drivers are checking IDs when they deliver orders, so alcohol isn’t getting into the hands of those under 21.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it does.</p>
<p>Last year in Virginia, for example, agents conducted a series of decoy operations: They ordered alcohol to be delivered to underage buyers, who presented an ID showing their age to be under 21.</p>
<p>Of 52 decoy operations completed, 32 underage buyers ended up with the alcohol, mostly from restaurants but also from grocery or convenience stores. In most cases, the driver didn’t ask for an ID at all. In others, the driver requested an ID but made the sale anyway.</p>
<p>“The noncompliance rate was extremely high,” said Chris Curtis, deputy secretary of the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Authority. He said the typical noncompliance rate for onsite retail sales is closer to 10 percent.</p>
<p>In late April 2020, the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control launched the first of nearly a dozen decoy delivery operations, in which underage youths supervised by officers ordered alcohol online or over the phone.</p>
<p>If the driver asked their age, they showed their real ID and answered truthfully, said John Carr, the department’s spokesperson.</p>
<p>Seventy-nine percent of delivery drivers gave alcohol to the underage decoys, according to Carr. During a second operation in early May 2020, there was a 53% violation rate.</p>
<p>Initially, agents handed out educational warnings. Soon after, they issued criminal citations to delivery drivers, who could face fines of $250 to $1,000 for selling alcohol to a minor, Carr said.</p>
<p>Department staffers held virtual meetings with food delivery companies, encouraging training for drivers, and warned liquor licensees they could face a fine or suspension.</p>
<p>Between May 2020 and late February 2022, officers issued 282 citations to delivery drivers, according to Carr. While the percentage of citations dropped considerably over time, there still was a 20% violation rate in February.</p>
<p>A new California law that extends cocktails to-go through 2026 no longer allows deliveries. Customers must pick up the order inside the premises after showing a photo ID. Beer and wine, however, still can be delivered, as was the case before the pandemic.</p>
<p>But the decoy delivery program is here to stay, Carr said. “It’s now part of our normal enforcement.”</p>
<h3>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Permanent changes</h4>

	</h3>
<p>While some health care advocates oppose cocktails to-go and home delivery, saying it makes alcohol more easily available and could lead to <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2021/01/12/cocktails-to-go-help-restaurants-stay-afloat" target="_blank">increased substance use disorder </a>and underage drinking, the changes have gotten bipartisan support in many state legislatures.</p>
<p>Since the start of the pandemic, at least 32 states and the District of Columbia have taken legislative action to allow restaurants and bars to sell cocktails to-go, according to the Distilled Spirits Council, an industry trade group. Eighteen states and the District of Columbia have made those changes permanent, and 14 others have extended temporary measures.</p>
<p>New Jersey and Pennsylvania are considering bills to make cocktails to-go permanent.</p>
<p>At least 11 states allow third-party delivery services such as DoorDash and Uber Eats to bring cocktails to people 21 and over at home along with their food order. Some other states let them deliver just beer and wine.</p>
<p>With those changes come more responsibilities, not just for restaurants and delivery companies, but also for enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>“This is an evolving situation,” said Brandy Nannini, a senior vice president at Responsibility.org, a Virginia-based nonprofit funded by distillers that aims to eliminate underage drinking and impaired driving. “It’s important, as we see these new practices allowed, that people get it right. Maybe we’re not there yet. But we’re trying to get there.”</p>
<p>The National Liquor Law Enforcement Association, which represents agencies across the U.S., recommends that they conduct quarterly, random compliance checks. It also wants servers, bartenders and delivery drivers trained in both state and local alcohol policies and how to properly check IDs.</p>
<p>And the group wants more funding for alcohol law enforcement agencies, many of which already are overburdened. A survey of 18 states published by the group in December 2020 found an average of one agent <a href="https://files.constantcontact.com/c1247982301/242bf27d-994c-4d0a-92a4-da9298e02b89.pdf" target="_blank">for every 207 alcohol outlets. </a></p>
<h3>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Training for delivery drivers</h4>

	</h3>
<p>Cocktails to-go legal requirements and policies vary from state to state and sometimes from county to county. Typically, they require food to be ordered along with the mixed drink, which needs to be in a tamper-proof container. Many cap the number of cocktails per meal.</p>
<p>But unlike patrons ordering drinks in person at brick-and-mortar businesses, home delivery often is ordered online. Officials say that’s why it’s important for restaurants and delivery services to know who is placing the order and receiving it.</p>
<p>“The main objective is to make sure alcohol does not get into the hands of minors or those who are visibly intoxicated, which could cause harm, such as DUIs and domestic violence,” said Carrie Christofes, executive director of the National Liquor Law Enforcement Association.</p>
<p>In Texas, the alcoholic beverage commission has created an online course for third-party delivery drivers <a href="https://www.tabc.texas.gov/services/tabc-certification/texas-responsible-alcohol-delivery-training-trad/" target="_blank">who bring alcoholic beverages </a>to consumers.</p>
<p>The Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Authority <a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2022/RD203" target="_blank">cited its decoy operations </a>in an October report, which concluded that delivery providers need to be held responsible for verifying ID and age when delivering alcohol.</p>
<div id="rte-1316dc3c-ba67-4fa0-8815-3cab7c879a84" class="js-selection-sharer rich-text rich-text--Left u-allow-page-break selectionShareable" data-component-ds-path="/sitecore/content/PewTrusts_org/Home/Research and Analysis/Blogs/Stateline/2022/05/05/Your To-Go Cocktails Make It Harder to Enforce Underage Drinking Laws/Components/Rich Text/Body Text">
<p>The report recommended regular compliance checks and training for servers and delivery drivers as well as measures included in a bill Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed into law last month. The law <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+SB254" target="_blank">extends cocktails to-go </a>until July 2024 and requires third-party delivery companies to be licensed. Drivers also must go through state-approved education about delivering alcoholic beverages, and the state agency must collect data about how the program is working.</p>
<p>Curtis of the Virginia agency said delivery companies will have to pay a license fee that would cover any additional costs incurred by his agency. They also will be subject to a fine if their drivers illegally deliver alcohol to people underage.</p>
<p>Some delivery companies say they are taking these issues seriously.</p>
<p>DoorDash offers <a href="https://help.doordash.com/dashers/s/article/Delivering-Alcohol-Guidelines?language=en_US" target="_blank">guidance for drivers </a>and a course on responsible alcohol deliveries, and, if the state requires its own, they must complete that, company spokesperson Campbell Millum said in an email. Customers who order alcohol must first upload an image of a government-issued ID, which delivery drivers then have to verify before they hand over alcohol. They also need to determine whether someone appears intoxicated.</p>
<p>Uber Eats also gives drivers information about how to deliver alcohol properly, an Uber spokesperson said in an email. Customers who order from the site must show the driver a valid ID. Drivers are alerted when the order includes alcohol and use technology that scans the ID. If the customer is underage, intoxicated or not at home, the app routes the driver back to the merchant and the person is paid, using the usual fare structure.</p>
<p>But it’s not just deliveries that need to be monitored, officials say.</p>
<p>In Montgomery County, Maryland, outside of Washington, D.C., the alcohol beverage agency conducted a curbside pickup “mystery shopper” initiative in the fall of 2020. Participants were 21 or older, but looked much younger, said Kathie Durbin, director of Montgomery County Alcohol Beverage Services.</p>
<p>The county found that 55% of restaurants did not check curbside mystery shoppers’ IDs and that only 15% told them that an ID would be needed when they picked up an order.</p>
<p>“People were not checking properly. It gave us an opportunity to educate them more,” Durbin said, noting that the county then launched a series of campaigns to alert businesses about what they need to do.</p>
<p>Nannini, of Responsibility.org, said changes in alcohol to-go laws have been a learning experience for businesses and government agencies.</p>
<p>“There were some bumps in the road at the beginning of the pandemic. Today, compliance is much better,” she said. “But the flip side of this is that fake IDs are getting more and more sophisticated. You can buy a really good one online now.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As National Child Abuse Prevention Month comes to an end and we enter into National Foster Care Month, it’s important to remember the children directly affected by child abuse and foster care and then ask ourselves, are we really doing all that we can? Are we doing all that we can to prevent child abuse? Are we doing all that we can to better the lives of children in foster care? Every single one us can play a part in bettering the lives of children in foster care – are we all doing our part? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Children enter foster care for a variety of reasons, one being child abuse. It could be your child’s classmate, Little League teammate, a member of their scout troop, or a child that rides the same bus. There are children in each of our communities who suffer from child abuse: children who have been held underwater during bath time, who have been sexually abused by an adult they trusted, who have been burned on their body with cigarettes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What happens to these vulnerable children? Often times, when a child is abused at home, they are removed from their home and placed into foster care. They are taken from their home, the home they know, and placed with a foster family they have likely never met, with little understanding of when or if they will be able to go home. All of these things that are happening to this child – due to no fault of their own – are instances of trauma that compound the experience that led to them being placed in foster care.. These traumas will affect that child’s ability to focus at school, ability to regulate emotions and even affect children’s physical health for years down the road. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After children are placed in foster care, what ultimately happens to these children? It depends. For some, the family of origin is able to remedy the home situation and the children are ultimately able to return home to their family in a safe way. For many, particularly those children who are subjected to more severe abuse, they are never able to return home. In many ways, this is where you, the community, can step in and make a difference in the lives of children in foster care. Children in foster care who cannot return home will either ultimately be adopted by another family or they will remain in temporary foster care homes, often times many, many temporary foster care homes, until they reach age 18 and age out of foster care and have to transition into adulthood with little to no supports. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you hear the messages throughout National Foster Care Month, take a few moments to remember these children and ask yourself – am I doing my part to help these children? One of the most obvious ways is to consider adopting a child in foster care and provide a permanent, loving family for that child to heal. Agencies like Children’s Home Society of Virginia can provide you the training, guidance and supports you need to adopt a child out of the foster care system at </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those who are unable to adopt, there are many other ways you can positively impact the lives of these children. As a business owner you can offer workforce development and employment opportunities to youth in foster care and youth who have aged out of foster care using a trauma-informed approach.  As a member of a church congregation, you can hold food drives for programs serving youth in care.   As a donor you can include foster and adoptive agencies in your charitable donation portfolios.  Or you can encourage the social group of which you are a member to host a fundraiser for one of those agencies.  If you are a neighbor to a foster or adoptive family, consider offering to bring a meal to the family or host a play date for the children.  And we all can encourage our legislative representatives to prioritize children touched by the foster care system as they pass new laws and provide funding to our social services system! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a way that each of us can positively impact children in foster care – and this month is the perfect time to ask yourself: Am I doing everything I can to change the lives of innocent, vulnerable children in foster care who have been subjected to child abuse and trauma? My hope is that this time next year, when we all ask ourselves that question again, the answer is unequivocally yes.  Because when the answer is “yes”, our Commonwealth’s children and youth will enjoy better outcomes.</span></p>

(Getty Images stock photo)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the beginning of April, Gov. Glenn Youngkin made a startling announcement: Over the last year, more than 150 foster children in Virginia had spent at least one night in government offices, hotel rooms or local emergency departments due to a lack of available placement options.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The governor </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/04/01/with-nowhere-else-to-go-some-va-foster-children-have-been-sleeping-in-government-offices/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">convened a task force</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> with an immediate goal of ending the practice by July 1. Over the course of a month, dozens of experts from local social service departments, private providers and statewide agencies worked to find places for still-displaced kids to stay. One director with Virginia’s Department of Medical Assistance Services began calling the </span><a href="https://www.virginiamanagedcare.com/choose/compare-plans" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">state’s contracted health plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> directly, managing to locate six beds over the course of a single weekend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On Tuesday, a little more than four weeks after the initial news release, Youngkin reported a major milestone. Over the past weekend, not a single child in Virginia had been forced to spend the night at their local social service department — the result of “tremendous work” by task force members, he announced at the launch of the state’s </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/05/03/virginias-newest-state-office-aims-to-close-gaps-in-oversight-over-child-welfare-system/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">new Office of the Children’s Ombudsman</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s not a broad framework — it’s shoe leather,” he said. “It’s passion, it’s caring.” The victory, however, was short-lived. Two days later, at a meeting of the </span><a href="https://www.csa.virginia.gov/Governance/Index/5" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">State and Local Advisory Team</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> for high-needs children, James City Social Services Director Rebecca Vinroot told members that a kid in the system had just been released from juvenile detention and didn’t have a home to go back to. In the meantime, the child was sleeping at a local social service agency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Until there are systemic changes that are made, we’re going to keep having these kids crop up,” she said. “Even after we handle these cases we’ve been working on.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Long-time workers in the field say it’s an issue that’s been percolating for years, despite its recent snowball to crisis-level proportions. The children struggling to find placements in Virginia’s foster care system are all older — most 10 and above. They’re often highly traumatized </span><span style="font-weight: 400">and many have spent years bouncing from placement to placement. Most are considered high-acuity, with behavioral health needs often co-occurring with other diagnoses, from deafness to developmental disabilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Andy Crawford, director of the Bedford County Department of Social Services, said local agencies have had trouble finding homes for a small percentage of children under their care. But over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, that trickle became a flood. Experts can point to many contributing factors, but almost all say it’s an off-shoot of Virginia’s broader psychiatric crisis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is really a mental health emergency that’s impacting child welfare,” Crawford said. “And that’s what we’re really trying to clear up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It stems back to a lack of treatment options for some of the state’s most vulnerable residents. Last summer, severe staffing shortages forced more than half of Virginia’s state-run mental hospitals </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/07/09/more-than-half-of-virginias-state-run-mental-hospitals-are-closing-to-new-admissions/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">to close to new civil admissions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. While facilities have gradually reopened over the last 10 months, ongoing recruitment and retention challenges continue to limit capacity. At the Commonwealth Center for Children and Adolescents, for example — the only state-operated psychiatric hospital for patients under 18 —  only 18 of 48 beds are currently operating.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_8965" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1024px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/CCCA.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-8965" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/CCCA-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  <em>The Commonwealth Center for Children and Adolescents is the only state psychiatric hospital that accepts children. (Image via University of Virginia Medical School)</em></p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The ongoing bed shortages have a cascading effect on the child welfare system. Some of the kids spending nights in emergency rooms are </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/03/10/virginia-county-sues-state-behavioral-health-system-for-failing-to-admit-psychiatric-patient/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">foster children under the custody of local social service agencies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> waiting for mental health treatment. An increasing number end up sleeping in local government offices if their temporary detention order expires before an inpatient bed becomes available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But staffing shortfalls aren’t unique to state-run psychiatric hospitals. Over the course of the pandemic, local departments, private providers and other supporting agencies have been grappling with ongoing vacancies, making it harder to find placements for children with more intensive needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Group homes and residential treatment centers are just one example. Given the high needs of displaced children in Virginia, many struggle to stay in foster homes. Others spend time in juvenile detention facilities or cycle through multiple congregate care placements. And many local agencies depend on those more institutional placements for children with a history of difficult behavior.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But like the state’s mental hospitals, many have experienced a crisis in staffing since the start of the pandemic. Scott Zeiter, chief operating officer for the nonprofit service provider </span><a href="https://www.grafton.org/about-us/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Grafton</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, said the company’s residential psychiatric treatment center in Berryville historically operates at a capacity of 70 beds. Over the pandemic, that number has dropped to 40 due to ongoing worker shortages. The same problem is facing congregate facilities across the state, fueling the shortage of placements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The pressure is there every minute of every day,” Zeiter said. “That’s where the rubber meets the road — it comes down to the number of beds we can deliver. And when I talk to other providers, I hear very similar stories.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Funding is another compounding factor. Some local social service agencies say the state’s low rate of Medicaid reimbursement to group homes and residential treatment facilities lead some to accept a greater proportion of children from out-of-state. While Virginia Medicaid caps daily payments, Zeiter said other states often agree to higher rates more commensurate with the true cost of providing care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Virginia’s complicated funding mechanism for children in foster care — or those at risk of entering the system — is another challenge. Services are typically provided through multiple sources, including Medicaid, local community service boards and </span><a href="https://www.csa.virginia.gov/content/doc/Impact_of_the_Tiered_Match_Rate_for_the_Children%E2%80%99s_Services_Act_2021.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Children&#8217;s Services Act funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, which typically pays for treatment not covered by health insurance. But both community services boards and CSA funding require a local match, resulting in wide differences in the availability of services across Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At Thursday’s meeting of the State and Local Advisory Team, a complaints specialist with the Virginia Department of Education said some localities don’t have </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/11/19/as-virginia-routes-more-students-with-disabilities-to-private-schools-costs-are-soaring/#:~:text=Costs%20have%20more%20than%20doubled,%2481%20million%20to%20%24186%20million." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">private day schools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> — nonresidential academies that typically provide educational services to students with disabilities. The lack of access has led some school districts to push for students to be admitted into residential facilities that also serve foster children.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They literally don’t have a private day close enough to travel the kid back and forth,” she said. “And now you’ve got more entry into those more restrictive settings because of the lack of resources.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Regardless of where agencies are encountering bed shortages, they’re putting a major strain on both children and workers. When kids end up in government offices, they’re required to be supervised by two separate staffers who also spend the night in the building, said Crawford, the Bedford social services director. Local agencies are also frequently tasked with supervising foster children if they go into crisis, sometimes commuting hours to local emergency rooms if children are placed with faraway families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At one point, workers with his agency spent six days commuting to and from Galax — a five-hour round trip — to sit with a child who was stuck in a local emergency room waiting for a psychiatric bed. But the impacts on children can be even worse. Crawford pointed to one child who moved from the Commonwealth Center to a congregate care facility in Missouri. After staff at the home said they could no longer meet his needs, he was moved to another facility in Tennessee. From there, he moved to a home in Virginia and stayed for six days before he had another mental health crisis that put him back in the emergency room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some local agencies say the bed shortage appears to be spurring more placements outside Virginia. The state’s Department of Social Services was unable to provide any data on the number of children placed out-of-state during the pandemic or the years preceding it, declining to provide a timeline on when the information might become available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Experts, though, say the residential bed shortage is just an immediate symptom of long-standing systemic failures. Crawford said the children who are the hardest to place are among the most traumatized in the state’s child welfare system. In many cases, they’ve spent years bouncing between different settings, which can exacerbate or create entirely new mental health challenges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Most of these kids have not just come into foster care,” said Lora Smith, the foster care program manager for the Virginia Department of Social Services. “A few weeks ago, we staffed a 13-year-old who had been in care since he was five. The system failed him. There’s no reason for a kid to be in care for eight years.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It goes back to a lack of support for foster families and intermediate placements for children with more intensive needs. </span><a href="https://www.vakidsbelong.org/our-team" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Janet Kelly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, a former secretary of the commonwealth tapped to lead the governor’s foster care task force, said many states have a network of </span><a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2019/02/20/foster-parents-have-become-professionals-in-some-states" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">professional foster parents</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> — guardians paid to take on the full-time work of caring for high-needs children. But the model is largely nonexistent in Virginia. Other alternatives are also relatively rare, including sponsored residential homes, where families are provided with wraparound services for children with disabilities and other health needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Another major issue is with kinship care. Virginia ranks near the bottom of the nation when it comes to placing foster children with relatives or close family friends. State lawmakers have repeatedly refused to provide families with </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/06/02/they-forgot-about-us-thousands-of-families-are-doing-the-same-work-as-foster-parents-in-virginia-without-the-support/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">any financial assistance for taking in relatives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, even when children need supportive services to help them overcome past trauma.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+SB56" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">The most recent legislative effort</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to establish a comprehensive support system for kinship care died in a House committee earlier this year. But state and local officials say building out those alternatives are vital for preventing a new crisis from emerging.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As helpful as the staffing was last week, it’s unrealistic that we continue at that pace,” Smith said Thursday, referring to the all-hands-on-deck effort to find beds for displaced children. “We’re at a point where we’re really trying to think outside the box to tackle this in a different way so we can get to all those kids.”</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After decades of limited oversight, a new state office is dedicated to investigating and intervening when problems emerge within Virginia’s child welfare system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Office of the Children’s Ombudsman officially launched Wednesday, nearly a year after former Gov. Ralph Northam </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/06/30/a-new-state-office-aims-to-address-longstanding-gaps-in-virginias-foster-care-system/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first appointed attorney Eric Reynolds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to helm the agency. While the office was formally created — and funded — through 2020 legislation, it’s been a priority for advocates since at least 2006, when Sen. John Edwards, D-Roanoke, filed one of the first bills attempting to establish the ombudsman position.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The measure failed, but a </span><a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2008/RD117/PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">subsequent study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Virginia Commission on Youth also endorsed the idea of an independent office. The 2008 report found that the state had “no central point of contact for children’s services,” leaving families without a way to navigate the system or file complaints outside the same agencies handling their cases.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s meant to give families more power and accountability over government,” said Ali Faruk, director of public policy for the nonprofit Families Forward Virginia. “Because traditionally, the incentive has been to make these problems go away as quietly as possible.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like other child welfare advocates, Faruk said the problem stems from the state’s system of governance for social services. Virginia is one of nine states where agencies are considered “state-supervised and locally administered,” meaning that its 120 local departments of social services have </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/10/29/little-kingdoms-administration-of-social-services-in-virginia-rests-largely-in-the-hands-of-localities-what-happens-when-they-cant-fix-themselves/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">near-total autonomy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in how they carry out statewide guidelines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The system is intended to give Virginia’s diverse array of cities and counties more flexibility in responding to local issues. But in practice, it sometimes means the state has no clear way of intervening — even in egregious cases of wrongdoing. In 2016, for instance, an internal review of Rockbridge County’s department found a former supervisor had </span><a href="https://roanoke.com/news/virginia/child-abuse-reports-ignored-by-rockbridge-social-services-report-finds/article_47320fbb-d32d-5c28-aa57-e8b327d7c289.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shredded child abuse reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before they could be assessed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the review, the state’s central agency in Richmond lacked the authority to discipline or take over the department, according to guidance from its Board of Social Services. Betty Wade Coyle, executive director emeritus of Prevent Child Abuse Hampton Roads, said families can try contacting </span><a href="https://www.dss.virginia.gov/division/regional_offices/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s five regional offices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or reaching out to elected representatives, but often find their complaints are bounced back to the same local agency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A regional director could remove a local director if they weren’t doing their job properly, but that almost never happens,” she said. “So there are technically remedies in place, but they’re either unclear or hardly ever used.” </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_17796" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1920px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VARIT114-scaled.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-17796 size-full" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VARIT114-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1214" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VARIT114-scaled.jpg 1920w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VARIT114-300x190.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VARIT114-1024x647.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VARIT114-768x485.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VARIT114-1536x971.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VARIT114-2048x1294.jpg 2048w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VARIT114-696x440.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VARIT114-1068x675.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VARIT114-665x420.jpg 665w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  <em>House of Delegates members walk past the south portico around at the end of the veto session at the Virginia State Capitol in Richmond on April 22, 2020.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The launch of the ombudsman’s office comes as Virginia scrambles to manage a </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/04/01/with-nowhere-else-to-go-some-va-foster-children-have-been-sleeping-in-government-offices/#:~:text=By%3A%20Kate%20Masters%20%2D%20April%201%2C%202022%2012%3A16%20pm&amp;text=Over%20a%20six%2Dmonth%20period,Glenn%20Youngkin%20said%20Friday." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">critical shortage of foster care placements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which has forced more than 100 children to sleep in government offices, emergency rooms or hotels over the past year. For Reynolds, the crisis has only underscored his focus on the state’s foster care system, another long-held priority for child welfare advocates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Families often struggle to meet their local agency’s criteria for reunification after children are removed from the home, and Virginia’s current model for court-appointed representation is widely viewed as insufficient. As a result, advocates say some children end up staying in foster care longer than necessary. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many local agencies fail to connect children with the appropriate services needed to keep them in a stable home, Reynolds added at a state Board of Social Services meeting last month. Virginia also ranks near the bottom in the nation for </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/06/02/they-forgot-about-us-thousands-of-families-are-doing-the-same-work-as-foster-parents-in-virginia-without-the-support/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">kinship care</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — placing children with relatives or close friends rather than unknown foster families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Locating services and alternative placements can be laborious at a time when many local agencies are struggling with understaffing. But the frequent failure to collaborate with families and keep children in their communities has compounded the statewide crisis, experts say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Before this office was created, I worked in the judiciary and people would call with questions we couldn’t answer,” Reynolds said at Wednesday’s launch. “It’s not our role — it’s not the role of the attorney general or the judiciary.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This office fills that gap,” he continued. “Now I don’t have to say, ‘I’m sorry, I can’t answer that question’ or refer them someplace that’s just going to refer them somewhere else. We’re it — we’re that person in the know who can tell you something real and meaningful.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, the office has received around 160 calls even before officially launching, Reynolds said. It now has a webpage with more information on its role and an </span><a href="https://www.oco.virginia.gov/complaints/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online complaint form</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for child welfare cases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Faruk, like other advocates, said there’s still concern over the current limitations of the office. The ombudsman can open investigations into local agencies and ultimately conveys findings to the department’s leaders as well as its regional office and the state’s Commissioner of Social Services. The office can also follow up with agencies, and the hope is that greater scrutiny will help troubled local departments fix their problems faster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But like the state’s central office, the ombudsman also can’t enforce its recommendations or findings. Reynolds, though, said the agency has the ability to release investigative reports and other issue briefs, which could put more pressure on both local departments and the state to find solutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Part of our spiel is that we’re not here to point a finger,” he said. “We’re not a hammer — the General Assembly didn’t give us any enforcement rights. But we’ve got a flashlight, and we’re going to find the areas where there’s improvement to be had.”</span></p>

(Getty Images stock photo)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over a six-month period last year, 163 children in Virginia spent at least one night in hotels, emergency rooms or local government offices due to a shortage of foster homes and other permanent housing, Gov. Glenn Youngkin said Friday.</span></p>
<p>In response, Youngkin&#8217;s administration is launching a task force charged with bringing government partners together to find safe placements for unhoused children, develop a bigger reservoir of housing options and explore potential policy options.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is unacceptable that last year over 150 children in foster care spent the night in places that just simply are not meant for kids,” Youngkin said in a news release. “When this challenge came to our attention, my administration knew we had to act swiftly to ensure that every child has a safe place to belong.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Social Services did not immediately respond to questions related to the announcement. But local agencies have faced a shortage of available foster homes for months. Last year, one of the state’s largest foster placement organizations told the Mercury it had seen a </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/05/20/one-of-virginias-largest-foster-agencies-is-seeing-a-steep-decline-in-interest-from-prospective-parents/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">substantial decline</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in parental inquiries, raising concerns over its ability to make new placements. And Virginia is ranked at the bottom of the nation when it comes to kinship care, the practice of placing children with extended family rather than unrelated foster parents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When local agencies can’t locate permanent placements — which can also include group homes and residential treatment centers — children end up sleeping in temporary spaces, including the offices of local departments of social services, according to the release. A shortage of mental health treatment beds, particularly for children, also plays a role. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, the state’s only publicly run psychiatric hospital for children and adolescents is operating </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/03/10/virginia-county-sues-state-behavioral-health-system-for-failing-to-admit-psychiatric-patient/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">at greatly reduced capacity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> due to staffing concerns and continued demand for beds. Often, children end up sleeping in emergency rooms due to the lack of treatment options. In March, a local social services agency sued the state over the issue, alleging that a foster child in its care was forced to spend four days in a Richmond emergency room without ever receiving adequate mental health care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lack of resources also puts a strain on crisis system workers, including police and employees with local agencies, according to the administration. Children who end up sleeping in temporary spaces often have the highest needs and are referred to social service agencies through family relinquishment or &#8220;child in need of services&#8221; (CHINS) petitions — filed in cases of children who regularly run away from home or routinely miss schools. With few places for those children to go, local workers stay with them and handle their cases until more permanent support is found.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Social workers or law enforcement personnel stay overnight with children who are displaced, creating an undue burden on already overworked staff,” the release stated. “This greatly exacerbates the existing workforce shortages in the child welfare and criminal justice systems.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While COVID-19 outbreaks and other pandemic-related challenges have added additional stressors to state-run hospitals, group homes and other placement options, the existing problems within Virginia’s foster care system have been well-known for years. </span><a href="http://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt513-2.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2018 report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that local social services departments didn’t do enough to place children with relatives or ensure a steady stream of foster homes, resulting in more restrictive placements including congregate living facilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Despite the persistent nature of these shortages, Virginia still has no plan, dedicated funding, or staff to systematically recruit non-relative foster families, in contrast to other states,” the report stated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Youngkin administration said the new task force would bring together both state and local agencies, residential facilities, hospitals and community partners to find sustainable solutions.  Eric Reynolds, the state’s </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/06/30/a-new-state-office-aims-to-address-longstanding-gaps-in-virginias-foster-care-system/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently appointed children’s ombudsman,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has also been investigating some of the root causes, according to the news release.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While there are a number of issues that created this untenable situation, it will require </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">collaboration and creativity at both the local and state levels to solve it,” John Littel, Virginia’s secretary of health and human resources, said in a statement. “We are grateful to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">every child welfare worker who has worked to the best of their ability to ensure these kids </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are safe and we look forward to working together with them to end this practice.”</span></p>

(Photo by Parker Michels-Boyce/ For the Virginia Mercury)</p><p>WASHINGTON — A COVID-19 vaccine for young children will be delayed by at least two months as Pfizer and BioNTech gather more information on a three-dose regimen.</p>
<p>The disappointing news for many parents came after the Biden administration earlier had announced it was preparing to get the vaccines out to states as soon as it could following federal approval.</p>
<p>The pharmaceutical companies and the Food and Drug Administration released separate statements Friday saying a review of the vaccine for children under 5 years old will likely not take place until early April.</p>
<p>“Based on the agency’s preliminary assessment, and to allow more time to evaluate additional data, we believe additional information regarding the ongoing evaluation of a third dose should be considered as part of our decision-making for potential authorization,” the FDA said in a <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-postpones-advisory-committee-meeting-discuss-request-authorization" target="_blank">statement</a>.</p>
<p>The FDA said it would postpone the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee meeting scheduled for Tuesday to “​​give the agency time to consider the additional data, allowing for a transparent public discussion as part of our usual scientific and regulatory processes for COVID-19 vaccines.”</p>
<p>Pfizer and BioNTech began submitting data to the FDA on a two-dose regimen for children under 5 earlier this month at the request of the agency.</p>
<p>Pfizer Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-ok-sought-two-dose-covid-vaccine-kids-under-5" target="_blank">said</a> at the time the company would submit data on a two-dose regimen while it continued researching a three-dose regimen.</p>
<p>“Ultimately, we believe that three doses of the vaccine will be needed for children 6 months through 4 years of age to achieve high levels of protection against current and potential future variants,” he said on Feb. 1.</p>
<p>The Biden administration immediately began getting ready for approval of the emergency use authorization request. White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Jeffrey Zients said the next day the federal government was preparing to ship the vaccine to states as soon as it was approved.</p>
<p>“Following FDA authorization, we would immediately begin packing and shipping doses to states and health care providers,” Zients <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/white-house-plans-speedy-delivery-states-covid-vaccine-littlest-kids" target="_blank">said</a>, noting the federal government had already “secured ample doses and the necessary needles and supplies” designed for this age group.</p>
<p>The White House was also preparing to work with local and state health officials as well as pediatricians to distribute information about the vaccine, including to hesitant parents.</p>
<p>That process now won’t get underway until at least April, as Pfizer and BioNTech gather more data on what will likely be a three-shot vaccine.</p>
<p>“Given that the study is advancing at a rapid pace, the companies will wait for the three-dose data as Pfizer and BioNTech continue to believe it may provide a higher level of protection in this age group,” the companies said in a <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-provide-update-rolling-submission" target="_blank">statement</a>. “The companies expect to have three-dose protection data available in early April.”</p>

(Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of her argument that Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin and his more liberal counterparts in states like New Jersey are taking two different approaches to lifting mask mandates in schools, Virginia House Minority Leader Eileen Filler-Corn said other states aren’t easing their rules until March.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If we move forward with this bill with an emergency clause, you’re talking about putting this into effect in a number of weeks,” said Filler-Corn, D-Fairfax, referring to anti-mask mandate legislation she said would endanger children, teachers and administrators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Amanda Batten, R-James City, one of the bill’s sponsors, pointed out that March is only a few weeks away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If we’re looking at March as a magic date, we&#8217;re pretty close to March right now,” Batten said. “Even with an emergency clause, if all that were to happen, we would probably be lining up with March. Much as the other states are.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a handful of Democrats in the Virginia Senate joined with Republicans Wednesday in a 21-17 vote to end mandatory student masking in schools, questions remained over how and when the proposed law might go into effect. </span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="bihyrcWzbI"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/02/08/senate-set-to-vote-on-bill-ending-mask-mandates-in-virginia-schools/">Senate set to vote on bill ending mask mandates in Virginia schools</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Senate set to vote on bill ending mask mandates in Virginia schools&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/02/08/senate-set-to-vote-on-bill-ending-mask-mandates-in-virginia-schools/embed/#?secret=PskoSMtfF1#?secret=bihyrcWzbI" data-secret="bihyrcWzbI" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin has indicated he’s eager to sign it, but it still needs to pass the Republican-led House of Delegates before it goes to him. House Speaker Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, said Wednesday he plans to get the bill to Youngkin as soon as possible because “kids can’t wait any longer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Youngkin’s executive order against mask mandates in limbo due to legal challenges, the legislative ban could potentially end compulsory school masking before the courts have had the final say on whether Youngkin’s action is legal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though most new laws go into effect on July 1 by default, Youngkin could recommend an emergency clause that would make the law take effect immediately after he signs it. But both narrowly divided legislative chambers would need to approve that step. This week, rules experts have been poring over parliamentary procedures to figure out if that would take a simple majority vote or the four-fifths votes required of most emergency legislation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both the House and the Senate clerks, the General Assembly&#8217;s experts on legislative rules, confirmed to the Mercury that, under current practice, an emergency clause sent down by Youngkin could pass with simple majority votes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That suggests the masks provision could easily clear the House, where Republicans have a 52-48 majority. And if only one of the three Senate Democrats who voted for the bill Wednesday want the law to take effect immediately — a strong possibility given the vocal anti-mandate stance of Sen. Chap Petersen, D-Fairfax — emergency language could also clear the Senate, where Democrats have a 21-19 majority with Lt. Gov. Winsome Sears breaking ties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don&#8217;t have a lot of tools to push back,” Del. Marcus Simon, D-Fairfax, said Wednesday. “That&#8217;s life in the minority.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a similar situation in the fall of 2020, Democrats used their superior numbers in both chambers to pass emergency protections for Virginians facing eviction when then-Gov. Ralph Northam added an emergency clause. Both chambers approved it by majority vote, over Republican opposition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats voiced strong objections to the anti-mask mandate bill in both chambers this week. Unlike other states moving away from mask mandates, they note, both Youngkin’s order and the pending bill prevent local school boards from making masks mandatory. That could create problems, they say, should another COVID-19 surge happen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Groups representing Virginia school boards, school superintendents and teachers have also raised that concern while voicing opposition to the bill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stacy Haney, a lobbyist for the Virginia School Boards Association, said her organization opposes the state making masks mandatory and opposes the state making masks optional.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is a decision that should be made by our local school boards,” Haney told the House Education Committee.&#8221;If there&#8217;s anything that is certain in this pandemic, it is that it will change again. But if you pass this substitute, you tie our hands and we can&#8217;t change with the pandemic.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Education Association, the state’s largest advocacy group for teachers, and the Virginia Association of School Superintendents also registered their opposition to the bill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same hearing, Youngkin Secretary of Education </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aimee Guidera, said “if things get worse,” the state can revisit the mask issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is not about masks,” Guidera said. “This is about parents&#8217; rights to have judgment. They know their children best.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pressed to explain how a masks-optional system would protect immunocompromised students at higher risk from the virus, Guidera said she’s confident principals and parents will work together to protect those students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No Democrats on the House Education Committee voted for the mask mandate ban, perhaps signaling more unified opposition in their caucus than among the Senate Democrats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Senate, the two Democrats who joined Petersen in support of the bill were Sens. Joe Morrissey, D-Richmond and Lynwood Lewis, D-Accomack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a lengthy debate on the Senate floor, Morrissey said he believes masks are effective (though perhaps not as effective as initially thought) and will continue to tell his own children to wear them at school. But he said he thinks all parents should be able to make that choice themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are telling parents what to do,” Morrissey said. “And as a legislator, I just don&#8217;t believe that I have the audacity to tell them what they can do and they cannot do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other Senate Democrats argued that — just as Youngkin’s executive order did — the bill would strip communities of their power to make their own decisions on masks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We will eventually get back to normal. We all want that,’ said Sen. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond. “But we have to do it in a way that is safe for everyone. Not a one-size-fits-all approach.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, said she’s heard a wave of opposition since the mask mandate ban was introduced Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don&#8217;t know about other people,” Locke said,  “but my emails and my text messages and my phone have been inundated with calls from my district of school board members, teachers, saying: ‘Are you people crazy? What is wrong with you?’&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supporters of the bill said it would bring some measure of peace to communities divided by mask debates and would better reflect newer findings suggesting cloth masks are less effective against the omicron variant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The truth here is that the only mitigation that actually works is the vaccine,” said Sen. Siobhan Dunnavant, R-Henrico, the only doctor in the General Assembly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Petersen, the bill’s Democratic champion,  said his goal is to end “the mask wars” once for all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don&#8217;t have a doctorate in medicine,” he said. “But I do have a doctorate in common sense.&#8221;</span></p>

(Photo by Parker Michels-Boyce/ For the Virginia Mercury)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Pfizer and BioNTech on Tuesday asked the federal government to begin the approval process for a two-dose COVID-19 vaccine for children under 5.</p>
<p>The companies said in a joint statement they began the rolling submission process for an emergency use authorization at the request of the Food and Drug Administration “in response to the urgent public health need in this population.”</p>
<p>While the approval process is underway for the two-dose regimen, the company will continue researching a third dose that would likely be given at least eight weeks after a child receives the second dose.</p>
<p>Pfizer Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla <a href="https://investors.pfizer.com/Investors/News/news-details/2022/Pfizer-and-BioNTech-Initiate-Rolling-Submission-for-Emergency-Use-Authorization-of-Their-COVID-19-Vaccine-in-Children-6-Months-Through-4-Years-of-Age-Following-Request-From-U.S.-FDA/default.aspx" target="_blank">said in the statement</a> that increasing infections and hospitalizations of young children led the two companies to begin the approval process.</p>
<p>“As hospitalizations of children under 5 due to COVID-19 have soared, our mutual goal with the FDA is to prepare for future variant surges and provide parents with an option to help protect their children from this virus,” Bourla said.</p>
<p>“Ultimately, we believe that three doses of the vaccine will be needed for children 6 months through 4 years of age to achieve high levels of protection against current and potential future variants.”</p>
<p>Bourla said that if the FDA authorizes the two doses, that would allow parents to begin vaccinating their young children while waiting on approval of a third dose.</p>
<p>The submission announcement on Tuesday comes sooner than previously expected.</p>
<p>In mid-December, Pfizer and BioNTech <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-provide-update-ongoing-studies-covid-19" target="_blank">announced </a>they were modifying their trial to include a third dose of the vaccine for children between 2 and 4 years old after the two-dose approach didn’t lead to the type of immune response researchers sought. The trial did, however, produce the levels desired in children between six months and 2 years old.</p>
<p>The company said at the time that if the three-dose trial was successful, it would likely submit its emergency use request to the federal government in the first half of 2022.</p>
<p>Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, then <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/fauci-declines-to-predict-covid-vaccine-timetable-for-kids-under-5/" target="_blank">said last week</a> that parents needed to be patient in waiting for approval of the vaccine for younger children.</p>
<p>“I don’t think we can predict when we will see an [emergency use authorization] with that because the company is still putting the data before the FDA,” Fauci said during a White House briefing on the pandemic.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-january-2022-parents-and-kids-update/?utm_campaign=KFF-2022-polling-surveys&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=2&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--QyqlXrAGuzJNF2pxPXwIqFBoJABxjhaUUr383WfhOx-jt107C9Ah1D51J8HZNLjQrIWnrAKmjklUUVMJjyVl1gBn9zA&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_source=hs_email" target="_blank">poll </a>released Tuesday by the Kaiser Family Foundation indicated about 31 percent of parents would get their small children vaccinated immediately.</p>
<p>Another 29 percent said they would wait and see while 12 percent said only if required and 26 percent of respondents said they definitely would not give their young child the vaccine.</p>

(Caroline County Public Schools via NBC12)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to education advocacy, there’s an ocean of difference between </span><a href="https://www.veanea.org/about/who-we-are/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s largest teacher’s union</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank that’s decried “</span><a href="https://www.cato.org/commentary/school-closures-have-been-made-politics-mind-not-science" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">union‐​induced school closures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now, though, representatives from groups are united on one front: opposition to Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/74---eo/74---eo/EO-2---School-Mask-Mandate-Executive-Order-Exception.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executive order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on masks in school. On Monday, teachers from the Richmond, Chesterfield and Henrico chapters of the Virginia Education Association gathered to oppose the directive, which gives parents the right to opt out of universal masking requirements in local school districts. The same day, the director of Cato’s Center for Educational Freedom wrote a </span><a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/yes-youngkins-mask-mandate-ban-applies-private-schools" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">second column</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> criticizing the executive order after confirming with the state Department of Education that it also applies to Virginia private schools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The governor is basically saying that parents should not be able to choose a school with a universal mask mandate,” director Neal McCluskey said in a phone call on Monday. “That’s a huge thing to do, especially during a pandemic.” And while his chief concern was how the directive affected private schools, McCluskey also pointed out that it presented serious challenges for public divisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Schools across the state have kind of been whipsawed,” he said. “You go back one week and the state is saying you must have mask mandates in place. Then you get to Monday and the state is saying, no, you actually may not have mask mandates. And it’s generally not good policy to impose drastic policies on schools in the middle of the year.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a view that’s shared by many parents and school divisions amid ongoing confusion over the executive order, which went into effect Monday despite legal challenges and sometimes open defiance. Seven local school boards and a group of parents in Chesapeake have now filed two separate lawsuits against the administration, claiming Youngkin lacks the authority to override local masking policies. And while some divisions have </span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/powhatan-schools-to-support-governor-youngkins-mask-optional-order-monday/#:~:text=POWHATAN%2C%20Va.,not%20have%20to%20wear%20one." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">already made masks optional</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, more than a dozen others are keeping their mandates as the order is challenged in court. The Virginia Supreme Court is expected to take up the case this week, <a href="https://www.nbc12.com/2022/01/24/virginia-supreme-court-take-up-school-mask-debate-this-week/" target="_blank">according to NBC12.</a></span></p>
<p>https://twitter.com/Gelman_Scott/status/1485610523098062852?s=20</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is legitimate uncertainty about whether Youngkin, as governor, has the ability to overturn local policies. In 2021, the General Assembly passed a law requiring public schools to stay open for in-person instruction. Signed by Gov. Ralph Northam, the language of the law directs divisions to follow mitigation guidance from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention “to the maximum extent practicable. Currently, </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/k-12-guidance.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">that guidance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> explicitly recommends universal masking for all students, staff and visitors regardless of vaccination status.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s still unclear if the governor can override state law with an executive order. And under the Virginia Constitution, school policy largely falls to the state Board of Education, with day-to-day supervision largely left to local school boards. While Youngkin has </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/01/18/youngkin-still-wont-say-how-his-school-masking-order-will-be-enforced/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declined to specify</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> how he plans to enforce the executive order, it’s not certain that he has any authority to take action against noncompliant districts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For many educators and administrators, though — as well as students and their families — frustration with the order is more about the practical impacts. In divisions keeping their universal masking policies, teachers are now largely tasked with enforcement if children show up to school without face coverings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For Richmond, we have communication to encourage students to put their masks back on,” said Katina Harris, president of the Richmond Education Association. “Some educators are creating rewards programs, as well, for students who come in with their masks on.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Confrontation, though, is still a concern. In Fairfax County, students who refuse to comply with the district’s masking mandate won’t be allowed to attend in-person instruction, according to a staff-wide webinar held on Monday. As other districts mull similar policies, parents worry that students may get caught in the crosshairs. </span></p>
<p>https://twitter.com/approject/status/1485664829713096709?s=11</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, a Page County mother made </span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/virginia-school-board-gun-threat-face-mask-dispute/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">national headlines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when she threatened to bring loaded guns to school if the division kept its mask mandate. With similarly contentious debates playing out all over the state, it’s hard to keep students from worrying that their district won’t experience something similar, said Alsúin Creighton-Preis, a parent in Henrico County.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These kids have already had to walk the gauntlet of these seemingly normal parents shouting nonsense during school board meetings,” she said. “And they’re all super-connected, so the rumor mill is flying.” Her own daughter, a senior in high school, was nervous that an armed parent might come to school on Monday to protest the district’s masking policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not every family, though, opposes the order. Alexis Gearhart and John Cantello, parents in Prince William County, sent their three oldest children to school without face coverings on Monday despite the district’s universal masking policy. Cantello said he’s worried that continued masking is hurting his children’s social-emotional development, especially in the case of his six-year-old daughter, who’s never experienced a typical pre-pandemic school year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re talking about a whole generation where masks are becoming the new normal,” Cantello said. “But for me, they’re not normal, and I don’t want a new normal.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, both parents said their children did put masks back on when their teachers asked them to do so, though Gearhart said her 10-year-old daughter was initially instructed to sit in the back of the classroom. With the masking order still tied up in court, though, some parents and students are worried the debate will only grow more contentious. The divide is especially visible in counties where masks were made optional.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’d say probably 80 percent of students in Powhatan County were not wearing masks,” said Alexander Campbell, a junior who still opted to return to school in a KN95. Some teachers in the district also left their faces uncovered, which he said spurred both gossip and debate among students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“COVID has been really difficult in terms of school feeling more awkward, more tense,” he said. “And so I’m wondering, are we going to spiral back to normalcy, or is this tension going to continue to build up to the point where we’re seeing altercations and social media debate over masks?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’s equally worried that the sudden transition away from face coverings will increase the spread of COVID-19, especially if maskless students don’t quarantine after close exposures. But on a statewide level, Campbell said he’s frustrated to see autonomy taken away from local school boards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I found the order ironic because for decades conservatives have been advocating for local control,” he said. “And now local officials can’t make decisions about health when they were elected to make those decisions.”</span></p>

</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Isabel Bishop, 12, and her 8-year-old brother, Bodhi, school might mean a trip from their home in Fairfax County to the Harriet Tubman Museum in Maryland to learn about slavery and the underground railroad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Mali Holmes, 7, of Richmond, school might mean playing chess with friends and developing critical thinking and problem-solving skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Tera Thomas’ sons – Noah, 10; Jude, 8; and Elias, 7 – school might mean baking Christmas cookies. “Lots of math and instruction following,” the boys’ mother said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those children are among the approximately</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12GG0V5S8jfpJgvsbPDNxhuzJHNPzbBDfGd83Ac3zWhI/edit#gid=569413521" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">62,000 home-schoolers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Virginia – a number that has doubled over the past decade and is up 40 percent since fall 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experts say home schooling has grown in popularity across the socio-political spectrum, from the religious right to the humanist left, driven in recent years not only by the COVID-19 pandemic but also by the culture wars being waged in many school districts.</span></p>
<p><iframe id="datawrapper-chart-jnrKb" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" title="Home-schooling jumped in Virginia after COVID-19 hit" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/jnrKb/4/" height="500" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" aria-label="Interactive area chart"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think it will permanently change the landscape of education,” said Yvonne Bunn, director of government affairs for the</span><a href="https://heav.org/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Home Educators Association of Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or HEAV. “I don’t think it will ever go back to the way it was before.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bunn said home schooling lets parents “individualize the curriculum to fit the needs of their children.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nikiya Ellis, Mali’s mother, agreed.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_29959" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:225px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/art.jpeg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-29959" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/art-225x300.jpeg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/art-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/art.jpeg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Mali Holmes holds a drawing at an art class at the Cultural Roots Home School cooperative.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our children learn from us in different ways,” she said. “And it doesn’t have to be this academic way of learning all day, every day. They learn from watching us cook, watching how we treat each other. It doesn’t have to be sitting down at a table with pen and paper.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past two years, home schooling has</span><a href="https://bit.ly/va-home-schooling" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">increased in 120</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Virginia’s 132 school divisions, including in</span><a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/Qk0ZV/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">all but one</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the 15 largest districts. If home-schoolers were a division unto themselves, it would be the</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12GG0V5S8jfpJgvsbPDNxhuzJHNPzbBDfGd83Ac3zWhI/edit#gid=334664795" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">sixth-largest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the commonwealth – with about as many students as the public schools of Virginia Beach or Chesterfield County.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 was the main trigger. When the coronavirus prompted schools to move instruction online in spring 2020, many families created “</span><a href="https://www.educationnext.org/rapid-rise-pandemic-pods-will-parent-response-covid-19-lead-to-lasting-changes/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pandemic pods</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">“ to home-school their children: A handful of students, often from the same neighborhood, would study together, led by parents or a hired teacher.</span></p>
<p><iframe id="datawrapper-chart-Qk0ZV" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" title="Most big districts see increase in home-schooling" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Qk0ZV/2/" height="489" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" aria-label="Bar Chart"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, the number of home-schoolers in Virginia spiked from about 44,000 before the pandemic to</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12GG0V5S8jfpJgvsbPDNxhuzJHNPzbBDfGd83Ac3zWhI/edit#gid=569413521" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 65,500</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the 2020-21 academic year, when instruction remained virtual in most communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tera Thomas’ children were part of that initial exodus from the public schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We knew there was no way our kids were going to enjoy being on a computer all day,” said Thomas, a former high school English teacher who lives in Louisa County. “I don’t even want to be on a computer all day.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_29962" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/colors_shapes-scaled.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-29962" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/colors_shapes-300x142.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="142" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/colors_shapes-300x142.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/colors_shapes-1024x485.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/colors_shapes-768x363.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/colors_shapes-1536x727.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/colors_shapes-2048x969.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Adah Thomas, 3, creates pictures by arranging tiles of different shapes and colors. (Photo courtesy of Tera Thomas)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When public schools resumed in-person classes this fall, some home-schoolers returned to campus, but most continued their studies at home. They were joined by children like Isabel and Bodhi Bishop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their mother, Carlea Bauman, said home schooling not only makes learning fun and interactive but also helps her forge “deeper relationships with my kids.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the sharp spike when COVID-19 emerged and then a slight dip this fall, home schooling in Virginia has seen a net gain of about 18,000 students over the past two years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s amazing to us,” Bunn said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number may continue to grow. Since September, Bunn said, HEAV has handled more than 21,000 phone calls for advice about home schooling. “It’s been unbelievable the surge in parents just wanting to know what they need to do and how they could do it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrea Cubelo-McKay, president of the</span><a href="https://vahomeschoolers.org/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Organization of Virginia Homeschoolers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, said many families that turned to home schooling early in the pandemic thought it would be a temporary move. But they “decided to continue home schooling because it was a really positive experience for them.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_29963" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:225px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/HTUGRR-Museum-rotated.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-29963" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/HTUGRR-Museum-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/HTUGRR-Museum-225x300.jpg 225w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/HTUGRR-Museum-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/HTUGRR-Museum-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/HTUGRR-Museum-rotated.jpg 1512w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Isabel Bishop sitting next to a statue of Harriet Tubman at the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Historical Park in Maryland.

    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Why the increase? Zoom, masks, CRT and Billie Eilish</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Cubelo-McKay said, two factors boosted home schooling:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">When public schools moved online, many students experienced</span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/10/25/927564357/virginia-high-school-senior-reflects-on-his-school-year-during-the-pandemic" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoom fatigue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/fairfax-schools-more-failing-grades/2020/11/24/1ac2412e-2e34-11eb-96c2-aac3f162215d_story.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">failing grades</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and other trouble learning in a virtual environment. They wanted an alternative.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, more parents were working from home, had flexible schedules or were furloughed from their jobs. That made them more available for home schooling.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When school doors re-opened for the 2021-22 academic year, numerous parents and students</span><a href="https://www.nvdaily.com/nvdaily/students-protest-mask-mandate-for-shenandoah-county-schools/article_830d14ea-6af5-57ff-a840-476ee6d3a5f8.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">opposed mask requirements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, social distancing and other measures adopted by school boards to curb the spread of the virus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, some home schooling advocates have circulated misinformation that the coronavirus vaccines are dangerous and that public schools are forcing students to get them. Such misinformation may have scared some parents about sending their children back to school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, in an</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hfcR39D5I_tXP-tRn1ctDtyc8qq34wAHbOjqHzhuIxM/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">online interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with The Virginia Mercury, J. Allen Weston, executive director of the</span><a href="https://www.nationalhomeschoolassociation.com/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">National Home School Association</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, said some parents fear “that their children will be bribed or coerced into getting injected with a ‘so-called’ vaccine that has been proven to be damaging and even deadly to many who get it.” (In fact,</span><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/featured-topic/covid-19-vaccine-myths-debunked" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">scientists agree</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the COVID-19 vaccines approved for children by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration are safe and effective.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it wasn’t just COVID-19 that spurred home schooling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Loudoun County, where Cubelo-McKay lives, angry parents </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/24/us/loudoun-county-school-board-meeting/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">disrupted school board meetings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the role of c</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ritical race theory in teacher trainings and education more broadly (</span><a href="https://www.loudountimes.com/news/ziegler-remains-firm-lcps-is-not-teaching-critical-race-theory/article_146c1e8c-c3c9-11eb-9217-ebb5be4d3868.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">school officials insisted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that it is not part of the curriculum) and by</span><a href="https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/local/virginia/loudoun-county-public-schools-board-policy-8040-crt-meeting-protest/65-03ad470f-3f11-4429-9bc4-1d60b6723d9c" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">protesting a policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requiring teachers and staff to refer to transgender students by their chosen pronoun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conservative commentators</span><a href="https://www.baconsrebellion.com/wp/post-covid-public-school-enrollment-still-down-by-45000/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">have speculated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that those controversies prompted politically conservative families, especially Whites, to pull their children from the public schools.</span></p>

<p><b>Resources for home-schooling families</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><b>Home Educators Association of Virginia</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, established in 1983, operates “within the context of a</span><a href="https://heav.org/about-heav/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">biblical worldview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” with a goal to “help and encourage parents to fulfill their God-given rights and responsibilities to educate their own children.” The group, which serves families “regardless of religious or philosophical beliefs,” provides support for home schooling through a help line (804-278-9200),</span><a href="https://heav.org/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Facebook</span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/HEAV.Virginia.Homeschool/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/128831755261" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. HEAV also has a room with home-schooling resources at its offices at 2100 W. Laburnum Ave. in Richmond. The association plans to hold its annual convention June 9-11 at the Greater Richmond Convention Center.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><b>Organization of Virginia Homeschoolers</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was formed in 1993 by home schooling advocates who were “were</span><a href="https://vahomeschoolers.org/about/history" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">uncomfortable with ‘the extent of the exclusiveness</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> within the ranks of the Christian conservative home-school organizations.’” The group, which goes by VaHomeschoolers, “is an inclusive organization and is neutral in matters of politics and religion.” The organization has a help line (866-513-6173), a</span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/VaHomeschoolers" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an</span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/vahomeschoolers/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a</span><a href="https://vahomeschoolers.org/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with such resources as an online</span><a href="https://vahomeschoolers.org/resources/bookstore" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">bookstore</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At HEAV, which espouses a “</span><a href="https://heav.org/about-heav/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">biblical worldview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” Bunn said parents may have turned to home schooling because “they feel like they’re not being heard” – a theme that Republican Glenn Youngkin struck in</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-education-parental-rights-school-curricula-604edece27a483155c409187f258a058" target="_blank"> his <span style="font-weight: 400;">winning campaign for governor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in November.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The children don’t belong to the state. I think parents really want to impart their own values to their children – their values and beliefs and their own worldview. And that is a major reason parents are home schooling,” Bunn said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At VaHomeschoolers, which</span><a href="https://vahomeschoolers.org/about/history" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">calls itself</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an inclusive alternative to “Christian conservative home-school organizations,” Cubelo-McKay said the rancor over social issues in the public schools had a different effect: It drove more Black and LGBT students to try home schooling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They didn’t feel safe with the level of hostility” toward racial equity iniatives and transgender rights, she said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Home-schoolers represent about</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12GG0V5S8jfpJgvsbPDNxhuzJHNPzbBDfGd83Ac3zWhI/edit#gid=569413521&amp;range=A22:L22" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">5 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Virginia’s total public school enrollment. That is among the highest proportions in the United States, according to the</span><a href="https://www.nheri.org/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">National Home Education Research Institute</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fifteen states publicly report their home-schooling numbers, the institute said.</span><a href="https://www.nheri.org/how-many-homeschool-students-are-there-in-the-united-states-pre-covid-19-and-post-covid-19/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Only two</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – North Carolina and Montana – had a greater percentage of home-schoolers than Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proportion of home-schoolers varies widely among the commonwealth’s school divisions. It ranges from less than 1 percent in Arlington County and the city of Norton to more than 15 percent in eight mostly rural counties. In Franklin and Highland counties, nearly one of every five students is home-schooled.</span></p>

    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The law on home schooling, and a call to ban it</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Home School Legal Defense Association, based in Loudoun County,</span><a href="https://hslda.org/legal/virginia" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">considers Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a “moderate regulation” state in terms of home schooling.</span> <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/22.1-254.1/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">State law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has two main requirements:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Aug. 15 of each year, parents must file a notice with their school district that they plan to home-school their children. The notice must list the subjects each home-schooler will study.</span></li>
<li>At the end of the school year, parents must submit “evidence of the child’s academic achievement.” That can be a standardized test score or an evaluation by a licensed teacher or “a person with a master’s degree or higher in an academic discipline.”</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, parents generally need only a high school diploma to oversee their child’s home schooling. Even then, there’s an exception: Parents who didn’t graduate from high school can home-school their children if they use “a program of study or curriculum,” such as correspondence or distance-learning courses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Harvard Law School professor recently created a stir among home-schooling advocates when she criticized such laws as too lax and said home schooling should be closely regulated if not banned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an</span><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3391331" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">article in the Arizona Law Review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/10048/Bartholet" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Elizabeth Bartholet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who specializes in child welfare laws, called for a “presumptive ban” on home schooling, saying it “presents both academic concerns and democratic concerns.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a</span><a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/05/law-school-professor-says-there-may-be-a-dark-side-of-homeschooling/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">follow-up interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, she said there is a danger that home-schoolers “are simply not learning basic academic skills or learning about the most basic democratic values of our society or getting the kind of exposure to alternative views that enables them to exercise meaningful choice about their future lives.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Citing “right-wing Christian conservatives” in particular, Bartholet said many home-schooling parents question science and “are extreme ideologues, committed to raising their children within their belief systems isolated from any societal influence.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She noted the dearth of independent, peer-reviewed research to support claims that home-schoolers are as well prepared academically and socially as public school students. “We have zero evidence that, on average, home-schooled students are doing well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bartholet’s views</span><a href="https://youtu.be/lkIL7fpBfxE" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">outraged</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> home-schooling advocates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They pointed out that home-schoolers are diverse: African Americans represent the fastest-growing home-schooling demographic nationwide, and Black and Hispanic families have been more likely than Whites to home-school their children during the pandemic,</span><a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/03/homeschooling-on-the-rise-during-covid-19-pandemic.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">according to a 2020 survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the U.S. Census Bureau.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proponents of home schooling also say</span><a href="http://efinstitute.org/academic-achievement-of-home-schooled-students-literature-review/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">most studies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> show that home-schoolers do better than their regular-school counterparts on achievement tests and in college later on; however, such studies often have been sponsored by home-schooling advocacy groups like the</span><a href="https://www.nheri.org/research-facts-on-homeschooling/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">National Home Education Research Institute</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How and why families home-school children</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many parents say they have firsthand evidence of the benefits of home-schooling. Nikiya Ellis said it has been a far better fit for her son Mali than Barack Obama Elementary School, which serves the family’s Battery Park neighborhood in Richmond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He’s not a disrespectful child at all, but he’s curious and he’s smart,” said Ellis, who is a doula (a home-birth assistant to a midwife) and co-director of the nonprofit organization</span><a href="https://birthincolorrva.org/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Birth in Color RVA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. She said Mali likes to ask questions like “Why?” and “Can I do it another way?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mali attended Obama Elementary for kindergarten during the 2019-20 academic year, and his inquisitiveness got him in trouble, Ellis said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want our children to be free-thinking and creative,” she said, but Mali’s teacher “felt that he wasn’t listening and he was being defiant because he was questioning her.” As a result, Mali received frequent demerits (repeatedly being placed “on red” in the school’s behavioral management system) and was moved to the back of the classroom, Ellis said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said Mali wanted to learn, but the school’s chief lesson was “obey authority, don’t question anything, sit in your seat and be quiet – and if you don’t, you’ll be punished.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she picked up Mali from school in the afternoon, Ellis said, “Sometimes, we were literally in tears.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the 2020-21 academic year, Richmond Public Schools, like other districts, held classes only online. “That did not work for Mali at all,” Ellis said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So for the current year, Ellis developed a home-schooling system that she believes does work. It has several components, including:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• A curriculum from</span><a href="https://www.acellusacademy.com/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Acellus Academy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a popular learning program for home-schoolers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mali is taking classes in math, English, robotics and Spanish. The program involves online coursework, working independently and studying with guidance from Ellis; her partner, Duron Chavis; and, on weekends, Mali’s father, David Holmes. (Ellis and Holmes are divorced.)</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• Activities at the</span><a href="https://culturalrootsco-op.com/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Cultural Roots Homeschool Cooperative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which emphasizes the “cultural attributes, traditions and histories of Black and Brown communities.” Mali takes classes in art, cultural studies, science, yoga and capoeira, a Brazilian martial art that combines elements of dance, acrobatics and music. Mali also plays chess and outdoor games with friends at the co-op.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• Lessons mostly in reading and writing with Dr. Hollee Freeman, an</span><a href="https://youtu.be/ZEi03HojVi8" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">award-winning teacher</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and executive director of the regional</span><a href="https://www.mymsic.org/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">MathScience Innovation Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Mali is reading on a fifth-grade level, Ellis said.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">• Weekly visits to the Libbie Mill Library to check out books, participate in scavenger hunts (finding pictures among the stacks) and meet in a study room to work on academic projects.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• Field trips to venues such as the Science Museum of Virginia, where Mali recently watched an immersive film about Antarctica and played the role of a pit crew member for an</span><a href="https://smv.org/explore/things-to-do/hot-wheels-race-win/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">exhibit about Hot Wheels</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, racing and velocity. “When the environment is a fun, welcoming one, Mali doesn’t even notice when he’s actually ‘learning,’” Ellis said. “He takes it all in and is eager to know more.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That schedule is packed but doable, Ellis said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She is a busy person: Ellis and Chavis are urban farmers who manage three community gardens and an orchard, and Ellis is not only a doula but also a beekeeper and a member of a</span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/richmond-city/healthy-childbirth-and-infancy/#collectiveimpact" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">regional task force</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on maternal and infant health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Ellis said she and Chavis are both self-employed and have some flexibility in their work schedules.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, Ellis said she now realizes that learning can happen at any place at any time. “I never thought that a trip to the grocery store could actually teach my son about math and money,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, Ellis might give Mali $5 to buy certain items on their shopping list – and if he can come in under budget, he can use the leftover money to purchase a piece of candy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another strategy is to let children make some of their own decisions about learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mali hated reading the books he was assigned in public school because “it wasn’t anything that he was interested in,” Ellis said. Now, she said, Mali gets to choose age-appropriate graphic novels. “He loves it, and now he’s going through books.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tera and Silas Thomas, who have been home-schooling their three school-age sons for the past two years, also say their children are learning a lot and enjoying it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The family was living in Henrico County, and the boys were attending Springfield Park Elementary School, “when COVID hit and everything got shut down,” Tera Thomas said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even before then, the Thomases were disenchanted with the public schools. For example, Tera Thomas said she felt the teachers assigned a lot of busywork. Her children would come home with a pack of worksheets they had completed at school, she said. “I’d ask, ‘What’s worth keeping?’ And they’d say, ‘None of it.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We wanted there to be more value in their education, more individualized (attention), more freedom to explore and do things,” Tera Thomas said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the Thomases took a</span><a href="https://heav.org/events/homeschool-crash-course/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">home-schooling class from HEAV</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And when the public schools shifted to online instruction because of COVID-19, the family switched to home schooling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last spring, the Thomases moved to Maidens, an unincorporated community in Goochland County. Tera Thomas said the boys – along with their 3-year-old sister, Adah – enjoy the variety of educational activities the family has developed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At times, the children work one on one with their mother at the “mom station.” Other times, they work independently – perhaps with a curriculum program like</span><a href="https://www.hmhco.com/classroom-solutions/homeschool" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Saxon Math</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Sometimes, they all read a book together but do different follow-up activities based on their academic levels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s structured but customized: When a son was grumpy one morning, Tera Thomas told him to take a break, and then they completed the lesson later in the day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Thomases also belong to a home-school co-op, a group of parents who have pooled their resources to organize classes and other learning activities for their children. (Tera Thomas declined to name the co-op because it is a private group and is not seeking more members.) The boys go to the co-op once a week for lessons in science, creative writing, Spanish and American history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are</span><a href="https://heav.org/homeschool-support-group/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">about 100</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> home-school co-ops across Virginia, and they offer a broad range of models. Some are highly structured, emphasizing</span><a href="https://www.classicalconversations.com/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">classical education</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or</span><a href="https://www.homeschool-life.com/va/gracechurchcoop/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">religious orientation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Other co-ops focus on</span><a href="https://thesteamschool.org/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">creative and critical thinking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or</span><a href="https://www.faym-music.com/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">music</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://rsahomeschool.org/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">performing arts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Such support groups provide a sense of community for home-schoolers and their parents, Tera Thomas said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s this idea that home-schoolers are unsocialized – weirdos, for lack of a better term. But there’s a huge network of people” involved in home-schooling, she said. “We have more of a community of friends and parents than we ever did in the three years that we were at Springfield Park.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the co-op, parents share ideas on how to facilitate learning. “You don’t really get to have those conversations in the public schools,” Tera Thomas said. “You just are kind of at the mercy of whatever they’re choosing to do – ‘one size fits all.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of their home-schooling adventure, the Thomases have taken their children on trips – not only to nearby sites like Colonial Williamsburg and Pamplin Historical Park but also cross-country in the family’s pop-up camper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tera Thomas said her son Jude is “very into Davy Crockett and Daniel Boone” – and the boy was captivated when the family visited the stomping grounds of those two frontiersmen in Tennessee.</span></p>

(Photo courtesy of Tera Thomas)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On another occasion, the Thomases spent a “homesteading weekend” on a farm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My kids came home knowing how to raise chickens and process chickens and rabbits. It was hands-on. I think by the time we were done, my 10-year-old had processed 30 chickens from live to packaged and ready for market,” Tera Thomas said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Some people might not see value in that, like ‘How is that teaching you math and other things?’ But it does teach a level of work ethic and self-sustainability and how to take care of animals well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experiential learning also is a crucial component of home-schooling for Carlea Bauman and Geoff Bishop’s children, Isabel and Bodhi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bishop works at Marriott International’s headquarters in Bethesda, Maryland; Bauman has worked for various nonprofits and currently is a director for</span><a href="https://www.sambhalius.org/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Sambhali U.S.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which helps women and girls in Rajasthan, India.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They started looking into home schooling after COVID-19 disrupted work and school in the spring of 2020.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_29969" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/PVF-haul.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-29969" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/PVF-haul-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/PVF-haul-300x225.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/PVF-haul-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/PVF-haul-768x576.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/PVF-haul-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/PVF-haul.jpg 2016w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Bodhi and Isabel Bishop taking leftover produce from a nearby farm to Food for Others, a food bank in Fairfax County.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the Fairfax County Public Schools went virtual for the 2020-21 academic year, “they did the very best that could be done,” Bauman said. Even so, she said, “it was awful” for Isabel and Bodhi, who were “anchored to their chairs for eight hours a day.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her research, Bauman found that “there is no one way to do home schooling – which is great but also terrifying.” So for the current school year, she developed a program customized for her children.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Isabel and Bodhi (a name that means enlightenment in Buddhism), home-schooling has included lessons with their parents – Bauman’s strong suits are English and history – and online learning programs such as</span><a href="https://science.mom/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Science Mom</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Math Dad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The children learn a lot of their own, too. In a</span><a href="https://vahomeschoolers.org/im-a-homeschooling-noob" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">blog post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Bauman recounted how Isabel learned math by playing a favorite video game: “She figured out that if she didn’t spend any (of the virtual) money and instead worked on her tasks with other players, her money would start to grow.” In her head, Isabel even calculated the amount to the penny.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The payoff, according to the blog: “Financial literacy AND double-digit multiplication. In a video game. That she was playing on her own. Because she wanted to.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such “</span><a href="https://www.homeschool.com/blog/2019/11/gameschooling-by-subject/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">game-schooling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">“ has become popular among home-schoolers. Bodhi and Isabel have been playing</span><a href="https://www.proofmathgame.com/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Proof</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – “a pretty fun math game,” explained Bauman, “and I say this as a person who never liked math.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Mondays, Bauman usually takes her children on a field trip – for example, to the</span><a href="https://www.usbg.gov/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Botanic Garden</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Assateague Island National Seashore and historic sites like Jamestown.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The visit to the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Historical Park in Maryland was especially memorable for Isabel. After holding hands with a statue of the</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harriet_Tubman" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">famed abolitionist</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who escaped slavery and then rescued other enslaved people, Isabel told her mother “that she could feel Harriet Tubman’s spirit,” Bauman said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bauman and her children also do community service projects together – hauling leftover produce from a nearby farm to a </span><a href="https://foodforothers.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">food bank</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for example and conducting a neighborhood food drive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The children aren’t the only beneficiaries of home schooling, their mother said. “I’m really getting this quality time with them that I will never get back, and I’m so lucky and grateful for that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bauman is a proponent of self-directed education – sometimes called “</span><a href="https://www.educationcorner.com/what-is-unschooling.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unschooling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">“ – in which children follow their own interests at their own pace, without explicit direction from adults.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrea Cubelo-McKay also champions that philosophy. Besides heading</span><a href="https://vahomeschoolers.org/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">VaHomeschoolers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, she founded the</span><a href="https://embarkcenter.org/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Embark Center for Self-Directed Education</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which provides mentoring, tutoring and work space for home-schoolers and holds</span><a href="https://embarkcenter.org/classes-and-activities/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">classes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on subjects from creative writing and guitar to cooking and skateboarding. The center, established in 2017, is in Leesburg in Loudoun County.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Society often tells young people they are</span><a href="https://gamerant.com/joe-rogan-video-games/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">wasting their time playing video games</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But the Embark Center</span><a href="https://youtu.be/LB_s_1jPJG0" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">encourages kids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to play Minecraft, Fortnite or Roblox – on grounds that such games can teach academic skills such as math and engineering as well as personal and social skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cubelo-McKay, a former therapist and Montessori teacher, said the center serves students who felt bored and unchallenged, confined and frustrated, or perhaps bullied in traditional schools. Whatever the reason, she said, a regular school setting wasn’t working for them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One such student was Becca Berglie, 18, who said she stopped attending Fairfax County Public Schools when she was a high school junior in 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve always struggled with my mental health. I’ve had extreme anxiety and depression throughout my life, and school just made those issues bigger for me,” Berglie said. “I’ve always been an outside-the-box thinker and always very independent – not wanting to do something that somebody told me to do when I didn’t see value in it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online, she discovered the Embark Center and the affiliated </span><a href="https://liberatedlearners.net/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liberated Learners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> network. With support from her parents, Berglie said, she left the public school system, registered as a home-schooler and became a self-directed learner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She participated in activities at the Embark Center and even helped lead a class in American sign language, which she had studied in high school. More importantly, Berglie said, the center mentored her on how to pursue her career goals involving agricultural education and youth development.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_29970" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:225px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/chicken.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-29970" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/chicken-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/chicken-225x300.jpg 225w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/chicken.jpg 469w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Becca Berglie holding a chicken at Fairfax County’s Frying Pan Farm Park. (Photo courtesy of Becca Berglie)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a home-schooler, Berglie said she had more time to work with</span><a href="https://ext.vt.edu/4h-youth.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">4-H</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a leadership and service program for young people, and at</span><a href="https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/parks/frying-pan-park/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Frying Pan Farm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Fairfax County park that has horses, cows and other animals and reflects what rural life was like a century ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Embark overall gave me a place of belonging, support and a place that I could learn about myself and heal,” Berglie said. She said the center also helped her navigate the college application process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s confusing for anyone but especially for a non-traditional student,” Berglie said. “Everything is made for that in-the-box traditional student. It can be scary and confusing because they’re not making it for you. They’re making it for the people that stayed on the conveyor belt.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Berglie graduated – or “moved on” in Embark Center parlance – last June. She now attends </span><a href="https://www.nvcc.edu/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northern Virginia Community College</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where she said she feels better prepared than other students because of her self-directed education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After community college, Berglie has her eyes set on Virginia Tech, where she hopes to study agricultural sciences, </span><a href="https://www.alce.vt.edu/student-info/undergraduate/leadership-social-change.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">leadership and social change</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m extremely passionate about being able to provide opportunities for other youth to get to know themselves and learn and grow,” she said.</span></p>

<p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden’s giant social and climate spending bill on Thursday night appeared stalled in the U.S. Senate for some time to come, a deep frustration for congressional Democrats who aimed to pass the ambitious package by the Christmas recess.</p>
<p>At risk also is a temporary expansion of the child tax credit, the last payment of which was made Wednesday. The expansion was included in Biden’s bill, known as Build Back Better, and Democrats in the evenly divided Senate say they can’t pass it separately because Republicans won’t support it.</p>
<p>In addition, the Wall Street Journal reported that a key immigration provision added by the House to the bill has been rejected by the Senate parliamentarian.</p>
<p>“We strongly disagree with the Senate parliamentarian’s interpretation of our immigration proposal, and we will pursue every means to achieve a path to citizenship in the Build Back Better Act,&#8221; Democratic Sens. Chuck Schumer of New York, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Bob Menendez of New Jersey, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico and Alex Padilla of California said in a joint statement in reaction.</p>
<p>Biden in a statement on Thursday night said that he spoke earlier in the day with congressional leaders about his negotiations with Sen. Joe Manchin III, the moderate West Virginia Democrat whose objections to the funding of the expanded child tax credit have held up the Build Back Better measure.</p>
<p>“My team and I are having ongoing discussions with Senator Manchin; that work will continue next week,” Biden said. “It takes time to finalize these agreements, prepare the legislative changes, and finish all the parliamentary and procedural steps needed to enable a Senate vote. We will advance this work together over the days and weeks ahead; Leader Schumer and I are determined to see the bill successfully on the floor as early as possible.”</p>

<p>During Thursday’s White House press briefing, Deputy Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the administration would not go into details on a timeline for when the bill would be passed.</p>
<p>“The president is determined to get this done as soon as possible,” she said.</p>
<p>Negotiations have foundered over objections by Manchin, who has said the price tag for “Build Back Better” should account for a 10-year expansion of the child tax credit, which would help <a href="https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/104743/expanding-the-child-tax-credit-could-lift-millions-of-children-out-of-poverty_0.pdf" target="_blank">lift millions of children and families out of poverty</a>.</p>
<p>The bill now includes just a one-year expansion, through 2022, and adding another nine years of the revamped tax credit would push the overall cost far beyond what Manchin has said he would accept.</p>
<p>Manchin <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/13/politics/joe-manchin-congress-social-safety-net-bill/index.html" target="_blank">told CNN </a>earlier this week that Build Back Better should be &#8220;within the limits of what we can afford.”</p>
<p>Manchin also has objected to the inclusion of a universal paid parental and family leave provision.</p>
<p>The Congressional Budget Office has estimated the bill would spend about $1.7 trillion over 10 years. Budget analysts project another roughly $500 billion in tax breaks, putting the total cost at about $2.2 trillion over a decade, higher than earlier estimates from the White House.</p>
<p>The bill includes historic investments in child care and universal pre-K for 3-and-4 year-olds. It would also for the first time give Medicare the ability to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies on the price of some prescription drugs, and offer coverage of hearing aids for seniors, among other things.</p>
<p>“Build Back Better is urgently needed to lower the cost of prescription drugs, health care, child care, and elder care,” Biden said. “Notwithstanding the unrelenting Republican obstruction — not a single Republican is willing to move forward on the bill — I am determined to see this bill enacted into law, to give America’s families the breathing room they deserve. We also need urgent action on climate change and other priorities in the Build Back Better plan.”</p>
<p>However, it’s become unclear if an extension to the child tax credit will be included, given Manchin’s stance.</p>
<p>When a <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/joe-manchin-child-tax-credit_n_61ba3c4de4b0456499dcdff6" target="_blank">Huffington Post reporter </a>asked Manchin Wednesday if he supported the child tax credit, Manchin lost his temper and did not answer the question.</p>
<p>“This is bullshit,” he said. “You’re bullshit.”</p>
<p>Democrats temporarily expanded the child tax credit earlier this year under the American Rescue Plan from $2,000 to $3,600 for kids under 6, and to $3,000 for kids between 6 and 17.</p>
<p>Republicans have objected to the overall cost of the bill.</p>
<p>The legislation also includes $555 billion in climate spending and tax credits, primarily in the form of $320 billion in new and extended clean energy tax credits.</p>
<p>Rep. Kathy Castor, (D-Fla.), is also urging the Senate to not remove the ban on offshore drilling off the Atlantic, Pacific and the eastern Gulf of Mexico from its version of the bill. Manchin has raised opposition to offshore drilling bans, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/16/climate/manchin-offshore-drilling-climate.html" target="_blank">according to the New York Times</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a moral obligation to urgently reduce our carbon dioxide and methane pollution, which are fueling catastrophic extreme weather events across the country,” Castor said in a statement. “That&#8217;s why we must permanently ban drilling on our coasts and address the pollution spewed by hundreds of abandoned, leaky rigs and pipelines in the Gulf of Mexico.”</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, has not yet scheduled a vote on the bill, which is also undergoing scrutiny by the parliamentarian so that it complies with a process called reconciliation, which allows passage with a simple majority in the evenly divided Senate.</p>
<p>Schumer said he met with Biden and other Democratic senators about the Senate stalemate. “All I’m saying is that we had a very good discussion on voting rights and BBB,” Schumer said, according to Capitol Hill pool reports.</p>
<p>Sen. Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota Democrat who chairs the Senate Rules Committee, said that she had a virtual meeting with the president and vice president, along with Manchin, on passing voting protections.</p>
<p>Immigration policy also hangs in the balance.</p>
<p>The House passed <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2021/11/19/house-democrats-pass-bidens-1-85-trillion-build-back-better-plan/" target="_blank">its version of Build Back Better in late November</a>, and wrapped in temporary work and deportation protections through a parole program that allows some undocumented people to change their status to prevent deportation.</p>
<p>The Senate is now waiting for a decision by the Senate <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/RS/RS20544" target="_blank">parliamentarian</a>, Elizabeth MacDonough, who is nonpartisan and provides advice and help on Senate rules and procedures, on whether the immigration provisions in the package can be passed through reconciliation.</p>
<p>However, the Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/senate-parliamentarian-rejects-democrats-immigration-proposal-in-2-trillion-bill-11639696968" target="_blank">reported</a> Thursday night that MacDonough rejected Democrats&#8217; immigration proposals.</p>
<p>Durbin, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said that he was “disappointed” about the parliamentarian’s ruling, according to Capitol Hill pool reports.</p>
<p>“We’re considering what options remain,” he said.</p>
<p><a href="https://lailluminator.com/2021/11/26/immigration-protections-in-bidens-social-policy-bill-face-a-new-test-in-the-senate/" target="_blank">Many immigration advocates and House progressives were not satisfied </a>with those provisions as they pushed Congress to include a pathway to citizenship for millions of undocumented people in the bill.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.penncapital-star.com/dc-bureau/immigration-reform-blocked-from-reconciliation-bill-in-congress-but-democrats-vow-to-try-again/" target="_blank">Democrats have tried</a> to include a pathway to citizenship for millions of undocumented people through the reconciliation package, but were blocked by the Senate parliamentarian from including those provisions.</p>
<p>Many advocates and progressive Democrats have argued that the parliamentarian is merely an adviser and that the Senate could overrule her opinion.</p>
<p>“Throughout the entire reconciliation process, we have worked to ensure that immigration reform was not treated as an afterthought,&#8221; Schumer and others said in their statement Thursday night.</p>
<p>&#8220;The majority of Americans support our efforts to provide legal status for millions of undocumented immigrants in the United States because it would raise wages, create good-paying jobs, enrich our economy, and improve the lives of all Americans.</p>
<p>“The American people understand that fixing our broken immigration system is a moral and economic imperative, and we stand with the millions of immigrant families across the country who deserve better and for whom we will not stop fighting.”</p>

Federal officials first passed legislation requiring states to transition to a centralized 988 number.(Jane Norman/ States Newsroom D.C. Bureau)</p><p>WASHINGTON — When paid family leave was briefly dropped from congressional Democrats’ massive social spending and climate bill earlier this fall, the outcry was swift.</p>
<p>Women and caregivers suddenly were calling lawmakers and advocates, and they were sharing their own stories on social media in huge numbers, said Dawn Huckelbridge, director of Paid Leave for All, a national advocacy group, during a virtual event with reporters on Tuesday.</p>
<p>“I think people assumed this was a given, that why would you drop paid leave in a pandemic?” Huckelbridge said. “And when that happened, there was outrage.”</p>
<p>She added: “Women, caregivers, have been dealing with unimaginable circumstances these last few years. And I think it felt tone-deaf to them.”</p>
<p>The Democrats’ &#8220;Build Back Better&#8221; bill that passed the U.S. House did ultimately restore four weeks of paid leave for workers who need to care for a new baby or ailing loved one or recover from their own serious illness.</p>
<p>But that provision is <a href="https://ncpolicywatch.com/2021/11/24/how-paid-leave-a-tax-cut-for-the-rich-and-more-could-get-axed-from-bidens-social-policy-bill/" target="_blank">at risk of deletion in the Senate, </a>due to opposition from Sen. Joe Manchin III, (D-W.Va.).</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Payback at the polls?</h4>

	
<p>Huckelbridge and other advocates and Democratic pollsters who spoke to reporters on Tuesday said a failure to take action on a national paid leave program could have significant political consequences for Democrats in 2022.</p>
<p>The U.S. is one of only a few countries in the world — and the only wealthy country — that does not have a national paid family leave program.</p>
<p>Yet creation of such a program is overwhelmingly popular across party lines, particularly with younger voters and among suburban women in key battleground states.</p>
<p>“It may not be bipartisan in the Congress, but it is bipartisan with the public, particularly in America&#8217;s suburbs,” said Celinda Lake, of Lake Research Partners, who was the leading pollster for Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign.</p>
<p>It’s also one of the most popular provisions in the Build Back Better package. Research from Global Strategy Group, a Democratic consulting firm, found the issue has support that’s on par with allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices.</p>
<p>Paid leave also was the only provision tested from that legislative package other than the Medicare provision that gained majority support from voters in both parties — a rare feat in an extremely politically divided era.</p>
<p>In the Global Strategy Group’s survey of battleground voters, Democrats trailed Republicans by 3 percentage points in a generic question of which party’s candidate a voter is more likely to pick.</p>
<p>But in a follow-up question specifically comparing a Democrat who supports paid leave to a Republican who does not, Democrats hold a 13-point edge, said Joey Teitelbaum, lead researcher on the group’s battleground polling.</p>
<p>Teitelbaum said the research found the issue is one that may motivate voters who would otherwise stay home, but only if those voters see Democrats following through on promises of action on paid leave.</p>
<p>One-third of voters in the survey said they would rather stay home on Election Day than vote for a Senate candidate who opposes access to paid leave, with higher shares of women ages 18 to 44 and Black female voters agreeing with that statement.</p>
<p>One key group of swing voters in the 2022 elections, Lake said, will be White, non-college-educated women ages 40 to 65 — a group that has many women in the “sandwich” years of caring for children and aging parents.</p>
<p>Another key group will be women of color and younger women under 40, “who lean very Democratic, but also wonder what the Democrats are doing for them,” she added.</p>
<p>“So whether you&#8217;re talking about the strategy of persuasion, or you&#8217;re talking about the strategy of turnout, this is one of the few issues that is at the top of both of those agendas,” Lake said.</p>

    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Manchin opposition</h4>

	
<p>Moving paid leave from a campaign promise to a policy achievement will take a shift by Manchin, who has said he supports the idea of paid leave but does not back creating a new national program in the pending legislation.</p>
<p>Huckelbridge said Democratic Sens. Patty Murray of Washington and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who have been heavily involved in work on a paid leave program, have told her and others that they believe Manchin is “movable” on the issue.</p>
<p>But they acknowledge that the current bill — which would be passed through the reconciliation process, allowing Democrats to approve it without any Republican votes — is the only path forward on the national level.</p>
<p>“We have to do this in Build Back Better. There is no bipartisan path anytime soon that will deliver real results for families,” Huckelbridge said.</p>
<p>If that fails, advocates say the movement has grown stronger during the past year. In some states, the fight may move to the state legislature, describing a rise in state-level interest.</p>
<p>“We will see this be an issue in state legislatures and at the ballot box in states,” said Vicki Shabo, senior fellow for paid leave policy and strategy at the think tank New America. “And the federal issue is not going away either.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I mean, obviously,” said the eight-year-old from Bon Air. “Who wouldn’t be?” She got her first dose of Pfizer’s pediatric vaccine on Wednesday night, and besides the hour-long wait at her local Walgreens, the process went relatively smoothly. The shot itself felt like the smallest pinch ever, Pearl said — more like a mosquito bite. And her dad, Tim Barry, was equally relieved to see both Pearl and her 5-year-old sister, June, take their first steps toward full immunization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Pearl probably asks to go to SkyZone two or three times a week,” he said. “So we’re really excited to have this coincide with Christmas and be able to be more free about seeing friends and family.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across Virginia, other parents are feeling the same jubilation. In the first week after federal officials </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/11/03/virginia-families-should-expect-some-delays-in-vaccinating-5-to-11-year-olds-officials-say/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">authorized Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for 5 to 11-year-olds, more than 35,000 children received their first dose — close to 5 percent of the state’s total population in that age group, </span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/see-the-numbers/covid-19-in-virginia/covid-19-vaccine-summary/covid-19-vaccine-demographics/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Virginia Department of Health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rush by many families to embrace pediatric vaccines has been a relief for state health officials after </span><a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/dashboard/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-dashboard/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">national polling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (conducted before the federal authorization) indicated only 27 percent of parents planned to get their children immunized “right away.” VDH hasn’t released demographic data on the 5 to 11-year-olds who have already received their first doses, making it difficult to determine whether </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/covid-booster-shots-in-va-are-outpacing-first-doses-and-nearly-all-have-gone-to/article_b2ce32ce-5ac3-56bb-abde-9a3774fe3d22.html#tracking-source=home-top-story-1?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=89b037e0-45ba-4f4f-b10c-a9fb9aca91af" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">disparities have emerged</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between different groups in getting the shots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, though, health officials have seen “high interest among parents of young children who want to get them protected from COVID-19,” state vaccine coordinator Dr. Danny Avula said in a statement Wednesday. Some health districts are reporting even higher interest in pediatric vaccines than they saw when the shots were authorized for adolescents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our surveys have indicated that about 65 percent of parents intend to vaccinate their children (a higher number than our 12 to 17-year-old age group, interestingly),” Dr. Noelle Bissell, director of four health districts in Southwest Virginia, wrote in a Thursday email. And at least one free health clinic in Richmond, where </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/gracias-a-dios-how-latinos-became-the-most-vaccinated-group-in-richmond-and-henrico-after/article_25ba29ad-ad96-5492-8fe5-0ea30f9e1824.html#tracking-source=home-top-story-1?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=2ce204c1-e395-42c2-af73-5d4fa577b437" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Latinos are now the most-vaccinated group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, reported there’s been no real difference in interest between families of all races and ethnicities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now they’re mainly dealing with people who are hesitant about vaccines in general,” said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rufus Phillips, director of the Virginia Association of Free and Charitable Clinics. Those are the families that local health departments, pediatricians and other providers are preparing to reach out to over the next several weeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think everyone’s expecting to see that big drop-off we’ve seen before,” said Dr. Michael Martin, president of the Virginia chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. “And that’s where the real work begins.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When that decline will occur, though, is difficult to predict. In many areas of the state, clinics have been busy but not overwhelmed with interest as they were in the early days of the adult rollout. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bremo Pharmacy in Henrico, for example, has already held two pediatric clinics and filled up every slot, according to Tana Kaefer, the company’s director of clinical services. But the appointments have trickled in over the course of several days, unlike earlier in the year when the pharmacy would exhaust its capacity within a few hours or less.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I haven’t gotten frantic calls like I did in the beginning with the adult vaccines” Kaefer said. But she said it doesn’t necessarily reflect a lack of demand. For one, state and local health officials now have months of experience in distributing and administering vaccines, which allowed them to quickly set up new clinics and allocate doses among doctor’s offices, pharmacies and other providers. As a result, many parents have a wealth of options when it comes to getting their children vaccinated.</span></p>

(Courtesy of Neighborhood Health)</em></p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some pediatricians, for example, have been highly efficient at distributing doses. Martin said he’s already administered around 100 first shots at his small practice in Northern Virginia, and one office in Charlottesville vaccinated </span><a href="https://www.cbs19news.com/story/45133920/550-covid-shots-given-to-kids-at-drivethru-clinic-in-charlottesville?fbclid=IwAR3C8tlzY39z_4Sn81IWsqna7kmBA8jHHBDoe9xYN0k9HsTVg83uPprjcGw" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 500 children</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at a drive-through clinic on Saturday. Other doctors, though, are still in the process of setting up appointments or haven’t signed up for shipments at all. In many of those cases, families can easily turn to pharmacies or their local health departments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Daniel and Margaret Anne Hinkle, who live outside Lexington with their six-year-old son, it was more convenient to go through his elementary school. While they were waiting to hear back from their pediatrician, they learned the district had scheduled a clinic with help from the health department. On Tuesday, their son took a break from classes to get his first shot, with Margaret Anne there to hold his hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He’s always been very nervous about shots,” she said. “So to have that dynamic instead where he’s going with friends — and honestly, the lollipop afterwards — it really made the whole process smoother. He didn’t even cry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaefer said other parents are holding out for appointments on Friday so their children won’t have to miss school in case of side effects. Some are waiting a week or two so their children’s second doses aren’t due over the week of Thanksgiving. And there are still parents with lingering questions over what to expect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Basim Khan, who directs a </span><a href="https://neighborhoodhealthva.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">network of primary care clinics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Northern Virginia, said the response they’ve had from families so far has been a mix. That’s where outreach becomes particularly important. His practice, Neighborhood Health, just began offering pediatric vaccines at a mobile van that visits community locations including rec centers, faith-based and low-income housing developments. The office is also sending text messages to the families of existing patients, encouraging them to get their children vaccinated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These longitudinal relationships are so important,” he said. “Because sometimes it isn’t just one conversation. And that’s where I think primary care is so critical at this stage of the rollout.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even with the advent of shots for 5 to 11-year-olds, Virginia’s average number of daily doses has been </span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/see-the-numbers/covid-19-in-virginia/covid-19-vaccine-summary/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declining steadily</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> since the start of the month. Still, some regions are struggling to keep up with demand. While there’s no concern about exhausting supplies, health officials allocated pediatric vaccines based on previous demand among 12 to 15-year-olds. As a result, high-uptake counties like Fairfax received more than 59,000 doses in the first week, while the New River Health District received 2,700.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, Bissell said she’s nowhere close to meeting demand in the region, which includes university towns like Radford and Blacksburg. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our pediatrician and pharmacy partners have waiting lists of hundreds for the 5 to 11-year-old vaccines,” she wrote. The district is only expecting 800 additional doses next week, which Bissell distributes among five community providers. Some other pharmacies have gotten shipments directly through the federal government, but she’s urging parents to be patient as more supply comes in over the next several weeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For providers, vaccinating children is key to curbing further infections. Martin pointed to historic success with the </span><a href="https://news.vumc.org/2013/07/11/infant-vaccine-for-pneumonia-helps-protect-elderly/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pneumococcal vaccine for infants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which reduced rates of hospitalization for pneumonia across the board. The same thing is true for the COVID-19 vaccine, which can  </span><a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/covid19-vaccine-what-parents-need-to-know" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prevent children from spreading the virus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and reduces the risk it will continue to evolve into new strains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But for many parents, it’s also the first glimmer of hope after nearly two years of virtual school, missed sports practices, and carefully guarding their children against potential exposures. It’s exciting for kids, too. Meredith Henne Baker, a Chesterfield County parent, said one of her daughters discussed the vaccine in her second-grade class on Monday. It was a French immersion session, and her daughter said everyone was <em>très excité</em></span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">about the opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Reddish-purple county, and the kids are completely excited about getting a shot,” Henne Baker wrote in an email. “There’s been a lot of coverage of hesitancy, but there’s some serious polio-vax level enthusiasm out here too.”</span></p>

</p><p><strong>By Elizabeth Cropper</strong></p>
<p>As a single mother, I’ve sometimes struggled to provide for my family. Things became even more difficult six years ago, when I sustained a hip injury while working at my job in a warehouse. This accident left me permanently disabled with debilitating chronic pain and unable to work.</p>
<p>My son and I live with my mother, and money is tight. When you live on a fixed income that is just barely enough to support a child, you have to choose which bills you will pay and which bills you will be late on.</p>
<p>It’s not just lower-income households like mine that are struggling. <a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA308-3.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA308-3.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1635385657411000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG4-fQUnnjovHEBJjJBkTxTvivPoQ">About 30 percent of American households</a> across all income levels report difficulty paying their bills on time. For many of us, the expanded child tax credit couldn’t have come at a better time.</p>
<p>In July, I used the first installment of the monthly CTC to pay the WiFi and cell phone bills I had fallen behind on. Like many teenage boys, my son outgrows all of his clothes within what seems like an instant. He grew six inches in one year, and by the start of school he could only fit into a pair of sandals. I used the August CTC payment to buy him new clothes and shoes, especially to keep him warm as winter approaches.</p>
<p>In September, I used the CTC to pay for gas to drive my son to several different specialist medical appointments. We live in a rural town with few medical resources, so each visit included driving upwards of 90 minutes each way. I had planned to use the monthly tax credit to start giving him an allowance and teach him how to handle money. But as many parents know, there are always unexpected expenses that come with raising a child.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons why I prefer to receive the CTC in monthly payments as opposed to a lump sum once a year. My family needs access to this money year round for the bills that I can never seem to catch up on and for unexpected expenses. The monthly installments also help me to better manage my family’s finances. When you spend the year forgoing many basic needs, and then you have a lump sum of money at once, that money runs out quickly.</p>
<p>The monthly CTC payments are helping families across America make ends meet. <a href="https://parentstogetheraction.org/2021/08/10/new-survey-90-of-parents-receiving-the-child-tax-credit-said-funds-were-helpful-or-made-a-huge-difference-in-their-families-lives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://parentstogetheraction.org/2021/08/10/new-survey-90-of-parents-receiving-the-child-tax-credit-said-funds-were-helpful-or-made-a-huge-difference-in-their-families-lives/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1635385657411000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF5oP7LaRG0XzlnIPJb8-MkxF3ENQ">Nine out of 10 </a>parents reported that the CTC was helpful to their family’s economic security. And <a href="https://parentstogetheraction.org/2021/08/10/new-survey-90-of-parents-receiving-the-child-tax-credit-said-funds-were-helpful-or-made-a-huge-difference-in-their-families-lives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://parentstogetheraction.org/2021/08/10/new-survey-90-of-parents-receiving-the-child-tax-credit-said-funds-were-helpful-or-made-a-huge-difference-in-their-families-lives/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1635385657411000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF5oP7LaRG0XzlnIPJb8-MkxF3ENQ">eight in 10</a> used the monthly advance payments immediately for basic needs such as food, rent, and child care.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/08/13/fact-sheet-president-bidens-build-back-better-agenda-will-deliver-historic-investments-in-american-families-and-communities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/08/13/fact-sheet-president-bidens-build-back-better-agenda-will-deliver-historic-investments-in-american-families-and-communities/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1635385657411000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFlz7EZJMvXypOD4FTwfGY9OYCAlQ">President Joe Biden’s Build Back Better agenda</a> includes extending the monthly advance CTC until 2025. This would be vital to my family because it helps me to provide for my son without taking on debt or being late on my bills. I&#8217;ve always done the best I could, but as time goes on, child rearing gets more expensive.</p>
<p>There was one more important expenditure I made with my CTC check: The start of the new school year fell around the same time as my son’s 14th birthday. With the high cost of supplies for in-person learning, I worried that I wouldn’t be able to buy him a birthday present, but it turns out I could afford school supplies and even a small gift for my son.</p>
<p>The CTC is by no means the solution to all of our problems, but it’s making our lives better. It’s helping make small things possible — like being able to give your kid a new backpack and Halloween costume — and that makes parenting just a little bit easier.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — Smaller needles. Redesigned shipments to ease the storage needs in pediatricians’ offices. And enough vials of the COVID-19 vaccine to inoculate the 28 million U.S. children between ages 5 and 11.</p>
<p>Those are among the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/20/fact-sheet-biden-administration-announces-update-on-operational-planning-for-covid-19-vaccinations-for-kids-ages-5-11/" target="_blank">plans</a> announced by the White House Wednesday as federal and state officials prepare for a regulatory decision to be made on the COVID-19 shot that Pfizer reformulated for younger children.</p>
<p>A long-awaited decision on a vaccine for that age group is expected in the coming weeks. A Food and Drug Administration advisory panel is set to consider authorizing the shot on Oct. 26, and after the FDA’s green light, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention then will issue its guidelines for use.</p>
<p>“We know millions of parents have been waiting for COVID-19 vaccine for kids in this age group,” said Jeff Zients, the White House’s COVID-19 response coordinator, during a briefing Wednesday morning. “And should the FDA and CDC authorize the vaccine, we will be ready to get shots in arms.”</p>
<p>Making another age group eligible for vaccines could be significant in preventing another spike in infections this winter.</p>
<p>The rate of infections and deaths has been falling after a summer surge caused by the delta variant, but colder weather and the winter holidays will lead to more indoor gatherings, where the virus that causes COVID-19 can spread quickly.</p>
<p>“If we can get the overwhelming majority of those 28 million children vaccinated, I think that would play a major role in diminishing the spread of infection in the community,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Shipments to states</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Should the FDA authorize Pfizer’s shot for kids, 15 million doses will begin to ship to states, so providers will be ready to launch the next phase of the vaccination campaign as soon as the CDC weighs in.</p>
<p>The doses for children between 5 and 11 will be different from the ones approved for those 12 and older.</p>
<p>Pfizer has sought authorization for that younger age group to receive one-third of the amount given to adults and teens, and the vials will have a different color cap to distinguish them from the adult version.</p>
<p>Instead of the larger shipments of the adult version that initially were sent out, spurring concerns about potentially wasted doses in areas with fewer residents or less demand, the cartons shipping to pediatricians will include just 10 vials with 10 doses each. Those doses can be stored for up to 10 weeks at standard refrigeration temperatures.</p>
<p>The shipments also will come with all the supplies needed to administer shots to kids, the Biden administration emphasized in a memo outlining its operational plans. That includes needles designed for smaller arms.</p>
<p>Once the shipments go out to states, the doses will be distributed to providers, including pediatricians, children’s hospitals, pharmacies, and community health centers.</p>
<p>Zients said officials are seeking to ensure parents and children can go to a trusted and familiar site to get their vaccine. More than 25,000 pediatric and primary care provider sites will provide vaccinations, he said.</p>
<p>The administration also is working with state and local officials to set up vaccination sites at schools, and with children’s hospitals and other sites to host clinics during evenings and on weekends to inoculate kids at times that don’t require missing work or school.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed"></h4>

	State reimbursements[/s</strong>ubhed]
<p>States can receive reimbursement through the Federal Emergency Management Agency to cover their costs related to setting up vaccination sites, buying supplies, and conducting outreach campaigns.</p>
<p>The White House’s planning efforts also include ways to ensure parents are receiving scientifically sound information about the vaccines amid waves of misinformation, and to create forums for them to ask questions.</p>
<p>A third of parents, or 34 percent, say they will vaccinate their 5-to-11-year-old child “right away” once a vaccine is authorized for that age group, according to <a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-trends-among-children-school/" target="_blank">a September survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>Another third say they will “wait and see” how the vaccine is working, and one in four say they definitely won’t get their children in that age group vaccinated.</p>

<p>Here’s a notice a new mom shouldn’t receive:</p>
<p>“Your doctor ordered a test to see if the membranes around your baby were leaking.  The procedure is not approvable under the plan clinical criteria because there is no proof or not enough proof that it works as well as other tests to check for ROM.  For this reason, the request is denied as investigational and not medically necessary.”</p>
<p>Let’s start at the beginning: On Jan. 4, I went to an ultrasound appointment with my midwife. I was 38 weeks into a high-risk pregnancy, having spent my third trimester with twice-weekly appointments to monitor me and my son’s health. I had two days left of work. I’d worked retail full time through the pregnancy, and an induction was scheduled for a week later.</p>
<p>My midwife was concerned about the amount of amniotic fluid I had been leaking, and wanted me to immediately go to my hospital to be checked for signs of labor. I called my husband and warned him to be on standby should I need him to meet me at the hospital. I was quickly shown to a room, and tested for amniotic fluid leakage.</p>
<p>My mind raced as I laid waiting on the test results. The year before, I lost my first pregnancy when my water broke at 19 weeks. My body went into labor within 24 hours and my daughter was stillborn on my 25th birthday. This was a major factor in my high-risk pregnancy status, as well as my midwife’s concern.</p>
<p>Finally, the results came back: I was not in labor. I was sent away with instructions to take it easy until my induction on the 11th.</p>
<p>On Jan. 11 we welcomed my son into the world. It was my husband and I in face masks — no visitors were allowed in the hospital. We brought him home and entered a new chapter of sleeplessness, joy and lots of poopy diapers. We were tired but we were together.</p>
<p>Of course, the bills eventually rolled in. We were prepared for that: It cost us over $2,000 after insurance to lose our daughter at the hospital, and even more for the anesthesiologist. Several bills took additional back-and-forth with the hospital and the insurance company to get them settled. Sometimes not enough information was on file, sometimes the insurance company made mistakes. So I was tasked with combing through every bill and explanation of benefits that came in the mail.</p>
<p>Eventually, for my son’s birth, we paid well over $4,000, meeting my individual deductible and approaching our family deductible.</p>
<p>One bill, however, bounced between the insurance company and the hospital several times and was still not yet covered.</p>
<p>The leftover bill was for Jan. 4, the day I was tested for “rupture of membrane” — or as the rest of us call it, my water breaking. The insurer — called Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield — repeatedly said they needed more information, and eventually denied the claim due to lack of proof that the test was necessary. That’s the note I got above.</p>
<p>I filed an appeal and had my midwife’s office send over the notes from the visit that spurred the hospital followup.</p>
<p>A notice from my insurance company dated Sept. 17 arrived on Sept. 23. It stated that on Sept. 22 a meeting would be held to review my appeal. The notice said I could attend the meeting via phone to present my grievance and answer any questions from the committee, as long as I reached out by Sept. 20. I would have loved to have stated my case, but that letter arrived on Sept. 23.</p>
<p>The committee deemed the procedure unnecessary, which meant we were stuck with the bill.</p>
<p>This isn’t the biggest claim we’ve had to pay; without insurance this bill is $675. That loss won’t destroy my little family, but it makes a difference. I still saw red when I got the verdict in those big professional words.</p>
<p>I want to know what they think I should have done when my midwife expressed concern and told me to go to the hospital. Should I have just gone to work instead?</p>
<p>When I got to the hospital and was told we were going to do an “evaluation of cervicovaginal fluid for specific amniotic fluid protein,” should I have said that wasn’t the correct test to perform?</p>
<p>Should I have just forgotten that I had an extremely unlikely premature labor before?</p>
<p>I’m going to do another appeal before biting my tongue and paying the bill. This year I’ve had to spend so much time with deductibles and billing summaries, and checking the work of people I don’t know, on bills I don’t understand, because each decision results in hundreds or sometimes thousands of dollars out of our pocket.</p>
<p>I’ve spent countless hours on this while breastfeeding on my couch.</p>
<p>This is not my first time dealing with bills that don’t feel fair. I once had a former apartment property manager contact me two years after moving out, claiming my roommate and I owed $1,200 in repairs. Once, after paying off a hospital stay, I was billed $900 over a year later for the physician who asked me inappropriate questions and prescribed me medications for diagnoses I did not have. That doesn’t even come close to what my student loans are going to get out of me.</p>
<p>I don’t even know any names of the people who decided that my claim was unnecessary, so maybe I shouldn’t take it personally.</p>
<p>But it’s hard not to, because this was my health and my baby’s health on the line.</p>
<p>In the final paragraph of the letter detailing their decision it says, “What’s next? This decision means this service isn’t covered by your health plan. It doesn’t mean that you should stop getting medical care. Only you and your doctor can decide what’s best for you.”</p>
<p>Funny, because it doesn’t feel that way.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — The coronavirus pandemic has brought heartbreaking consequences for millions of U.S. children, even as most avoided serious illness themselves, pediatric experts told Congress on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Take, for instance, a young girl from Tennessee named Sophia, whose story was relayed by Dr. Margaret Rush, president of Monroe Carell Jr. Children’s Hospital at Vanderbilt University.</p>
<p>Within a few days after Sophia started kindergarten, she contracted a mild case of COVID-19, Rush said. She didn’t require hospitalization, but her parents, both unvaccinated, soon became critically ill.</p>
<p>Neither of Sophia’s parents survived, making her among 1.5 million children worldwide who have lost a main caregiver to COVID-19, Rush said.</p>
<p>“Sophia, now five, will carry this pain forever,” Rush said during the hearing held by the U.S. House Energy and Commerce’s Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. “There should be no question that this pandemic has negatively impacted the health and well-being of children, now and perhaps well into the future.”</p>
<p>While children have been much less likely to be hospitalized or die from a COVID-19 infection thanks in part to differences in how their bodies respond to the virus, many still have become sick.</p>
<p>As of Sept. 16, more than 5.5 million children have been infected by the virus since the start of the pandemic. That represents more than 15 percent of the total cases, according to Dr. Lee Beers, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics.</p>
<p>More than 21,000 children have been hospitalized, a rate that’s 2.5 to 3 times higher than flu-related hospitalizations, Beers testified.</p>
<p>At least 480 children have died as a result of COVID-19, making it one of the 10 leading causes of death for U.S. kids and one that has disproportionately affected Black and Latino children.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Delta variant, and the return to school</h4>

	
<p>The more-transmissible delta variant, and the lack of a vaccine approved for children under 12, have been reflected in an exponential rise in infections among children.</p>
<p>There were more than a million new cases among children between Aug. 5 and Sept. 16, Beers said, and more than 225,000 cases added in the past week.</p>
<p>Rush said her hospital has seen a shift in the age distribution among children testing positive, though the percentage of children requiring hospitalization has remained about the same.</p>
<p>Still, children’s hospitals have seen an uptick in patients because more children nationally are being infected, she added.</p>
<p>Rep. Frank Pallone, (D-N.J.), who chairs the Energy and Commerce Committee, described the increases among children as “alarming,” and asked why it is that the children’s hospitals have been so hard-hit.</p>
<p>“Many of the public-health measures that were in place in 2020 that separated children, and they kept children more isolated, as we&#8217;ve all talked about this morning, also prevented the transmission of disease,” Rush said. “So children are now back together, they’re in school settings … and so they are sharing germs again.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Mental health issues</h4>

	
<p>But the pandemic’s effect on children goes beyond the direct consequences of an infection.</p>
<p>Whether they’ve become sick or not, American kids have had three school years disrupted due to COVID-19, and have faced growing challenges with mental health, obesity, and the loss of learning that should have occurred during those years.</p>
<p>Each of the witnesses during Wednesday’s hearing specifically mentioned the mental health issues for kids, who spent months away from school and friends. Rush described behavioral health as an epidemic among children before the COVID-19 pandemic, and said that hospitals have seen more children showing up in crisis.</p>
<p>Dr. Tracy Beth Høeg, a physician and researcher at the University of California at Davis, questioned whether some U.S. policies for children, including rules on mask use and school closures and quarantines, make sense.</p>
<p>She contrasted those policies against looser ones in some European countries, arguing that those countries have better acknowledged the non-COVID-19 health risks for children.</p>
<p>“It’s kind of ironic that in trying to keep these kids 100 percent safe, that they’re feeling abandoned,” Høeg said.</p>
<p>U.S. kids also have faced an uphill fight against vaccine misinformation.</p>
<p>One California teen launched her own site, <a href="https://www.vaxteen.org/about" target="_blank">VaxTeen</a>, after hearing stories of fellow teenagers who were searching for accurate information on how to get vaccinated if their parents would not consent.</p>
<p>Kelly Danielpour, the site’s founder and a Stanford University student, said the pandemic has been a “tremendously difficult” time for everyone, particular for young people.</p>
<p>She asked legislators on the panel to think broadly about what it will mean for children to feel safe and healthy again, suggesting that it will take much more than just lower COVID-19 infection rates.</p>
<p>Danielpour described a Virginia teenager who had contacted her after successfully convincing her parents to let her be vaccinated. The teen was working in an ice-cream store, and told Danielpour how unsafe she felt, getting yelled at by customers who refused to wear masks.</p>
<p>“There&#8217;s so much to be said for the right to feel healthy and safe and protected that we cannot discount,” Danielpour said.</p>
