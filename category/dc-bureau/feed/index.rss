(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)</p><p dir="ltr">WASHINGTON — As U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson vies to keep his gavel, President-elect Donald Trump on Monday gave the Louisiana Republican a major boost with his “Complete &amp; Total Endorsement.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump’s coveted backing — just days ahead of Friday’s House vote to elect a speaker — came as Johnson sat in the hot seat over a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/congress-clears-bill-avert-government-shutdown-extend-farm-bill" target="_blank">government shutdown quarrel</a> earlier this month that exacerbated public dissatisfaction from several of his GOP colleagues over his leadership.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The spending fight also put a spotlight on his vulnerabilities in securing the votes to win the speakership again.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The American people need IMMEDIATE relief from all of the destructive policies of the last Administration,” Trump said in a Monday post on&nbsp;<a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113742374534233751" target="_blank">Truth Social</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The soon-to-be president described Johnson as a “good, hard working, religious man,” noting that “he will do the right thing, and we will continue to WIN.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a post on&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/speakerjohnson/status/1873758339324362916?s=46" target="_blank">X</a> shortly after the endorsement, Johnson said he was “honored and humbled” by Trump’s support. “Together, we will quickly deliver on your America First agenda and usher in the new golden age of America,” he added.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Tensions flare</h4>
<p dir="ltr">But Johnson has failed to secure the backing of every House GOP colleague —&nbsp;which will be critical in a chamber Republicans will hold by a razor-thin margin. His opponents include Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who said he would not be voting for the incumbent.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a post on&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/RepThomasMassie/status/1873776475264213174" target="_blank">X</a>, Massie said: “I respect and support President Trump, but his endorsement of Mike Johnson is going to work out about as well as his endorsement of Speaker Paul Ryan.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We’ve seen Johnson partner with the democrats to send money to Ukraine, authorize spying on Americans, and blow the budget,” he added.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In an earlier Monday post on&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/RepThomasMassie/status/1873684971526955030" target="_blank">X</a>, Massie noted he was the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/paul-ryan-easily-wins-reelection-as-speaker-of-the-house-233139" target="_blank">only Republican</a> to not vote for former U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan’s reelection to the speakership in 2017.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Mike Johnson is the next Paul Ryan,” Massie said. He urged his colleagues to join him in voting against the Louisiana Republican “because history will not give America another ‘do-over.’”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Massie has not said whom he would prefer for the position.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In another post&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/RepThomasMassie/status/1873704602513924355" target="_blank">on X</a>, Massie said he thinks no one will run for speaker until “Johnson concedes that he can’t be Speaker” and “Trump weighs in.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“To step up before then, or to nominate someone before then, is to doom that candidacy,” he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Indiana GOP Rep. Victoria Spartz has also been vocal in her dissatisfaction of Johnson’s leadership and so far has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6366548934112" target="_blank">refused to commit to voting</a> for his reelection.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">On Monday, Spartz laid out&nbsp;<a href="https://spartz.house.gov/media/press-releases/spartz-it-will-take-bold-and-decisive-leadership-reverse-titanic-its-0" target="_blank">several demands</a> for whoever becomes the next leader, saying: “Our next speaker must show courageous leadership to get our country back on track before this ‘Titanic’ strikes an iceberg at any moment.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We must have a vision and a concrete PLAN to deliver on President Trump’s agenda for the American people, which I have not seen from our current speaker despite countless discussions and public promises,” she added, comparing federal spending to the iceberg that caused the infamous nautical disaster.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Spokespeople for House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York did not immediately respond Monday to a message seeking comment.</p>

(Photo by Getty Images).</p><p dir="ltr">WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate approved a broadly bipartisan bill early Saturday that would increase Social Security benefits for millions of Americans with pensions by ending two of the program’s policies in place for decades — the windfall elimination provision and government pension offset.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The legislation, which would cost more than $195 billion over 10 years, now goes to President Joe Biden for his signature. While he hasn’t released a public endorsement of the bill, extensive support in the House and Senate could signal he’s likely to support the measure becoming law.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Senate vote was <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1182/vote_118_2_00338.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">76-20</a> and the <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2024456" target="_blank" rel="noopener">House vote</a> in November was 327-75.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins said during floor debate Wednesday that a fix for the two provisions has been decades in the making, noting she held the first hearing on the issue in the upper chamber in 2003.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Collins later partnered with the late California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein to introduce the first version of the bill in 2005, before working with former Maryland Democratic Sen. Barbara Mikulski in 2007 on another version.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Social Security is the foundation of retirement income for most Americans, yet many teachers, firefighters, police officers and other public servants often see their earned Social Security benefits unfairly reduced by two provisions,” Collins said. </p>
<p dir="ltr">The windfall elimination provision, she said, “affects public servants who receive a pension from a job not covered by Social Security, but who also worked long enough in another job to qualify for Social Security benefits.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The government pension offset affects people who worked in jobs that weren’t eligible for Social Security, but were eligible for a spousal benefit. That pension offset, Collins said, can reduce a spouse’s Social Security benefit by two-thirds of the non-covered pension, leading to 70% of those affected by the GPO to lose the entire Social Security benefit.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This issue is extraordinarily important in my state of Maine because the state’s pension system does not include a Social Security component,” Collins said. “And among those most affected are Maine school teachers.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Collins called the WEP and the GPO “an unfair, inequitable penalty.” </p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Hit to trust fund</h4>
<p dir="ltr">North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis said the bill’s title made it sound like “motherhood and apple pie,” but argued it wasn’t the right approach to address the problem.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He expressed concern the bill would reduce the Social Security trust fund by an additional $200 billion during the next decade, moving up the insolvency date by six months.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This chamber needs courage and needs to say what needs to be said — we are about to pass an unfunded $200 billion spending package for a trust fund that is likely to go insolvent over the next nine to ten years and we’re going to pretend like somebody else has to fix it,” Tillis said. “Well, when you’re a U.S. senator and you have your election certificate, that falls on us.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tillis said he agreed with Collins and others who support the bill that the WEP and the GPO must be fixed, but said that should be part of a larger conversation about addressing Social Security’s upcoming insolvency.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We do not disagree with what we ultimately need to do,” Tillis said. “This is a disagreement in how to get here and how to have something that assesses the downstream risk. So it is with some trepidation that I come to the floor and criticize the good work of Sen. Collins. But I do it because there is so much riding on us getting this right and having the courage to fix Social Security over the next few years.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown said during floor debate Wednesday that people who paid into Social Security for the required amount of time should receive their full benefits. </p>
<p dir="ltr">“Social Security we know is a bedrock of our middle class — it’s retirement security that Americans pay into and earn over a lifetime,” Brown said. “You pay in for 40 quarters, you pay in essentially for 10 years. You’ve earned it. It should be there when you retire.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Brown said it “makes no sense” that workers in certain public service jobs, like teachers, police officers and firefighters, cannot draw their full benefits. </p>
<p dir="ltr">“They protect our communities, they teach our kids, they pay into Social Security just like everyone else,” Brown said.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">How do these provisions work?</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The pension offset reduces a “spousal or widow(er)’s benefits of most people who also receive pensions based on federal, state, or local government employment not covered by Social Security,” according to a <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN12451" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The windfall elimination provision changes the formula to reduce Social Security benefits for people “who are also entitled to pension benefits based on earnings from jobs that were not covered by Social Security,” the report said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The pension offset affects about 746,000 Americans while the windfall provision affects 2.1 million.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The share of Social Security beneficiaries affected by the GPO varies widely by state,” the CRS report says. “States with a relatively larger share of GPO-affected beneficiaries are usually those with a larger share of state and local government employees not covered by Social Security or those with more (Civil Service Retirement System) retirees.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The pension offset has a disproportionate impact on Social Security beneficiaries in Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Ohio, Rhode Island, Texas and Utah. </p>
<p dir="ltr">The windfall elimination provision affects a larger percentage of residents in Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Washington, Wyoming. </p>
<p dir="ltr">“Similar to the GPO, the share of Social Security beneficiaries affected by the WEP varies by state,” CRS wrote. “Typically, states that have a larger share of state and local government employees not covered by Social Security or more CSRS retirees have a relatively larger share of Social Security beneficiaries affected by the WEP.”</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Bipartisan House support</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The U.S. House <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2024456" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted 327-75</a> in November to approve the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/82/text?s=1&#038;r=1&#038;q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22social+security+fairness+act%22%7D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four-page bill,</a> sponsored by Louisiana Republican Rep. Garret Graves and Virginia Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Graves said during <a href="https://www.congress.gov/118/crec/2024/11/12/170/166/CREC-2024-11-12-house.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">floor debate</a> that for 40 years, Social Security worked by “treating people differently, discriminating against a certain set of workers.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“These are police officers, teachers, firefighters, and other public servants,” Graves said at the time. “I worked side by side with these folks. They are not people who are overpaid. They are not people who are underworked.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Spanberger called the windfall elimination provision and the government pension offset “two misguided provisions that were added to the Social Security Act in 1983 (and) have denied Americans the retirement security they worked for and expected to receive.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“For more than 40 years, public servants have tirelessly implored their representatives in Congress to listen to their stories and to correct this glaring injustice,” Spanberger said. “Today, for the first time, Congress will vote on the Social Security Fairness Act, to repeal the WEP and the GPO, and to finally put an end to this theft.”</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Opposition to bill</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Missouri Republican Rep. Jason Smith, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said the two provisions affect around 4% of all Social Security beneficiaries, more than 60% of whom are concentrated in 10 states.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The two provisions, he said, “were put in place more than four decades ago to prevent workers with earnings that were exempt from Social Security payroll taxes from getting more generous treatment from Social Security than workers who spent their whole careers contributing to Social Security.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Unfortunately, these policies still result in overly generous benefits for some while unfairly penalizing others,” Smith said, before arguing the bill wasn’t the right way to address the two provisions. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Smith said that getting rid of the two provisions “without a replacement potentially trades unfair treatment for preferential treatment.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">He also expressed concern about how pulling more money from the Social Security trust fund would impact solvency. </p>
<p dir="ltr">The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/60690" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated</a> the bill would cost $195.65 billion during the next 10 years and wrote in a <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2024-11/60876-HR82.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">letter</a> to Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley that it would likely move up the Social Security insolvency date by six months.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“If H.R. 82 was enacted, the balance of the (Old-Age and Survivors Insurance) trust fund would, CBO projects, be exhausted roughly half a year earlier than it would be under current law,” CBO Director Phillip L. Swagel wrote. “The agency estimates that under current law, the balance of the OASI trust fund would be exhausted during fiscal year 2033.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Social Security<a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/trsum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> trustees report</a> for 2024 says that the program will be able to pay full benefits until 2035. After that, if Congress hasn’t brokered a solution, Social Security would be able to pay about 83% of benefits. </p>

Biden on Monday commuted the sentences of 37 federal death row inmates. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)</p><p dir="ltr">President Joe Biden commuted the sentences on Monday of 37 death row inmates, citing his conscience as a force behind the decision. He also left the death sentences unchanged for three men charged with hate-motivated mass shootings and terrorism.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Biden, who imposed a moratorium on federal executions during his administration, commuted the death sentences to life sentences without the possibility of parole, saying in a statement that he’s dedicated his career “to reducing violent crime and ensuring a fair and effective justice system.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Make no mistake: I condemn these murderers, grieve for the victims of their despicable acts, and ache for all the families who have suffered unimaginable and irreparable loss,” Biden said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“But guided by my conscience and my experience as a public defender, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Vice President, and now President, I am more convinced than ever that we must stop the use of the death penalty at the federal level. In good conscience, I cannot stand back and let a new administration resume executions that I halted.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The three men Biden left on death row Monday include Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, sentenced in 2015 of bombing the Boston Marathon in 2013; Dylann Roof, sentenced in 2017 of fatally shooting nine members of Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in 2015 in Charleston, South Carolina; and Robert Bowers, sentenced in 2023 for the deadly shooting in 2018 that killed 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The president’s commutations Monday come after he <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-commutes-sentences-nearly-1500-people-pardons-39-historic-clemency-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commuted the sentences</a> on Dec. 12 of 1,500 people who were placed in home confinement during the coronavirus pandemic. He also granted pardons for 39 individuals convicted of nonviolent crimes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Biden received <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/criminal-justice/shapiro-conahan-says-biden-commuting-kids-for-cash-judges-sentence-absolutely-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">criticism</a> from Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and others for including among the mass commutations a Pennsylvania judge convicted in 2011 of sending children to prison in exchange for millions of dollars in kickbacks from a private jail — a crime that became known in the commonwealth as the “<a href="https://penncapital-star.com/criminal-justice/shapiro-conahan-says-biden-commuting-kids-for-cash-judges-sentence-absolutely-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cash for Kids</a>” scheme.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Advocates for abolishing the death penalty and some U.S. House Democrats had <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-dem-quartet-calls-biden-spare-lives-federal-death-row-inmates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pressured Biden</a> to commute death penalty sentences ahead of President-elect Donald Trump’s return to the White House. Trump expedited some executions during his first term.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a statement, Trump transition spokesman Steven Cheung blasted the commutations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“These are among the worst killers in the world and this abhorrent decision by Joe Biden is a slap in the face to the victims, their families, and their loved ones,” Cheung wrote. “President Trump stands for the rule of law, which will return when he is back in the White House after he was elected with a massive mandate from the American people.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to the White House, the names of the death row inmates whose sentences were commuted Monday are:</p>

Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican, speaks at the Republican National Convention at the Fiserv Forum on July 17, 2024 in Milwaukee. The U.S. House Ethics Committee released a report Monday finding "substantial evidence" of misconduct by Gaetz. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)</p><p dir="ltr">President-elect Donald Trump’s first choice for attorney general in his second presidency, former Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz, paid for sex, including with a minor, used illegal drugs and sought to obstruct investigators, according to a U.S. House Committee on Ethics report released Monday.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://ethics.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Committee-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">42-page report</a>, the culmination of a years-long committee investigation, found that Gaetz, who denies the allegations, “regularly paid women for engaging in sexual activity with him,” used cocaine and ecstasy on multiple occasions between 2017 and 2019, accepted gifts including a 2018 trip to the Bahamas, and lied to the Department of State to obtain a passport for a woman he was sexually involved with and who he falsely claimed was his constituent.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Representative Gaetz took advantage of the economic vulnerability of young women to lure them into sexual activity for which they received an average of a few hundred dollars after each encounter. Such behavior is not ‘generosity to ex-girlfriends,’ and it does not reflect creditably upon the House,” the report stated, noting the former congressman violated Florida prostitution and statutory rape laws.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Gaetz has not been criminally charged.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But the <a href="https://ethics.house.gov/press-releases/statement-of-the-committee-on-ethics-regarding-representative-matt-gaetz-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">panel</a> cited “substantial evidence” that Gaetz had sex with a 17-year-old girl whom they refer to as “Victim A.” Evidence included “credible testimony from Victim A herself, as well as multiple individuals corroborating the allegation.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Several of those witnesses have also testified under oath before a federal grand jury and in a civil litigation,” the report continued.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Representative Gaetz denied the allegation but refused to testify under oath. He has publicly stated that Victim A ‘doesn’t exist’ and that he has not ‘had sex with a 17-year-old since I was 17.’ The Committee found that to be untrue and determined that there is substantial evidence that Representative Gaetz had sex with Victim A in July 2017, when she was 17 years old, and he was 35. Representative Gaetz’s actions were in violation of Florida’s statutory rape law,” according to the report.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Gaetz was chosen by Trump in November as his nominee to run the U.S. Department of Justice, even though Gaetz was previously the target of a department sex trafficking investigation that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-wont-charge-matt-gaetz-with-crimes-sex-trafficking-probe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">never</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/14/us/politics/matt-gaetz-investigations-explainer.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yielded</a> <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/matt-gaetz-was-once-under-investigation-for-sex-trafficking-now-he-could-lead-the-justice-department" target="_blank" rel="noopener">charges</a>. Gaetz resigned from the House hours after Trump named him for the position.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After criticism from lawmakers and a spotlight on the House Ethics Committee’s probe, ongoing since April 2021, Gaetz <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/matt-gaetz-bows-out-trumps-pick-attorney-general" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bowed out</a> of the running for attorney general.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Gaetz continues to deny the allegations outlined in the committee report and sued the panel Monday. In the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.275994/gov.uscourts.dcd.275994.1.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complaint</a>, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Gaetz calls the committee’s decision to release the report “unconstitutional” because it does not have jurisdiction over a private citizen.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“There is a reason they did this to me in a Christmas Eve-Eve report and not in a courtroom of any kind where I could present evidence and challenge witnesses,” Gaetz <a href="https://x.com/mattgaetz/status/1871207714665197718" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> on X Monday.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Gaetz declined an opportunity to present his version of events to the committee, refusing an invitation to sit for a voluntary interview, the report said.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Debate over release</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The committee wrestled with the decision to release the report, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-ethics-panel-republicans-vote-against-disclosure-gaetz-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blocking</a> the decision after meeting on Nov. 20 before reversing course in a Dec. 10 vote.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Committee Chair Michael Guest said in a statement Monday that he opposed the report’s release.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I believe, have publicly stated, and remain steadfast in the position that the House Committee on Ethics lost jurisdiction to release to the public any substantive work product regarding Mr. Gaetz after his resignation from the House on November 14, 2024,” Guest, a Mississippi Republican, said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“While I do not challenge the Committee’s findings, I did not vote to support the release of the report and I take great exception that the majority deviated from the Committee’s well-established standards and voted to release a report on an individual no longer under the Committee’s jurisdiction, an action the Committee has not taken since 2006,” Guest’s statement continued.</p>

Mike Johnson, R-La., speaks to members of the press at the U.S. Capitol on Dec. 20, 2024 in Washington, D.C.  (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)</p><p dir="ltr">WASHINGTON — Congress finally approved a stopgap spending bill&nbsp;early Saturday that will keep the government open for a few more months, after a raucous 48 hours that served as a preview of what President-elect Donald Trump’s second term in office might look like.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The short-term spending package, the third version of a bill to be released this week, will give lawmakers until mid-March to negotiate agreement on the dozen full-year government funding measures and provide about $100 billion in natural disaster assistance.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Although it technically was passed by the Senate after the midnight deadline for a shutdown, deputy White House press secretary Emilie Simons <a href="https://x.com/EmilieSimons46/status/1870332808813764703" target="_blank">said on X </a>that agencies would continue normal operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The House passed the bill Friday evening following a&nbsp;<a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2024517" target="_blank">366-34 vote</a> with one Democrat voting “present.” The Senate voted&nbsp;<a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1182/vote_118_2_00339.htm" target="_blank">85-11</a> shortly after midnight Saturday. President Joe Biden signed the bill Saturday morning.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The legislation did not include any language either raising or suspending the debt limit, rejecting a demand by Trump that it be addressed. Congress and Trump will have to deal with that next year when they control the House, Senate and the White House.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20241216/ARA%2012.20.pdf" target="_blank">118-page bill&nbsp;</a>will extend programs in the five-year farm bill through September, giving the House and Senate more time to broker a deal, even though they are already more than a year late.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The package would not block members of Congress from their first cost-of-living salary adjustment since January 2009, boosting lawmakers’ pay next year from $174,000 to a maximum of $180,600.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It does not include a provision considered earlier this week that would have allowed the year-round sale of E15 blended gasoline nationwide in what would have been a win for corn growers and biofuels.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The White House announced during the House vote that Biden supports the legislation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“While it does not include everything we sought, it includes disaster relief that the President requested for the communities recovering from the storm, eliminates the accelerated pathway to a tax cut for billionaires, and would ensure that the government can continue to operate at full capacity,” press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre wrote. “President Biden supports moving this legislation forward and ensuring that the vital services the government provides for hardworking Americans – from issuing Social Security checks to processing benefits for veterans &#8212; can continue as well as to grant assistance for communities that were impacted by devastating hurricanes.”</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Appropriators at odds</h4>
<p dir="ltr">House Appropriations Chairman Tom Cole, R-Okla., urged support for the bill during floor debate, saying it would avoid a partial government shutdown, provide disaster aid and send economic assistance to farmers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Governing by continuing resolution is never ideal, but Congress has a responsibility to keep the government open and operating for the American people,” Cole said. “The alternative, a government shutdown, would be devastating to our national defense and for our constituents and would be a grave mistake.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Connecticut Democratic Rep. Rosa DeLauro, ranking member on the Appropriations Committee, spoke against the bill and criticized GOP negotiators from walking away from the original, bipartisan version released Tuesday.</p>
<p dir="ltr">She rejected billionaire Elon Musk, a close Trump ally, seemingly calling the shots as if he were an elected lawmaker, though she ultimately voted for passage.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The United States Congress has been thrown into pandemonium,” DeLauro said. “It leads you to the question of who is in charge?”</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Trump, Musk objections</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Democrats and Republicans reached<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/huge-spending-bill-unveiled-congress-provides-more-100-billion-disaster-aid" target="_blank"> an agreement earlier this week</a> to fund the government, provide disaster aid, extend the agriculture and nutrition programs in the farm bill, extend various health care programs and complete dozens of other items. But Trump intervened, preventing House GOP leaders from putting that bill on the floor for an up-or-down vote.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump and Musk&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/chances-government-shutdown-escalate-after-trump-and-gop-reject-stopgap-spending-bill" target="_blank">were unsupportive of some of the extraneous provisions in the original bill&nbsp;</a>and Trump began pressing for lawmakers to address the debt limit now rather than during his second term.</p>
<p dir="ltr">House Republicans&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-torpedoes-new-spending-plan-government-shutdown-nears-friday-night" target="_blank">tried to pass their first GOP-only stopgap bill&nbsp;</a>on Thursday night, but failed following a 174-235 vote, with 38 GOP lawmakers voting against the bill. That bill included a two-year debt limit suspension, but that was dropped from the version passed Friday.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said Friday before the vote that the GOP was united on its plan forward.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We have a unified Republican Conference. There is a unanimous agreement in the room that we need to move forward,” Johnson said following a 90-minute closed-door meeting. “I expect that we will be proceeding forward. We will not have a government shutdown. And we will meet our obligations for our farmers, for the disaster victims all over the country, and for marking sure the military and essential services and everyone who relies on the federal government for a paycheck is paid over the holidays.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">A total of 34 House Republicans voted against the bill. No House Democrats voted against passage.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">No shutdown, for now</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The House and Senate not agreeing on some sort of stopgap spending bill before the Friday midnight deadline would have led to a funding lapse that would likely have led to a partial government shutdown just as the holidays begin.</p>
<p dir="ltr">During a shutdown, essential government functions that cover the protection of life and property continue, though no federal workers would have received their paychecks until after the shutdown ends. That loss of income would have extended to U.S. troops as well.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“If there is going to be a shutdown of government, let it begin now, under the Biden Administration, not after January 20th, under “TRUMP,” the president-elect posted on social media Friday morning. “This is a Biden problem to solve, but if Republicans can help solve it, they will!”</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a separate post that went up just after 1 a.m. Eastern, Trump doubled down on his insistence that any short-term spending bill suspend the debt limit for another four years or eliminate the borrowing ceiling entirely.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Congress must get rid of, or extend out to, perhaps, 2029, the ridiculous Debt Ceiling,” Trump wrote. “Without this, we should never make a deal. Remember, the pressure is on whoever is President.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">The state-by-state breakdown of roughly $100 billion came just hours after Trump and many of his closest allies, including tech billionaire Elon Musk, urged GOP leaders in Congress to walk away from a bipartisan year-end spending package.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That short-term spending bill, or some version of it, must become law before Friday at midnight, otherwise a partial government shutdown would begin. A partial shutdown would halt paychecks to federal employees and U.S. troops just ahead of the holiday season.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The&nbsp;<a href="https://democrats-appropriations.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/democrats-appropriations.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/CR2%20State%20by%20State_0.pdf" target="_blank">breakdown</a> shows states battered by hurricanes and other natural disasters such as California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Minnesota, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia would miss out on more than $2 billion each, though the figures for the larger states go above $10 billion.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Misinformation over pay raise</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/chances-government-shutdown-escalate-after-trump-and-gop-reject-stopgap-spending-bill" target="_blank">stalemate over the short-term spending bill</a> began shortly after congressional leaders&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/huge-spending-bill-unveiled-congress-provides-more-100-billion-disaster-aid" target="_blank">released the 1,547-page package&nbsp;</a>on Tuesday evening.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Speaker Mike Johnson defended some of the extraneous measures during a press conference Tuesday before it was publicly released and during a Fox News interview Wednesday morning.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Louisiana Republican reinforced the need for disaster aid and economic assistance to farmers, though the spending package includes dozens of unrelated items, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/win-biofuels-stopgap-spending-bill-allows-year-round-sales-e15-gas-nationwide" target="_blank">a provision that would allow the nationwide sale of 15% ethanol blended gasoline</a> year round.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bill also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/members-congress-rolled-pay-raise-themselves-big-must-do-spending-bill" target="_blank">dropped a long-standing provision that blocked members of Congress from getting an annual cost of living adjustment&nbsp;</a>salary increase.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There was considerable misinformation Wednesday around how much of a boost in pay lawmakers would stand to receive next Congress, riling up people who didn’t have access to the correct figures.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The incorrect numbers were spread by many online, but received special attention from Musk, who&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1869461048828522999" target="_blank">advocated shutting down the government&nbsp;</a>before Trump and Vice President-elect J.D. Vance&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/JDVance/status/1869495076604227726" target="_blank">weighed in</a> later Wednesday.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lawmakers would receive a maximum 3.8% salary increase, boosting their annual pay from $174,000 to $180,600, according to a&nbsp;<a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/RS/97-1011" target="_blank">report</a> released in September by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. Lawmakers haven’t received a COLA increase since January 2009.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Sudden debt limit demand</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The full package, which congressional leaders and committees spent weeks negotiating, would have given Congress until March 14 to negotiate a bicameral agreement on the dozen annual government funding bills that were supposed to become law by the start of the fiscal year on Oct. 1.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Republicans wanted to hold over the full-year spending bills until they have unified control of government next year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The package would have given lawmakers until Sept. 30 to work out a deal on the five-year farm bill, which they should have completed work on well over a year ago.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump pressed Wednesday for lawmakers to add the debt limit to negotiations, with just about two days left before the shutdown deadline. Working out a bipartisan agreement to raise or suspend the nation’s borrowing authority typically takes months of talks.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump said he didn’t want to have to deal with the debt limit debate once his second administration begins on Jan. 20 and would rather have had it on President Joe Biden’s record.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/GarrettHaake/status/1869744357886263420" target="_blank">told NBC News on Thursday morning&nbsp;</a>that he wanted Congress to eliminate the debt limit entirely, marking a substantial shift in how Republicans have approached the cap on borrowing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The GOP typically leverages the debt ceiling debate to push for spending cuts, though not always successfully.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Democratic leaders in Congress maintain they are not going to renegotiate with Republicans, which would prevent any Republican-only bill from becoming law before the deadline. While the GOP controls the House, Democrats right now run the Senate and hold the White House.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said Thursday morning in a floor speech that GOP infighting over the bipartisan bill was risking an unnecessary government shutdown.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Unfortunately, it seems Republicans are in shambles over in the House,” Schumer said. “But as they try to piece things together, they should remember one thing — the only way to get things done is through bipartisanship.&#8221;</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Jeffries urges vote on stopgap</h4>
<p dir="ltr">House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., on didn’t entirely rule out lawmakers from his party voting for a slimmed-down stopgap spending bill, but urged GOP leaders to stick with the version they spent weeks negotiating.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This reckless Republican-driven shutdown can be avoided if House Republicans will simply do what is right for the American people and stick with the bipartisan agreement that they themselves negotiated,&#8221; Jeffries said at a Thursday press conference.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump’s insistence that the package address the debt limit in some way was “premature at best,” he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Jeffries also said Democrats would not give Johnson extra votes to secure the speaker’s gavel in January, should several of his GOP colleagues refuse to vote for him during a floor vote.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Numerous far-right Republicans have hinted or said directly that they might not support Johnson continuing on as speaker due to their grievances over provisions in the stopgap spending bill.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Republicans will have an extremely narrow House majority next year, meaning Johnson can only lose a few votes before the GOP would begin the third prolonged speaker race in just two years.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy began this session of Congress in January 2023 going through 15 floor votes before he was able&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-backs-mccarthy-speaker-after-tense-and-chaotic-late-night-session-25" target="_blank">to secure the votes needed</a> to become speaker.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Republicans<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-votes-remove-kevin-mccarthy-speaker" target="_blank"> voting to oust</a> him a little over a year ago led to several GOP speaker nominees, who were unable to get the 218 votes needed to become speaker on a floor vote or who opted to not even try.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Republicans nominated House Majority Leader&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/scalise-nominated-us-house-gop-speaker-closed-door-meeting" target="_blank">Steve Scalise&nbsp;</a>of Louisiana, Ohio Rep.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/ohios-jordan-latest-us-house-gop-nominee-speaker-after-days-turmoil" target="_blank">Jim Jordan&nbsp;</a>and Minnesota’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/emmer-nominated-us-house-speaker-drops-out-after-trump-opposition-0" target="_blank">Tom Emmer&nbsp;</a>before landing on Johnson, who was<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/mike-johnson-louisiana-elected-speaker-us-house-after-three-weeks-stalemate" target="_blank"> able to win a floor vote</a>.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Musk for speaker?</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-rep-marjorie-taylor-greene-fails-attempt-oust-house-speaker-mike-johnson" target="_blank">tried but failed to oust Johnson as speaker</a> in May, has been leading the charge to select someone else, possibly Musk. The Constitution is silent on the question of whether the speaker must be a member of the House.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The establishment needs to be shattered just like it was yesterday,” Greene&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/RepMTG/status/1869768295399964765" target="_blank">wrote</a> on social media. “This could be the way.”</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>This report has been updated with state-by-state numbers revised by U.S. House Democrats later Thursday morning.</em></p>

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)</p><p dir="ltr">Members of Congress are among those calling for greater transparency from the federal government as a spate of reported drone sightings concentrated in New Jersey and New York has raised questions beyond the Northeast.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Reported sightings of drones, officially known as unmanned aerial systems, or UAS, have spiked since Nov. 18, when authorities received several reports of suspicious drone activity near critical infrastructure in New Jersey, according to an FBI official in the state who briefed reporters over the weekend.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The increased activity has worried some and led to calls from lawmakers for the federal agencies to provide more information on drone activity, even as security officials urged caution.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a statement that described an “epidemic of non-stop drone sightings,” U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called for the federal government to deploy more drone-detection systems and to share information with local authorities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I want it deployed widely across New York and New Jersey to help give us concrete answers on what is going on, and from where,” Schumer, a New York Democrat, said of a drone-detection system that the federal government uses. “What we need right now is data. The briefings I have had tell me there is no evidence that this is a government or foreign activity, and so, we have to answer the logical of question of: who?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Schumer called on Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to deploy the drone-detection system and said he would cosponsor a bill that would give local law enforcement more authority to respond to drone sightings.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Drones, like planes and other users of the national airspace, are regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We still have very few answers on where some of these drones come from and who may be operating them,” Schumer said Monday on the Senate floor. “The people of New York and New Jersey have a lot of questions and haven’t gotten many answers. We know one thing, though. Local officials now don’t have the resources nor the authority to get to the bottom of what’s happening.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">On CBS’ Sunday morning news show “Face the Nation,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat who is a senior member of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee with jurisdiction over the FAA, called for federal officials to brief U.S. senators.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We need more transparency,” she said.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">‘No evidence’ of threat, says DOD</h4>
<p dir="ltr">U.S. Defense Department spokesman Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters Monday that there was “no evidence at this time that the reported drone sightings pose a national security or public safety threat or have a foreign nexus.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Regardless, he said he wanted to take the public’s concerns seriously, but also offered further context.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The drone industry is expanding, with more than 1 million hobbyist and commercial drones licensed by the FAA and 8,000 in use daily.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He likened the drone sightings, even those near military installations or other important sites, to drivers who may get lost and turn up in their cars at places they are not supposed to be, something he said happens regularly without incident.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The point being is that flying drones is not illegal,” he said. “There are thousands of drones flown around the U.S. on a daily basis. So, as a result, it’s not that unusual to see drones in the sky, nor is it an indication of malicious activity or any public safety threat.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, noted Monday that federal investigators had not found any malicious activity and <a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2024/12/16/governor-murphy-asks-public-to-calm-down-over-drone-sightings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">urged residents to “calm down”</a> about drone sightings.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Many recent reports of drones, noted by non-experts, turned out to be commercial planes flying regularly scheduled nighttime routes.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">More than 5,000 tips</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The New Jersey-based FBI official said that the vast majority of the more than 5,000 tips his office received in the past month related to unidentified objects in the night skies have not been “actionable.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The official, who briefed reporters along with officials from other agencies on the condition their names not be used, said the FBI was working to identify the 100 or so tips that did warrant further investigation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I don’t want to cause alarm and panic, but you can’t ignore the sightings that have been there, and we are concerned about those just as much as anybody else is,” the FBI official said. “We’re doing our best to find the origin of that specific — of those drone activities. But I think there has been a slight overreaction.”</p>

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)</p><p dir="ltr">WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump pledged Monday to keep the polio vaccine available throughout his presidency, but didn’t extend that protection to other vaccines, saying he expects his administration will look closely at safety — something the U.S. Food and Drug Administration already does before granting approval.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump’s comments came during an hour-long press conference where he hinted at trying to privatize the Postal Service and said he planned to file a lawsuit against a presidential preference poll published by The Des Moines Register that found him trailing Vice President Kamala Harris in the last days before the election.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump, who will take the oath of office on Jan. 20, also said he would solve the war between Ukraine and Russia and establish the Middle East as a “good place,” though he declined to provide details.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Starting on day one, we&#8217;ll implement a rapid series of bold reforms to restore our nation to full prosperity,” Trump said in his first formal back-and-forth with reporters since the Nov. 5 election. “We&#8217;re going to go full prosperity and to build the greatest economy the world has ever seen, just as we had just a short time ago.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump said he expects Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the vaccine denier he has said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-taps-vaccine-skeptic-rfk-jr-lead-department-health-and-human-services" target="_blank">he will nominate&nbsp;</a>to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, will be “much less radical” than some people expect.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump said Kennedy and others in his administration will file reports sharing what they think about vaccines, but didn’t say what actions might be taken after those reports are released.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump said he didn’t like the idea of mandating vaccines, but didn’t go as far as saying he’d change vaccine policy for parts of the federal government, like the Defense Department, which has numerous requirements for troops, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.military.com/off-duty/2020/02/10/why-most-dreaded-injection-called-peanut-butter-shot.html" target="_blank">the so-called peanut butter shot.</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Kennedy is notorious for spreading misinformation about vaccine safety, one of the many issues that could imperil his attempts to garner U.S. Senate confirmation and actually lead HHS.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump said he wanted this administration to look at why autism rates have increased in recent decades.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/autism-vaccine-link-debunked" target="_blank">Multiple research studies have debunked&nbsp;</a>any connections between vaccines and autism.</p>
<p dir="ltr">His administration, Trump said, would also look at ways to lower the costs of health care and prescription drugs within the United States, but he didn’t provide details.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Lawsuit threats</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Trump doubled down on his grievances with news organizations during the press conference at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, saying he planned to file several lawsuits in the days and weeks ahead against people or organizations he believes have wronged him.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The announcement came just days after Trump’s legal team&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/abc-trump-lawsuit-defamation-stephanopoulos-04aea8663310af39ae2a85f4c1a56d68" target="_blank">reached a settlement with ABC News</a> in which the news organization agreed to pay $15 million to Trump’s presidential library.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The suit centered on anchor George Stephanopoulos saying during an interview that a New York state jury had found Trump liable for the rape of writer E. Jean Carroll, when the jury had found him civilly liable for “sexual misconduct.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump said during his press conference that he would likely file lawsuits against Iowa pollster J. Ann Selzer, the news show “60 Minutes” and the Pulitzer Prize organization for awards given to the New York Times and Washington Post.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">“In my opinion it was fraud and election interference,” he said of the Iowa Poll published by the Des Moines newspaper. “She&#8217;s got me right, always. She&#8217;s a very good pollster. She knows what she was doing, and she then quit before and we&#8217;ll probably be filing a major lawsuit against them today or tomorrow.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Selzer, a longtime pollster, said last week on Iowa PBS that she hadn’t yet figured out what went wrong with the poll she released just ahead of Election Day that showed Democratic presidential nominee Harris outperforming Trump in the state by 3 percentage points. Trump won Iowa in the election with 56% of the vote to her 42.7%.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“There wasn&#8217;t anything that we saw that needed to be fixed. The reality is that more people supporting Donald Trump turned out,” she said. “I&#8217;m eagerly awaiting the secretary of state&#8217;s turnout reports that will happen in January to see what we can glean from that.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“But there wasn&#8217;t an adjustment to my data when we saw that it was going to be a shocker that I would have said okay, let&#8217;s adjust it. It&#8217;s not like I know ahead of time what the right numbers are going to be in the future. So, you kind of take the data designed to reveal to me our best shot at what the future is going to look like.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Selzer said during the PBS interview that she was “mystified” about allegations that she sought to interfere in the election results through the poll. Carol Hunter, executive editor of The Des Moines Register, could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump said he also planned to sue the CBS News program “60 Minutes” over how it edited an interview with Harris that was released before the election.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He said he wants to sue the Pulitzer Prize organization&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/staffs-new-york-times-and-washington-post" target="_blank">for awarding&nbsp;</a>staff at The New York Times and The Washington Post the national reporting award in 2018 for their reporting on “Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and its connections to the Trump campaign, the President-elect’s transition team and his eventual administration.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I want them to take back the Pulitzer Prizes and pay big damages,” Trump said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Pulitzer Prize Board&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pulitzer.org/news/statement-pulitzer-prize-board-2" target="_blank">announced in July 2022</a> that it would not revoke the prizes in response to an inquiry from Trump and two independent reviews of the work.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Both reviews were conducted by individuals with no connection to the institutions whose work was under examination, nor any connection to each other,” the board wrote. “The separate reviews converged in their conclusions: that no passages or headlines, contentions or assertions in any of the winning submissions were discredited by facts that emerged subsequent to the conferral of the prizes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The 2018 Pulitzer Prizes in National Reporting stand.”</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Israel and Ukraine</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Trump said during his press conference that he would address the ongoing Israel-Gaza war as well as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine once he takes office, but didn’t say exactly how he’d encourage those countries to end their conflicts.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump said he believed that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is doing a “fantastic job” and said he thinks his second administration will be able to solve longstanding issues throughout the Middle East.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I think the Middle East will be in a good place,” Trump said. “I think actually more difficult is going to be the Russia-Ukraine situation. I see that as more difficult.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 and has refused to leave the country’s borders. In the years since Russia launched a war, numerous organizations, including the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/10/un-commission-concludes-war-crimes-have-been-committed-ukraine-expresses" target="_blank">United Nations,</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/11/ukraine-russian-strikes-amounting-to-war-crimes-continue-to-kill-and-injure-children/" target="_blank">Amnesty International</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/04/03/ukraine-apparent-war-crimes-russia-controlled-areas" target="_blank">Human Rights Watch</a> have all made allegations of war crimes against Russia.</p>
<p dir="ltr">U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken released a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.state.gov/crimes-against-humanity-in-ukraine/" target="_blank">statement</a> in February 2023 that “Russia’s forces and other Russian officials have committed crimes against humanity in Ukraine.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Russia, he wrote, had engaged in torture, rape, execution-style killings and “deported hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian civilians to Russia, including children who have been forcibly separated from their families.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump said during his press conference that he didn’t believe the Biden administration should have allowed Ukraine&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-ukraine-long-range-weapons-russia-52d424158182de2044ecc8bfcf011f9c" target="_blank">to shoot long-range missiles into Russia’s sovereign territory&nbsp;</a>and said he may reverse the policy once in office.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I thought it was a very stupid thing to do,” Trump said of the Biden administration’s policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">On the Israel-Hamas war, Trump declined to clarify exactly what he meant when he said there would be “hell to pay” if Hamas had not released the remaining hostages abducted in October 2023 before Trump took over the Oval Office. He simply added that it “would not be pleasant.”</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Postal Service, TikTok, primary challengers</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Trump left many questions about his agenda unanswered following the press conference.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He declined to clarify whether he would press to privatize the U.S. Postal Service, saying only that there was “talk” about severing the agency and that his team is “looking at that.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">He didn’t divulge whether his administration would seek to force social media giant TikTok to divest from its Chinese parent company if it wants to remain operational within the United States. TikTok on Monday asked the U.S. Supreme Court for a stay of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-appeals-court-upholds-rapidly-approaching-tiktok-ban" target="_blank">an appeals court order</a> preserving a bipartisan law forcing ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, to cease operations in the United States.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We’ll take a look at that,” Trump said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He left open supporting Republican primary challenges against GOP senators who don’t support his nominees to lead federal departments and agencies.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A senator voting against one of his nominees “for political reasons or stupid reasons” would likely earn them a primary challenger, he said. But Trump added that wouldn&#8217;t have anything to do with him.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump also declined to say whether he expected Chinese leader Xi Jinping to attend his inauguration after extending an invitation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“If he&#8217;d like to come, I&#8217;d love to have him, but there&#8217;s been nothing much discussed,” Trump said. “I have had discussions with him, letters, etc, etc, at a very high level. You know, we had a very good relationship until COVID. COVID didn&#8217;t end the relationship, but it was a bridge too far for me.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump then added he believes Xi is “an amazing person.”</p>

(Photo by Getty Images)</p><p dir="ltr">WASHINGTON — The form to apply for federal financial student aid must roll out by Oct. 1 annually after President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-passes-bill-move-annual-fafsa-release-deadline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed a bill into law</a> Wednesday that ensures an earlier processing cycle.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Though the <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/feds-roll-out-2025-26-college-financial-aid-form-ahead-planned-date" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Free Application for Federal Student Aid</a>, or FAFSA, typically launches in October each year, the U.S. Department of Education legally had until Jan. 1 to make the form available.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The new law came as the department has taken heat over its <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/gaps-fafsa-rollout-are-closing-watchdog-tells-us-house-panel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">botched rollout</a> of the 2024-25 form, when users faced a series of glitches and errors. The form did not officially launch until January.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Adding fuel to the fire, the agency announced earlier this year that it would take a staggered approach to the 2025-26 form so it could address problems that might pop up before opening applications to everyone — again making the form available later than usual.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-department-education-begins-testing-new-fafsa-form" target="_blank" rel="noopener">testing stages</a> that began Oct. 1, the department fully debuted the 2025-26 form in late November — 10 days ahead of its Dec. 1 official launch.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A spokesperson for the department said it is “committed to enforcing all laws duly passed by Congress” when asked about Biden signing the FAFSA bill into law.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, the department said Thursday it had received over 1.5 million 2025-26 FAFSA submissions and has delivered more than 7 million student records to states and schools.</p>
<p dir="ltr">U.S. Under Secretary of Education James Kvaal said that even with these developments, the department’s work “is not done.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We will continue to fix bugs and improve the user experience to make it easier for students and families to get the financial aid they need,” Kvaal said on a call with reporters Thursday regarding updates on the 2025-26 form.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">FAFSA deadline bill breezed through Congress</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The bill was met with sweeping bipartisan support and swiftly passed both the House and Senate in November. Indiana GOP Rep. Erin Houchin, a member of the U.S. House Committee on Education and the Workforce, introduced the legislation in July.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sen. Bill Cassidy, ranking member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, put forth the Senate version of the bill. The Louisiana Republican is in line to chair the panel next year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Rep. Bobby Scott, ranking member of the House education panel, celebrated the bill becoming law on Wednesday.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“As college costs continue to rise, federal financial aid, including Pell Grants, is essential to making higher education more affordable and accessible,” the Virginia Democrat said in a statement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Scott said that by standardizing the deadline, the measure “gives students and families more time to complete their applications and secure the financial support they need to attend college without unnecessary delays.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The 2024-25 application got a makeover after Congress passed the FAFSA Simplification Act in late 2020 but was met with several issues that prompted processing delays and gaps in submissions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The department’s staff worked to fix these errors and close the gap in submissions from the previous processing cycle, and officials said they reflected on how to make improvements for the 2025-26 form and beyond. </p>

(Photo by David McNew/Getty Images)</p><p dir="ltr">WASHINGTON —  A top Republican on the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee said Tuesday that when President-elect Donald Trump takes office and the GOP takes control of the Senate, lawmakers’ first priority will be to pass a border security package through a complex process known as budget reconciliation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump has promised his base his administration will enact mass deportations of people living in the country illegally. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said at a Judiciary hearing that Senate Republicans will focus on increasing beds at detention centers, hiring Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and purchasing technology for enforcement at the southern border.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It is our belief that the only way you’ll get control of the border is for deportations to start early,” he said. “If we do not have outflow, the inflow will continue.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, a senior fellow at the pro-immigration think tank the American Immigration Council, Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, told the panel the endeavor will be expensive.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Carrying out mass deportations of 1 million people would <a href="https://immigrationimpact.com/2024/10/02/report-costs-mass-deportation-immigration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cost about $88 billion a year</a> for arrests, detainment and removal, he said. About 13 million people are living in the United States illegally.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Fixing a broken system</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The committee hearing, led by Democrats who control the Senate now but will be in the minority next year, explored the ramifications of the Trump campaign promise of mass deportations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Instead of mass deportations, mass accountability,” said the chair of the committee, Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois. “Let’s fix our broken immigration system in a way that protects our country and honors our heritage as a nation of immigrants.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The budget reconciliation process cited by Graham that would be used to pass border security legislation, if successful, would allow Republicans to get around the 60-vote filibuster in the Senate.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Reconciliation is generally used when one party controls the House, Senate and the White House, because it only requires a majority vote in each chamber.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Graham added that Republicans will also prevent those people who were paroled into the country through executive authority from employing another avenue for legal immigration status. The GOP has been critical of programs that allow certain nationals from Haiti, Nicaragua, Cuba and Venezuela to temporarily work and live in the United States.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“So if you’re here illegally, get ready to leave,” Graham said.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">DACA program</h4>
<p dir="ltr">One of the hearing witnesses, Foday Turay, is in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, which is awaiting a federal court ruling on its legality after the Trump administration tried to end it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Separately, on Monday, <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2024/12/09/texas-daca-recipients-affordable-care-act/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a federal court blocked</a> the implementation of a final rule from the Biden administration to allow DACA recipients to have health care access under the Affordable Care Act. </p>
<p dir="ltr">About 500,000 people are in the program, which is aimed at protecting children brought into the country without authorization from deportation. It also allows them to obtain work permits.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Turay is an assistant district attorney in the Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office, and said if he were deported it would devastate his family, as he is the primary income earner in his household.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He said his wife, a U.S. citizen, is the primary caretaker of her mother, a person with disabilities who is undergoing cancer treatments. Additionally, Turay said he would have to leave his son behind if he is deported.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Another witness, Patty Morin of Aberdeen, Maryland, told how her daughter, Rachel, was killed. <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/baltimore/news/1-year-ago-maryland-mom-rachel-morin-was-murdered-heres-what-happened-since-baltimore-ma-and-pa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The suspect, who was charged</a> with first-degree murder and sexual assault, was in the country illegally and had a prior criminal record.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Durbin said Democrats are not opposed to ICE carrying out its duties to deport those with criminal records and stressed that Trump’s plans for mass deportations extend beyond that group and would include people like Turay.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This man for a living is prosecuting criminals,” Durbin said of Turay. “This other individual is a clear criminal with a record. When we say ‘mass deportation,’ should we consider them the same because they’re both undocumented?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Graham said when it comes to DACA, “hopefully we can find a solution to that problem.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Over the weekend, Trump expressed his support for coming to an agreement with Democrats to allow DACA recipients to remain in the country, despite trying to end the program during his first term.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Use of National Guard</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Durbin said he is concerned about Trump’s comments about using the National Guard to carry out mass deportations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One of the witnesses, Randy Manner, a retired major general in the U.S. Army, said he sees problems with using the military for mass deportations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It could affect military readiness, he said, and the military is not trained in that capacity.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Immigration enforcement is the responsibility of federal law enforcement agencies,” Manner said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He added that having soldiers carry out that directive would have a negative impact on morale and recruiting. Manner also said having the U.S. military involved in that kind of political messaging would erode public trust.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Cost of mass deportations</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar said not only would mass deportations be harmful to communities, but a financial strain as well.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Reichlin-Melnick said industries that would be hit particularly hard by losing employees would include construction, agriculture and hospitality.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Reichlin-Melnick also argued that ICE already focuses on arresting and conducting deportation proceedings for noncitizens with criminal records.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The overwhelming majority of people who would be the target of a mass deportation campaign do not have criminal records,” he said. “They are people who have been living otherwise law-abiding lives in this country, living, working and, in many cases, paying taxes.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tennessee Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn suggested that local law enforcement should be empowered to carry out deportations, even though immigration enforcement is a federal issue.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Art Arthur, a resident fellow in law and policy at the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that advocates for sharply limiting immigration, supported that idea.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“They’re going to be the people who are best able to pull those individuals out of the community,” Arthur said of local law enforcement.</p>

(Photo Illustration by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)</p><p dir="ltr">The law Congress passed this year to force the Chinese parent company of social media giant TikTok to either sell the service or face a U.S. ban is constitutional, a panel of federal appeals judges ruled Friday.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://media.cadc.uscourts.gov/opinions/docs/2024/12/24-1113-2088317.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">order</a> from a three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals preserves the bipartisan <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7521/text?s=1&#038;r=1&#038;q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22Protecting+Americans+from+Foreign+Adversary+Controlled+Applications+Act%22%7D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">law</a> President Joe Biden signed in April forcing ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, to cease operations in the United States over concerns the platform’s data gathering could be obtained and used by the Chinese Communist Party.</p>
<p dir="ltr">TikTok, ByteDance and a handful of users <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/tiktok-sues-block-new-us-law-banning-app-if-it-not-sold" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sued the administration to block</a> enforcement of the law, saying <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/congress-silenced-free-speech-tiktok-law-platform-tells-federal-court" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it violated the First Amendment</a> right to free speech and other rights.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The panel on Friday rejected that argument, saying that although the short-form videos produced on the service constitute speech and the shuttering of U.S. operations would limit that speech, that was the result of the Chinese government’s “hybrid commercial threat to U.S. national security,” not the U.S. government’s actions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United States,” Senior Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg wrote for the panel. “Here the Government acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary’s ability to gather data on people in the United States.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ginsburg, who was appointed to the court by Republican President Ronald Reagan, and Neomi Rao, a Donald Trump appointee, formed the court’s main opinion. Chief Judge Sri Srinavasan, whom Democrat Barack Obama appointed, wrote a concurring opinion.</p>
<p dir="ltr">TikTok has the option to appeal Friday’s ruling to the full D.C. Circuit or the U.S. Supreme Court. The law is set to go into effect Jan. 19, the day before Trump — who has said he opposes the law even after trying his own TikTok ban during his first presidency — retakes office.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Free speech concerns</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Those challenging the law are likely to appeal directly to the Supreme Court and to seek an emergency temporary stay, “given the urgency of the situation,” Jacob Huebert, who represents a plaintiff in the case, said in a Friday interview.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Huebert is the president of Liberty Justice Center, a nonprofit that has litigated high-profile free-speech cases and is representing the libertarian news and commentary channel BASEDPolitics in the TikTok case, arguing that the law unconstitutionally restricts the channel’s reach to its intended audience of Gen Z users.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The government’s national security argument should not have overridden the First Amendment concerns, Huebert said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This national security justification that the court relied so heavily on isn’t enough,” he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The law would set a dangerous precedent that could be applied in the future to other social media, he added.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It should trouble you regardless of what you think about TikTok or China in particular because it’s really a threat to Americans’ free speech rights online, across the board,” Huebert said.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Bill sponsors from both parties praise ruling</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The bipartisan leaders of the U.S. House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, where the bill was introduced, cheered the decision Friday in a joint statement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Today’s ruling is a victory for the American people and TikTok users, and a loss for the Chinese Communist Party, which will no longer be able to exploit ByteDance’s control over TikTok to undermine our sovereignty, surveil our citizens, and threaten our national security,” Chairman John Moolenaar, a Michigan Republican, wrote. “I am optimistic that President Trump will facilitate an American takeover of TikTok to allow its continued use in the United States and I look forward to welcoming the app in America under new ownership.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ranking Democrat Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois said there is no solution other than a sale of TikTok.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“With today’s opinion, all three branches of government have reached the same conclusion: ByteDance is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, and TikTok’s ownership by ByteDance is a national security threat that cannot be mitigated through any other means than divestiture,” he said. “Every day that TikTok remains under the Chinese Communist Party’s control is a day that our security is at risk.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bill was introduced in March by then-Chair Mike Gallagher, a Wisconsin Republican who has since left Congress, and Krishnamoorthi.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It has dozens of co-sponsors from each party and <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-votes-ban-tiktok-unless-it-sold-china-controlled-parent" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed</a> the House 352-65. The Senate <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/aid-ukraine-israel-overwhelmingly-approved-us-house-bipartisan-vote" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cleared the bill in April</a> as part of a larger funding package.</p>

Edgar Hoover FBI Building is seen on Jan. 28, 2019 in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images)</p><p dir="ltr">WASHINGTON — The decade-long endeavor to move the Federal Bureau of Investigation out of its crumbling headquarters in downtown Washington, D.C., and into a new facility outside the city could face roadblocks next year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">President-elect Donald Trump and some of his top allies in Congress have rebuked the federal agency that undertook the search for a new suburban location, ultimately deciding on Greenbelt, Maryland, over two other options.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Once Trump is back in the Oval Office and the GOP controls both chambers of Congress, the funding stream for the General Services Administration to build the new facility could end.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Republican lawmakers could also require the GSA to restart the search process, change the criteria the federal agency used to select the Greenbelt location, or simply tell the agency it must construct the new headquarters in a different location. Other options <a href="https://alabamareflector.com/briefs/wsj-ohio-congressman-wants-to-move-fbi-headquarters-to-huntsville/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">floated by GOP lawmakers</a> include Alabama and somewhere inside the District of Columbia. Or they could require GSA to build the new FBI headquarters in either Springfield, Virginia, or Landover, Maryland — the other two locations considered for the new building.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen, the top Democrat on the spending panel that controls GSA’s budget, told States Newsroom he believes the issue is settled, in part, because some funding has already been allocated for the project.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We’re going to work very hard to make sure we keep the program on track,” Van Hollen said. “I think there’s a consensus that the FBI’s current headquarters does not meet the security requirements, does not meet the other requirements. So, you know, from our perspective, a decision has been made and we will work hard to make sure it’s executed, implemented.”</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Construction funding</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Congress approved $200 million for the headquarters project this spring as part of a much larger government spending package.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Beyond that, funding is less certain.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Senate Appropriations Committee, controlled by Democrats, has proposed $375 million for construction in <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/4928/text?s=6&#038;r=7&#038;q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22van+hollen%22%7D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this year’s GSA spending bill</a>. That measure, which includes numerous other funding proposals, received bipartisan support during a committee vote. In January, control of the Senate will flip to the GOP.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/AP/AP00/20240613/117435/BILLS-118-FC-AP-FY2025-AP00-FY25FSGGFullCommitteeMark.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">House version of the bill</a>, drafted by Republicans, doesn’t include any funding for a new FBI headquarters and would require the GSA to send Congress “a detailed plan and timeline to support the District of Columbia based personnel by keeping the current FBI headquarters operational or identifying another Federally owned location in the District of Columbia that can serve as the FBI headquarters building.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The two chambers will likely negotiate a final, bicameral version of the bill during the first few months of next year, once the GOP holds unified control of Congress and the White House. </p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Trump hotel</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine said during an interview he hadn’t really thought about whether his state could become the new site for the FBI headquarters.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“If you just go by history, Trump didn’t want to put any money into a new FBI headquarters,” Kaine said. “He didn’t want that block that the FBI is on to be cleared and opened for a hotel that might compete with his own hotel. So four years of the Trump administration was him basically doing everything he could to stop a move and to stop funds being used for the move.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Now he may not have the same financial interest that he had back then so I bet it’s hard to say.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump owned a hotel in the old Post Office building along Pennsylvania Avenue during his first term in office, but it was later sold and is now a Waldorf Astoria. The building is about one block away from the current FBI headquarters.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Maryland Rep. Steny Hoyer, the top Democrat on the House panel that funds the GSA, told States Newsroom there’s “no doubt” the Greenbelt location “is the best site, both in terms of security and in terms of finances.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I’m going to continue to push that position,” Hoyer said. “We need to get this done for the FBI, for the American people. The building is literally falling down. And the fact that we have delayed this … is testament that we’ve escalated cost, decreased security for the federal employees at FBI, and we ought to move on. And hopefully we will.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Maryland and Virginia governors’ offices declined to comment for this article. A GSA representative, speaking on background, said the agency has submitted a report to Congress that was required by <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2471" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the spending package lawmakers approved </a>in March 2022.</p>
<p dir="ltr">GSA, the person said, is trying to secure “resolutions” from congressional committees before it obligates funds to buy the site or begin design and construction activities. They said this is consistent with other large-scale development projects that require congressional approval. It was not clear what those resolutions would say.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Evaluation of selection process continues</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The GSA has been under review by its inspector general for how it undertook the site selection process for more than a year, one factor that could potentially complicate things during unified Republican control of Washington.</p>
<p dir="ltr">GSA acting Inspector General Robert Erickson <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/investigation-launched-site-selection-process-new-fbi-headquarters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched an evaluation </a>into the agency’s process in November 2023, a few weeks after GSA <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/maryland-confirmed-pick-new-fbi-headquarters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced its decision</a> to pick the Greenbelt, Maryland, location.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That evaluation is ongoing, and the inspector general continues “to work thoroughly and expeditiously on the project,” according to a spokesperson.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner told States Newsroom in a brief interview he’s waiting to see the inspector general’s evaluation before deciding on a path forward.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I know people thought that it might come out in the spring. It didn’t,” Warner said. “The reports we’ve got is that they’re still doing the investigating, and let’s see what that says first.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Hoyer said he doesn’t expect the results of that evaluation will affect moving the FBI headquarters to Greenbelt.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I think everything was done absolutely as it should have been,” Hoyer said. “An argument was made by both sides in public on the merits of their sites.”</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Debate over process</h4>
<p dir="ltr">FBI Director Christopher Wray <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/fbi-director-slams-selection-process-new-hq-maryland-while-lawmakers-squabble%C2%A0%C2%A0-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also questioned the decision</a> last year, writing in a letter to employees that he and others held “concerns about the fairness and transparency in the process,” though he wrote those “concerns are not with the decision itself but with the process.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump has announced he will name Kash Patel as head of the FBI, though Wray would have to be fired or quit first. Trump has not yet named someone to lead the GSA.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Greenbelt decision brought about some bipartisanship in Congress, with House Oversight &#038; Accountability Committee Chair James Comer, a Kentucky Republican, and Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Virginia Democrat, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-oversight-leader-demands-probe-political-interference-fbi-hq-move%C2%A0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">urging GSA to conduct a full investigation</a> into the site selection process. </p>
<p dir="ltr">The two said the most disturbing aspect to them was that then-GSA Commissioner of the Public Building Service Nina Albert “overturned the unanimous site decision of an expert panel of civil servants representing GSA and its agency client, the FBI.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Albert left that role on Oct. 13, 2023, about a month before the final decision was announced. General Services Administrator Robin Carnahan had also <a href="https://www.gsa.gov/system/files/Enclosure%201.2%20-%20N.Albert_Authorization%20Memo_7.6.21.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said two years earlier </a>Albert didn’t have a conflict of interest.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Congress created GSA in 1949 to increase the efficiency and economy of federal government operations — not least the procurement and use of property,” Comer and Connolly wrote in their letter. “To fulfill that mission, GSA must be fair and transparent in its operations. Its real estate dealings should consider only what is best for taxpayers and the Nation. It must set aside political or parochial interests.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Comer and Connolly added they were “deeply concerned that GSA’s choice of a new FBI headquarters site departed from those principles — and in doing so, failed to put taxpayers and the public interest first.”</p>

(Photo by SDI Productions via Getty Images)</p><p dir="ltr">WASHINGTON — The U.S. Education Department called on every state, school and district on Tuesday to adopt policies on cellphone use in schools.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The department asks schools to have well-thought-out policies on the matter, but does not dictate exactly what those policies should be. An accompanying resource for schools notes the risk social media can pose to students’ mental health.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“In this digital age, every elementary, middle, and high school should have a clear, consistent, and research-informed policy to guide the use of phones and personal devices in school,” U.S Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said in a written statement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The evidence makes clear: there is no one-size-fits-all policy,” Cardona added, noting that “different school communities have different needs, and the nuances of this issue demand that local voices — parents, educators, and students — inform local decisions around the use of personal devices in school.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The department acknowledged the role cellphones can play in keeping parents connected to their kids, especially in emergency situations, while also highlighting the increasing evidence on the harms social media can have on youth mental health, such as sleep deprivation and depression.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Increasing state policies</h4>
<p dir="ltr">An increasing number of states and school districts have enacted policies either prohibiting or restricting students from using their cellphones in the classrooms.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Across the country, schools and districts continue to grapple with how to deal with kids’ cellphone use, and <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/09/29/cell-phone-schools-bans-states" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than half of all states</a> have sought to ban or restrict cellphone use in classrooms.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As of early November, at least eight states have passed statewide policies that either limit or prohibit cellphone use in the classrooms, according to <a href="https://www.kff.org/mental-health/issue-brief/a-look-at-state-efforts-to-ban-cellphones-in-schools-and-implications-for-youth-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KFF</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That includes California, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Ohio, South Carolina and Virginia. A Minnesota law forces schools to <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/episode/2024/08/29/minnesota-now-new-school-cellphone-policy-landscape-across-minnesota-locked-pouches" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adopt a policy on cellphone use</a> by March 2025.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A handful of other states’ <a href="https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/2024/11/01/oregon-department-of-education-offers-schools-guidance-on-limiting-student-cell-phone-use/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">education departments</a> have issued <a href="https://alaskabeacon.com/2024/10/24/alaska-joins-growing-number-of-states-considering-crackdown-on-cellphones-in-schools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">policy recommendations</a> or pilot programs, while lawmakers in several more have introduced statewide legislation regarding cellphone use.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The guidance from the U.S. Education Department coincides with the release of a <a href="https://tech.ed.gov/device-policy-playbook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resource</a> for education officials and local communities on adopting cellphone use policies.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the playbook, Cardona points to U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy’s <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/sg-youth-mental-health-social-media-advisory.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public warning</a> in 2023 on <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/prodded-fed-parents-some-congress-try-curb-kids-use-social-media" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media’s effects</a> on youth mental health.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Murthy warns: “More research is needed to fully understand the impact of social media; however, the current body of evidence indicates that while social media may have benefits for some children and adolescents, there are ample indicators that social media can also have a profound risk of harm to the mental health and well-being of children and adolescents.” </p>

(Official White House Photo by Shealah Craighead)</p><p dir="ltr">WASHINGTON — Incoming White House budget director Russ Vought has spent much of his career learning the detailed, often convoluted mechanisms that make up the Office of Management and Budget.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The agency, little known outside Washington, D.C., is relatively small compared to the rest of the federal government, but it acts like a nucleus for the executive branch and holds significant power.</p>
<p dir="ltr">OMB is responsible for releasing the president’s budget request every year, but also manages much of the executive branch by overseeing departments’ performance, reviewing the vast majority of federal regulations and coordinating how the various agencies communicate with Congress. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Vought was deputy director, acting director and then director at OMB during Trump’s first term.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Before that Vought worked as vice president of Heritage Action for America, policy director for the U.S. House Republican Conference, executive director of the Republican Study Committee and a legislative assistant for former Texas Republican Sen. Phil Gramm. He has an undergraduate degree from Wheaton College and a law degree from George Washington University Law School.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Following Trump’s first term in office, Vought founded the right-leaning Center for Renewing America. The group’s mission is “to renew a consensus of America as a nation under God with unique interests worthy of defending that flow from its people, institutions, and history, where individuals’ enjoyment of freedom is predicated on just laws and healthy communities.”</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Cutting government spending</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Vought outlined his agenda for the next four years in Project 2025, a 922-page <a href="https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">document</a> from the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation that led to speculation during the presidential campaign about what Trump would seek to do without Congress, including in areas that constitutionally fall within the legislative branch, like government spending.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, repeatedly tried to tie Project 2025 to Trump and his campaign, and they sought to distance themselves from its proposals. But Trump has since nominated some of its authors or contributors to run federal departments and agencies.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Vought, in a 26-page chapter on the executive office of the president, wrote the OMB director “must ensure the appointment of a General Counsel who is respected yet creative and fearless in his or her ability to challenge legal precedents that serve to protect the status quo.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump, Vought and many others are bullish about cutting government spending, but will likely run into legal challenges if they try to spend more or considerably less than lawmakers approve in the dozen annual government funding bills. </p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Budget request</h4>
<p dir="ltr">One of Vought’s most visible responsibilities will be releasing the president’s annual budget request, a sweeping document that lays out the commander-in-chief’s proposal for the federal government’s tax and spending policy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The president’s budget, however, is just a request since Congress has the constitutional authority to establish tax and spending policy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lawmakers on Capitol Hill write the dozen annual government funding bills that account for about one-third of annual federal spending. The rest of the federal government’s spending comes from Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, which are classified as mandatory programs and mostly run on autopilot unless Congress approves changes and the president signs off on a new law.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That separation of powers led to frustration during Trump’s first term in office and will likely do so again, since he spoke during the 2024 campaign about using “impoundment” to prevent the federal government from spending money Congress has approved.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump withheld security assistance funding from Ukraine during his first term in office, leading to one of his two impeachments and a ruling from the Government Accountability Office —a nonpartisan government watchdog — that he had violated the law.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Faithful execution of the law does not permit the President to substitute his own policy priorities for those that Congress has enacted into law,” GAO <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/b-331564.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>. “OMB withheld funds for a policy reason, which is not permitted under the Impoundment Control Act (ICA). The withholding was not a programmatic delay. Therefore, we conclude that OMB violated the ICA.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump spoke on the campaign trail about using “impoundment” to drastically cut government spending, but that would likely lead to lawsuits and a Supreme Court ruling. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Vought’s think tank, Center for Renewing America, <a href="https://americarenewing.com/the-history-of-impoundments-before-the-impoundment-control-act-of-1974/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published analysis </a>of presidents using impoundment throughout the country’s history, with the authors concluding the Impoundment Control Act is unconstitutional.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">‘Every possible tool’</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Vought sought to defend the president’s budget request in his chapter in Project 2025, writing that though “some mistakenly regard it as a mere paper-pushing exercise, the President’s budget is in fact a powerful mechanism for setting and enforcing public policy at federal agencies.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">He signaled the second Trump administration would be more nuanced in its interpretation of presidential authority.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The President should use every possible tool to propose and impose fiscal discipline on the federal government.” Vought wrote. “Anything short of that would constitute abject failure.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Vought also wrote about the management aspect of OMB’s portfolio, pressing for political appointees to have more authority and influence than career staff.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It is vital that the Director and his political staff, not the careerists, drive these offices in pursuit of the President’s actual priorities and not let them set their own agenda based on the wishes of the sprawling ‘good government’ management community in and outside of government,” Vought wrote. “Many Directors do not properly prioritize the management portfolio, leaving it to the Deputy for Management, but such neglect creates purposeless bureaucracy that impedes a President’s agenda—an ‘M Train to Nowhere.’”</p>

<p dir="ltr">In a <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113546215051155542" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pair</a> of <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113546215408213585" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posts</a> to his social media platform, Truth Social, on Monday evening, Trump said on his first day in office he would impose 25% tariffs on all imports from Canada and Mexico and 10% tariffs on goods from China until those countries stopped the flow of illegal drugs and migrants into the U.S.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Thousands of people are pouring through Mexico and Canada, bringing Crime and Drugs at levels never seen before,” Trump wrote. “On January 20th, as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders. This Tariff will remain in effect until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!”</p>
<p dir="ltr">While Trump has not always followed through on threats of stiff tariffs — generating doubts about how severe the next round will actually be — the executive branch does have wide latitude to impose the taxes on foreign goods without congressional approval, meaning it is likely Trump will act in some way.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We are going to get several tariff threats via rage-posts over the next four years,” Brendan Duke, a senior director for economic policy at the liberal Center for American Progress, said in an interview. “Unclear what exact levels on what exact countries he is going to pursue.”</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">What about inflation?</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Tariffs are consistent with Trump’s preference for a protectionist trade policy, but may actively hurt in an area that was key to his election win over Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris this month: taming inflation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">An analysis from the Center for American Progress said the tariffs Trump announced Monday would raise annual costs for the average U.S. family by $1,300.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Democratic members of the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee, which oversees tax and trade policy, estimated tariffs favored by Trump would increase consumer costs by up to $4,000 per year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to CBS News exit polling, 78% of voters said inflation was a moderate or severe hardship. Trump won voters who rated the economy as bad by 40 points over Harris.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Cars, ag and energy to be hardest-hit</h4>
<p dir="ltr">About 15% of goods consumed in the United States are imported, Gary Hufbauer, a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, an economics research center, said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Adding across-the-board tariffs on those imports would contribute to consumers’ overall cost of living, even without considering related economic consequences.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“You’ve added to inflation, and that’s assuming that U.S. producers of similar products don’t jack up their prices,” he said. “But experience shows that if the economy is strong, they’ll do just that.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The U.S. automotive sector, which is heavily integrated with Mexico and Canada with parts of a single vehicle produced in all three countries, could see “pretty startling” price increases, Hufbauer said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Additionally, the U.S. imports Mexican fruits and vegetables and Canadian oil, complicating Trump’s campaign promise to bring down prices specifically of groceries and gas, Duke said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Americans have obviously been frustrated with the cost of food and the cost of gas,” he said. “Some parts of the United States are heavily reliant on Canadian oil, even though we’re a net exporter … So, one would expect price increases, especially in places like the Midwest that are heavily dependent on Canadian oil.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tariffs on Chinese goods would increase the costs of electronics, clothing and other consumer goods, Duke said.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Democratic legislation</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Ways and Means Democrats, led by Washington’s Suzan DelBene and Virginia’s Don Beyer, and also joined by Earl Blumenauer of Oregon, Terri Sewell of Alabama, Steven Horsford of Nevada, Dan Kildee of Michigan and four others, introduced a bill Tuesday to rein in the executive’s ability to implement tariffs, citing the added cost to American families.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The American people have clearly and consistently said that costs are one of their top concerns,” DelBene said in a statement. “Imposing sweeping tariffs on imported goods would raise prices on consumer products by thousands of dollars a year according to estimates. Not only would widespread tariffs drive up costs at home and likely send our economy into recession, but they would damage our trade relationships with allies and likely lead to significant retaliation, hurting American workers, farmers, and businesses.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump’s promises of dramatic tariffs go beyond the intent of the law that gave the president the power to enact tariffs, the Democrats said. Congress wanted a president to be able to quickly impose tariffs on hostile foreign countries, but did not intend “to allow a president to indiscriminately impose tariffs without Congress’ approval.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tariffs can be an important tool for conducting foreign policy, but the range Trump is proposing is 10 to 20 times beyond what even he did in his first term, Duke said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He cautioned that the final form of new tariffs may not be exactly what Trump proposed Monday night, though they could be similar.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“He’s gonna do something on tariffs. I don’t know what. It’s probably not these exact levels on these exact countries,” he said. “But it rhymes with it.”</p>

(Photo credit: NIH)</p><p dir="ltr">WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump said Tuesday he has selected a Stanford University professor of health policy and skeptic of COVID-19 precautions to run the National Institutes of Health, the sweeping federal agency tasked with solving many of the country’s biggest health challenges.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Dr. Jay Bhattacharya will require Senate confirmation before taking over the role officially, but assuming he can secure the votes next year when the chamber is controlled by Republicans, he’ll have significant sway over where the federal government directs billions in research dollars.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Dr. Bhattacharya will work in cooperation with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to direct the Nation’s Medical Research, and to make important discoveries that will improve Health, and save lives,” Trump wrote in the announcement. Kennedy is Trump’s <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-taps-vaccine-skeptic-rfk-jr-lead-department-health-and-human-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pick to lead</a> the Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bhattacharya <a href="https://x.com/DrJBhattacharya/status/1861586856590320071" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted on social media</a> that he was “honored and humbled” by the nomination and pledged to “reform American scientific institutions so that they are worthy of trust again and will deploy the fruits of excellent science to make America healthy again!”</p>
<p dir="ltr">In addition to Kennedy, other Trump nominees for health-related positions include former TV personality and onetime Pennsylvania U.S. Senate candidate Mehmet Oz <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-picks-dr-oz-run-mammoth-centers-medicare-and-medicaid-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to lead</a> the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, former Florida Congressman Dave Weldon <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-unveils-his-lineup-fda-cdc-and-surgeon-general" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to run</a> the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Marty Makary for commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration and Fox News medical contributor Dr. Janette Nesheiwat as the next surgeon general.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Together, Jay and RFK Jr. will restore the NIH to a Gold Standard of Medical Research as they examine the underlying causes of, and solutions to, America’s biggest Health challenges, including our Crisis of Chronic Illness and Disease,” Trump wrote in his announcement.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Health economist</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Bhattacharya received his undergraduate degree from Stanford University in 1990 before earning his medical degree from its School of Medicine in 1997 and a Ph.D. from the university’s Economics Department in 2000.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He focuses his research on health economics and outcomes, according to <a href="https://fsi9-prod.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/cv-jay-march2016.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his curriculum vitae</a>, the academic version of a resume.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bhattacharya’s <a href="https://healthpolicy.fsi.stanford.edu/people/jay_bhattacharya" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biography</a> on Stanford’s website says that in addition to being a professor of health policy, he runs its Center for Demography and Economics of Health and Aging, in addition to working as a research associate at the National Bureau of Economics Research.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Dr. Bhattacharya’s research focuses on the health and well-being of vulnerable populations, with a particular emphasis on the role of government programs, biomedical innovation, and economics,” according to the biography. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Among his research areas is the “epidemiology of COVID-19 as well as an evaluation of policy responses to the epidemic.”</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">‘A fringe component’</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Bhattacharya <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/roundtable/preparing-for-the-future-by-learning-from-the-past-examining-covid-policy-decisions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">testified</a> before the U.S. House Oversight Committee’s Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic in February 2023 that he believed there was “near universal agreement that what we did failed.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Official counts attribute more than one million deaths in the United States and seven million worldwide,” he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bhattacharya was one of three authors of The Great Barrington Declaration in October 2020, arguing that younger, healthy people should have gone about their normal lives in an effort to contract COVID-19, since they were somewhat less likely to die than at-risk populations. </p>
<p dir="ltr">The brief declaration says that “(a)dopting measures to protect the vulnerable should be the central aim of public health responses to COVID-19.” But it doesn’t list what those measures should include and never brings up masking, physical distancing, or vaccination.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Several public health officials and researchers rejected the declaration, noting that it didn’t cite any research, data or peer-reviewed articles.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Former NIH Director Francis S. Collins, who ran the agency from 2009 through 2021, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/covid-herd-immunity/2020/10/10/3910251c-0a60-11eb-859b-f9c27abe638d_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told The Washington Pos</a>t in October 2020 that the Barrington Declaration authors’ beliefs were not held “by large numbers of experts in the scientific community.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This is a fringe component of epidemiology. This is not mainstream science. It’s dangerous. It fits into the political views of certain parts of our confused political establishment,” Collins said in the Post interview. “I’m sure it will be an idea that someone can wrap themselves in as a justification for skipping wearing masks or social distancing and just doing whatever they damn well please.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">One of the many reasons public health experts recommended masking, working from home and physical distancing before there was a COVID-19 vaccine was to prevent patients from overwhelming the country’s health care system.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There were concerns during some of the spikes in COVID-19 infections that the country would have so many ill people at one time there wouldn’t be enough space, health care professionals or equipment to provide treatment.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Wide-ranging agency</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The NIH is made up of <a href="https://www.nih.gov/institutes-nih/list-institutes-centers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">27 different centers and institutes</a> that each focus on health challenges facing Americans.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, formerly run by Dr. Anthony Fauci, became one of the more well known institutes during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially when he would regularly appear beside Trump at press briefings.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Other components at NIH include the National Cancer Institute, National Institute on Aging, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and the NIH Clinical Center that’s also referred to as America’s research hospital.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Congress approved $48 billion in discretionary spending for NIH during the last fiscal year, continuing a broadly bipartisan push that for years has increased funding to the agency to provide grants to research some of the most challenging diseases and illnesses facing Americans.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The current NIH director, Monica M. Bertagnolli, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/nih-targeting-rare-diseases-director-tells-us-house-funding-panel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">testified before Congress </a>in early November about how the agency was working to rebuild trust following the pandemic.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bertagnolli told U.S. House lawmakers the NIH was focusing some of its research on finding cures for rare diseases, since for-profit companies often don’t have the financial incentive to do so.</p>
<p dir="ltr">She also rejected the notion that NIH leaders have allowed politics to interfere with the agency’s mission.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“First and foremost, NIH concentrates on science, not on politics,” Bertagnolli said. “We actually have an integrity mandate against political interference in our work. That is the law for us and we abide by that completely.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/4250/text" target="_blank" rel="noopener">measure</a> would limit federal law enforcement surveillance of journalists and the government’s ability to force disclosure of journalists’ sources, codifying regulations the Department of Justice has put in place under President Joe Biden.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The House Judiciary Committee unanimously approved it last year and it passed the House by voice vote in January.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“REPUBLICANS MUST KILL THIS BILL!” Trump wrote on his social media site, <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113516968142292237" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Truth Social</a>, in all capital letters on Wednesday, linking to a PBS segment about the measure.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Substantial floor time is generally required in the Senate to bypass the process that allows a single member to hold up the chamber’s business. With Democrats prioritizing confirmation of Biden’s judicial nominees before they lose their majority in January, it is unlikely they would bring a vote on the measure without the unanimous consent of all 100 senators.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump’s influence within the Senate Republican Conference makes reaching unanimous consent exceedingly unlikely.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bill’s House sponsor, California Republican Kevin Kiley, accepted the bill’s defeat in a statement Thursday.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Based on the feedback we’ve received from Senators and President Trump, it’s clear we have work to do to achieve consensus on this issue,” he said. “I’m looking forward to working with the new Administration on a great many areas of common ground as we begin a new era of American prosperity.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">A Kiley spokesperson declined to provide further details about senators’ feedback on the measure. A spokesperson for U.S. Senate Judiciary ranking Republican Lindsey Graham of South Carolina did not respond to a message seeking comment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the House, 19 members from both parties, including Republicans Barry Moore of Alabama, Darrell Issa of California, Russell Fry of South Carolina and Kelly Armstrong of North Dakota and Democrats Jamie Raskin of Maryland, Ted Lieu of California and Rashida Tlaib and Dan Kildee of Michigan, signed on as cosponsors.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Protection for local journalists</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Jon Schleuss, the president of The NewsGuild-CWA, a national journalists’ union that has supported the bill, noted in <a href="https://newsguild.org/the-press-act-protects-all-american-voices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Thursday statement</a> it would protect news sources across the political spectrum.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Americans would not know about the corruption of former Democratic Senator Bob Menendez or former Republican Representative George Santos without the hard work of local journalists holding power to account,” he said. “All of us depend on journalism, especially local journalism, to shine a light and protect Americans from threats, both foreign and domestic. The PRESS Act protects all voices: news sources, whistleblowers and the journalists they talk to from media outlets across the spectrum.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a Thursday statement to States Newsroom, Gabe Rottman, policy director at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, called the bill a “reasonable and common-sense measure” that enjoyed broad bipartisan support.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Its passage would put an end to actions the Justice Department has taken under past administrations of both parties to target reporters’ confidential communications when investigating and prosecuting disclosures of government information,” he wrote. “We urge Congress to recognize that there is still a need for a legislative remedy here.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Press advocacy groups have expressed worries about Trump’s return to the White House, citing a record in his first term that included surveillance of and legal threats against journalists and news organizations.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Seeking retribution</h4>
<p dir="ltr">In the closing days of the presidential race, Trump <a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2024/11/03/as-presidential-campaign-rockets-toward-end-7-big-things-that-happened-this-weekend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fantasized aloud</a> about reporters being shot.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Press freedom groups also worry that Trump’s promises to use the federal bureaucracy to seek retribution against perceived enemies would extend to journalists.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“In his second term, Trump will make good on these anti-press threats to try to destroy any news outlet, journalist, or whistleblower who criticizes or opposes him,” Seth Stern, the director of advocacy at the Freedom of the Press Foundation, wrote in <a href="https://freedom.press/issues/trump-will-try-to-destroy-press-freedom-we-wont-let-him/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Nov. 6 blog post</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Stern added that Trump would “almost certainly repeal” the protections against surveillance the Department of Justice had put in place during President Joe Biden’s term.</p>

Matt Gaetz leaves a House Republican Conference meeting at the U.S. Capitol on Oct. 3, 2023 in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">WASHINGTON — Former Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz announced Thursday he’s withdrawing as President-elect Donald Trump’s planned nominee for attorney general days after securing the appointment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Gaetz’s path to Senate confirmation was highly unlikely following years of investigations about alleged drug usage and payments for sex, including with an underage girl. He submitted his resignation to Congress last week.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“While the momentum was strong, it is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition,” Gaetz wrote in&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/mattgaetz/status/1859649045553402285" target="_blank">a social media post.</a> “There is no time to waste on a needlessly protracted Washington scuffle, thus I&#8217;ll be withdrawing my name from consideration to serve as Attorney General. Trump&#8217;s DOJ must be in place and ready on Day 1.”&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113522181118234752" target="_blank">posted on social media</a> afterward that he “greatly” appreciated “the recent efforts of Matt Gaetz in seeking approval to be Attorney General.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“He was doing very well but, at the same time, did not want to be a distraction for the Administration, for which he has much respect,” Trump wrote. “Matt has a wonderful future, and I look forward to watching all of the great things he will do!”</p>
<p dir="ltr">When asked if the Trump-Vance transition team had another nominee choice lined up, and whether they viewed the Gaetz withdrawal as a setback, spokesperson Karoline Leavitt did not provide details.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;President Trump remains committed to choosing a leader for the Department of Justice who will strongly defend the Constitution and end the weaponization of our justice system. President Trump will announce his new decision when it is made,&#8221; Leavitt told States Newsroom in an emailed statement.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The House Ethics Committee&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-ethics-panel-republicans-vote-against-disclosure-gaetz-report" target="_blank">voted along party lines</a> Wednesday not to release its report on Gaetz, following more than three years of investigation. Gaetz has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, including the allegations that he had sex with a minor.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Meetings with senators</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, spent Wednesday shuffling Gaetz between meetings with Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which would have held his confirmation hearing. Republicans will control the Senate in the new session of Congress beginning in January.</p>
<p dir="ltr">South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee,&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1859657654336983200" target="_blank">wrote on social media</a> that he respected Gaetz’s decision to withdraw his name from consideration as AG.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I look forward to working with President Trump regarding future nominees to get this important job up and running,” Graham said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley, incoming Judiciary Committee chair, posted the following on X: “I respect Gaetz decision &amp;look fwd 2helping PresTrump confirm qualified noms 2reform Dept of Justice &amp;bring TRANSPARENCY/ACCOUNTABILITY Trump’s mission = DRAIN THE SWAMP&amp; I would add get some1 who will answer my hundreds of outstanding oversight letters sitting at Biden DOJ/FBI.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Grassley’s staff referred States Newsroom to the social media post when the outlet reached out for comment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The offices of Sens. John Kennedy of Louisiana and Tom Cotton of Arkansas, fellow Senate Judiciary Committee Republicans, declined to comment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Gaetz’s future is unclear, given that he resigned from the U.S. House last week and notified the chamber he didn’t plan to take the oath of office for the upcoming 119th Congress.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He first joined the House in January 2017 and led efforts to remove former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy from that role last year, setting off a month-long stalemate within the House Republican Conference over who should lead the party.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The race to fill his empty seat in a special election has already&nbsp;<a href="https://floridaphoenix.com/2024/11/21/two-more-republicans-file-to-run-for-matt-gaetz-congressional-seat/" target="_blank">attracted six candidates</a>, mostly Republicans in a heavily conservative-leaning district.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Gaetz could jump into the race for his old seat, possibly winning a place back in the House of Representative next year following the special election.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He could also try to take the oath of office when the next session of Congress begins on Jan. 3, since he wrote in his resignation letter that he did “not intend to take the oath of office for the same office in the 119th Congress, to pursue the position of Attorney General in the Trump Administration.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">That would give the House Ethics Committee jurisdiction to complete its report on Gaetz and release it publicly.&nbsp;</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">AG oversees Department of Justice</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The attorney general is responsible for overseeing the Department of Justice, which includes the federal government&#8217;s top law enforcement agencies as well as prosecutors.</p>

<p dir="ltr">WASHINGTON — Former TV personality and onetime U.S. Senate candidate Mehmet Oz could become the next administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, an expansive government agency that is responsible for large swaths of the country’s health care.</p>
<p dir="ltr">President-elect Donald Trump announced his intent to nominate Oz on Tuesday, writing in a statement “there may be no Physician more qualified and capable than Dr. Oz to Make America Healthy Again.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Oz won the Republican primary in the 2022 Pennsylvania U.S. Senate race but was <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/briefs/oz-concedes-to-fetterman-in-pa-s-u-s-senate-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defeated during the general election</a> by Democratic Sen. John Fetterman.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump wrote that Oz would “work closely” with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-taps-vaccine-skeptic-rfk-jr-lead-department-health-and-human-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will be nominated for Health and Human Services secretary</a>, “to take on the illness industrial complex, and all the horrible chronic diseases left in its wake.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“He will also cut waste and fraud within our Country’s most expensive Government Agency, which is a third of our Nation’s Healthcare spend, and a quarter of our entire National Budget,” Trump wrote in the announcement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services manages the country’s largest health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, and the health insurance marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are 67.7 million people enrolled in Medicare, with nearly 90% of those enrollees over the age of 65. The program also provides health care coverage for younger people with severe illnesses or disabilities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Medicaid, a state-federal program that provides health coverage for low-income people, has about 72.4 million enrollees.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are 7.1 million CHIP program participants.</p>
<p dir="ltr">And 21.3 million people purchased health insurance through the ACA marketplace during the 2024 open enrollment period.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When added together, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services provides health care coverage to 1 in 4 Americans, according to its latest <a href="https://www.cms.gov/files/document/cms-financial-report-fiscal-year-2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financial report</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The agency spent about $1.516 trillion during the last fiscal year and has more than 6,700 federal employees as well as contractors to handle the workload.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“CMS and its contractors process over one billion Medicare claims annually, monitor quality of care, provide the states with matching funds for Medicaid benefits, and develop policies and procedures designed to give the best possible service to beneficiaries,” according to the report.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“CMS also assures the safety and quality of medical facilities, provides</p>
<p dir="ltr">health insurance protection to workers changing jobs, and maintains</p>
<p dir="ltr">the largest collection of healthcare data in the United States.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Oz received his undergraduate degree from Harvard University before earning a joint M.D. and MBA from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and Wharton Business School.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He starred in the daytime show “Dr. Oz,” which ran from 2009 until 2022.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Oz’s nomination is subject to Senate confirmation and is under the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee, currently led by Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden and Idaho Republican Sen. Mike Crapo.</p>
<p>Oz’s confirmation hearing won’t be the first time he’s testified before a Senate committee. More than 10 years ago, <a href="https://apnews.com/united-states-congress-united-states-government-television-ab2b321bd7bf40ebb4c80e49bb19d284" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he testified in front of a Senate panel </a>that his comments on his TV show about certain weight loss supplements were “flowery.”</p>

(Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)</p><p dir="ltr">WASHINGTON — A measure to ensure the federal student aid form opens up annually by Oct. 1 passed the U.S. House Friday with overwhelming bipartisan support.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/BILLS-118hr8932rh/pdf/BILLS-118hr8932rh.pdf" target="_blank">effort</a> — which passed 381-1 — came after the U.S. Department of Education faced major backlash over the botched rollout of the 2024-25&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/dont-give-fafsa-advocates-student-financial-aid-urge" target="_blank">Free Application for Federal Student Aid</a>, or FAFSA. California Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren was the only lawmaker to vote against the bill.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Though the form got a makeover after Congress passed the FAFSA Simplification Act in late 2020, users faced multiple glitches and technical errors throughout the form’s soft launch in December and past its full debut in January, prompting processing delays and gaps in submissions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The department has worked to correct these glitches and close that gap while also fixing major issues that prevented parents without Social Security numbers from completing the form.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Adding another complication, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-education-department-gradually-roll-out-new-fafsa-form-dec-1" target="_blank">department said in August</a> it would use a phased rollout of the 2025-26 form in an attempt to address any errors that might arise before it opens up to everyone — making the application fully available two months later than usual.</p>
<p>“Since Oct. 1, the Department has conducted three successful beta tests of the 2025–26 FAFSA form to ensure it is ready for all students and families on or before Dec. 1,” U.S. Under Secretary of Education James Kvaal said in a statement shared Monday with States Newsroom, while noting that the department already began its fourth testing stage this past week.</p>
<p>“We have a fully functioning site and a form working end-to-end that has been successfully submitted by more than 10,000 students, with dozens of schools all over the country receiving the data for student aid packages,” he said.</p>
<p>The department is on track to launch the 2026-27 FAFSA on Oct. 1, 2025, with “a fully functioning system,” according to Kvaal.&nbsp;</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Codified deadline</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Though the department legally has until Jan. 1 to roll out the form, it typically launches Oct. 1.</p>
<p dir="ltr">U.S. Rep. Erin Houchin, an Indiana Republican and member of the U.S. House Committee on Education and the Workforce, in July&nbsp;<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/8932" target="_blank">introduced the bill</a> to standardize that deadline.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I’m especially frustrated considering the Department of Education has had three years to simplify the FAFSA as Congress has dictated,” Houchin said during floor debate Friday.</p>
<p dir="ltr">She also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/gaps-fafsa-rollout-are-closing-watchdog-tells-us-house-panel" target="_blank">referenced recent findings</a> from the Government Accountability Office, including that nearly three-quarters of all calls to the call center went unanswered in the first five months of the 2024-25 rollout.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We want this program to work — we want to make sure that children and families that want to send their kids to college have the availability to do that and that the FAFSA is available and workable,” she added.</p>
<p dir="ltr">U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott, ranking member of the House education panel, echoed his support during the floor debate, saying the measure will “help ensure that even more students have the information they need in a timelier manner to access Pell Grants and other vital student aid.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Scott initially opposed the effort when the committee took it up in July out of concerns that the implementation deadline could force the department to roll out an incomplete form on Oct. 1 of this year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“However, because we’re now considering the bill after Oct. 1, the deadline will apply next year, 2025, and that gives the department ample time to make improvements and fix any lingering issues,” the Virginia Democrat said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/4632" target="_blank">introduced a companion bill</a> in July.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bill was referred to the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, where Cassidy serves as ranking member. After Republicans won a Senate majority in the Nov. 5 elections,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.help.senate.gov/ranking/newsroom/press/cassidy-to-chair-help-committee-in-119th-congress" target="_blank">Cassidy is in line</a> to chair the panel next year.&nbsp;</p>

Matt Gaetz is photographed inside the Rayburn House Office Building Feb. 27, 2019. &nbsp;(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)</p><p dir="ltr">WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump announced Wednesday that he intends to nominate U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz as the next attorney general of the United States, an unexpected pick as the Florida Republican remains the subject of a congressional ethics investigation for alleged sexual misconduct, illicit drug use and accepting improper gifts.</p>
<p dir="ltr">House Speaker Mike Johnson announced on Wednesday night at a GOP press conference following leadership elections that Gaetz has already submitted a letter of resignation from the House.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I think out of deference to us, he issued his resignation letter effective immediately of Congress,” Johnson said. “That caught us by surprise a little bit, but I asked him what the reasoning was, and he said, ‘Well, you can&#8217;t have too many absences.’”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Florida state law, Johnson said, provides an eight-week time frame for the governor to fill a vacancy. He’s already placed a call to Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is in Italy, to ask him to begin that timeline.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“And if we start the clock now, if you do the math, we may be able to fill that seat as early as January 3, when we take the new oath of office for the new Congress,” Johnson said.&nbsp; “So Matt would have done us a great service by making that decision, as he did on the fly. And so we&#8217;re grateful for that.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The position of attorney general requires U.S. Senate approval, and if confirmed, the four-term congressman and Trump ally would lead the massive U.S. Justice Department that oversees more than 40 component organizations and 115,000 employees, according to the department.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The announcement comes as U.S. special counsel Jack Smith&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-prosecutors-move-wind-down-trump-jan-6-case-after-win-presidential-race" target="_blank">winds down</a> two federal investigations of Trump — one, alleging Trump improperly stored classified government documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate after leaving office, and the other stemming from his alleged scheme to subvert the 2020 presidential election. Justice Department memos from 1973 and 2000 concluded that criminally prosecuting a sitting president would impair the leader’s capacity to carry out the office’s functions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump first announced his decision to choose Gaetz on social media, describing the congressman as “a deeply gifted and tenacious attorney, trained at the William &amp; Mary College of Law, who has distinguished himself in Congress through his focus on achieving desperately needed reform at the Department of Justice.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Revealing the information on Truth Social roughly 10 minutes before his transition team sent an official statement, the president-elect wrote that Gaetz “will root out the systemic corruption at DOJ, and return the Department to its true mission of fighting Crime, and upholding our Democracy and Constitution. We must have Honesty, Integrity, and Transparency at DOJ. Under Matt’s leadership, all Americans will be proud of the Department of Justice once again.” Trump routinely writes on social media in mixed capitalization.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Gaetz quickly published on the social media platform X that, “It will be an honor to serve as President Trump’s Attorney General!”</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Ethics probe</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The House Committee on Ethics&nbsp;<a href="https://ethics.house.gov/press-releases/statement-regarding-matter-representative-matt-gaetz" target="_blank">revealed</a> in June that it would continue pursuing allegations in its ongoing investigation of Gaetz, including the possibility the lawmaker may have “engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, accepted improper gifts, dispensed special privileges and favors to individuals with whom he had a personal relationship, and sought to obstruct government investigations of his conduct.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Gaetz has “categorically denied all of the allegations before the Committee,” according to the committee’s June update on the matter.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The committee’s probe began in April 2021 and originally included allegations that the lawmaker “shared inappropriate images or videos on the House floor, misused state identification records, converted campaign funds to personal use, and/or accepted a bribe or improper gratuity.” The committee announced in June that it was no longer pursuing those specific accusations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As of June, the panel had&nbsp;spoken with more than a dozen witnesses, issued 25 subpoenas, and reviewed thousands of pages of documents regarding the Gaetz probe.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Rep. Michael Guest, chair of the House Ethics Committee, told reporters Wednesday that if Gaetz is confirmed by the Senate as attorney general, his committee will no longer have jurisdiction over the probe.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Once we lose jurisdiction, there would not be a report that would be issued,” said Guest, a Mississippi Republican elected to Congress in 2019. “That&#8217;s not unique to this case, we have that every new Congress, where there are members who are under ethics investigation, who either choose not to run again, in some instances, or they resign or they lose reelection.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We&#8217;re not going to rush this investigation because of the appointment. And so we&#8217;re going to again follow the rules and the procedures that we set in place.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The ethics investigation is expected to wrap up following Gaetz’s resignation, though Punchbowl News&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/JakeSherman/status/1856859774211563535" target="_blank">reported</a> that the panel was set to release a “highly damaging” report in the days ahead</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Lawmakers taken aback</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Senators on Capitol Hill, who will have to vet and possibly vote to confirm Gaetz, expressed surprise at Trump’s announcement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski said that she expected to consider another option at some point.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s a serious nomination for the attorney general,” Murkowski said. “We need to have a serious attorney general and I&#8217;m looking forward to the opportunity to consider somebody that is serious.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said she was shocked when she heard the news. She said that she and her colleagues will want to question Gaetz.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Obviously, the president has the right to nominate whomever he wishes. But I&#8217;m certain that there will be a lot of questions,” Collins, a Republican, said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn said he doesn’t know Gaetz “other than his public persona,” but said Gaetz will face questions and possibly challenges getting the votes needed for Senate confirmation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll have a lot of questions, and I&#8217;m sure all that stuff will come out,” Cornyn said. “And then it&#8217;s a question of, can he get 51 votes?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., said that Republicans were the ones to question about whether they’d support Gaetz’s nomination, since Democrats were unlikely to do so.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Talk to my colleagues, like, to see who&#8217;s gonna vote for, like, a jerk-off like that,” Fetterman said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst said Gaetz “has his work cut out for him,” and that it will be up to the Judiciary Committee to decide whether to confirm him to the post.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio, who Trump on Wednesday nominated as secretary of State, said that he was supportive of the president-elect’s pick.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I’ve known Matt for a long time, I think he would do a good job,” Rubio said, adding that he wouldn’t comment further about the recent ethics complaints against Gaetz.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Democrats who sit on the Judiciary Committee that would be tasked with holding a nomination hearing for Gaetz, such as Cory Booker of New Jersey and Jon Ossoff of Georgia, declined to comment on the news.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I’m literally just walking out of a meeting and hearing this,” Booker said. “Give me a minute.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Wisconsin GOP Sen. Ron Johnson said he honestly doesn’t “know (Gaetz) that well or know his professional qualifications.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I know of his skill in questioning witnesses in the House,” Johnson said. “I really don&#8217;t know his legal background that much. I&#8217;ve never really spent much time with him, other than a couple times in different meetings, so I just don’t know him that well.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Rep. Jim Himes, ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, issued a strong rebuke of Trump’s choice of Gaetz for the position.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The Attorney General of the United States must have strong judgement, moral character, and a deep respect for the law. As almost all members of Congress know, Matt Gaetz has none of those things. What he does have is unconditional loyalty to Donald Trump and a willingness to weaponize the government against his political allies— an affinity that he and the president-elect share,” Himes, a Connecticut Democrat, said in a statement.</p>

Biden continued the tradition of inviting the newly elected president to meet at the White House after Trump won the presidential election on Nov. 5.

<p dir="ltr">The pair met behind closed doors in the Oval Office for most of the meeting that lasted just under two hours. Biden’s Chief of Staff Jeff Zients and Trump’s incoming counterpart, Susie Wiles, joined the president and president-elect.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Biden had been seeking reelection against Trump until late July, when Biden dropped his bid. Vice President Kamala Harris lost the race to Trump after just over 100 days of campaigning as the Democratic nominee.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Harris did not attend the meeting, according to the White House.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In brief remarks before cameras, Biden congratulated his predecessor who will again take the oath of office in January as the nation’s 47th president.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Well, Mr. President-elect, former president, Donald, congratulations,” Biden said, as Trump interjected with “Thank you very much, Joe.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“And looking forward to having a, like I said, smooth transition, do everything we can to make sure you’re accommodated, what you need,” Biden continued. “And we’re gonna get a chance to talk about some of that today.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump again thanked Biden and responded “And politics is tough. And it’s, many cases, not a very nice world, but it is a nice world today. And I appreciate it very much, a transition that’s so smooth, it’ll be as smooth as it can get. I very much appreciate that, Joe,” Trump said.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">A ‘substantive’ conversation</h4>
<p dir="ltr">First lady Jill Biden joined the president in greeting Trump and presented a handwritten letter of congratulations and offer for transition assistance addressed to incoming first lady Melania Trump, according to the White House.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The meeting got underway just after 11 a.m. Eastern, and the press was ushered out after the brief welcoming remarks and photo opportunity. Biden and Trump finished their private discussion at roughly 1 p.m. Eastern.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Neither addressed a large gathering of reporters and photographers outside afterward.</p>
<p dir="ltr">White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden and Trump had “a very good back and forth.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“(Biden) wants you all to know that the president-elect was gracious, came with a detailed set of questions, it was, again, substantive” Jean-Pierre said at the daily press briefing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Jean-Pierre declined to provide the meeting’s specifics but said “the length of the meeting tells you they had an in-depth conversation on an array of issues.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump did <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/biden-has-invited-trump-to-the-white-house-trump-shunned-that-tradition-when-biden-won" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not</a> invite Biden to the White House following his 2020 presidential election win, nor did he attend his successor’s inauguration that occurred just 14 days after a mob of his supporters violently tried to stop Congress’ certification of Biden’s victory.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The president-elect’s transition team did not immediately respond to States Newsroom’s inquiries on why Trump did not invite Biden to the White House in 2020.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Musk, Ramaswamy to head new initiative</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The president-elect continues to announce numerous Cabinet and staff positions, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-names-floridas-rep-mike-waltz-national-security-adviser" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stacking</a> his administration with staunch loyalists.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Late Tuesday, Trump announced he named billionaire Elon Musk and former presidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy to what he describes as a new “Department of Government Efficiency,” or shortened to “DOGE,” also the name for a popular internet dog meme and cryptocurrency in the last decade.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump said the new entity would function outside of government.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“To drive this kind of drastic change, the Department of Government Efficiency will provide advice and guidance from outside of Government, and will partner with the White House and Office of Management &#038; Budget to drive large scale structural reform, and create an entrepreneurial approach to Government never seen before,” Trump said in a statement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Musk was also present, sitting in the front row during Trump’s visit with House Republicans earlier Wednesday.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Also on Tuesday night, Trump announced Fox News host Pete Hegseth as his pick for secretary of Defense, a position that requires managing hundreds of billions in Pentagon spending.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Trump endorses Johnson</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Trump joined House Republicans Wednesday morning before his meeting with Biden at the White House. At a hotel near the U.S. Capitol, Trump received a standing ovation from GOP lawmakers, according to congressional pool reports.</p>
<p dir="ltr">House Speaker Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana, introduced Trump, calling him a “singular figure in American history,” according to congressional pool reports. </p>
<p dir="ltr">House Republicans are also planning to have their leadership elections late Wednesday, but it’s expected that Johnson will be selected to continue the role, although an official vote for the speaker’s gavel will take place in January.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At the meeting, Trump threw his support behind Johnson to continue in his role as House speaker, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-republicans-meet-triumphant-trump-elect-leadership-team-rcna179669" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to NBC News.</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">During the meeting, Trump touted GOP wins in keeping control of the lower chamber. Although Republicans are on track to hold their slim majority, The Associated Press, the news organization that States Newsroom relies upon for race calls based on <a href="https://www.ap.org/elections/our-role/how-we-call-races/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decades of experience</a>, has not called the House for Republicans though it might happen soon.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://apnews.com/live/election-house-trump-updates-11-13-24?tab=00000193-238b-dd90-adb7-bf9b31be0000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As of Wednesday</a> afternoon, Republicans have 216 seats, just two short of the 218 seats needed for control. Democrats have 207 seats, with 12 races still to be called.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump also joked about wanting to run for another term in office — <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">something that the U.S. Constitution prohibits</a>, as presidents are limited to only serving two terms. </p>
<p dir="ltr">“I suspect I won’t be running again unless you do something,” Trump told members, who laughed, according to pool reports.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Democrats ready to push back</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Chair of the House Democratic Caucus Pete Aguilar said Wednesday that Democrats are ready to work with the incoming administration in a bipartisan manner, but are also prepared to push back on efforts to further restrict reproductive rights, such as a national abortion ban, and any changes to the Affordable Care Act.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We’re clear-eyed about the challenge ahead of us,” Aguilar, Democrat of California, said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He acknowledged the failure of Democrats to regain control of the House.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I think it’s appropriate for the current caucus to reflect on what happened, to listen to listen to our constituents, to listen to American people, to listen to our members, to gather data, and then to chart a path forward,” he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Aguilar added that Democrats plan to look at voter data to understand the issues important to their voting bloc.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I don’t want to have broad generalizations of any group or geographic or otherwise, without that data in front of me,” he said. “I think it’s very clear to us that for people with two jobs, the economy is, gas and groceries and rent. We’ll need to speak to those issues if we’re going to be the party that speaks to our community members and people working, everyday Americans, then we need to speak to those issues, and … that’s on us to communicate.”</p>

(Photo by Steven Hirsch-Pool/Getty Images)</p><p dir="ltr">WASHINGTON — All court proceedings for President-elect Donald Trump’s guilty conviction in New York are now paused, as the prosecution examines moving forward with the case against the man who will be sworn in as the 47th president of the United States.</p>
<p dir="ltr">New York Judge Juan Merchan stayed all actions Monday in the People of New York v. Donald J. Trump until Nov. 19, according to email correspondence between all parties that was <a href="https://www.nycourts.gov/LegacyPDFS/press/PDFs/People-v-DJT-App4Adjournment11-12-24.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> by the court.</p>
<p dir="ltr">U.S. special counsel Jack Smith has similarly <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-prosecutors-move-wind-down-trump-jan-6-case-after-win-presidential-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requested</a> a federal judge to delay proceedings in Trump’s 2020 election interference case.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump, who was found guilty by a jury in late May of 34 felonies in falsifying business, is scheduled to be sentenced on Nov. 26.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Merchan has yet to rule on Trump’s motion to dismiss the case based on the U.S. Supreme Court’s July presidential immunity ruling that triggered questions over what evidence against a former president can or cannot be admitted to a court of law.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Delay sought</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Merchan granted the delay in response to a joint application from both the District Attorney of New York’s office and Trump’s defense team, which wants the case altogether dismissed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">New York prosecutor Matthew Colangelo informed Merchan in an email Sunday that Trump’s team requested on Friday the state delay the case “to provide time to review and consider a number of arguments based on the impact on this proceeding from the results of the Presidential election.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Colangelo agreed the “unprecedented circumstances” presented by Trump’s election victory “require careful consideration to ensure that any further steps in this proceeding appropriately balance the competing interests of (1) a jury verdict of guilt following trial that has the presumption of regularity; and (2) the Office of the President.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Colangelo asked Merchan to give him until Nov. 19 to decide how and whether the prosecution will move forward.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Later Sunday morning, Trump attorney Emil Bove followed with an email to Merchan agreeing with the prosecution’s deadline request.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The stay, and dismissal, are necessary to avoid unconstitutional impediments to President Trump’s ability to govern, which is the broader argument that we made to DANY on Friday,” Bove wrote.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">34 felony charges</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Trump made history as the first former president to become a convicted felon when the New York jury on May 30 found him guilty on all 34 felony charges for covering up hush money payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels just ahead of the 2016 presidential election.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The trial that stretched throughout the spring featured witness <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/porn-star-stormy-daniels-nyc-hush-money-trial-alleges-sexual-encounter-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">testimony</a> from Daniels about a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006 at a Lake Tahoe golf resort.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Former Trump attorney Michael Cohen was also called by the prosecution to <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/star-witness-trump-trial-tells-plot-conceal-porn-star-hush-money-payments" target="_blank" rel="noopener">give an account</a> of Trump’s concealment of 11 invoices, 11 checks and 12 ledger entries to repay Cohen for the $130,000 in hush money he paid to Daniels.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/angry-trump-pledges-appeal-scam-conviction-republicans-vow-resistance-24" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slammed</a> the trial and conviction as a “scam,” and Republicans showed resounding support for the former president during and after the proceedings, with House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, calling the verdict a “shameful day in American history.”</p>

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)</p><p dir="ltr">WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden on Thursday reassured the nation that democracy won despite his party’s resounding election losses, and promised his accomplishments will live on, in brief remarks from the White House.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I know for some people, it&#8217;s a time for victory, to state the obvious. For others, it&#8217;s a time of loss. Campaigns are contests of competing visions. The country chooses one or the other. We accept the choice the country made,” Biden said in just over six minutes of remarks to his staff and administration officials gathered in the Rose Garden just after 11 a.m. Eastern.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Former Republican President Donald Trump, now president-elect,&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/live/trump-harris-election-updates-11-5-2024#00000193-0229-dcda-ab93-b2e9ada10000" target="_blank">handily won</a> the 2024 presidential contest Tuesday against Vice President Kamala Harris, earning victories in closely watched swing states, including Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump as of early Thursday afternoon had 295 Electoral College votes, to 226 for Harris, with 270 needed for victory. He also led in the popular vote.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Republicans also secured a Senate majority, gaining at least 52 seats while Democrats have 45. Control of the U.S. House&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/it-was-hell-good-day-us-senate-gop-takes-election-victory-lap" target="_blank">remained unclear</a>, though a trend toward GOP victory was emerging as ballots were still being counted.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Biden ran against Trump for the majority of the 2024 presidential race but dropped his reelection bid weeks after a disastrous presidential debate performance sparked a pressure campaign for him to step aside.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Biden phoned Trump Wednesday to congratulate him and arranged an in-person meeting to discuss the White House transition — a step that Trump did not take following his loss to Biden in 2020.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I assured him I’d direct my entire administration to work with his team to ensure a peaceful and orderly transition. That&#8217;s what the American people deserve,” Biden said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Biden also talked about his phone call Wednesday with Democratic nominee Harris, whom he described as a “partner and public servant.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“She ran an inspiring campaign, and everyone got to see something that I learned early on to respect so much: her character. She has a backbone like a ramrod,” Biden said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The president said he told his team that “together, we’ve changed America for the better.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Much of the work we&#8217;ve done is already being felt by the American people, with the vast majority of it will not be felt, will be felt over the next 10 years,” Biden said, specifically citing the bipartisan infrastructure legislation he signed into&nbsp;<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3684" target="_blank">law</a> in November 2021.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Harris&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/vp-harris-concedes-presidential-race-phone-call-donald-trump" target="_blank">conceded</a> the race Wednesday in a phone call to Trump.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?539843-1/vice-president-kamala-harris-concession-speech" target="_blank">speech</a> to somber supporters at her alma mater Howard University in Washington, D.C., the same day, Harris told the crowd “I get it” when it comes to feeling a range of emotions following the outcome.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“But we must accept the results of this election. … A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election we accept the results,” Harris said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Following the 2020 presidential election, Trump and his allies challenged the results in dozens of ultimately unsuccessful lawsuits. Following his losses in court, Trump and a team of private lawyers continued to deny the election outcome and pressure state officials to manipulate slates of electors.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump’s repeated denials of his loss — including a speech on Jan. 6, 2021 where he told his supporters he would never concede — culminated in a violent attack on the U.S. Capitol as Congress met that day to certify the election results.&nbsp;</p>

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)</p><p dir="ltr">WASHINGTON — Vice President Kamala Harris Wednesday afternoon called Donald Trump to concede the 2024 presidential race, according to a senior Harris aide.</p>
<p dir="ltr">During the call, the Democratic presidential nominee “discussed the importance of a peaceful transfer of power and being a president for all Americans,” the senior aide said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Steven Cheung, the Trump campaign communications director said in a statement that during the call Trump “acknowledged Vice President Harris on her strength, professionalism, and tenacity throughout the campaign, and both leaders agreed on the importance of unifying the country.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Harris&nbsp;delivered a concession speech at 4 p.m. Eastern to her supporters at Howard University in Washington, D.C. Her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, was in the crowd as well.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The outcome of this election is not what we wanted,” she said. “But hear me when I say this: The light of America&#8217;s promise will always burn bright.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Harris told her supporters to not be discouraged by the results, but to continue the fighting and organizing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Sometimes the fight takes a while,” she said. “This is not a time to throw up our hands, this is a time to roll up our sleeves.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The college was also the site of her election watch party on Tuesday night, which quickly turned somber after her path to the White House narrowed when the southern battleground states of North Carolina and Georgia swung to Trump.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Harris, who was originally expected to attend her own election night party, never arrived on campus, disappointing supporters and Howard alums.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/ap-former-president-donald-trump-wins-second-term" target="_blank">Trump was declared the presidential winner</a> early Wednesday, according to projections by The Associated Press.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Harris said it was important to accept the results of the race – something that Trump did not do four years ago, leading to a violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“That principle, as much as any other, distinguishes democracy from monarchy or tyranny and anyone who seeks the public trust must honor it,” she said. “At the same time, in our nation, we owe loyalty not to a president or a party, but to the Constitution of the United States.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Harris said that while she concedes the election, “I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The presidential race isn’t the only loss for Democrats. They lost control of&nbsp; the U.S. Senate and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/it-was-hell-good-day-us-senate-gop-takes-election-victory-lap" target="_blank">Republicans are favored to take the House</a>, potentially giving the GOP a trifecta in Washington.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The election saw a deep gender divide,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/25/harris-trump-poll-gender-gap/75697863007/" target="_blank">with exit poll surveys</a> showing women tended to favor Harris over Trump.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It’s the second time a woman has led as the presidential candidate for a major party and it’s the second time a woman has lost to Trump. Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton lost to him in 2016.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The election came two years after the constitutional right to an abortion was stripped away by the U.S. Supreme Court. The incoming 47th president cemented its conservative majority by hand-picking three justices.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Harris, whose bid only began in July after President Joe Biden suspended his reelection campaign, had a little over 100 days to pick a running mate, release policy plans to appeal to voters and hit the seven battleground states.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite the sprint of a campaign, Harris said she was grateful for the campaign she and Walz ran and the coalition they built along the way.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some of that coalition was fractured, though. There was deep dissatisfaction within her party for the current administration’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Michigan, which has a high Arab American population and is a state that Biden won in 2020,&nbsp;<a href="https://michiganadvance.com/2024/11/06/trump-turns-michigan-red-once-again/" target="_blank">voted for Trump</a>, according to projections by The Associated Press.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It was Harris’ second time running for the White House, after her first run quickly fizzled in 2019 before Biden picked her as his running mate.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With Biden out of the race following a disastrous June debate that rattled his party’s belief he could win a rematch against Trump, the coronation of Harris as the party heir breathed new hope into Democrats along with a flood of cash. They raised more than $1 billion, according to the campaign.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite the funding and new enthusiasm among Democrats, the swing states of Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin ultimately went to Trump, giving him a clear path to the White House with 292 Electoral College votes out of 270 needed to win the White House, to her 224 votes,&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/live/trump-harris-election-updates-11-5-2024" target="_blank">according to The Associated Press.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p dir="ltr">The first-ever&nbsp;<a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2024/05/30/breaking-trump-found-guilty-on-34-felony-counts-in-ny-hush-money-trial/" target="_blank">convicted</a> felon elected to the Oval Office,&nbsp;Trump by 8 a.m. Eastern had won four of the vital seven swing states in which he and the Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, spent most of their time campaigning through 2024.</p>
<p dir="ltr">North Carolina,<a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2024/11/06/after-bitter-defeat-in-2020-trump-comes-back-to-win-georgia-in-2024/" target="_blank"> Georgia</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://penncapital-star.com/election-2024/donald-trump-projected-to-win-pennsylvanias-19-electoral-votes/" target="_blank">Pennsylvania</a> and Wisconsin all voted for Trump, giving him 277 Electoral College votes compared to 224 for Harris.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Still without a victor declared were Michigan, Nevada and Arizona. But even without them, Trump — who will be the nation’s 47th president as well as having been its 45th — had more than enough of the 270 votes required to win the Electoral College.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump still faces charges of election subversion related to his actions in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">GOP Senate</h4>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/struggle-control-congress-too-close-call-states-begin-adding-votes" target="_blank">Republicans also took control&nbsp;</a>of the U.S. Senate, guaranteeing Trump a relatively smooth path in confirming his appointments to the courts and the Cabinet in the coming months.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As of Wednesday morning, Republicans had nabbed 52 seats in the Senate and Democrats had 42, the AP said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Montana Sen. Jon Tester, a longtime centrist Democrat viewed as his party’s most vulnerable senator in 2024,&nbsp;<a href="https://dailymontanan.com/2024/11/06/sheehy-leads-tester-in-early-montana-us-senate-results/" target="_blank">was ousted&nbsp;</a>by Republican Tim Sheehy in a high-profile race called by the AP on Wednesday morning.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Control of the U.S. House had not yet been called but Republicans were leading there on Wednesday morning, 198-180.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If they were to maintain control of the chamber, that would set up an extraordinary Republican trifecta in Washington that likely could expedite legislation including on taxes, the debt, reproductive rights and immigration.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Harris is expected to address the nation on Wednesday, her campaign co-chair, Cedric Richmond, told a crowd that had gathered Tuesday night for an election watch party at her alma mater, Howard University in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p dir="ltr">All results are unofficial until local election officials across the country&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eac.gov/election-officials/election-results-canvass-and-certification" target="_blank">verify and certify</a> the outcome in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/election-certification-deadlines" target="_blank">coming days and weeks</a>.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Trump legal problems</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Trump’s long presidential campaign was punctuated by a busy legal schedule that included two federal cases, still&nbsp;<a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2024/10/03/special-counsel-jack-smith-reveals-new-evidence-against-trump-in-2020-election-case/" target="_blank">ongoing</a>, and cases in Georgia and New York. The former president was convicted in New York in May on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to hush money paid to a porn star ahead of the 2016 election. His sentencing is scheduled for Nov. 26.</p>
<p dir="ltr">His long appeal of the government’s 2020 election subversion charges against him eventually received a victory in the U.S. Supreme Court when the conservative majority ruled that former presidents enjoy criminal immunity for core constitutional duties, and presumed immunity for duties on the office’s outer perimeter, but none for personal actions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After the election subversion case was returned to the lower court, U.S. special counsel Jack Smith presented new evidence to underscore that Trump schemed to overturn 2020 presidential results in a personal capacity, acting alongside his private lawyers. Trump has indicated numerous times that, if elected to another presidency, he would oust Smith.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump’s refusal to concede the 2020 presidential contest to President Joe Biden eventually culminated in his supporters’ violent attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Speaking to his supporters in West Palm Beach, Florida, earlier on Wednesday, alongside his running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, Trump thanked “thousands of friends in this incredible movement like nobody’s ever seen before.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Frankly, this was, I believe, the greatest political movement of all time. There’s never been anything like this in this country,” Trump said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump promised to “heal” the country and that his second presidency “will truly be the golden age of America.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We overcame obstacles that nobody thought possible,” Trump said.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">A roller coaster race</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Trump had spent most of his reelection campaigning against President Joe Biden, who bowed out of the race in the summer after a disastrous debate performance.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That required the Trump team to pivot to a new campaign with a candidate Trump had never gone up against — Harris.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Harris, who touted herself as the underdog, tried to position herself as a new generation of leadership and through her policy plans on housing, health care and the economy, offering a new chapter for Americans.</p>
<p dir="ltr">She heavily ran on her support of reproductive rights and the threat to democracy that a second Trump presidency would bring, citing the immunity ruling from the Supreme Court.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the end, Trump’s core campaign issues of immigration and criticisms of the economy appeared to have swayed voters, and she fell short of claiming any of the swing state votes that offered her a path toward victory.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As it became clear late Tuesday that she was falling behind in support in key states that carried Biden to the White House in 2020, thousands of her supporters who gathered at Howard University for a<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/harris-watch-party-dc-hope-gives-way-anxiety" target="_blank"> watch party left in waves</a> as her chances for victory continued to narrow.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Trump led with 267 Electoral College votes overall nationally, eclipsing Democratic nominee Vice President Harris’ 224, just before 3 a.m. Eastern, according to the AP. A total of 270 votes are needed to win.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Associated Press had not yet projected results for the other battleground states of Arizona, Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin. Trump, however, held leads in all four. Alaska’s three electoral votes are reliably Republican and were expected in the morning hours.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Decision Desk HQ and Fox News also called Wisconsin for Trump, which would give him an Electoral College victory. The AP and other media that project election winners, including NBC News, CNN and The New York Times, had not called the race by 3 a.m. Eastern.</p>
<p dir="ltr">All results are unofficial until local election officials across the country <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://www.eac.gov/election-officials/election-results-canvass-and-certification" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">verify and certify</a> the outcome in the <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/election-certification-deadlines" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">coming days and weeks</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump declared victory at his election night party just before 3 a.m. Wednesday.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Though votes in key swing states were still being counted, the speech signaled the end of an extraordinary presidential contest defined by Trump’s <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2024/11/04/trump-more-than-ever-mixes-anger-fear-and-insults-to-stir-supporters-say-researchers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">divisive</a> rhetoric, his <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/CRIMINAL-INDICTMENT.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">numerous</a> <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://missouriindependent.com/2024/07/15/federal-judge-dismisses-trump-classified-documents-criminal-case/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">criminal</a> <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://missouriindependent.com/2024/09/05/judge-in-trumps-jan-6-case-says-it-wont-be-delayed-by-upcoming-presidential-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">cases</a> and <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://penncapital-star.com/campaigns-elections/fbi-identifies-shooter-in-assassination-attempt-on-trump-at-butler-rally/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">two</a> <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://washingtonstatestandard.com/2024/09/16/man-arrested-after-poking-rifle-onto-trump-golf-course-charged-with-federal-gun-crimes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">attempts</a> on his life.

<h4 dir="ltr">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump promises to ‘heal’</h4>

	</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Trump amassed electoral votes shortly after polls closed in states forecast in his favor, and picked up critical wins in key battlegrounds when the AP projected victories for him in <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://ncnewsline.com/2024/11/05/ap-trump-wins-north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">North Carolina</a> just before midnight, <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2024/11/06/after-bitter-defeat-in-2020-trump-comes-back-to-win-georgia-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">Georgia</a> at about 1 a.m., and <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://penncapital-star.com/election-2024/donald-trump-projected-to-win-pennsylvanias-19-electoral-votes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">Pennsylvania</a> just before 2:30 a.m. Trump won the key states in his successful 2016 campaign but lost them in his failed reelection bid in 2020.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Speaking to his supporters in West Palm Beach, Florida, Trump thanked “thousands of friends in this incredible movement like nobody’s ever seen before.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Frankly, this was, I believe, the greatest political movement of all time. There&#8217;s never been anything like this in this country,” Trump said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump promised to “heal” the country and that his second presidency “will truly be the golden age of America.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We overcame obstacles that nobody thought possible,” Trump said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">During his roughly 25-minute speech, Trump thanked his family and campaign staff, and invited his running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, and Dana White, CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship, to speak on stage.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Vance, poised to become Trump’s vice president, said a new administration would usher in an economic “comeback” for the U.S.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I think we just witnessed the greatest political comeback in the history of the United States of America,” Vance said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">White thanked popular podcast host Joe Rogan for his election eve endorsement of Trump.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This is what happens when the machine comes after you,” White said. “This is karma, ladies and gentlemen.”</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Harris to speak Wednesday</h4>

	</h4>
<p dir="ltr">As election night turned into early Wednesday, the previously energetic crowd at Howard <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/harris-watch-party-dc-hope-gives-way-anxiety" target="_blank">started to dwindle</a>. Once campaign co-chair Cedric Richmond announced Harris would not be speaking at the party, the last stragglers left in waves, the mood quickly souring.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Richmond said that Harris would address supporters and the nation later Wednesday, and tried to give a small pep talk.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We still have votes to count,” he said. “We still have states that have not been called yet.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">In reference to reports that Harris’ watch party had begun to wind down, Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt commented on X “sounds like joy has left the building…” The word “joy” was a rallying cry among the Harris camp and supporters during her whirlwind campaign.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Billionaire Elon Musk, a major funder and surrogate for the Trump campaign, posted on his platform X a photo of a launching rocket ship along with the words, “The future is gonna be fantastic.” Shortly before that he posted a photoshopped image of himself hauling a sink into the Oval Office with the message, “Let that sink in.”</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘I don’t feel as hopeful’</h4>

	</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Harris had planned to spend election night at her alma mater, Howard University in Washington, D.C., where her supporters gathered, but she never left from the vice president’s residence at the Naval Observatory, according to press pool reports.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Early in the evening, Lalika Gerald, a Howard graduate from 2005, remembers studying TV production in the library that is now overlooking an election night rally for potentially the first Black woman to lead the country.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It’s a very exciting time just to be here and to know that a Bison like myself is about to be our president,” she said, referring to the university’s mascot.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The 41-year-old from Prince George’s County, Maryland, said she has felt a roller coaster of emotions throughout the day.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“As excited and as hopeful as I am, you know you never know what might happen,” she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a moment for us to be really seen.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">By the time the event ended around 1 a.m., Harris supporters’ said the hope they felt at the start of the evening had left.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I don’t know what’s happening, but it’s very stressful right now,” Liane Crosey said as she left the watch party. “Seeing the numbers coming in, I don’t feel as hopeful.”</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A convicted felon in the Oval Office</h4>

<p dir="ltr">Trump is positioned to make history as the first-ever <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2024/05/30/breaking-trump-found-guilty-on-34-felony-counts-in-ny-hush-money-trial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">convicted</a> felon elected to the presidency. His long presidential campaign tangled with a busy legal calendar that included two federal cases, still <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://missouriindependent.com/2024/10/03/special-counsel-jack-smith-reveals-new-evidence-against-trump-in-2020-election-case/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">ongoing</a>, and cases in Georgia and New York. The former president was convicted in New York in May on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to hush money paid to a porn star ahead of the 2016 election. His sentencing is scheduled for Nov. 26.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump ascended on the campaign trail despite facing federal felony charges for scheming to overturn the 2020 presidential election.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Four years ago, Trump refused to concede to Biden in 2020 and lost dozens of court cases challenging the results.</p>
<p dir="ltr">His repetition of the lie that the 2020 was “stolen” from him became a main feature of his campaign rallies in 2024.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The major policy area he focused on during the campaign was curtailing immigration, and he promised to conduct mass deportations of immigrants in the country illegally. Trump and Vance also targeted legal immigrants, including by amplifying the debunked rumor that Haitians with Temporary Protected Status in Springfield, Ohio, were eating pets.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump also pledged to ramp up tariffs, taxes on goods produced overseas, in an effort to boost U.S. manufacturing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump and campaign officials tried to distance the candidate from a comprehensive conservative policy blueprint written by the Heritage Foundation, a Washington think tank. The plan calls for restructuring the federal government to empower the president, further restricting abortion access and limiting immigration, among other proposals.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump would likely enjoy friendly lawmakers in Washington over the next two years, as Republicans were <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/republicans-take-majority-control-us-senate-after-ohio-west-virginia-victories" target="_blank">projected to win</a> control of the U.S. Senate. Control of the House remained unknown early Wednesday,</p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite several U.S. House races remaining too close to call, Republican Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana issued a written statement declaring “There is hope and morning in America again!”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Donald Trump is now our President-elect, chosen by the American people for such a time as this. The citizens of our great country used their voices to decisively reject four more years of Harris’ open borders, high crime, increased cost of living, weaponized government, dangerous radical woke ideology, and weakness on the world stage &#8211; demanding instead, a return to common sense, peace, and prosperity,” Johnson said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump is not officially president-elect until election results are certified.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">In the states</h4>

	</h4>
<p dir="ltr">States Newsroom journalists fanned out across the country Tuesday, talking to voters outside churches, community centers, schools and courthouses, where the presidential race not only weighed on their minds, but congressional contests and ballot initiatives as well.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Voter Stephanie Capps in Raleigh, <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://ncnewsline.com/briefs/election-day-in-battleground-nc-voters-reflect-on-history-and-the-future-theyd-like-to-see/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">North Carolina</a>, said she brought her 9-year-old daughter to the polls to show her democracy in action.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Because a little over 100 years ago, women couldn’t vote,” Capps told NC Newsline. “And so, we talked about how it’s really important for her to learn to vote.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The presidential campaigns continued to hit swing states, speak to the press and issue statements reminding voters of their rights.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Harris stayed in Washington, D.C, where she called in to several radio shows in battleground states. According to her campaign, she was a guest on Power 99 in Philadelphia with Cappuchino and KDKA NewsRadio in Pittsburgh with Larry Richert, the Big Tigger Morning Show in Atlanta, Georgia and Foxy 107.2 with Karen Clark in Raleigh, North Carolina.</p>

<p>So far, more than 80.6 million Americans have voted, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://election.lab.ufl.edu/early-vote/2024-early-voting/" target="_blank">the University of Florida’s Election Lab.</a></p>
<p>In a presidential contest that pollsters say is virtually a toss-up, seven battleground states likely will determine the outcome of the election. The results could take days, election officials repeatedly&nbsp;<a href="https://dailymontanan.com/2024/10/25/final-results-may-lag-in-deadlocked-presidential-contest-anxious-election-officials-warn/" target="_blank">have warned</a> and stressed again Monday. The 2020 presidential race was called for President Joe Biden the Saturday following Election Day.</p>
<p>“Election Day is not results day,” said&nbsp;Quentin Turner, the Common Cause Michigan executive director, during a Monday webinar.</p>
<p>Jen O&#8217;Malley Dillon, chair of the Harris-Walz campaign, made similar remarks during a Monday call with reporters, but still issued predictions as to when the campaign expects to know some results from key states.</p>
<p>She said the campaign understands that results could take a while based on each state’s law. Some states begin counting votes after the polls close, some as they come in.</p>
<p>O&#8217;Malley Dillon said because of that, the campaign expects on election night to have “near complete results” for North Carolina, Michigan and Georgia, “and then partial results from Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Arizona.”</p>
<p>She said the campaign expects by Wednesday morning to have most of the “results in from Wisconsin and additional results from Pennsylvania and potentially Michigan.”</p>
<p>“And then on Wednesday and beyond, we expect additional results from Pennsylvania, Arizona, Nevada,” she said. “So we think some of this stuff will trickle in, but keep in mind that some ballots will continue to be counted for many days.”</p>
<p>Democracy groups like Common Cause said during the webinar that they are prepared for high voter turnout on Election Day.</p>
<p>Bob Phillips, the Common Cause North Carolina executive director, said he expects about 1 to 1.5 million voters in his state on Election Day.</p>
<p>“For the most part, we&#8217;ve seen a lot of voter enthusiasm,” he said.</p>
<p>He added that there have been more calls on the voter help hotline than in the previous elections.</p>
<p>“There is definitely higher tension, more emotion, particularly among the electioneering that goes on outside the precincts, as well as some issues since this is our first major election where we&#8217;ve had the voter ID requirements,”&nbsp;Phillips said.</p>
<h4>It’s all about Pennsylvania (almost)</h4>
<p>Harris is closing out her campaign in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, which offers the most electoral votes of the swing states at 19.</p>
<p>O&#8217;Malley Dillon said the campaign will have get-out-the-vote rallies late Monday night in the seven swing states with Harris and surrogates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We’ve believed all along this race is going to be incredibly close, and so it&#8217;s really going to come down to mobilization, and that&#8217;s why an event like tonight matters so much,” she said.</p>
<p>Harris will head to Scranton and then to Allentown, a city with a large Puerto Rican population that Democrats have courted following racist remarks by a comedian at a Trump rally that referred to the island of Puerto Rico as “garbage.” She’ll then rally in Philadelphia with musical performances from The Roots and Lady Gaga among others.</p>
<p>Trump will make four stops in three states — starting in Raleigh, North Carolina, stopping twice in Pennsylvania at&nbsp;Reading and Pittsburgh and finishing in Grand Rapids, Michigan.</p>
<p><a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2024/11/04/trump-in-final-nc-rally-looks-for-a-third-straight-win-harris-barnstorms-pennsylvania/" target="_blank">While at his first campaign stop in North Carolina</a> on Monday, he told supporters that if he wins another term he will levy a 25% tariff on Mexico if migrants continue to head from that country to the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>
<p>“You&#8217;re the first I’ve told this to,” Trump told the crowd. “And if that doesn’t work, we’ll go up to 50. And if that doesn’t work, we’ll go to 75.”</p>
<p>Trump will hold his election night watch party at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Florida. Harris will have hers at her alma mater at Howard University in Washington, D.C.</p>
<h4>Polling puzzles</h4>
<p>Polls published over the weekend still showed a tight race, but one in Iowa&nbsp;<a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2024/11/02/harris-takes-slim-lead-over-trump-in-final-iowa-poll-before-2024-election/" target="_blank">rattled the Trump campaign</a>, showing that Harris had a lead in a state that the former president easily won in 2016 and 2020.</p>
<p>The highly regarded pollster — somewhat of a Midwestern oracle — showed that independent and women voters were breaking for Harris.</p>
<p>Both candidates are within the margin of error in all seven swing states meaning any of the states — Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin — could tip to either one.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, Harris appeared on NBC’s live sketch comedy show, “Saturday Night Live.”&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/nbc-donald-trump-campaign-free-ad-time-nascar-race-kamala-harris-snl-sketch-1236052709/" target="_blank">Trump also appeared</a> on a free commercial during NBC’s broadcast of a Sunday NASCAR race in compliance with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fcc.gov/sites/default/files/political_programming_fact_sheet.pdf" target="_blank">FCC’s Equal Time rule.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://michiganadvance.com/2024/11/04/harris-vows-to-end-war-in-gaza-during-final-michigan-rally-at-msu/" target="_blank">On Sunday, while at Michigan State University,</a> Harris pledged that she would do “everything in her power” to end the war in Gaza if she were to win the White House. Michigan has a high Arab American population that has been critical of Democrats&#8217; handling of the Israel-Hamas war, where&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2023/10/9/israel-hamas-war-in-maps-and-charts-live-tracker" target="_blank">more than 44,000 Palestinians have been killed.</a></p>
<p><a href="/article/harris-takes-slim-lead-over-trump-final-iowa-poll-2024-election">During a Sunday rally</a> in Pennsylvania, Trump told supporters that he shouldn’t have left the White House after losing the 2020 presidential race and then he joked about not minding if journalists were shot while covering his campaign event.&nbsp;</p>

(Photo by Melissa Sue Gerrits/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — As an exceedingly bitter, tight and dark campaign for the presidency moves into its last moments, apprehensive election officials and experts warn Election Day is only the first step.</p>
<p>The closing of the polls and end of mail-in voting kick off a nearly three-month process before the next president of the United States is sworn in on Inauguration Day in January. New guardrails were enacted by Congress in 2022 to more fully protect the presidential transition, following the Jan. 6, 2021 mob attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters and a failed scheme to install fake electors.</p>
<p>But even before that shift to a new chief executive begins, a presidential victor is unlikely to be announced election night or even the following day.</p>
<p>It’s a result that will possibly take days to determine, given tight margins expected in seven swing states. Officials needed four days to count all the votes to determine President Joe Biden the victor of the 2020 presidential election.</p>
<p>In states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, the law does not allow that process to begin for millions of mail-in ballots until Election Day. Other states allow pre-processing of ballots.</p>
<p>Trey Grayson, Kentucky’s former Republican secretary of state, said ballot authentication could be on different timelines across the country after voting ends on Election Day.</p>
<p>“We have 50 states, plus D.C., that pretty much all do it differently,” Grayson, who served as president of the National Association of Secretaries of State, told reporters Friday on a call of bipartisan former state election officials who are working to explain the process to the public.</p>
<p>It could mean “in a very close election that we don’t know on election night who the president is or who controls the House or the Senate, but we should feel confident over the next couple of days, as we work through that, that we’re going to get there,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Lawsuits and potential recounts </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Those delays, which former President Donald Trump seized on to spread the baseless lie that the election was stolen from him, are expected again in November, especially as all eyes will be on the battleground states — Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Additionally, there already are hundreds of pre-election lawsuits, mainly filed by Republicans, ranging from election integrity challenges to accusations of noncitizens allowed to vote in federal elections — something that rarely happens and is already illegal. The legal challenges could further spark delays.</p>
<p>“We will not have a winner on election night most likely and so we need to be able to prepare the public for this,” said Virginia Kase Solomón, the president and CEO of the democracy watchdog group Common Cause, during a Tuesday briefing.</p>
<p>She added that her organization will focus on combating misinformation and disinformation on election night and beyond.</p>
<p>“There is the potential that somebody could claim the win before … all of the votes have been counted,” she said.</p>
<p>In the early morning hours after Election Day in 2020, before results from key states were determined, Trump falsely claimed he won in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duE8tnrSmNc&amp;t=3s" target="_blank">an address at the White House.  </a></p>
<p>On top of that, experts say this year could see election denial erupting in countless courtrooms and meeting rooms in localities and the states, as well as across social media, if doubts are sown about the results.</p>
<p>Recounts could also delay an official election result, and the laws vary from state to state.</p>
<p>For example, in Pennsylvania, if a candidate demands a recount, three voters from each of the over 9,000 precincts have to petition for a recount.</p>
<p>“We’ve never seen that happen actually in Pennsylvania,” Kathy Boockvar, the commonwealth’s former Democratic secretary of state, said on Friday’s call with reporters.</p>
<p>An automatic statewide recount is triggered in Pennsylvania if there’s a difference of a half percent of all votes cast for the winner and loser. The final recount results, by law, are due to the secretary of state by Nov. 26, and results would be announced on Nov. 27, Boockvar said.</p>
<p>The margin in Pennsylvania’s 2020 results for the presidential election was between 1.1% and 1.2%, not enough to trigger the automatic recount, Boockvar said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Taking out the shrubs</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>State election officials have been preparing for the past year to train poll workers to not only run the voting booths but for possible violence — a precaution put in place after the 2020 election — and have beefed up security around polling locations.</p>
<p>On Friday, Trump posted on X that the election “will be under the closest professional scrutiny and, WHEN I WIN, those people that CHEATED will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law, which will include long term prison sentences so that this Depravity of Justice does not happen again.”</p>
<p>A reporter asked Grayson about the possibility of aggression from poll watchers. The Republican National Committee <a href="https://gop.com/press-release/trump-campaign-and-rnc-unveil-historic-100000-person-strong-election-integrity-program/" target="_blank">announced</a> in April a “historic move to safeguard the integrity of the electoral process,” establishing party-led trainings for poll watchers.</p>
<p>Poll watchers are not a new concept, and Grayson said clear “safeguards” are in place.</p>
<p>“If you’re intimidating, you’re gone. There’s clear laws in every state on that,” he said.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/rising-trend/decision-2024" rel="attachment wp-att-40551" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-40551 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/National-image-Horizontal.png" alt="" width="3240" height="720" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/National-image-Horizontal.png 3240w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/National-image-Horizontal-300x67.png 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/National-image-Horizontal-1024x228.png 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/National-image-Horizontal-768x171.png 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/National-image-Horizontal-1536x341.png 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/National-image-Horizontal-2048x455.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 3240px) 100vw, 3240px" /></a></p>
<p>Celestine Jeffreys, the city clerk in Green Bay, Wisconsin, said during a Wednesday roundtable with election workers that the city has an Election Day protocol in place that includes everything from blocking off streets to City Hall to getting rid of shrubbery.</p>
<p>“We have actually removed bushes in front of City Hall” to ensure no one can be concealed behind them, she said. In the second assassination attempt on Trump earlier this year, a gunman hid in bushes outside Trump’s private golf course.</p>
<p>New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver said during a Tuesday briefing she is focused on the physical safety of election officials.</p>
<p>During the event with the National Association of Secretaries of State, she said such safety is not only a priority during voting but when officials move to certify the state’s election results in December.</p>
<p>“We have all been spending a lot more time on physical security and making sure that our election officials at all levels are more physically secure this year,” Toulouse Oliver said. “And of course, you know when our electors meet in our states, you know, ensuring for the physical security of that process and those individuals as well.”</p>
<p>On Dec. 17, each state’s electors will meet to vote for the president and vice president. Congress will vote to certify the results on Jan. 6.</p>
<p>“We are thinking a lot more about this in 2024 than we did in 2020, but I think that each one of us… have a playbook in mind for how to handle any unanticipated eventualities in the certification process,” she said.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/law-enforcement-officials-prepare-possible-post-election-violence-dc" target="_blank">It’s a security precaution</a> that the U.S. Secret Service is also taking.</p>
<p>For the first time, Congress’ certification of the Electoral College on Jan. 6 has been designated a National Special Security Event, something that is usually reserved for Inauguration Day on Jan. 20.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The 2020 experience</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In 2020, The Associated Press did not call the presidential election for Biden <a href="https://blog.ap.org/behind-the-news/calling-the-2020-presidential-race-state-by-state" target="_blank">until</a> 11:26 a.m. Saturday, Nov. 7 — roughly three-and-a-half days after polls closed. The AP, as well as other media organizations, project election winners after local officials make initial tabulations public.</p>
<p>Those tallies are then <a href="https://www.eac.gov/election-officials/election-results-canvass-and-certification" target="_blank">canvassed, audited and certified</a>, according to each state’s legal timeline. Recounts may also extend the timeline before final certification.</p>
<p>The vote totals reported in Pennsylvania — a state that carried 20 Electoral College votes in 2020 — put Biden over the top for the 270 needed to win the presidency.</p>
<p>Trump refused to concede the race, and instead promised to take his fight to court.</p>
<p>For the next two months, Trump and his surrogates filed <a href="https://electioncases.osu.edu/case-tracker/?sortby=filing_date_desc&amp;keywords=&amp;status=all&amp;state=all&amp;topic=25" target="_blank">just over 60 lawsuits</a> challenging the results in numerous states. Ultimately none of the judges found evidence of widespread voter fraud.</p>
<p>The next step was for Congress to <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2014-title3/html/USCODE-2014-title3-chap1-sec15.htm" target="_blank">count</a> each state’s certified slate of electors, which by law, it must do on the Jan. 6 following a presidential election.</p>
<p>However, in the weeks leading up to Jan. 6, Trump and his private lawyers worked to replace legitimate slates of electors with fake ones, according to <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/collection/january-6th-committee-final-report?path=/GPO/January%206th%20Committee%20Final%20Report%20and%20Supporting%20Materials%20Collection" target="_blank">hundreds</a> of <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/67656604/266/2/united-states-v-trump/" target="_blank">pages</a> of records compiled by a special congressional investigation, and by the U.S. Department of Justice.</p>
<p>Trump pressured then-Vice President Mike Pence to block ratification of the Electoral College’s vote at the Jan. 6 joint session of Congress, because the vice president’s role in the certification of electoral votes was not exactly clear in the Electoral Count Act of 1887.</p>
<p>Pence ultimately refused.</p>
<p>Thousands of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 following a “Stop the Steal” rally at The Ellipse park, south of the White House, where Trump told the crowd “We will never concede.”</p>
<p>The mob assaulted police officers, broke windows to climb inside and hurled violent threats aimed at elected officials, including the desire to “hang” Pence. More than 1,500 defendants <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/44-months-jan-6-attack-us-capitol" target="_blank">have been charged</a> by the Department of Justice.</p>
<p>Congress stopped its process of reviewing the state electors in the 2 p.m. Eastern hour as police ushered the lawmakers to safety. The joint session resumed at roughly 11:30 p.m., and Pence called the majority of electoral votes for Biden at nearly 4 a.m. on Jan. 7.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">New law on presidential transition</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>To deter another Jan. 6 insurrection, Congress <a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2022/09/28/key-u-s-senate-panel-advances-bill-aimed-at-preventing-another-jan-6/" target="_blank">passed</a> the <a href="https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/JRQ121922.PDF" target="_blank">Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transitional Improvement Act of 2022</a> as part of a massive appropriations bill.</p>
<p>The Electoral Count Reform Act codifies into law that the vice president, who also serves as the president of the U.S. Senate, only ceremoniously reads aloud a roll call of the votes.</p>
<p>Most notably, the provision raises the threshold for lawmakers to make an objection to electors. Previously, only one U.S. House representative and one U.S. senator would need to make an objection to an elector or slate of electors.</p>
<p>But under the new law, it would take one-fifth of members to lodge an objection and under very specific standards — 87 House members and 20 senators.</p>
<p>The Electoral Count Reform Act also identifies that each state’s governor is the official responsible for submitting the state’s official document that identifies the state’s appointed electors, and says that Congress cannot accept that document from any official besides the governor, unless otherwise specified by the state’s law.</p>
<p>Trump and his allies tried to replace legitimate slates of electors in several states with fake electors who would cast ballots for Trump.</p>
<p>The Presidential Transitional Improvement Act provides candidates with funding and resources for transitional planning, even if a candidate has not conceded after the election.</p>
<p>There are already issues with the transition of power. The top Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin, <a href="https://oversightdemocrats.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/democrats-oversight.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2024-10-23.JBR%20to%20Trump%20and%20Vance%20re%20transition%20MOUs.pdf" target="_blank">sent a Wednesday letter</a> to Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, urging them to sign documents to ensure a peaceful transition of power.</p>
<p>“With fewer than three weeks left until an election in which the American people will select a new President of the United States, I urge you to put the public’s interest in maintaining a properly functioning government above any personal financial or political interests you may perceive in boycotting the official transition law and process,” Raskin wrote.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Denial expected at all levels of government</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Experts warn the effort to delay certification of the vote is largely being fought at the local and state levels, and that several groups are gearing up to sow doubt in the election outcome.</p>
<p>Devin Burghart, president of the Institute for Research and Education on Human Rights, said on a press call Wednesday that since 2020, “election denial has shifted away from the capital to county election commission meetings, courtrooms, cyber symposiums and countless conspiracies in preparation for a repeat this November.”</p>
<p>“This time, the baseless claim that undocumented immigrants are somehow swamping the polls has fueled the ‘big lie’ machine,” Burghart said.</p>
<p>Boockvar said the noncitizen topic is not new.</p>
<p>“I’d like to level set and remind everyone that it’s been illegal at the federal level since 1996 and you know, when you think back on 2002 the <a href="https://www.eac.gov/about/help_america_vote_act.aspx" target="_blank">Help America Vote Act</a> basically required voters to provide ID when they register, which is usually a driver’s license or a Social Security number, and states are checking that data against the DMV database. And these protections are enormously successful,” Boockvar said.</p>
<p>In two high-profile cases, the U.S. Department of Justice sued Republican-led efforts in <a href="https://alabamareflector.com/2024/10/16/federal-judge-blocks-alabama-secretary-of-states-voter-removal-plan/" target="_blank">Alabama</a> and <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/judge-orders-people-removed-from-voter-rolls-to-be-reinstated-gov-youngkin-to-seek-appeal/">Virginia</a> to purge voter rolls after alleging thousands of noncitizens were registered to vote. Both states were ordered to stop the programs and reinstate voters – though Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin promised Friday to appeal and even escalate to the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>More than 165 electoral process lawsuits across 37 states have been filed by both parties since 2023 leading up to the 2024 presidential election, according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-election-court-lawsuits-influence-voting/" target="_blank">survey</a> by Bloomberg of pre-election cases. The journalists found that more than half the cases have been filed in swing states, and challenge almost every facet of the voting process, from absentee voting, to voter roll management, voter eligibility and vote certification.</p>
<p>Republican and conservative groups have filed roughly 55% of the lawsuits, mostly aimed at narrowing who can vote, and overall most of the cases were filed in August and September, according to the analysis.</p>
<p>Courts threw out dozens of lawsuits claiming voter fraud in 2020.</p>
<p>Mai Ratakonda, senior counsel at States United Democracy Center, said anti-democracy groups have used litigation “to legitimize their efforts to sow doubt in our election system.”</p>
<p>“We’ve unfortunately continued to see this trend of filing lawsuits to bolster and legitimize narratives that our elections are insecure and laying the groundwork to contest results later,” Ratakonda told reporters on a press call Wednesday hosted by the organization, whose stated mission is to protect nonpartisan election administration.</p>

(Brent Stirton/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The threat of political violence will likely hang over the nation’s capital in the weeks following Election Day, security experts say, despite intensive preparations by law enforcement officials determined to avoid another Jan. 6 insurrection.</p>
<p>The 2,000-plus officers who make up the U.S. Capitol Police, as well as other federal law enforcement agencies like the Secret Service, have responded to a surge in threats against elected officials during the last few years, including two assassination attempts against Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump just this year.</p>
<p>But the threats, attacks and shooting have led to questions about whether the two agencies are truly prepared for the presidential transition, especially after a <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2024-10/24_1017_opa-Independent-Review-Panel-Final-Report-and-Accompanying-Materials.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> released this week said the Secret Service “requires fundamental reform to carry out its mission.”</p>
<p>The agency is tasked with planning and coordinating security for Congress’ certification of the Electoral College on Jan. 6 —the first time it’s been designated a National Special Security Event — and Inauguration Day on Jan. 20.</p>
<p>Experts interviewed by States Newsroom said there is a very real chance of political violence in the weeks and months ahead, though they said law enforcement agencies have learned from recent events. The unrest could build after what is expected to be a very close presidential election, with results possibly delayed for days or longer or even litigated in the courts.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, you can never have 100% security,” said Javed Ali, associate professor of practice at the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan.</p>
<p>“It’s nice to think that would exist. But, if you’re trying to consider all the different kinds of variables that you have to plan for, there’s always going to be a gap or vulnerability — now what you try to do is kind of minimize the big one and hope that the small ones don’t get exploited.”</p>
<p>Darrell M. West, the Douglas Dillon Chair in Governmental Studies at the Brookings Institution, said the risk of political violence could increase following Election Day if one or more political leaders object to the outcome.</p>
<p>“For months, we’ve been hearing extreme and sometimes violent rhetoric,” West said. “And rhetoric has consequences — it can encourage some people to take action.”</p>
<p>Trump has refused to accept the 2020 election results, and his running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/election-2024/vance-replies-to-question-about-2020-election-with-answer-about-hunter-bidens-laptop/" target="_blank">declined to say </a>Trump lost the election. Vance on Oct. 12<a href="https://penncapital-star.com/election-2024/vance-in-pennsylvania-says-there-was-a-peaceful-transfer-of-power-in-january-2021/" target="_blank"> said</a> there was a “peaceful transfer of power” in January 2021.</p>
<p>Trump has repeatedly recycled false claims he made following his loss that the system is rigged — a talking point he’s likely to use to rile up supporters should he lose this year’s election. Trump has been <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2024/10/02/special-counsel-jack-smith-reveals-new-evidence-against-trump-in-2020-election-case/" target="_blank">charged</a> by special counsel Jack Smith with four felony counts in connection with 2020 election interference, in a complex case that will continue after the election.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Threats against lawmakers</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Members of Congress are more vulnerable than presidential candidates, in part because most lawmakers live in normal houses and don’t have security details anywhere close to the kind the Secret Service provides for high-ranking officials.</p>
<p>And unlike the presidency, which has a long line of succession to avoid gaps in authority following a death or a crisis, Congress has been <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/23/congress-plan-mass-casualty-emergency-00178190" target="_blank">criticized for not having better plans in place </a>to address continuity of government following a mass casualty or similar event.</p>
<p>U.S. Capitol Police Chief J. Thomas Manger <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-capitol-police-chief-describes-preparations-possible-post-election-turmoil" target="_blank">testified in April </a>the agency was looking for ways to bolster protection for lawmakers in the line of presidential succession, like the speaker of the House and Senate president pro tempore.</p>
<p>Manger told the panel that security for those two officials was substandard to that provided for the Secretary of State, who sits below them in the line of succession.</p>
<p>“We can’t just go back to the days when we said, ‘Well, we’ll just follow them around and we’ll make sure they’re well protected wherever they are,’ because their homes, their families are at risk,” he testified.</p>
<p>Members of Congress who haven’t risen to the ranks of leadership don’t get security details unless there are specific threats to their safety. And those aren’t permanent.</p>
<p>That could present challenges for lawmakers who have higher profiles or who regularly receive threats, especially if people respond violently to the election results and encourage their supporters to take matters into their own hands.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump assassination attempts</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Making the situation more complicated, this year has shown that substantial levels of security aren’t a guarantee of safety.</p>
<p>Trump has some of the highest levels of protection in the country, if not the world, but that did not stop a man from<a href="https://penncapital-star.com/campaigns-elections/trump-campaigns-in-western-pennsylvania-with-rally-in-butler-county/" target="_blank"> shooting at the former president</a> during a rally in Pennsylvania this summer. A separate would-be gunman<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/ryan-routh-charged-attempted-assassination-trump-golf-course-case" target="_blank"> was spotted </a>and apprehended just off Trump’s Florida golf course with a semi-automatic weapon in September.</p>
<p>Both instances raised questions about the Secret Service’s ability to protect Trump as well as others, though agency leaders maintain they’re up to the task.</p>
<p>Trump’s experiences, as the subject of political violence, haven’t deterred him from spreading disinformation about Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris as well as other lawmakers who disagree with him on policy issues.</p>
<p>Trump’s comments about immigrants have also led to threats against everyday people, including Haitian immigrants in Ohio, who are in the country legally.</p>
<p>During an interview with Maria Bartiromo on “Sunday Morning Futures” on Fox News earlier this month, Trump said he may use the National Guard or the military against his political opponents should he win reelection, calling them “the enemy from within.”</p>
<p>“We have some very bad people,” Trump said. “We have some sick people. Radical left lunatics. And it should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by National Guard, or if really necessary by the military, because they can’t let that happen.”</p>
<p>The military and National Guard have significantly different training programs and missions than local, state, or federal law enforcement, making Trump’s comments somewhat darker than previous claims he’d try to put his political opponents in prison if reelected.</p>
<p>Trump hasn’t committed to respecting the results of the election or supporting a peaceful transition in power should he lose his bid for the White House.</p>
<p>Trump’s comments could indicate that violence is likely following the election, if he loses, or after he regains the powers of the presidency, if he wins.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Delayed election results predicted</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>West from the Brookings Institution said violence isn’t likely to take place in the days immediately following the end of voting on Nov. 5, since it’s unlikely anyone learns the results of the presidential election for a few days.</p>
<p>The Associated Press <a href="https://blog.ap.org/behind-the-news/calling-the-2020-presidential-race-state-by-state" target="_blank">didn’t call the race for President Joe Biden until the Saturday</a> after the election in 2020, following days of speculation and ballot counting.</p>
<p>Mail-in ballots, which Democrats tend to submit in larger numbers than Republicans, could lead to confusion in swing states, especially if people don’t understand they tend to boost numbers for Democratic candidates over GOP politicians as they’re counted, he said.</p>
<p>“We could end up in a situation where on election night, Trump is ahead, because we know Republicans tend to vote in person on Election Day, and Democrats often vote via mail ballots,” West said. “And then as the mail ballots get counted on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, the numbers may shift from Trump to Harris.</p>
<p>“And I think that’s a very bad combination, because it will look to some individuals like voter fraud, even though there’s a perfectly logical explanation for the change. But that’s a scenario that could lead to violence, because it’ll look like the election is being stolen from Trump.”</p>
<p>While the presidential candidates will play a significant role in stirring up or calming down their supporters, members of Congress, many of whom sought to legitimize misinformation and disinformation four years ago, have responsibilities as well.</p>
<p>“We need leaders who act responsibly, but unfortunately, in the last few months, we have not seen that,” West said. “We’ve seen members of Congress who have promoted misinformation. There’s been a lot of it surrounding the hurricane, and so the fear is that there will be blatant lies that then will incite people to take action.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Learning from 2020</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Ali, from the University of Michigan, said he expects federal law enforcement will be better prepared for post-election violence than they were four years ago, though there are still chances for violent people to slip through the cracks.</p>
<p>The most likely scenario, Ali said, is a single actor or “lone wolf” attack and not a mob marching to the Capitol, the way Trump supporters did on Jan. 6.</p>
<p>“I still think it’s relatively low,” Ali said of the likelihood of violence. “But as we’ve seen, all it takes is one person to really shake up the perception of security. And if they’re aiming at President Trump or Vice President Harris, well then, you know the stakes are even higher.”</p>
<p>Ali said he’s confident that the Secret Service, U.S. Capitol Police and other law enforcement agencies in the Washington, D.C., area are preparing for various scenarios, though he’s less sure about what would happen if there’s violence at state capitals.</p>
<p>“There might be a little more vulnerability there,” Ali said. “But I still think, at least when we’re getting to the Electoral College (certification) day, that January 6th-type insurrection will be almost impossible to pull off.”</p>
<p>When it comes to spreading disinformation, Ali said, he expects there will be a combination of foreign adversaries, including Iran and Russia, as well as domestic actors.</p>
<p>“You’ll probably see a lot of disinformation, especially if Vice President Harris wins, sort of casting doubt on the integrity of the voting, the credibility of the process, maybe going after specific individuals and key swing states, or even counties,” Ali said.</p>
<p>“All those things that were happening in 2020. But there were also costs to doing that, as we’ve seen too, with the civil charges and some of the potential criminal ones as well,” he added. “So I think that’s also an area domestically, where people will have to tread very cautiously. That doesn’t mean that you won’t see it, but again, there might be a line that gets crossed where people will be held accountable for that.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘More prepared than ever before’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>U.S. Capitol Police Inspector General David T. Harper said USCP leadership has implemented the 100-plus recommendations put forward by his predecessor following the Jan. 6 attack, closing gaps that existed that day.</p>
<p>“I think they’ve made a lot of improvements, and I think that they’re more prepared than ever before,” Harper said, though he later added he couldn’t “say for certain that they are prepared to handle anything that can come up” due to the unpredictable nature of domestic terrorism and political violence.</p>
<p>The OIG is also “prepared to be all hands on deck” in the event of another attack on the Capitol or lawmakers takes place, to analyze what went wrong and make recommendations for USCP to implement, he said.</p>
<p>Harper, whose tenure as inspector general <a href="https://rollcall.com/2024/01/23/new-capitol-police-inspector-general-selected/" target="_blank">began earlier this year</a>, noted during the interview that much of what he can publicly discuss is restricted by national security concerns.</p>
<p>The U.S. Capitol Police declined an interview request from States Newsroom, but provided written information about changes that it’s implemented during the last few years.</p>
<p>Among those is a law approved by Congress that allows the USCP chief to request the National Guard without the approval of the three-member Capitol Police board.</p>
<p>USCP has also overhauled its intelligence-gathering activities and established partnerships with other law enforcement agencies to bolster its ranks ahead of major events.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Secret Service planning for Jan. 6</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The Secret Service is one of those partners and it will take the lead this year planning security for major events during the presidential transition, even those undertaken by Congress inside the Capitol.</p>
<p>While Inauguration Day has traditionally been categorized as a National Special Security Event, the Department of Homeland Security <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/additional-security-will-be-place-jan-6-2025-certification-presidential-vote" target="_blank">has extended that classification</a> for the first time for Congress certifying the winner of the presidential race on Jan. 6.</p>
<p>Nate Herring, spokesperson for the United States Secret Service, said part of the process includes planning with other law enforcement agencies for “various scenarios” that could take place, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Metropolitan Police Department.</p>
<p>“We work very closely with our partners throughout the whole planning process,” Herring said. “And D.C. is especially unique because National Special Security Events occur fairly frequently.”</p>
<p>But the Secret Service’s leadership and structure have come under scrutiny during the last few months.</p>
<p>The four-member panel tasked with investigating the Pennsylvania assassination attempt against Trump wrote in the<a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2024-10/24_1017_opa-Independent-Review-Panel-Final-Report-and-Accompanying-Materials.pdf" target="_blank"> 52-page report</a> released in mid-October that the Secret Service “has become bureaucratic, complacent, and static even though risks have multiplied and technology has evolved.”</p>
<p>“This is a zero-fail mission, for any failure endangers not only the life of the protectee, but also the fundamentals of our government itself,” they wrote.</p>
<p>Without substantial changes to the Secret Service, the independent review panel wrote, it believes the type of deadly attack that took place in Butler, Pennsylvania, “can and will happen again.”</p>
<p>Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas released a written statement after the report’s release, saying the department had begun “taking the actions needed to advance the Secret Service’s protection mission,” including addressing the “systemic and foundational issues” described by the review panel.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">D.C. planning</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>District of Columbia Assistant City Administrator Chris Rodriguez said that city officials will be watching for any indications people intent on violence begin traveling or gathering inside the city following Election Day.</p>
<p>“We are obviously attuned to what happened last time. I mean, I don’t think we can ignore that, and we’re not,” Rodriguez said, referring to the Jan. 6 attack. “But we also are in a place where we have great relationships among our agencies within the region, with the federal government in terms of coordination, and we will be prepared to adapt our operational posture in any way that we need to.”</p>
<p>D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser originally requested the NSSE designation for Jan. 6, which Rodriguez said has increased planning and coordination, in hopes of avoiding any violence.</p>
<p>Rodriguez also stressed D.C. officials and the city’s police department are used to planning for the large crowds and protests that tend to take place whenever there’s a presidential transition.</p>
<p>“We are a city that prides itself, as the nation’s capital, to ensuring that there is a peaceful transition of power,” he said. “And we will do our part to ensure that.”</p>

<p>Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump agree that gun violence is a major problem, but they offer strikingly different views on how to address it.</p>
<p>Two 14-year-old students and two math teachers were killed at Apalachee High School.</p>
<p>While at a campaign rally in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, shortly after the Apalachee shooting, Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, <a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2024/09/04/georgia-national-democratic-leaders-call-for-gun-safety-legislation-after-apalachee-high-shooting/" target="_blank">renewed calls</a> for an assault weapons ban, universal background checks and red flag laws.</p>
<p>Students should not have to be frightened of school shootings, she said. “They are sitting in a classroom where they should be fulfilling their God-given potential, yet some part of their big, beautiful minds is worried about a shooter breaking through the door,” she said. “It doesn’t have to be this way.”</p>
<p>Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, expressed his condolences.</p>
<p>“Our hearts are with the victims and loved ones of those affected by the tragic event in Winder, GA,” Trump wrote on his social media site Truth Social. “These cherished children were taken from us far too soon by a sick and deranged monster.”</p>
<p>Trump has survived two assassination attempts, one where he was injured in the ear, but has not changed his stance on guns.</p>
<p>After the first assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, Trump campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita said at <a href="https://tennesseelookout.com/2024/07/16/gun-rights-advocates-at-convention-spell-out-plans-if-gop-gains-control-in-november/" target="_blank">the Republican National Convention</a> that the party won’t back away from its support of Second Amendment rights.</p>
<p>During a Univision town hall with undecided Latino voters that aired Wednesday night, an audience member asked Trump how he would explain his gun policy to “parents of the victims of school shootings.”</p>
<p>“We have a Second Amendment and a right to bear arms,” Trump said. “I’m very strongly an advocate of that. I think that if you ever tried to get rid of it, you wouldn’t be able to do it. You wouldn’t be able to take away the guns, because people need that for security, they need it for entertainment and for sport, and other things. But they also, in many cases, need it for protection.”</p>
<p>A majority of Americans view gun violence as a problem — about 60% — and they expect it to only get worse over the next five years, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2023/06/28/gun-violence-widely-viewed-as-a-major-and-growing-national-problem/" target="_blank">according to a Pew Research Center study.</a></p>
<p>This year there have been 421 mass shootings, according to the <a href="https://www.gunviolencearchive.org" target="_blank">Gun Violence Archive</a>, which tracks gun violence in the U.S.</p>
<p>For a third year in a row, in 2022 — the most recent year of finalized data — firearms were <a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2024/guns-remain-leading-cause-of-death-for-children-and-teens" target="_blank">the leading cause of death </a>for children and teens ages 1 to 17, <a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/sites/default/files/2024-09/2022-cgvs-gun-violence-in-the-united-states.pdf" target="_blank">according to a report from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions.</a></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Harris’ record</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In the aftermath of two mass shootings in 2022, Congress passed the most comprehensive bipartisan gun safety legislation in decades.</p>
<p>In Uvalde, Texas, 19 children and two teachers were murdered, making it the second-deadliest mass shooting since the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in 2012. In Buffalo, a white supremacist targeted a Black neighborhood and killed 10 Black people in a grocery store.</p>
<p>The package that Congress passed and President Joe Biden signed into law provided $11 billion in mental health funds and $750 million for states to enact red flag laws. It also closed loopholes and established a White House Office for Gun Violence Prevention, among other provisions.</p>
<p>Red flag laws allow courts to temporarily remove a firearm from an individual who is a threat to themselves or others, among other provisions.</p>
<p><a href="https://washingtonstatestandard.com/briefs/biden-administration-to-create-new-gun-violence-prevention-office/" target="_blank">Biden tasked Harris with leading</a> the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, which helps local communities implement that 2022 bipartisan gun legislation and aids communities impacted by gun violence.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump’s record</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>During Trump’s first presidency, he had a mixed record on gun policy.</p>
<p>After a mass shooting in Las Vegas, Nevada, the Trump administration moved to ban bump stocks, which allow a semi-automatic rifle to quickly fire bullets.</p>
<p>However, the U.S. Supreme Court, to which Trump appointed three conservative justices, <a href="https://missouriindependent.com/briefs/u-s-supreme-court-overturns-ban-on-bump-stocks-used-in-las-vegas-mass-shooting/" target="_blank">struck down the ban on bump stocks. </a></p>
<p>Trump also threatened to veto legislation from <a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/saphr8hr1112hr_20190225.pdf" target="_blank">Congress that would have enhanced background checks on guns.</a></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Promise: a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines</h4>

	
<p>Democrats have long called for a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, which are typically used in mass shootings.</p>
<p>The U.S. used to have a ban on assault weapons, but it expired in 2004 and Congress failed to renew the ban.</p>
<p>“I am in favor of the Second Amendment, and I believe we need to reinstate the assault weapons ban,” Harris <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbGlPpQUmMA" target="_blank">said at the White House</a> in late September.</p>
<p>Fulfilling this promise would come down to the makeup in Congress and overcoming the Senate’s 60-vote threshold to advance legislation.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Promise: a rollback of Biden regulations</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>During a forum with the National Rifle Association in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, in February, Trump promised to roll back all gun-related regulations that the Biden administration has implemented.</p>
<p>“Every single Biden attack on gun owners and manufacturers will be terminated on my very first week back in office, perhaps my first day,” Trump said.</p>
<p>Trump specifically said he would cancel the Biden administration’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/23/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-comprehensive-strategy-to-prevent-and-respond-to-gun-crime-and-ensure-public-safety/" target="_blank">“zero-tolerance” policy,</a> which revokes federal licenses from gun dealers who violate firearm laws.</p>
<p>Brian Hughes, a Trump campaign senior adviser, said in a statement to States Newsroom that if Trump wins a second term, “he will terminate every single one of the Harris-Biden’s attacks on law-abiding gun owners his first week in office and stand up for our constitutionally enshrined right to bear arms.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Promise: tax credits, no gun-free zones</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>During an NRA event in April 2023, Trump said that he was supportive of a tax credit for teachers who wanted to carry a firearm in schools.</p>
<p>Trump has also previously voiced his disapproval of schools being gun-free zones. Days after the Uvalde school shooting, Trump attended another NRA event in Houston, Texas, where he argued that a gun-free zone does not allow people to protect themselves.</p>
<p>“As the age-old saying goes, the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,” Trump said. “The existence of evil is one of the very best reasons to arm law-abiding citizens.”</p>
<p>He argued that schools should have metal detectors, fencing and an armed police officer.</p>

In this photo, a ghost gun is displayed before the start of an event about gun violence in the Rose Garden of the White House April 11, 2022 in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Supreme Court justices Tuesday grappled with whether the Biden administration exceeded its authority when it set regulations for kits that can be assembled into untraceable firearms, and a majority of justices seemed somewhat skeptical the rule was an overreach.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/23a82.html" target="_blank">Garland v. VanDerStok,</a> the nine justices are tasked with determining whether a rule issued by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives in 2022 overstepped in expanding the definition of “firearms” to include “ghost guns” under a federal firearms law.</p>
<p>Ghost guns are firearms without serial numbers and can be easily bought online and quickly assembled in parts, usually through a kit. Law enforcement officials use serial numbers to track guns that are used in crimes.</p>
<p>Arguing on behalf of the Biden administration, U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar told the justices that there has been an “explosion in crimes” with untraceable guns across the U.S.</p>
<p>She added that the federal government has for years required gun manufacturers and sellers to mark firearms with a serial number.</p>
<p>“The industry has followed those conditions without difficulty for more than half a century, and those basic requirements are crucial to solving gun crimes and keeping guns out of the hands of minors, felons and domestic abusers,” Prelogar said.</p>
<p>She said with the kits to make untraceable homemade guns in as little as 15 minutes, those manufacturers “have tried to circumvent those requirements.”</p>
<p>Prelogar said untraceable guns “are attractive to people who can’t lawfully purchase them or who plan to use them in crime.”</p>
<p>Because the ATF saw a spike in crimes committed with those firearms, Prelogar said it promulgated the 2022 rule. The Biden administration said since 2016, it’s seen <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/04/11/fact-sheet-the-biden-administration-cracks-down-on-ghost-guns-ensures-that-atf-has-the-leadership-it-needs-to-enforce-our-gun-laws/#_ftn1" target="_blank">a tenfold increase in ghost guns.</a></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What the rule does</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The regulation does not ban ghost guns, but requires manufacturers of those firearm kits or parts to add a serial number to the products, as well as conduct background checks on potential buyers. The regulation also clarified those kits are considered covered by the 1968 Gun Control Act under the definition of a “firearm.”</p>
<p>The Biden administration is advocating for the Supreme Court to reverse a lower court’s decision that favored gun rights groups and owners that argued the agency exceeded its authority.</p>
<p>Pete Patterson on Tuesday represented <a href="https://www.firearmspolicy.org/vanderstok" target="_blank">those gun rights groups</a>, such as the Firearms Policy Coalition and clients, and argued the ATF expanded the definition of a firearm to “include items that may readily be converted to a frame or receiver.”</p>
<p>A frame or receiver is the primary structure of a firearm that holds the other components that cause the gun to fire.</p>
<p>“Congress decided to regulate only a single part of a firearm, the frame or receiver, and Congress did not alter the common understanding of a frame or receiver,” he said. “ATF has now exceeded its authority by operating outside of the bounds set by Congress.”</p>
<p>The case has already been before the high court on an emergency basis in 2023. The three liberal justices, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, and two conservative justices, Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. and Amy Coney Barrett, allowed the regulation to remain in place while going through legal challenges.</p>
<p>The case is similar to the Supreme Court decision that struck down a Trump-era ban on bump stocks from the ATF, but that was on the grounds of a Second Amendment argument.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Omelets and turkey chili kits</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Justice Samuel Alito questioned Prelogar whether the kits were defined as weapons.</p>
<p>“Here’s a blank pad and here’s a pen,” he said. “Is this a grocery list?”</p>
<p>She said it wasn’t because “there are a lot of things you could use those products for to create something other than a grocery list.”</p>
<p>Alito asked her if he had eggs, chopped up ham, peppers and onions, “is that a Western omelet?”</p>
<p>“No, because, again, those items have well known other uses to become something other than an omelet,” Prelogar said. “The key difference here is that these weapon parts kits are designed and intended to be used as instruments of combat, and they have no other conceivable use.”</p>
<p>Barrett asked if her answer would change if “you ordered it from HelloFresh and you got a kit and it was like turkey chili, but all of the ingredients are in the kit?”</p>
<p>Prelogar said it would.</p>
<p>“We are not suggesting that scattered components that might have some entirely separate and distinct function could be aggregated and called a weapon, in the absence of this kind of evidence that that is their intended purpose and function,” she said.</p>
<p>“But if you bought, you know, from Trader Joe’s, some omelet-making kit that had all of the ingredients to make the omelet, and maybe included whatever you would need to start the fire in order to cook the omelet, and had all of that objective indication that that’s what’s being marketed and sold, we would recognize that for what it is,” Prelogar continued.</p>
<p>Roberts asked Patterson what the purpose would be of selling a receiver without a hole in it, meaning the gun is not complete.</p>
<p>Patterson argued that the kits are mainly for gun hobbyists, who would have to drill their own holes to put the product together.</p>
<p>“Some individuals enjoy, like working on their car every weekend, some individuals want to construct their own firearms,” Patterson said.</p>
<p>Roberts seemed skeptical.</p>
<p>“I mean drilling a hole or two, I would think doesn’t give the same sort of reward that you get from working on your car on the weekends,” Roberts said.</p>
<p>Patterson argued that putting together a homemade gun was somewhat difficult, especially if an individual had no experience.</p>
<p>“Even once you have a complete frame, it’s not a trivial matter to put that together,” he said. “There are small parts that have to be put in precise locations.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">No hobbyists</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In her rebuttal, Prelogar pushed back on the notion that hobbyists were using those kits, arguing that “if there is a market for these kits, for hobbyists, they can be sold to hobbyists, you just have to comply with the requirements of the Gun Control Act.”</p>
<p>“What the evidence shows is that these guns were being purchased and used in crime. There was a 1,000% increase between 2017 and 2021 in the number of these guns that were recovered as part of criminal investigations,” she said. “The reason why you want a ghost gun is specifically because it’s unserialized and can’t be traced.”</p>

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Members of Congress left Capitol Hill last week to focus their attention on the campaign trail during the six weeks leading up to Election Day, leaving much of their work unfinished.</p>
<p>The Republican House and Democratic Senate are scheduled to remain on recess until Nov. 12, though the urgent needs created in the wake of Hurricane Helene, which are fully funded for the moment, could bring the chambers back into session before then.</p>
<p>When lawmakers do return to Washington, D.C., they’ll need to address the must-pass legislation they’ve left on autopilot instead of negotiating new bipartisan compromises.</p>
<p>So far this year, lawmakers have pushed off reaching brokering agreement on must-pass measures <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/delayed-farm-bill-punted-until-after-election-congress-stuck-how-pay-it" target="_blank">like the farm bill</a> as well as this year’s batch of government funding bills and the annual defense policy legislation.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Kids’ online safety, radiation exposure</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>There are also a handful of measures that have passed one chamber with broad bipartisan support, but haven’t been taken up on the other side of the Capitol that leadership could decide to move forward during November or December.</p>
<p>For example, an interesting combination of senators, led by Connecticut Democrat Richard Blumenthal and Tennessee Republican Marsha Blackburn, are advocating for House Republican leaders to hold votes on <a href="https://apnews.com/article/senate-child-online-safety-vote-f27c329679feb2d74787fc3887aa710f" target="_blank">a pair of online safety bills </a>designed to better protect children from the darker side of the internet.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2023/05/12/bipartisan-rail-safety-bill-headed-for-u-s-senate-vote/" target="_blank">rail safety bill</a> drafted by a bipartisan group of senators from Ohio and Pennsylvania after the train derailment in East Palestine remains unaddressed following more than a year of intransigence.</p>
<p>And legislation to reauthorize the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, or RECA, which <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/reca-expansion-passes-us-senate" target="_blank">passed the Senate</a> on a broadly bipartisan vote earlier this year, sits on a shelf collecting dust in the House.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/cancer-victims-implore-us-house-take-compensation-radiation-exposure" target="_blank">Cancer victims</a>, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/families-are-suffering-indigenous-people-impacted-radiation-head-capitol-hill" target="_blank">Indigenous communities</a> and <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/people-affected-radiation-exposure-push-congress-extend-benefits" target="_blank">many others </a>have pressed House GOP leadership to hold a vote to reauthorize the program after it expired this summer, but they have avoided it due to cost.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Five-week lame duck</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Lawmakers interviewed by States Newsroom and congressional leaders all indicated the outcome of the November elections will have significant sway on what Congress approves during the five-week lame-duck session that spans November and December.</p>
<p>All interviews took place before Hurricane Helene made landfall and Israel was directly attacked by Iran, both of which are likely to be at the top of congressional leaders’ to-do lists.</p>
<p>Senate Minority Whip John Thune said it’s “hard to say” what, if anything, Congress will approve during the lame-duck session.</p>
<p>“I think a lot will be shaped by what happens in November,” the South Dakota Republican said.</p>
<p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said just a day before Hurricane Helene made landfall that Democrats would advocate for passing natural disaster response funding previously requested by the Biden administration.</p>
<p>“Extreme weather events are on the rise and they affect everyone — in blue states, purple states and red states,” Jeffries said. “This is not a partisan issue, it’s an American issue in terms of being there, in times of need for everyday Americans, who have had their lives and livelihood upended.”</p>
<p>Other House Democratic priorities during the lame duck include approving the dozen full-year government funding bills that were supposed to be completed before Oct. 1, the defense policy bill that had the same deadline and the farm bill, which is more than a year overdue.</p>
<p>Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley said he “sure hopes” the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act reauthorization bill reaches the president’s desk before the end of the year.</p>
<p>He didn’t rule out lobbying to attach it to a must-pass government funding bill, but said the real hurdle is House GOP leaders.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t need help in the Senate. It just needs the House,” Hawley said. “I’ve had good, productive conversations with Speaker (Mike) Johnson in the last few weeks, and I appreciate his personal engagement on this, and I hope that that will lead to action.”</p>
<p>Haley said the House allowing RECA to expire, preventing people who qualify for the program from receiving benefits, was “outrageous.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Defense priorities, farm bill</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Senate Armed Services Chair Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, said staff would work during October to bridge the differences between the two chambers on the annual defense policy bill, called the National Defense Authorization Act.</p>
<p>Those staff-level talks will lay the foundation for Republicans and Democrats to meet once they return to Capitol Hill following the elections.</p>
<p>“We have to be ready when we come back to go right to the ‘Big Four’ meeting,” he said, referring to the top leaders in both chambers. “That’s our objective.”</p>
<p>Reed said many of the differences between the House and the Senate aren’t typical Defense Department policy issues per se, but are “more political, cultural, social.”</p>
<p>Congress may begin to debate additional military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine this year, though that’s more likely to happen next year, Reed said.</p>
<p>Senate Agriculture Committee Chair Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., said she was making a “big push” for the House and Senate to reach agreement on the farm bill in the months ahead, though she cautioned talks don’t actually constitute a conference.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t call it a conference; technically to have a conference, you have to have a bill passed by the House and a bill passed by the Senate, which will not happen,” Stabenow said.</p>
<p>“But I believe that there is a way,” Stabenow added. “I believe there’s a way to get a bipartisan bill.”</p>
<p>Arkansas Sen. John Boozman, the top Republican on the Agriculture panel, said lawmakers didn’t need the election results to “start working through our disagreements” on the farm bill, adding there’s some new momentum in talks.</p>
<p>“I think what’s changed is that there is a recognition among members, all members, how difficult it is right now as a farmer,” Boozman said. “So that’s really what’s changed in the last three or four months. It’s developing a real sense of urgency for these folks.”</p>
<p>Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst said the election outcome could influence what lawmakers choose to accomplish during the lame-duck session.</p>
<p>“There’s any number of scenarios, whether it’s NDAA, whether it’s farm bill, whether it’s anything else,” she said. “But it comes down to Leader Schumer.” New York Democrat Chuck Schumer is the majority leader in the Senate.</p>
<p>Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine said he expects Congress will broker some agreement on government funding legislation and the NDAA, but not necessarily anything else.</p>
<p>“In an odd way, the better the Dems do on Nov. 5, the more we’ll get done,” Kaine said. “Because I think if the House is going to flip back to Dem, I think the Rs will say, ‘Well, let’s get a whole lot of stuff done before the House goes down.’ So I think the better we do, the more we’ll get done in the lame duck.”</p>
<p>Kaine said if Democrats do well in the elections, they might not need to approve additional aid for Ukraine this Congress, since that funding can last into next year.</p>
<p>“If we don’t do well in the (elections), we might need to do it in the lame duck,” Kaine said. “So that’ll all depend.”</p>

J.D. Vance squared off Tuesday night in a vice presidential debate that marked the last scheduled in-person meeting for the campaigns as Americans decide the country’s next chapter.</p>
<p>Meeting for the first time, Walz and Vance engaged in a policy-heavy, nearly two-hour back-and-forth hosted by CBS News at its studios in New York City. The debate was moderated by Norah O’Donnell, host of the “CBS Evening News,” and Margaret Brennan, who anchors the network’s Sunday political show “Face the Nation.”</p>
<p>The vice presidential candidates emphasized their modest upbringings and laid out their visions to lower high living costs, address charged issues like reproductive rights, immigration and gun violence, and navigate a quickly worsening conflict in the Middle East.</p>
<p>And, with the presidential contest marking the first since the violent aftermath of the 2020 election, and Trump’s continued false claims that he won, the moderators pressed the men on whether voters would see a peaceful transfer of power, no matter the winner. Vance would not provide a direct answer whether he would have certified the 2020 vote.</p>
<p>Walz is a second-term governor who previously served six terms in the U.S. House. Prior to his election, Walz worked as a public school teacher and football coach while also enlisted in the Minnesota Army National Guard for 24 years.</p>
<p>Vance served in the U.S. Marines for four years before earning his Yale law degree and becoming a venture capitalist and bestselling memoirist. He was first elected to public office in late 2022 to serve as Ohio’s junior U.S. senator.</p>
<p>The mostly amicable debate, with some moments of tension, was a noticeable departure from the bitter polarization on display daily during the presidential campaign. Walz and Vance shook hands and lingered onstage afterward chatting and introducing each other to their wives.</p>
<p>The presidential nominees, former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, met on the debate stage <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/harris-tears-trump-over-abortion-rights-and-race-tense-presidential-debate" target="_blank">last month</a> in a more acrimonious exchange during which the former president falsely claimed immigrants were eating pets in Ohio and Harris ripped into him for his remarks on race and abortion.</p>
<p>Trump has <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/harris-presses-trump-debate-again-and-democrats-launch-chicken-billboards" target="_blank">refused</a> to debate again. Following the Vance-Walz exchange, the Harris campaign renewed its offer for another presidential meetup offered by CNN in Atlanta later this month.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Growing Middle East conflict</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Answering the first question from the moderators Tuesday night, Walz and Vance sparred over which administration, if elected, would best quell signs of a widening war in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Tensions in the region escalated earlier Tuesday when Iran fired nearly 200 ballistic missiles at Israel, according to the Pentagon.</p>
<p>Walz accused Trump of being “fickle” on foreign policy and said the world is worse off since Trump <a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-ending-united-states-participation-unacceptable-iran-deal/" target="_blank">pulled</a> the United States out of the Iran nuclear deal. Walz argued for “steady leadership.”</p>
<p>“You saw it experienced today where, along with our Israeli partners and our coalition, (we were) able to stop the incoming attack,” Walz said.</p>
<p>“It’s clear, and the world saw it on that debate stage a few weeks ago, a nearly 80-year-old Donald Trump talking about crowd sizes is not what we need in this moment,” the governor continued.</p>
<p>Vance maintained that Trump headed off heated global conflict by invoking fear.</p>
<p>“We have to remember that as much as Governor Waltz just accused Donald Trump of being an agent of chaos, Donald Trump actually delivered stability in the world, and he did it by establishing effective deterrence,” Vance said. “People were afraid of stepping out of line.”</p>
<p>The barrage in the Middle East followed Israel’s ground <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/01/israel-order-evacuation-southern-lebanon-border-villages-incursion" target="_blank">incursion</a> into Southern Lebanon and its recent <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/29/g-s1-25322/biden-nasrallah-hezbollah-israel" target="_blank">assassination</a> in Beirut of Hassan Nasrallah, leader of the Iranian proxy militant group Hezbollah.</p>
<p>While Israel intercepted the majority of the rockets Tuesday, U.S. Navy destroyers in the Middle East fired roughly a dozen interceptors at incoming Iranian missiles, Pentagon spokesman Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder said.</p>
<p>The Biden administration promised “severe consequences,” though it has not provided details. Harris said late Tuesday that Iran poses a “destabilizing, dangerous force in the Middle East” and her commitment to Israel is “unwavering.”</p>
<p>Despite a <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/zelenskyy-washington-meets-us-leaders-beef-support-ukraine" target="_blank">visit</a> to Washington less than a week ago from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the CBS moderators did not ask about the ongoing war in Ukraine, and neither candidate brought up the costly and ongoing fight against Russia’s continued invasion.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">2020 election</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Vance and Walz sparred over how Trump handled his loss in the 2020 presidential election and his actions leading up to Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of his supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol following a rally that Trump hosted.</p>
<p>Walz said while he and Vance found some areas of common ground at other points during the debate, the two were “miles apart” on Trump’s actions following the 2020 election.</p>
<p>“This was a threat to our democracy in a way that we had not seen, and it manifested itself because of Donald Trump’s inability to say – he is still saying he didn’t lose the election,” Walz said.</p>
<p>Vance didn’t directly answer whether he would have certified the electoral count for President Joe Biden had he been a member of Congress at the time, to Walz’s dismay.</p>
<p>“I’m pretty shocked by this,” Walz said. “He lost the election. This is not a debate.”</p>
<p>Walz said he was concerned that Vance wouldn’t follow the example set by former Vice President Mike Pence, who refused to go along with a scheme to recognize fake slates of electors and deny Biden the presidency.</p>
<p>Vance tried to pivot to Harris’ actions following the COVID-19 pandemic and whether she “censored Americans from speaking their mind” before saying that both he and Trump “think that there were problems in 2020.”</p>
<p>There was no evidence of widespread voter fraud during the last presidential election, during which Trump lost both the popular vote and the Electoral College.</p>
<p>Walz also criticized Trump and Vance for using the same narrative ahead of this November’s elections, saying they were “already laying the groundwork for people not accepting” the results should Trump lose.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Taxes and tariffs</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Both Harris and Trump have <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/taxes-where-do-trump-and-harris-stand" target="_blank">released</a> economic plans that would add trillions to the national deficit — though analysis after analysis shows Trump’s proposals <a href="https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2024/8/26/trump-campaign-policy-proposals-2024?te=1&amp;nl=the-morning&amp;emc=edit_nn_20240903" target="_blank">outpacing</a> Harris’ by at least a few trillion.</p>
<p>Harris and Walz are <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/harris-unveils-plan-curb-price-gouging-boost-child-tax-credit-tackle-rent-hikes" target="_blank">running on</a> an “opportunity economy” theme that would permanently expand the Child Tax Credit, including giving $6,000 to new parents, and provide tax credits and deductions to first-time homebuyers and entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Harris, following Biden’s earlier budget proposal, has said she would impose a minimum tax on high-wealth individuals, but vowed steeper levies on long-term capital gains.</p>
<p>Trump has promised to fund the Treasury’s coffers with money raised by taxing imported goods. Largely he wants to extend his signature 2017 tax law and permanently lower the corporate tax rate.</p>
<p>When asked by the moderators how the candidates could accomplish those goals without ballooning the national debt, both Vance and Walz sidestepped directly answering the question. Rather they touted Trump and Biden administration policies and then went on the attack.</p>
<p>“Donald Trump made a promise, and I’ll give you this: He kept it. He took folks to Mar-a-Lago (and) said, ‘You’re rich as hell. I’m gonna give you a tax cut,’” Walz said, adding that Trump’s tariff plan would be “destabilizing” for the economy.</p>
<p>Economists <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/taxes-where-do-trump-and-harris-stand" target="_blank">warn</a> that Trump’s plan to slap tariffs on imports across the board —  as high as 60% on Chinese imports and 100% to 200% on cars and John Deere tractors manufactured in Mexico — could cause consumer prices to increase and invite retaliation.</p>
<p>But Vance said he wanted to “defend my running mate” on the issue.</p>
<p>“We’re going to be taking in a lot of money by penalizing companies for shipping jobs overseas and penalizing countries who employ slave laborers and then ship their products back into our country and undercut the wages of American workers. It’s the heart of the Donald Trump economic plan,” the senator said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">High costs and housing</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Both candidates spent significant time addressing housing and child care costs.</p>
<p>Walz touted Harris’ “bold forward plan” that calls for construction of 3 million new homes and “down payment assistance on the front end to get you in a house.”</p>
<p>“A house is much more than just an asset to be traded somewhere. It’s foundational to where you’re at,” Walz said.</p>
<p>Vance said some of Walz’s ideas on housing were “halfway decent.”</p>
<p>One of the central pillars of Trump and Vance’s housing plans is to turn over federal lands to private hands for development.</p>
<p>“We have a lot of federal lands that aren’t being used for anything. They’re not being used for national parks. They’re not being used, and they could be places where we build a lot of housing,” Vance said.</p>
<p>On child care, Walz pledged a paid federal family and medical leave mandate as a priority for the Harris campaign, and advocated a parallel workforce development program for the care professions.</p>
<p>“We have to make it easier for folks to be able to get into that business, and then to make sure that folks are able to pay for that,” Walz said.</p>
<p>The dual goals, he said, “will enhance our workforce, enhance our families, and make it easier to have the children that you want.”</p>
<p>Vance said he sees an opportunity for a “bipartisan solution” to the high cost of child care, though he stopped short of agreeing with a federal paid leave law.</p>
<p>Instead he proposed expanding the potential recipients for federal child care grants.</p>
<p>“These programs only go to one kind of child care model. Let’s say you’d like your church maybe to help you out with child care. Maybe you live in a rural area or an urban area, and you’d like to get together with families in your neighborhood to provide child care and the way that makes the most sense. You don’t get access to any of these federal monies,” Vance said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Immigration, again</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Vance also repeatedly connected the housing shortage and high costs to immigration — the central issue for Trump’s campaign and a common answer from him for several of the nation’s woes.</p>
<p>The Ohio senator said housing is “totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans for scarce homes.”</p>
<p>“The people that I’m most worried about in Springfield, Ohio, are the American citizens who have had their lives destroyed by Kamala Harris’ open border,” Vance said, referring to the town where he and Trump falsely claimed over and over that Haitian migrants were stealing and eating pets.</p>
<p>Debate moderator Brennan pressed Vance on his claim: “Senator on that point, I’d like for you to clarify. There are many contributing factors to high housing costs. What evidence do you have that migrants are part of this problem?”</p>
<p>Vance said he would share on social media following the debate a Federal Reserve study that supported his claim.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Reproductive rights </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Access to abortion and fertility treatments was one of the more contentious areas of disagreement, though neither candidate trod new ground for their party.</p>
<p>Vance maintained the Trump stance that abortion laws should be set by voters or state lawmakers, while Walz said women and their doctors are best suited to make those decisions.</p>
<p>Vance told a story about a woman he grew up with having an abortion, then telling him a few years ago that “she felt like if she hadn’t had that abortion, that it would have destroyed her life because she was in an abusive relationship.”</p>
<p>“And I think that what I take from that, as a Republican who proudly wants to protect innocent life in this country, who proudly wants to protect the vulnerable, is that my party, we’ve got to do so much better of a job at earning the American people’s trust back on this issue, where they frankly, just don’t trust us,” Vance said. “And I think that’s one of the things that Donald Trump, and I are endeavoring to do.”</p>
<p>Walz rejected Vance’s position that state lawmakers should determine women’s access to the full slate of reproductive decisions, including fertility treatments.</p>
<p>Walz referenced some of the stories women have told in the last two years about being denied medical care for miscarriages or other dangerous pregnancy complications because of vaguely written state laws that banned or significantly restricted access to abortion.</p>
<p>“This is a very simple proposition: These are women’s decisions to make about their health care,” Walz said, later adding that people should “just mind their own business on this.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Gun violence</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The two vice presidential candidates had one of the more genuine exchanges of the debate after the moderators asked them about solutions for gun violence.</p>
<p>Vance conceded that he and Walz both want to reduce the number of people killed by guns every year, but said the solution should center around addressing illegal guns, including those used in drug trafficking, and through changing how schools are designed.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, I think that we have to increase security in our schools. We have to make the doors lock better. We have to make the door stronger. We’ve got to make the windows stronger,” Vance said. “And of course, we’ve got to increase school resource officers, because the idea that we can magically wave a wand and take guns out of the hands of bad guys, it just doesn’t fit with recent experience.”</p>
<p>Walz said school shootings are every parent’s “worst nightmare” before telling a story about how his son witnessed a shooting at a community center while playing volleyball.</p>
<p>“Those things don’t leave you,” Walz said, before talking about meeting with parents of the children killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, when he was a member of Congress.</p>
<p>“We understand that the Second Amendment is there, but our first responsibility is to our kids to figure this out,” Walz said. “In Minnesota, we’ve enacted enhanced red flag laws, enhanced background checks.”</p>
<p>Walz said he absolutely believes Vance hates it when children die from gun violence, but added that’s “not far enough when we know they’re things that work.”</p>
<p>“No one’s trying to scaremonger and say, ‘We’re taking your guns,” Walz said. “But I ask all of you out there, ‘Do you want your schools hardened to look like a fort?’ … when we know there’s countries around the world that their children aren’t practicing these types of drills.”</p>
<p>Vance expressed sympathy that Walz’s son had witnessed a shooting and thanked him for bringing up Finland as an example of a country with a high rate of gun ownership that doesn’t have school shootings.</p>
<p>“I do think it illustrates some of the, frankly, weird differences between our own country’s gun violence problem and Finland,” Vance said, before mentioning higher rates of substance abuse and mental health issues within the United States.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s the whole reason why we have such a bad gun violence problem, but I do think it’s a big piece of it,” Vance said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Hurricane Helene response, climate change </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The two candidates expressed dismay about the destruction stemming from Hurricane Helene in states in the Southeast, but disagreed about how best to address climate change.</p>
<p>Vance said “a lot of people are justifiably worried about all these crazy weather patterns,” before criticizing how Democrats have drafted climate change laws.</p>
<p>“This idea that carbon emissions drive all the climate change; well let’s just say that’s true, just for the sake of arguments,” Vance said. “Well, if you believe that, what would you want to do? The answer is that you’d want to restore as much American manufacturing as possible, and you’d want to produce as much energy as possible in the United States of America, because we’re the cleanest economy in the entire world.”</p>
<p>Walz said that Biden and Harris have worked with Congress to enact legislation addressing climate change that also created jobs.</p>
<p>“We are producing more natural gas and more oil at any time than we ever have. We’re also producing more clean energy,” Walz said. “Reducing our impact is absolutely critical, but this is not a false choice. You can do that at the same time you’re creating the jobs that we’re seeing all across the country.”</p>
<p>Walz also said that farmers in Minnesota know climate change is real because some years they experience significant drought and other years they’re inundated with too much rain for their crops to handle.</p>
<p>“They’ve seen 500-year droughts, 500-year floods back-to-back,” Walz said. “But what they’re doing is adapting, and this has allowed them to tell me, ‘Look, I harvest corn, I harvest soybeans, and I harvest wind.’”</p>

																						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1024" height="768" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VIRGINAI@-1024x768.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="" style="margin-bottom: 10px;" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VIRGINAI@-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VIRGINAI@-300x225.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VIRGINAI@-768x576.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VIRGINAI@-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VIRGINAI@-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p style="font-size:12px;">A sign representing the Virginia delegation at the Democratic National Convention, held in Chicago, Aug. 19-22, 2024. (Ariana Figueroa/States Newsroom)</p><p>The Democratic National Committee will send $2.5 million to more than 30 of its state and territorial parties in the closing weeks of the 2024 election cycle, the DNC said in a Friday statement.</p>
<p>With the new grants, national Democrats will have contributed to all 57 state and territorial chapters for the first time in a presidential cycle, according to the party.</p>
<p>“From the school board to the White House, the DNC is doing the work to elect Democrats to office at all levels of government,” DNC Chair Jaime Harrison said in the statement, given to States Newsroom ahead of a wider announcement.</p>
<p>“We are the only committee responsible for building Democratic infrastructure to win elections across the map, and with a new $2.5 million in grants, the DNC is delivering a multi-million dollar investment across all 57 state parties this cycle – a historic first for our committee.”</p>
<p>The new grants go beyond the seven swing states considered ultra-competitive in the presidential election that have gotten the lion’s share of attention and spending at the national level — and the handful with key U.S. Senate races that have also attracted a national focus.</p>
<p>Though some grants are relatively small, they represent a commitment by the national party to states across the country, including traditionally red states, Democrats said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Field workers in Idaho</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In Idaho, where Democrats hold just 18 of the 105 seats in the Legislature, a more-than $70,000 commitment from the national party will fund two field workers to reach Hispanic voters in two rural counties and tribal members on the Nez Perce Reservation, state party chair and state Rep. Lauren Necochea said.</p>
<p>Necochea, who spoke with States Newsroom in a Thursday interview ahead of the official announcement, said the funding was significant both for the symbolism of the national party’s investment in the overwhelmingly Republican state and for campaign operations this fall.</p>
<p>“We’re just gratified to see that this investment hit all 57 states and territories for the first time … so that no state is left behind,” she said. “We’re a traditionally red state, and that means we need the funding to fight back.”</p>
<p>The two organizers funded by the national money will help boost turnout in the state’s four battleground state legislative districts, Necochea said.</p>
<p>“This level of investment is also meaningful when it comes to winning races and getting out the vote,” she said, noting that a race in the last cycle was decided by 37 votes.</p>
<p>The outcomes in those races could determine which faction of the state’s Republican Party — either the hard right or the more moderate wing — will control the legislative agenda next session, she said.</p>
<p>The Democratic minority in the Legislature sometimes partners with moderate Republicans on legislation to fund education and health care programs, including maintaining the state’s Medicaid expansion, Necochea said.</p>
<p>“It is essential for state government to continue operating that we have a critical mass of Democrats in the Idaho Legislature,” she said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Other grants</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The DNC provided a partial list of the spending included in Friday’s announcement. State parties are free to use the funds as they wish, a DNC spokesman said. The national party noted some state organizations had already determined how to allocate the money.</p>
<p>Many state organizations planned to pursue outreach to voters of color, including in tribal communities.</p>
<p>Some examples of the spending and objectives, according to the DNC:</p>
<ul>
<li>Florida: More than $400,000 for statewide programs targeting “key coalitions.”</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Oregon: $125,000 to help the state party’s efforts in three key U.S. House races.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Pennsylvania: $100,000 “to supercharge voter outreach” in the only presidential battleground state on the new list. A portion of the funding will target the state’s large Puerto Rican community, the DNC said.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Minnesota: At least $100,000 to boost the state’s paid canvassing campaign. The new funding brings the total DNC allocation to the state to about $630,000, according to the party. The canvassing effort will help protect Democrats’ slim majorities in both legislative chambers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Missouri: “Nearly $100,000” for new organizing staff focused on breaking GOP supermajorities in both statehouse chambers and passing <a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2024/09/25/amendment-3-challenges-abortion-missouri-legislation/" target="_blank">an abortion ballot measure</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Maryland: $75,000 for the state party’s mail program, with a focus on reaching Asian American and Pacific Islander voters, a growing segment of the state’s voting base, the DNC said. The DNC noted its support for U.S. Senate candidate Angela Alsobrooks, calling her race against former GOP Gov. Larry Hogan critical to protecting reproductive rights.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>South Carolina: More than $70,000 for a get-out-the-vote staffer, focusing on outreach to new voters.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Maine: $61,250 for three staffers to focus get-out-the-vote efforts in rural parts of U.S. Rep. Jared Golden’s swing district.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Arkansas: Nearly $60,000 to hire six coalition directors targeting young, Black and Latino voters, including Spanish-speaking organizers. It’s the first DNC spending in Arkansas this cycle.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Louisiana: $55,000 for an organizer to help the state party reach voters in the new majority-Black 6th Congressional District.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Kansas: $50,000 for paid canvassing efforts to break GOP supermajorities in both legislative chambers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Oklahoma: $50,000 to help the state party’s outreach to tribal communities.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Virginia: $50,000 for the state party’s get-out-the-vote and voter contact programs, focusing on two competitive U.S. House races: <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/race-details/virginia-congressional-district-7/">Virginia&#8217;s 7th Congressional District contest</a>, where Democrat Eugene Vindman is facing off against Republican Derrick Anderson; and V<a href="https://virginiamercury.com/race-details/virginia-congressional-district-2/">irginia&#8217;s 2nd Congressional District race</a>, where Democrat Missy Cotter Smasal is competing against Republican incumbent U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>West Virginia: $50,000 for get-out-the-vote and paid mail programs targeting “youth and minority voters” who could affect four competitive state legislative races.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>North Dakota: Nearly $40,000 for get-out-the-vote efforts and organizing in tribal communities.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>New Jersey: “Five figures” will go to get-out-the-vote operations in all state races, with a particular focus on Rep. Andy Kim’s U.S. Senate race against Republican Curtis Bashaw. It’s the first DNC spending in the Garden State this cycle.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Tennessee: An unspecified amount to help the state party “build on the organizing momentum” it has seen in the past year.</li>

<p>Members of the U.S. House Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Development expressed frustration Tuesday over the botched rollout and its repercussions for students and families at a hearing that coincided with the release of a <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-24-107783" target="_blank">pair of findings</a> from the <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-24-107407" target="_blank">Government Accountability Office</a> on the major issues that plagued the rollout of the 2024-25 Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA.</p>
<p>Though the application got a makeover after Congress passed the FAFSA Simplification Act, advocates have shared concerns over processing delays as a result of the form’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/24/politics/fafsa-inflation-fix-income/index.html" target="_blank">failure to adjust for inflation,</a> its <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/miscalculation-in-fafsa-formula-is-another-unforced-error" target="_blank">formula miscalculation</a> and its <a href="https://fsapartners.ed.gov/knowledge-center/library/electronic-announcements/2024-04-01/update-tax-data-received-fa-ddx-and-manually-entered-information" target="_blank">tax data errors</a>. Major issues also initially prevented parents without Social Security numbers from completing the form.</p>
<p>The department has worked to fix issues surrounding the 2024-25 form and reevaluated the implementation of the 2025-26 form, taking into account feedback from students, families and stakeholders.</p>
<p>On Monday, the <a href="https://www.ed.gov/sites/ed/files/2024-09/AFocusonImprovingtheFAFSAExperience.pdf" target="_blank">department released a report</a> reviewing implementation of the 2024-25 form as well as the progress it’s making to try to improve the user experience since the streamlined form launched.</p>
<p>Part of those efforts include the department <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-education-department-open-new-financial-aid-form-more-applicants" target="_blank">using a phased rollout of the 2025-26 form</a> in an effort to address any problems that might arise before opening to everyone by Dec. 1. The staggered approach will make the 2025-26 FAFSA fully available two months later than usual.</p>
<p>Members of both parties criticized the 2024-25 form’s rollout at Tuesday’s hearing.</p>
<p>Subcommittee Chairman Burgess Owens said the “FAFSA rollout was mired in delays, errors, frustration — and for some of our most vulnerable students — the loss of their dreams for a higher education.”</p>
<p>The Utah Republican said the “impact of the Biden administration’s failure on real lives has been devastating.”</p>
<p>Rep. Frederica Wilson, ranking member of the subcommittee, said implementation of the FAFSA Simplification Act “has been derailed by a series of mistakes made by the Department of Education, leading to delays and ongoing setbacks in the rollout of the new application.”</p>
<p>The Florida Democrat expressed frustration that “aside from the dozens of letters Congress has sent, this is not the first hearing we’ve had this year about this same issue, nor is this the first application cycle with these issues.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Lack of information</h4>

	
<p>In one of the two GAO reports released Tuesday, the watchdog found that about 432,000 fewer people submitted a FAFSA compared to last year — marking a 3% decrease as of late August.</p>
<p>The decline in submissions was “most pronounced among lower income students and families,” per GAO.</p>
<p>The investigators also found that the department did not consistently provide students with timely information on processing delays, changes in their student aid eligibility, or “solutions to technical barriers they encountered during the application process.”</p>
<p>Melissa Emrey-Arras, a director at GAO who oversees work on education, said at the Tuesday hearing that delays “significantly hindered (students’) ability to choose a college, thinking wisely about their finances and whether they could afford a school.”</p>
<p>“Can you imagine? It’s like buying a house but not knowing how much aid you’re gonna get and having to make a commitment right then and there,” Emrey-Arras said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Understaffing leads to unanswered calls</h4>

	
<p>The government watchdog also found that, as a result of understaffing, nearly three-quarters of all calls to the call center went unanswered in the first five months of the 2024-25 rollout — totalling 4 million out of 5.4 million calls.</p>
<p>As for the communication with schools, GAO found that the department “consistently failed to meet promised deadlines and provide colleges with sufficient notice” of timeframe changes throughout the 2024-25 FAFSA rollout.</p>
<p>Marisol Cruz Cain, a GAO director who oversees work on information technology, said the Office of Federal Student Aid “did not fully test the system, leading to numerous performance problems.”</p>
<p>Cruz Cain said that after the initial deployment, “FSA identified 55 defects, which was almost twice as many as were identified when testing the system as a whole prior to launch.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Improvement plan</h4>

	
<p>In a Monday <a href="https://www.ed.gov/laws-and-policy/education-policy/secretarys-cover-letter-focus-improving-fafsa-experience" target="_blank">letter to college and university presidents</a> regarding progress on the 2025-26 form, U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said the department “has worked tirelessly to completely overhaul a system that had largely remained untouched for over four decades and itself included twenty different sub-systems that required significant changes — a wholesale transformation to enable the most sweeping changes to federal financial aid eligibility and processes in years.”</p>
<p>The department outlined in its <a href="https://www.ed.gov/sites/ed/files/2024-09/AFocusonImprovingtheFAFSAExperience.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> Monday 10 steps it has taken to improve the FAFSA application process, such as increasing the number of call center agents — with more than 700 new agents added. The department is also working to address issues families without Social Security numbers faced when completing the form.</p>
<p>The department’s efforts also include strengthening its leadership team and offering “additional outreach and support for students and families who need the most help completing the form.”</p>
<p>In a statement responding to Tuesday’s hearing, a spokesperson for the department said that “after the first major overhaul of the FAFSA system in more than four decades, there are more than 500,000 more students eligible for Pell Grants than there were at this time last year.”</p>
<p>“We have sought advice from students and families, colleges, and partners and provided more than 1,000 documents to the Government Accountability Office,” the spokesperson added. “Thanks to this input, along with community partnerships, we have now narrowed the FAFSA completion gap to about 2% compared to this time last year — down from 40% in March.”</p>

(Photo by Jim Vondruska/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris said Tuesday during a radio interview that she supports changing a Senate procedure in order to codify the right to an abortion.</p>
<p>Vice President Harris said she is in favor of ending the 60-vote threshold in the Senate, known as the filibuster, to advance abortion rights legislation. But that task would hinge on Democrats agreeing to do so and holding on to majority control in the Senate, a difficult feat this November as <a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2024/09/23/racing-toward-election-day-control-of-u-s-senate-and-house-up-for-grabs/" target="_blank">Republicans appear potentially poised to take back the upper chamber. </a></p>
<p>“I think we should eliminate the filibuster for Roe, and get us to the point where 51 votes would be what we need to actually put back in law the protections for reproductive freedom and for the ability of every person and every woman to make decisions about their own body and not have their government tell them what to do,” she said during an interview with Wisconsin Public Radio.</p>
<p>Harris in 2022 said she would <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/09/10/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-at-the-2022-democratic-national-committee-summer-meeting/" target="_blank">cast a tie-breaking vote</a> in favor of abortion rights in her role as vice president. She has often pledged to sign into law a codification of Roe v. Wade, the constitutional right to an abortion struck down by the conservative U.S. Supreme Court in 2022.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said in August that Democrats would talk about rules changes to codify abortion rights, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/chuck-schumer-outlines-2025-agenda-democrats-sweep-eying-filibuster-ch-rcna167433" target="_blank">NBC reported.</a></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump in Pennsylvania</h4>

	
<p><a href="https://penncapital-star.com/election-2024/trump-talks-agriculture-and-china-in-smithton-ahead-of-rally-at-iup/" target="_blank">At a Monday rally in Pennsylvania</a>, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump referred to himself as a “protector” of women. Trump said women no longer needed to think about abortion and it is “now where it always had to be, with the states.”</p>
<p>“All they want to do is talk about abortion,” the former president said at the rally, referring to Democrats. “It really no longer pertains because we’ve done something on abortion that no one thought was possible.”</p>
<p>Trump has called for Senate Republicans to dismantle the filibuster, but GOP Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and other Republican leaders like No. 2 Sen. John Thune of South Dakota have vowed to keep the procedure in place.</p>
<p>Current Senate projections indicate Republicans are likely to gain control of the Senate. Republicans are also expected to pick up a seat in West Virginia, and only need to hold on to seats in Florida, Texas and Nebraska.</p>
<p>Democrats will need to secure wins in Arizona, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Additionally, Senate Democrats would need to break a possible 50-50 tie through a Democratic presidency — if they want to remain the majority party and change the filibuster.</p>
<p>If Harris wins, and Democrats hold 50 seats in the Senate, then Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, the vice presidential nominee, would be the tie-breaking vote.</p>
<p>During a Tuesday Senate press conference on abortion, Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington said she was supportive of Harris’ stance and that it would be a carve-out of the filibuster, rather than an elimination of it.</p>
<p>“What we are talking about is a simple procedure to allow, whenever rights are taken away from someone, that the U.S. Senate can, without being blocked by a filibuster, be able to restore those rights,” she said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Harris, Trump and the economy</h4>

	
<p>The Harris campaign hosted a Tuesday press call with business owner and  “Shark Tank” investor Mark Cuban, to advocate for Harris’ economic policies.</p>
<p>Polls have found that voters view Trump as better for the economy. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/09/09/in-tied-presidential-race-harris-and-trump-have-contrasting-strengths-weaknesses/" target="_blank">Pew Research</a> found that Trump’s key advantage is the economy, with 55% of voters viewing the former president as making good economic decisions, and 45% of voters viewing Harris as making good decisions about the economy.</p>
<p>“In a nutshell, the vice president and her team thinks through her policies,” Cuban said. “She doesn’t just off the top of her head say what she thinks the crowd wants to hear, like the Republican nominee.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Battleground states still the favorite spot</h4>

	
<p>The candidates will continue to campaign and travel, especially around battleground states this week.</p>
<p>Trump is scheduled Tuesday to visit Savannah, Georgia, where he will give an afternoon campaign speech about lowering taxes for business owners.</p>
<p>Walz is scheduled to head back to his home state of Minnesota Tuesday for a campaign reception there.</p>
<p>Harris is heading to <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/briefs/kamala-harris-to-campaign-in-pennsylvania-on-wednesday/" target="_blank">Pennsylvania Wednesday </a>for a campaign rally and then she’ll travel to Arizona on Friday and Nevada on Sunday.</p>
<p>Trump is stopping in Mint Hill, North Carolina, on Wednesday to give remarks about the importance of making goods in the U.S. His running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, will travel to Traverse City, Michigan, on Wednesday to rally supporters.</p>
<p>Vance on Thursday will give a campaign speech on the economy in Macon, Georgia, and then host a voter mobilization drive in Flowery Branch, Georgia.</p>
<p>On Friday, Trump is scheduled to rally supporters in Walker, Michigan and in the evening hold a town hall in Warren, Michigan.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20240916/RCP_3724_01_xml.pdf" target="_blank">End Woke Higher Education Act</a> — which succeeded <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2024433" data-type="link" data-id="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2024433" target="_blank">213-201</a> — marks one of <a href="https://www.gop.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1850" target="_blank">several so-called anti-woke initiatives</a> and messaging bills from Republican lawmakers to hit the House floor this week.</p>
<p>The higher education measure, which drew fierce opposition from the Biden administration and major associations of colleges and universities, came amid a <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/government-shutdown-deadline-nearing-us-house-stumbles-stopgap-spending-bill%C2%A0" target="_blank">looming government shutdown deadline</a> and in the heat of the 2024 campaign.</p>
<p>Four House Democrats voted in favor of the GOP measure, including Reps. Don Davis of North Carolina, Jared Golden of Maine, Mary Peltola of Alaska and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington.</p>
<p>Baked into the legislation are two bills introduced by Republican members of the U.S. House Committee on Education and the Workforce — the Accreditation for College Excellence Act and the Respecting the First Amendment on Campus Act.</p>
<p>Utah Rep. Burgess Owens, chairman of the Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Development, introduced the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3724/text" target="_blank">Accreditation for College Excellence Act</a> in May 2023, while New York Rep. Brandon Williams brought forth the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7683/text" target="_blank">Respecting the First Amendment on Campus Act</a> in March.</p>
<p>In a statement to States Newsroom, Owens said “House Republicans passed the End Woke Higher Education Act to stand up for academic freedom, defend students’ constitutional rights, and ensure that colleges and universities aren’t forced to bend the knee to activist accreditors pushing political agendas as a condition for federal funding.”</p>
<p>The Utah Republican said the “Biden-Harris administration has injected its far-left ideology — Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion and Critical Race Theory — into every part of American life, including our higher education system.”</p>
<p>Owens’ bill says accreditation standards must not require, encourage or coerce institutions to support or oppose “a specific partisan, political, or ideological viewpoint or belief” or “set of viewpoints or beliefs on social, cultural, or political issues” or support “the disparate treatment of any individual or group of individuals.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Williams’ Respecting the First Amendment on Campus Act forces schools to disclose policies regarding free speech to students and faculty as a condition of receiving any Title IV funds.</p>
<p>Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 includes <a href="https://fsapartners.ed.gov/knowledge-center/library/program/All%20Title%20IV%20Federal%20Student%20Aid%20Programs" target="_blank">federal student financial aid programs</a>.</p>

<p>But the legislation is highly unlikely to be passed in the Democratic-controlled Senate.</p>
<p>The Biden administration also strongly opposed the measure, saying in a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/SAP-HR-3724.pdf" target="_blank">statement</a> this week that the legislation would “micromanage both public and private institutions, undermining their ability to recognize and promote diversity.”</p>
<p>The legislation “would go beyond Congress’s traditional role in higher education with a wide range of confusing and unprecedented new mandates,” the administration added.</p>
<p>Rep. Bobby Scott — ranking member of the U.S. House Committee on Education and the Workforce — called the measure a “baseless attempt to inject culture wars into an ever-important accreditation process” during the floor debate Thursday.</p>
<p>The Virginia Democrat said the legislation “attempts to circumvent the First Amendment to establish a whole new scheme to regulate speech and association rights on campus outside of established precedents and practices.”</p>
<p>The GOP measure also drew the ire of leading associations of colleges and universities, who opposed the legislation both individually and collectively.</p>
<p>In a joint letter this week to House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York, <a href="https://www.aau.edu/sites/default/files/Letter-House-End-Woke-Higher-Education-Act-091724.pdf" target="_blank">six major associations</a> led by the American Council on Education took aim at Williams’ portion of the legislation, saying it “would undermine efforts to protect free speech on campus and provide safe learning environments free from discrimination.”</p>

The FBI is leading the investigation and has said the incident “appears to be an attempted assassination of former President Trump” while he was golfing at his West Palm Beach, Florida, club. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Ryan Wesley Routh appeared in federal court Monday on two firearm charges after being apprehended by local law enforcement Sunday in what the FBI is investigating as a possible assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Authorities found a rifle in an area Routh was seen fleeing on Sunday, but acting Secret Service Director Ron Rowe said Monday that Routh did not fire his weapon. Trump was unharmed, his campaign confirmed shortly <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/fbi-investigates-apparent-assassination-attempt-against-trump-florida-former-president-safe" target="_blank">after Sunday’s incident. </a></p>
<p>The Secret Service agent who spotted someone holding a rifle near the treeline of Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, fired toward the suspect. Trump, the GOP presidential nominee, was golfing at the time.</p>
<p>The incident is being investigated as the second assassination attempt against Trump in two months. He sustained an injury to his ear during a shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July.</p>
<p>The Trump campaign Monday blamed Democrats and the media for the shooting.</p>
<p>“Democrats and the Fake News must immediately cease their inflammatory, violent rhetoric against President Trump — which was mimicked by yesterday’s would-be assassin,” the campaign said in a statement.</p>
<p>Routh, 58, appeared before U.S. Magistrate Judge Ryon McCabe in West Palm Beach federal court and was charged with possession of a firearm as a convicted felon and for obliterating the serial number on a firearm, according to court records. If convicted, he would face up to 20 years in prison.</p>
<p>Routh is being held in pretrial detention, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25145956-routh" target="_blank">according to a criminal complaint</a> filed by FBI special agent Mark Thomas.</p>
<p>The FBI is leading the investigation.</p>
<p>Separately, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/desantis-state-will-conduct-credible-probe-trump-assassination-bid" target="_blank">the state will conduct its own investigation</a> into the possible assassination attempt to determine if Routh broke any state laws.</p>
<p>A detention hearing on the federal charges is set for Sept. 23, the U.S. Department of Justice said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Initial investigation</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>According to an affidavit accompanying the criminal complaint, at 1:31 p.m. Eastern on Sunday, a Secret Service agent walking the perimeter of the golf course spotted a rifle poking out of the tree line. The agent fired toward the rifle.</p>
<p>Rowe said at a Monday press conference that Routh did not have a line of vision at the former president and he did not fire his weapon.</p>
<p>“The agent who was visually sweeping the area … saw the subject armed with what he perceived to be a rifle and immediately discharged his firearm,” Rowe said. “The subject, who did not have line of sight to the former president, fled the scene. He did not fire or get off any shots at our agents.”</p>
<p>Routh fled in a Nissan SUV, according to the charging documents. A witness took photos of the license plate and local law enforcement officers stopped the vehicle in Martin County, which borders Palm Beach County.</p>
<p>West Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said the witness was able to identify the driver as “the person that he saw running out of the bushes that jumped into the car.”</p>
<p>Routh was the sole person in the vehicle, according to the complaint.</p>
<p>According to the charging documents, agents found at the site Routh fled a digital camera, two bags, an SKS-style 7.62 x 39 rifle, which is the predecessor to the AK-47 assault rifle that law enforcement initially said they found Sunday, and a scope.</p>
<p>They also found a bag of food and noticed the rifle had the serial number obliterated “to the naked eye,” according to the filing documents.</p>
<p>The weapon also must have crossed state lines, Thomas noted.</p>
<p>“SKS-style 7.62 x 39 caliber rifles are not manufactured in the state of Florida,” Thomas wrote. “Therefore, I submit that there is probable cause to believe that the SKS-style rifle, which was seized from the tree line at Trump International… traveled in interstate or foreign commerce.”</p>
<p>The officers who stopped Routh on Interstate-95 noted that the license plate associated with the Nissan is registered to a 2012 white Ford truck that was reported stolen, according to the complaint.</p>
<p>Law enforcement found a July 10 Facebook post in which Routh directed his followers to contact him on WhatsApp and listed a contact number, according to the complaint.</p>
<p>Phone records associated with that number indicated that the phone “was located in the vicinity of the area along the tree line described from 1:59 a.m. Eastern to 1:31 p.m. Sunday,” according to the complaint.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Secret Service response</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The incident follows the July 13 <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/campaigns-elections/trump-campaigns-in-western-pennsylvania-with-rally-in-butler-county/" target="_blank">assassination attempt</a> of Trump during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in which the Secret Service was heavily criticized for its response.</p>
<p>Then-Director Kimberly Cheatle <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-secret-service-director-resigns-amid-fury-over-agency-failures-protecting-trump" target="_blank">resigned</a> and Congress <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-leaders-name-members-trump-assassination-attempt-task-force" target="_blank">established a bipartisan task force</a> to investigate the July shooting.</p>
<p>The leaders of that task force, U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly, Republican of Pennsylvania, and U.S. Rep. Jason Crow, a Colorado Democrat, have requested a briefing from the Secret Service on the security response to the shooting in West Palm Beach.</p>
<p>Members of Congress have been more complimentary of the Secret Service’s response to the Florida incident.</p>
<p>House Speaker Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana, commended the agency’s response during an interview with “Fox and Friends” on Monday.</p>
<p>“What I understand happened is that those agents that were with him yesterday saw that barrel of that gun between the bushes on a golf course. I mean, you know, that’s a difficult thing to spot. Thankfully, they did,” Johnson said. “But unlike in Butler, they did not pause. They immediately pulled their weapons and fired. I think that’s why this guy, the suspect, the shooter, threw the gun in the bushes and ran.”</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, said on the Senate floor Monday that senators are open to giving the Secret Service more funding in legislation this month needed to keep the government open past Sept. 30.</p>
<p>“If the Secret Service is in need of more resources, we are prepared to provide it for them,” he said. “Possibly in the upcoming funding agreement.”</p>
<p>President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, said Sunday they’d been briefed on the matter and condemned political violence.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Prior arrests, Ukraine activism</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In 2002, Routh was convicted in Greensboro, North Carolina, for possession of a weapon of mass destruction, which is a felony in the state. He was arrested after fleeing law enforcement and barricading himself for three hours in a business, <a href="https://greensboro.com/man-with-gun-barricades-self-inside-business/article_3006b4f9-9370-5b08-a54e-46c87faf6cbe.html" target="_blank">according to the Greensboro News &amp; Record.</a></p>
<p>He was also arrested in North Carolina in 2010 for possession of stolen goods.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Veltri, the special agent in charge of the bureau’s Miami field office, said during a Monday press conference that the FBI is conducting interviews with family and friends in Honolulu and Charlotte, North Carolina.</p>
<p>He added that in 2019 the FBI received a tip that Routh possessed a firearm, which was illegal because of his felony record. When FBI agents followed up, the tipster “did not verify providing the initial information,” Veltri said.</p>
<p>The agency referred the matter to Honolulu police, he said.</p>
<p>Routh was interviewed by The New York Times last year about his efforts to recruit Afghan soldiers who had fled the Taliban to fight in Ukraine’s war against Russia.</p>
<p>Routh, who had spent time in Ukraine and does not have any U.S. military experience, said he had planned to illegally obtain documents to move those Afghan fighters from Pakistan and Iran to Ukraine.</p>
<p>“We can probably purchase some passports through Pakistan, since it’s such a corrupt country,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/25/world/europe/volunteers-us-ukraine-lies.html" target="_blank">Routh told the Times in the interview</a>.</p>
<p>He wrote an ebook that he published on Amazon Kindle about his time in Ukraine, during which he became disillusioned about the country’s ability to win its war against Russia.</p>
<p>Kathleen Shaffer, who said Routh was her fiancé, set up a GoFundMe in 2022 to help Routh travel to Ukraine for 90 days to fight in the war.</p>
<p>The fundraiser has been deleted, but can be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240915214407/https://www.gofundme.com/f/ryans-international-volunteer-center-in-kyiv" target="_blank">accessed through internet archives.</a></p>
<p>“Any and all funds will support purchase of additional flags, tactical gear, any supplies needed for incoming volunteers, and hostel lodging,” according to the fundraiser, which raised $1,865 out of its goal of $2,500.</p>
<p>States Newsroom called a number associated with Shaffer, but could not reach her.</p>
<p>Public records show Routh currently lives in Kaaawa on the island of Oahu in Hawaii.</p>
<p>In 2018, Hawaii News Now <a href="https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/37542027/in-kaaawa-drenching-rains-leave-behind-flooded-yards-and-a-muddy-mess/" target="_blank">interviewed Routh about torrential rains in Kaaawa</a>. Routh talked in the interview about a recent home project he finished after buying his home a year prior.</p>

(Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson pulled a six-month stopgap spending bill from heading to the floor for a vote Wednesday, scuttling efforts by the GOP to show solidarity behind their plan, which included a provision requiring ID to register to vote in federal elections.</p>
<p>The spending bill, released by House Republicans last week in the heat of a presidential campaign in which immigration is a central focus, had no chance of becoming law amid opposition from Democrats, a cool response from many GOP senators and a veto threat from the Biden administration.</p>
<p>A number of House GOP lawmakers had also come out against the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/9494/text" target="_blank">legislation</a>.</p>
<p>Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, told reporters that lawmakers plan to work through the weekend to find a path forward on the stopgap spending bill and language that would require proof of U.S. citizenship to register to vote.</p>
<p>“No vote today because we are in the consensus-building business here in Congress; with a small majority, that’s what you do,” he said. “We’re having thoughtful conversations, family conversations within the Republican Conference and I believe we’ll get there.”</p>
<p>Johnson said Congress has “two primary obligations right now.”</p>
<p>One is funding the government ahead of the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1, thereby avoiding a shutdown.</p>
<p>And he said the other is addressing concerns about the possibility that people who are not citizens could vote in the November election, even though that is already illegal.</p>
<p>“We’re going to continue to work on this. The whip is going to do the hard work and build consensus. We’re going to work through the weekend on that,” Johnson told reporters. “And I want any member of Congress, in either party, to explain to the American people why we should not ensure that only U.S. citizens are voting in U.S. elections.”</p>
<p>Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-urges-shutdown-unless-congress-passes-bill-requiring-id-register-vote" target="_blank">posted on social media </a>Tuesday that Republicans should not vote for any short-term spending measure without the sidecar voter ID bill attached.</p>
<p>Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, called for a bipartisan negotiation after news broke of Johnson pulling the vote.</p>
<p>“For the good of the American people, Congress must move on from House Republicans’ partisan continuing resolution proposals and begin negotiating a funding bill that can earn the support of both Democrats and Republicans in the House and the Senate,” she said in a statement.</p>
<p>“It is past time for Chairman Tom Cole, Chair Patty Murray, Vice Chair Susan Collins, and I to begin good-faith negotiations on a continuing resolution that will keep government programs and services Americans depend on functioning while we complete our work on full-year funding bills before the end of the 118th Congress,” DeLauro added.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Senators sound off</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Maine Sen. Collins, the top Republican on the spending panel, said she’d like to see a stopgap spending bill that lasts through mid-December to incentivize Congress to finish negotiations on the dozen annual government funding bills this calendar year.</p>
<p>Those talks were supposed to be wrapped up before the end of this month, but neither chamber has begun conference negotiations, leading to the need for the stopgap spending bills.</p>
<p>“I’ve made clear that I think we need to get our work done as soon as possible, and that the CR should not go beyond mid-December,” Collins said. “If it goes beyond mid-December, it places the new administration at a huge disadvantage, because they’re going to have to deal with issues that date back to October of this year, rather than focusing on the FY 26 budget, which I would think would be their preference.”</p>
<p>West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, the top Republican on the Labor-HHS-Education spending subcommittee, said the Senate should wait a bit longer to see if the House can send over a bill, though not indefinitely.</p>
<p>“Obviously they have some struggles, which is not surprising,” she said of the House. “We’ll just wait. And if it gets to the point where it doesn’t look like they can act, then we may have to step in, but I wouldn’t say that’s the preferred path.”</p>
<p>Capito said that talks on the stopgap spending bills, which Congress enacts every year after missing their deadline, “have a tendency to fall into place much more quickly than what you might think.”</p>
<p>Montana Democratic Sen. Jon Tester, chairman of the Defense Appropriations subcommittee, said he wants to see a stopgap spending bill that lasts until mid-December, citing concerns from the Department of Defense about a longer continuing resolution.</p>
<p>“Yeah, shit, I’d like to have the appropriations done by the end of September, but yeah, the shorter, the better,” he said.</p>
<p>Tester said he supports the legislation that would require proof of U.S. citizenship to register to vote, but disagreed with House GOP leaders’ choice to attach it to the stopgap spending bill.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it should be on the appropriations bill. It just mucks things up,” Tester said. “Let’s take it to the floor and debate. I’ll vote for it, even though it’s not necessary.”</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said he wasn’t surprised that Johnson had to pull the bill from the floor and encouraged him to draft a new stopgap spending bill that can garner the votes needed to clear the divided Congress.</p>
<p>“Speaker Johnson ought not bother with merely delaying his vote,” Schumer said. “He should scrap it — scrap his plan and start over.”</p>
<p>Schumer said that he, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries and President Joe Biden would all “readily work” with Johnson on a bipartisan version.</p>

<p>The debate at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia hosted by ABC News just 56 days before the election was also notable as the first exchange between the candidates since President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/president-joe-biden-bows-out-reelection-campaign-harris-vows-win-nomination-8" target="_blank">exited</a> the race weeks after his botched debate performance in late June.</p>

<p>It is the only debate the campaigns have agreed to before the November election, although the Harris camp afterward suggested they’re ready for another and Fox News offered to host it in October.</p>
<p>The night began with Democratic nominee Harris crossing the stage to initiate a handshake and introducing herself to Trump, the GOP candidate. The two had never before met.</p>
<p>But the back-and-forth quickly grew contentious, as Trump blasted Harris’ record as vice president under President Joe Biden, and Harris said Trump was unfit to be president for myriad reasons. The two did not shake hands at the close.</p>
<p>Harris portrayed herself as a champion of the middle class. She presented a hopeful vision of the country that she sought to contrast with what she described as Trump’s self-centered vision that included attacks on the country’s democratic traditions and people of color.</p>
<p>“I am actually the only person on this stage who has a plan that is about lifting up the middle class and working people of America,” she said. “I believe in the ambition, the aspirations, the dreams of the American people.”</p>
<p>The vice president lambasted Trump as “extreme” and sought to tie him to the ultraconservative Project 2025, with which he denied an association. Harris also underscored the numerous legal cases Trump <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trumps-jan-6-case-extend-beyond-election-day-under-timeline-laid-out-judge%C2%A0-2" target="_blank">continues</a> to face. Trump is the first former president to become a <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-found-guilty-34-felony-counts-ny-hush-money-trial-10" target="_blank">convicted</a> felon.</p>
<p>“Donald Trump actually has no plan for you,” she said. “Because he is more interested in defending himself than he is in looking out for you.”</p>
<p>Trump repeated unverified claims about migrants eating dogs in Ohio, returned time and again to complaints about immigration, defended his plan to raise tariffs and boasted about campaign rally crowd sizes — after Harris taunted him about his events, saying people left.</p>
<p>“In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs, the people that came in, they’re eating the cats. They’re eating, they’re eating the pets of the people that live there,” Trump said in one of the more jarring moments of the debate, when he repeated <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/misinformation/jd-vance-ohio-police-no-reports-haitian-immigrants-harming-pets-rcna170271" target="_blank">baseless</a> claims about Haitian migrants. The rumors have circulated on social media in recent days, and have been <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/GXC9L0aXQAAjeIm.jpeg" target="_blank">amplified</a> by Trump’s running mate, Ohio U.S. Sen. J.D. Vance.</p>
<p>Trump challenged Harris to use her position in the administration to address inflation and immigration, suggesting that she was not actually able to follow through on her promises.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="LvYR73wQrF"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/15/im-entitled-to-personal-attacks-against-harris-trump-asserts/"> ‘I’m entitled to personal attacks’ against Harris, Trump asserts</a></p></blockquote>

<p>“She doesn’t have a plan,” he said. “She copied Biden’s plan, and it’s like four sentences like, ‘Run, Spot, run,’ four sentences that are just, ‘Oh, we’ll try and lower taxes.’ She doesn’t have a plan.”</p>
<p>Polls show the race is <a href="https://scri.siena.edu/category/political/nyt/" target="_blank">virtually tied</a> nationally and in seven key states that will decide the Electoral College margin: Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. Harris enjoyed a polling bump soon after she became a candidate, but her numbers have dropped in the weeks since and recent polls showed her roughly even with Trump.</p>
<p>Among the top moments of the night touching on policy and politics:</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Election integrity</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The 2024 presidential election marks a test for the peaceful transfer of power after political violence marred the nation’s tradition when Trump’s refusal to accept his loss sparked a Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol.</p>
<p>Trump repeated false claims during Tuesday’s debate that he won the 2020 presidential election, even walking back recent public statements that seemed to accept defeat.</p>
<p>Asked by moderator David Muir if recent statements that he “lost by a whisker” and similar sentiments were acknowledgements he’d lost, Trump said the comments were sarcastic.</p>
<p>“I don’t acknowledge that at all,” he said. “That was said sarcastically.”</p>
<p>Harris called Trump’s answer “deeply troubling.”</p>
<p>“You did, in fact, lose that election,” she told him. She added that his continued denial “leads one to believe that perhaps we do not have, in the candidate to my right, the temperament or the ability to not be confused about fact. That’s deeply troubling, and the American people deserve better.</p>
<p>When asked if he regretted any of his actions when the U.S. Capitol was violently overrun by his supporters, Trump defended himself and returned to the topic of immigration.</p>
<p>“I had nothing to do with that, other than they asked me to make a speech,” Trump said.</p>
<p>Harris responded: “For everyone watching who remembers what January 6 was, I say ‘We don’t have to go back.’”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Race</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Moderators asked Trump about his <a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2024/07/31/trump-insults-harris-makes-false-claims-quarrels-with-black-journalists-at-conference/" target="_blank">disparaging comments</a> about Harris’ biracial identity to the National Association of Black Journalists last month. Muir questioned if it was appropriate for Trump to weigh in on his opponent’s race.</p>
<p>Trump said it was not appropriate, but seemed to defend the comment that Harris had “turned Black” to promote her political career.</p>
<p>“I don’t care what she is,” he said. “Whatever she wants to be is OK with me. All I can say is that I read where she was not Black, that she put out, and I’ll say that, and then I read that she was Black, and that’s okay. Either one was okay with me. That’s up to her.”</p>
<p>Harris called it “a tragedy” that Trump continued “to use race to divide the American people.”</p>
<p>She invoked allegations that he refused to rent his residential properties to Black families, spread conspiracy theories that the first Black president, Barack Obama, was not born in the United States and supported the execution of Black and Latino boys accused of murder in New York’s Central Park. The suspects were later exonerated.</p>
<p>“The American people want better than that, want better than this,” she said, adding that voters wanted a conversation about how candidates could improve their lives. “Regardless of people’s color or the language their grandmother speaks, we all have the same dreams and aspirations, and want a president who invests in those, not in hate and division.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Abortion and IVF</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The 2024 presidential election is the first since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a 6-3 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.</p>
<p>While Trump told debate moderators that he would not sign a nationwide abortion bill into law, he refused to give a yes or no answer when asked if he would veto one.</p>
<p>Moderator Linsey Davis corrected Trump after he claimed that some states allow abortion “in the ninth month,” but he continued to repeat it throughout the debate.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="qw37QWvj2i"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/13/virginia-democrats-do-not-support-infanticide-but-heres-why-trump-keeps-saying-they-do/">Virginia Democrats do not support infanticide, but here’s why Trump keeps saying they do</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia Democrats do not support infanticide, but here’s why Trump keeps saying they do&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/13/virginia-democrats-do-not-support-infanticide-but-heres-why-trump-keeps-saying-they-do/embed/#?secret=O8snATNWbx#?secret=qw37QWvj2i" data-secret="qw37QWvj2i" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>Trump hailed the Supreme Court justices — three of whom he appointed — for giving full control of abortion laws to state governments.</p>
<p>“What I did is something, for 52 years, they have been trying to get Roe v. Wade into the states, and through the genius and heart and strength of six Supreme Court justices, we were able to do that,” Trump said, adding that he “strongly” believes in exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother.</p>
<p>Harris said she would “proudly” sign a bill into law that restored the federal right to an abortion.</p>
<p>“One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government and Donald Trump certainly should not be telling a woman what to do with her body,” Harris said.</p>
<p>She attacked what she dubbed “Donald Trump’s abortion bans” and said his actions resulted in a reality where couples “who pray and dream of having a family are being denied IVF treatments.”</p>
<p>In vitro fertilization, or IVF, has become a <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2024/02/28/u-s-senate-republican-blocks-legislation-protecting-in-vitro-fertilization/" target="_blank">lightning rod for debate</a> on the right after an Alabama court ruled in early 2024 that frozen embryos counted as children. Legislators in the state have since passed a law to restore IVF access.</p>
<p>Trump said Harris was telling “another lie.”</p>
<p>“I have been a leader on IVF, with which is fertilization, the IVF. I have been a leader,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Taxes, the economy, health care</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>With Trump’s signature 2017 tax law expiring at the end of 2025, tax policy has been front and center of the 2024 presidential race.</p>
<p>Harris trumpeted her plans for an “opportunity economy” and panned Trump’s proposal to raise tariffs and “provide a tax cut for billionaires and big corporations.”</p>
<p>“Donald Trump has no plan for you, and when you look at his economic plan, it’s all about tax breaks for the richest people,” Harris said on the debate stage.</p>
<p>Harris’ proposals include increasing the corporate tax rate to 28%, permanently expanding the child tax credit to pandemic levels and extending up to $6,000 to new parents, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/harris-roll-out-new-plan-tax-relief-small-businesses" target="_blank">providing</a> up to $50,000 in tax relief for business start-up costs, and offering new homebuyers a $25,000 tax credit.</p>
<p>A large part of Trump’s economic plan is to impose universal tariffs of at</p>
<p>least 10% on all U.S. imports, with tariffs on Chinese goods at 60%. When asked by Muir if the approach could cause consumer prices to increase, Trump denied the possibility.</p>
<p>“We’re not going to have higher prices. What’s going to happen, who’s going to have higher prices is China, and all of the countries that have been ripping us off for years,” Trump said.</p>
<p>Trump has promised, at minimum, to extend his tax policies, which cut individual income tax rates, lowered the corporate tax rate to 21%, loosened business expensing and deductions, and doubled the child tax credit to $2,000.</p>
<p>Economists warn that if extended, the Trump-era tax cuts would add trillions to the deficit. That total could reach between $4 trillion and $5.8 trillion over the next decade, <a href="https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2024/8/26/trump-campaign-policy-proposals-2024?te=1&amp;nl=the-morning&amp;emc=edit_nn_20240903" target="_blank">according</a> to the University of Pennsylvania’s Penn Wharton Budget Model. In a separate model, the Tax Foundation <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/donald-trump-tax-plan-2024/" target="_blank">estimated</a> the policies could reduce federal revenue up to $6.1 trillion over a 10-year window.</p>
<p>The Penn Wharton model <a href="https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2024/8/26/harris-campaign-policy-proposals-2024?te=1&amp;nl=the-morning&amp;emc=edit_nn_20240903" target="_blank">estimates</a> Harris’ proposals would increase the deficit by up to $2 trillion over ten years. Modeling from the Tax Foundation released Tuesday <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/kamala-harris-tax-plan-2024/" target="_blank">predicts</a> the vice president’s plan would increase taxes by $4.1 trillion over the next decade, but after accounting for various tax cuts and credits, the projected revenue drops to $1.7 trillion, and even further if slowed economic growth is considered.</p>
<p>On health care, Trump said he had “concepts of a plan” to overhaul the law signed by President Barack Obama in 2010.</p>
<p>“I would only change it if we come up with something that’s better and less expensive,” he said. “And there are concepts and options we have to do that, and you’ll be hearing about it in the not too distant future.”</p>
<p>Harris defended the law known as “Obamacare.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Immigration and border security</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Trump tried several times to steer the conversation to immigration, his signature issue since he began his first White House run in 2015.</p>
<p>He referenced viral — but unverified — stories of sensational disruptions caused by immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, and Aurora, Colorado, and blamed Harris and Biden for the supposed episodes.</p>
<p>“These are the people that she and Biden let into our country,” he said.</p>
<p>Continuing Biden’s immigration policies would turn the country into “Venezuela on steroids,” he said.</p>
<p>Harris laughed after Trump pressed unverified claims about immigration. “Talk about extreme,” she said.</p>
<p>Harris promoted a bipartisan immigration and border security bill this year that included measures Republicans sought to strengthen enforcement. But the bill fell apart, she said, under opposition from Trump, who preferred campaigning on the issue to solving the problem.</p>
<p>When moderators then asked Trump about the bill, he began his answer by bragging about crowds at his campaign rallies, responding to a comment Harris had made.</p>
<p>Rally attendance remained high, he said, “because people want to take their country back.”</p>
<p>“Our country is being lost,” he said. “We’re a failing nation, and it happened three-and-a-half years ago. And what? What’s going on here? … What they have done to our country by allowing these millions and millions of people to come into our country and look at what’s happening to the towns all over the United States.”</p>
<p>He did not answer the question about the bill.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Energy and climate</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Moderators asked Harris about her position on hydraulic fracturing, a technique for extracting natural gas better known as fracking.</p>
<p>The process is controversial among environmentalists, but a major industry in gas-rich Pennsylvania. During her unsuccessful bid for the Democratic nomination in 2020, Harris told a climate activist during a televised town hall that she favored banning fracking, but has said this year that is not her position.</p>
<p>Asked by Davis to explain the change Tuesday night, she said she’s also made clear in 2020 that she did not want to ban fracking.</p>
<p>She also noted her tie-breaking vote in the Senate to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, a massive energy, taxes and domestic policy law Democrats passed along party lines in 2022 that included expanded leases for natural gas production.</p>
<p>Trump urged voters not to believe Harris.</p>
<p>“If she becomes president, fracking in Pennsylvania will end on day one,” he said.</p>
<p>The last question before closing statements was on climate change.</p>
<p>Harris called it a threat and touted the Biden administration’s work to expand the clean energy industry, while preserving natural gas jobs.</p>
<p>Trump declined to answer the question, instead focusing on the work of Hunter Biden, the president’s son, with a Ukrainian energy company. Trump called the Biden administration “corrupt.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Foreign policy</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>As the humanitarian crisis continues in the Gaza Strip with deaths mounting 40,000, according to Gaza health officials, Davis asked Harris how she could break through a stalemate on a proposed cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas militants.</p>
<p>The vice president offered little detail on how to finally broker a deal, but said, “What we know is this war must end.”</p>
<p>“It must end immediately, and the way it will end is we need a cease-fire deal, and we need the hostages out, and so we will continue to work around the clock on that — work around the clock — also understanding that we must chart a course for a two-state solution,” she said.</p>
<p>Harris added that she will “always give Israel the ability to defend itself, in particular as it relates to Iran.”</p>
<p>Trump lashed back with accusations that Harris “hates” Israel and the “Arab population,” and repeated his refrain that “if I were president, (the war) would have never started.”</p>
<p>“I will get that settled and fast, and I’ll get the war with Ukraine and Russia ended. If I’m president-elect, I’ll get it done before even becoming president,” Trump said.</p>
<p>He did not directly answer if he wanted Ukraine to win the war.</p>
<p>“I think it’s in the U.S. best interest to get this war finished and just get it done, negotiate a deal, because we have to stop all of these human lives from being destroyed,” Trump said when asked if a Ukraine victory is in the U.S.’s best interest.</p>
<p>Harris said she would continue to stand with NATO allies on defending Ukraine.</p>
<p>“I believe the reason that Donald Trump says that this war would be over within 24 hours is because he would just give it up. And that’s not who we are as Americans,” she rebutted.</p>
<p>Another foreign policy topic was on display at the U.S. Capitol hours before the debate when congressional leaders held a <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?537990-1/house-speaker-mike-johnson-holds-congressional-medal-ceremony" target="_blank">ceremony</a> honoring 13 service members who were killed during the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Trump and Republican lawmakers have ratcheted up criticism of Harris — implicating her hundreds of times in a damning <a href="https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WILLFULL-BLINDNESS-An-Assessment-of-the-Biden-Harris%20Administrations-Withdrawal-from-Afghanistan-and-the-Chaos-that-Followed.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> released Monday — for the Biden administration’s handling of the August 2021 exit from Afghanistan after two decades of war.</p>
<p>“I will tell you I agreed with President Biden’s decision to pull out of Afghanistan. Four presidents said they would, and Joe Biden did,” Harris told Muir when asked if she bears any responsibility for the deadly withdrawal.</p>
<p>Harris criticized Trump for “negotiating directly with a terrorist organization” when he struck a deal with the Taliban before he left office.</p>
<p>Trump defended himself saying “I got involved with the Taliban because the Taliban was doing the killing” and said he achieved a “very good agreement.”</p>
<p>Trump made waves on the recent third anniversary of the 13 service members’ deaths when his staffers pushed an Arlington National Cemetery official aside to take photos in a restricted area, according to the U.S. Army and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/27/nx-s1-5091154/trump-arlington-cemetery" target="_blank">reporting</a> by NPR.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Swift endorsement</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Shortly after the debate’s close, mega star Taylor Swift said in an Instagram post she would vote for Harris.</p>
<p>Part of Swift’s exuberant fan base had called on her to endorse Harris, following her support for Biden and Harris four years ago.</p>

<p>“Laying out a coherent economic policy agenda that will resonate with Latinos … would go a long way, I think, for our community,” Janet Murguía, the president and CEO of UnidosUS, said on a call with reporters detailing the <a href="https://unidosus.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Natl-deck-UnidosUS-2024-Pre-Election-Poll-of-Hispanic-Electorate.pdf" target="_blank">results of the survey.</a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://unidosus.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/National-crosstabs-UnidosUS-2024-Pre-Election-Poll-of-the-Hispanic-Electorate.pdf" target="_blank">survey included 3,000 eligible Hispanic voters</a> who were interviewed in either English or Spanish, from Aug. 5-23, with oversampling of residents of Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Florida, Texas and California. The poll, conducted by BSP Research, had a margin of error of plus or minus 1.8 percentage points.</p>
<p>Murguía said Latinos are the second-largest voting-age population and 1 in 5 of them will be casting ballots for the first time in a presidential election this November.</p>
<p>“Top of mind are pocketbook issues,” she said. “Hispanic voters are most deeply concerned, like many of their fellow Americans, about the rising cost of living.”</p>
<p>Another issue that Latinos strongly supported is access to abortion. By a 71% to 21% margin, Latinos oppose abortion bans, according to the survey.</p>
<p>“They do not support making it illegal,” Murguía said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Minimum-wage workers</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Wages and jobs that provide economic security are a top priority for Latino voters, Gary Segura, who conducted the research poll for UnidosUS, said.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/swa-wages-2022/#:~:text=Low%2Dwage%20workers%20are%20disproportionately%20women%20and%20Black%20and%20Hispanic" target="_blank">Latino workers are disproportionately workers</a> who earn the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, which has not increased since 2009. If the federal minimum wage had kept pace with inflation, it would be around $24 an hour, <a href="https://aflcio.org/what-unions-do/social-economic-justice/minimum-wage#:~:text=Since%20then%2C%20it%20has%20lost,would%20be%20%2424%20an%20hour." target="_blank">according to the AFL-CIO.</a></p>
<p>“The lived economy for Latinos is different than the lived economy for the nation as a whole,” Segura said.</p>
<p>Segura said during the poll, interviewers followed up with respondents on their concerns about jobs and wages and found that being able to afford necessities like food and housing were top issues.</p>
<p>“People are struggling to make ends meet,” he said.</p>
<p>The number one response was that “jobs don’t pay enough, or I have to take a second job to make ends meet,” Segura said. “We talk a lot about the low levels of unemployment in this society now, which is certainly good news, but the issue is that many of those jobs do not pay enough for the holder of that job to essentially pay their basic living expenses.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Opinions on immigration</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Murguía noted that immigration, which the Republican presidential nominee, former President Donald Trump, has made a core campaign issue, ranks fifth in priorities among Latino voters, tied with concern about gun violence and too-easy access to assault weapons.</p>
<p>“We want to be crystal clear that Latino voters overall are not buying into campaign tactics that demonize immigrants,” Murguía said. “They know the difference between those who mean us harm and those who are contributing to the fabric of our nation.”</p>
<p>Latino voters strongly support a legal pathway to citizenship for those in the  Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, referred to as Dreamers, and for long-term undocumented immigrants, the survey found.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-promises-mass-deportations-undocumented-people-how-would-work" target="_blank">Trump has promised mass deportations</a> should he win a second term, a policy issue that has “virtually no support” by Latino voters sampled in the survey, Segura said.</p>
<p>Segura added that while Trump has campaigned on the issue, his promise to launch mass deportations is not particularly well known in Latino communities.</p>
<p>“Many of the people we speak to believe that (Trump) will do it if he can, but they just don’t actually believe that he can pull that off,” Segura said. “So there’s both a lack of awareness of these really draconian measures or proposals and then a lack of belief that they would actually come to pass.”</p>
<p>He added that he thinks it’s an opportunity for Democrats to campaign on the issue, but Vice President Kamala Harris has mainly criticized Trump for tanking a bipartisan border security deal.</p>
<p>“Our own results suggest that the primary border concern comes from voters who lean in the GOP direction in the first place, and so I don’t see a lot of movement there or a lot of risk for (Democrats), particularly in targeted advertisements and Hispanic voters,” Segura said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Dismissive and diminishing language’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The poll found that 55% of those Latinos had not been contacted by either political party this year.</p>
<p>“We often hear a really dismissive and diminishing language about Latino participation in elections,” Segura said. “‘Latinos don’t vote as often as they should. Latinos will let you down’ and so forth, and no one ever wants to address the elephant in the room, which is that no one is asking Latinos to vote.”</p>
<p>The Harris campaign last month launched a bilingual WhatsApp campaign to target Latino voters. Michelle Villegas, the national Latino engagement director for the Harris campaign, said during a Hispanic Caucus meeting at the Democratic National Convention that <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/harris-campaign-launches-bilingual-whatsapp-channel-draw-latino-voters-swing-states" target="_blank">the Latino vote is key to victory in three battleground states</a> — Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The survey also found that running mates had an impact on Latino voters. Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, gave her a 3-point boost, Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, made his rating drop by 3 points.</p>
<p>“Vance has (a) negative impact on the Republican ticket, which is consistent with his low favorability among Latino voters,” according to the survey.</p>
<p>While Democrats have an advantage with Latino voters, and Harris has seen a boost in support compared to when President Joe Biden was in the race, she is still not reaching the levels of Latino support seen in previous elections, Clarissa Martinez De Castro, the vice president of the Latino Vote Initiative at UnidosUS, said.</p>
<p>“There is work to be done to reach the levels of support Democrats need and had achieved in previous elections, and more intense communication with these voters is needed, particularly on economic issues and immigration,” Martinez De Castro said.<br />
Equis Research, which conducts research and polling specifically about Latino voters, <a href="https://www.weareequis.us/research/xssaug2024bgmemo" target="_blank">found in a recent poll t</a>hat Harris has gained significant support from Latinos but that Harris “remains a few points shy of what Biden received in 2020” across battleground states.</p>

(Spencer Platt/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday slashed the Biden administration’s latest efforts to provide student debt relief to millions of borrowers to go forward while the appeals process unfolds.</p>
<p>The Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan provided lower monthly loan payments for borrowers and lessened the time it takes to pay off their debt. The program came shortly after <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2023/06/supreme-court-strikes-down-biden-student-loan-forgiveness-program/" target="_blank">the Supreme Court struck down</a> an earlier student loan forgiveness plan from the administration in June 2023 that would have canceled more than $400 billion in debt.</p>
<p>But the SAVE plan was quickly met with a wave of legal challenges from a coalition of GOP-led states in two lawsuits stemming from Missouri and Kansas.</p>
<p>Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, North Dakota, Ohio and Oklahoma filed a <a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2024/04/09/missouri-attorney-general-leads-coalition-challenging-biden-student-debt-relief/" target="_blank">federal lawsuit</a> alongside Missouri in April against the administration over the plan.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court on Wednesday allowed an August ruling from the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/09/politics/student-loan-repayment-plan-court-blocks/index.html" target="_blank">U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit</a> that temporarily halted the plan to remain in effect. The appellate decision followed a federal judge in Missouri <a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2024/06/25/federal-rulings-out-of-kansas-missouri-put-biden-student-loan-forgiveness-on-hold/" target="_blank">issuing a preliminary injunction</a> blocking the plan in late June.</p>
<p>In its decision, the nation’s highest court said it expects the 8th Circuit to “render its decision with appropriate dispatch.”</p>
<p>Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey praised the Supreme Court’s decision in a <a href="https://ago.mo.gov/supreme-court-upholds-attorney-general-baileys-court-order-blocking-biden-harris-student-loan-scheme/" target="_blank">statement</a> Wednesday, calling it a “huge win for every American who still believes in paying their own way.”</p>
<p>On the other hand, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Education said “we are disappointed in this decision, particularly because lifting the injunction would have allowed for lower payments and other benefits for borrowers across the country,” per a statement shared with States Newsroom.</p>
<p>The spokesperson said the department “will work to minimize further harm and disruption to borrowers as we await a final decision from the Eighth Circuit,” adding that “the Biden-Harris Administration remains committed to supporting borrowers and will continue to fight for the most affordable repayment options for millions of people across the country.”</p>
<p>In a statement, Mike Pierce, executive director of the Student Borrower Protection Center, said “in rejecting this appeal, the Supreme Court perpetuates the 8th Circuit’s bogus legal fiction that pausing affordable payments is ‘preserving the status quo.’”</p>
<p>“This is ludicrous. Millions of people were repaying their student loans. Now they are in limbo,” Pierce added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kansas, Alabama, Alaska, Idaho, Iowa, Louisiana, Montana, Nebraska, South Carolina, Texas and Utah also <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2024/03/28/kobach-files-lawsuit-challenging-bidens-latest-effort-to-diminish-college-student-loan-debt/" target="_blank">filed a lawsuit over the plan</a> in March.</p>
<p>A federal judge in Kansas dismissed eight of those states — allowing only Alaska, South Carolina and Texas to move forward with their challenge — and issued a preliminary injunction.</p>
<p>In late June, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit allowed parts of the SAVE plan to go forward — forcing Alaska, South Carolina and Texas to <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A11/316401/20240705173618326_Alaska%20v%20Cardona%20Application%20to%20Vacate%20Stay%20final.pdf" target="_blank">file an emergency request</a> to the Supreme Court to vacate the stay.</p>
<p>But the Supreme Court rejected this attempt from the states’ attorneys general on Wednesday, saying that “applicants represent that they do not require emergency relief from this Court as long as the Eighth Circuit’s injunction … is in place.”</p>

(Photo by Leon Neal/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — “Mass deportation now!” is a catchphrase for the Trump presidential campaign, as the Republican nominee proposes a crackdown on immigration that would oust thousands of undocumented people.</p>
<p>Often citing a deportation operation enacted by former President Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s, former President Donald Trump has repeatedly vowed in campaign rallies that he plans to not only go back to the tough immigration policies of his first term in office, but expand them greatly.</p>
<p>“We’re going to have the largest deportation,” Trump said at a June campaign rally in Racine, Wisconsin. “We have no choice.”</p>
<p>The crowd responded with a chant: “Send them back. Send them back. Send them back.”</p>
<p>Mass deportation would be a broad, multipronged effort under Trump’s vision. The plan includes invoking an 18th-century law; reshuffling law enforcement at federal agencies; transferring funds within programs in the Department of Homeland Security; and forcing greater enforcement of immigration laws.</p>
<p>But whether a Trump administration could accomplish a mass deportation is doubtful. Historians, lawyers and immigration and economic experts interviewed by States Newsroom said removal of the more than 11 million undocumented people in the country would require enormous amounts of resources and overcoming legal hurdles. The effects on the U.S. economic and social fabric would be profound, they said.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it will happen,” Donald Kerwin, a senior researcher on migration at the University of Notre Dame, said of mass deportations. “But what it can do is it can make the lives of the undocumented and their families miserable.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">GOP support</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Trump repeatedly has pledged mass deportation.</p>
<p>At the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee in July, delegates waved “Mass Deportation Now” signs as Trump said “to keep our families safe, the Republican platform promises to launch the largest deportation operation in the history of our country.”</p>
<p>In a March rally in Dayton, Ohio, Trump said some undocumented immigrants were not “people.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know if you call them people,” Trump said. “In some cases they’re not people, in my opinion, but I’m not allowed to say that because the radical left says that’s a terrible thing to say.”</p>
<p>Trump’s campaign message comes as the Biden administration has dealt with the largest number of migrant encounters at the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/11/09/whats-happening-at-the-u-s-mexico-border-in-7-charts/" target="_blank">southern border in 20 years</a> and immigration <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/611135/immigration-surges-top-important-problem-list.aspx" target="_blank">remains a top issue for voters. </a></p>
<p>However, since President Joe Biden signed a recent executive order, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna159777" target="_blank">border crossings have fallen to their lowest level since he took office. </a></p>
<p>The GOP and Trump have now set their sights on the Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>House Republicans already <a href="https://mainemorningstar.com/2024/07/25/six-u-s-house-dems-join-gop-in-condemning-harris-biden-administration-over-border-policy/" target="_blank">led a resolution disapproving </a>of Harris’ handling of the southern border and labeling her the “Border Czar,” a title she was given by the media. Her campaign has argued she never had such an official title  and her involvement with immigration has been focused on root causes of migration in Central and South America, rather than domestic immigration.</p>
<p>Even though Biden is no longer in the race, and has undertaken his own crackdown on immigration, he warned in mid-June, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-unveil-protections-some-undocumented-spouses-easier-daca-work-visas" target="_blank">during an announcement of protections offered for the spouses of long-term undocumented people</a>, that Trump would undertake mass deportations.</p>
<p>“Now he’s proposing to rip spouses and children from their families and homes and communities and place them in detention camps,” <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?536470-1/president-biden-announces-plan-undocumented-spouses-daca-anniversary" target="_blank">Biden said</a> of Trump. “He’s actually saying these things out loud, and it’s outrageous.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How does the public feel?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Polls have found Americans are split on the idea of mass deportations but Republicans are more supportive.</p>
<p>A recent <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/poll-trump-biden-neck-and-neck-06-09-2024/" target="_blank">CBS News poll</a> that found nearly 6 in 10 voters favor a new government agency that would deport all undocumented immigrants. Of those voters, one-third were Democrats and 9 in 10 were Republicans.</p>
<p>The Trump campaign did not respond to multiple requests from States Newsroom for comment on the specifics of how a second Trump administration would plan to carry out mass deportations.</p>
<p>The massive deportation campaign that Trump often cites in his campaign rallies was conducted under the Eisenhower administration in the summer of 1954, with a pejorative, racist name attached to it.</p>
<p>“Following the Eisenhower model, we will carry out the largest domestic deportation operation in American history,” Trump said at a September rally last year in Ankeny, Iowa.</p>
<p>But what the Trump campaign is proposing is not an Eisenhower-style crackdown, said Michael Clemens, a professor in the Department of Economics at George Mason University.</p>
<p>“That policy was instituted hand-in-hand with a crucial other arm of the policy,” he said — which was that lawful work pathways for Mexicans to the U.S. were nearly tripled at the same time as the mass deportations.</p>
<p>“We’ve heard zero about substantial increases in lawful migration pathways from the people who are now talking about an Eisenhower-style crackdown,” Clemens said. “What they’re proposing is not an Eisenhower-style crackdown — it is something that the Eisenhower administration understood would not work and therefore it did not do.”</p>
<p>Additionally, the Eisenhower program was not as successful as thought.</p>
<p>The Einshower administration <a href="https://history.house.gov/Exhibitions-and-Publications/HAIC/Historical-Essays/Separate-Interests/Depression-War-Civil-Rights/" target="_blank">claimed that it deported 1 million people</a> back to Mexico, but the real number is a couple hundred thousand, said Eladio Bobadilla, an assistant history professor at the University of Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t really about getting rid of immigrants in any real sense,” he said. “It was a way to sell to the American public that the problem had been solved.”</p>
<p>While one agency of the Eisenhower administration was deporting Mexicans — and often U.S. citizens of Mexican descent — another agency was sometimes bringing those same workers back in through the so-called Bracero program, which was created through <a href="https://prologue.blogs.archives.gov/2023/09/27/the-bracero-program-prelude-to-cesar-chavez-and-the-farm-worker-movement/#:~:text=The%20Bracero%20Program%20was%20a,lasted%20from%201942%20to%201964." target="_blank">an executive order by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt</a> in 1942.</p>
<p>States and local governments also worked in tandem with the 1950s deportation operation, something unlikely to happen under a second Trump administration, said David Bier, the director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.</p>
<p>“You also had the cooperation of the employers in those areas, because the Eisenhower administration was totally explicit that all the people that we’re deporting, you’re gonna get workers back legally through the Bracero guest worker program,” said Bier.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Obama deportation</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The most recent mass deportation campaign came during the Obama administration, said Clemens, who studies the economic effects of migration.</p>
<p>That was the Secure Communities program, which was a set of agreements between local law enforcement and federal level immigration enforcement officials such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection. Localities shared information about noncitizens who were encountered by local law enforcement, such as at traffic stops.</p>
<p>“Our most recent experience with mass deportation at the federal level, mostly under the Obama administration, directly harmed U.S. workers,” Clemens said.</p>
<p>The program was slowly rolled out, from 2008 to 2014, but over those six years nearly half a million workers were deported.</p>
<p>For every 10 workers who were deported, one U.S. job was eliminated, Clemens said.</p>
<p>“The net effect is that Secure Communities cost jobs for Americans across the country,” he said.</p>
<p><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/233150241700500101" target="_blank">In a recent paper for the Center for Migration Studies of New York,</a> Kerwin and Robert Warren found that mass deportations would financially harm U.S. families, especially the more than 3 million mixed-status families.</p>
<p>“The household income in those households plunges, and drops all of these families, or a high percentage of them, into poverty,” Kerwin said.</p>
<p>Of those mixed-status families, meaning some family members have different citizenship or immigration status, about 6.6 million members are U.S. citizens, said Warren, a senior visiting fellow at the center, a think tank that studies domestic and international migration patterns.</p>
<p>“So you say, ‘We took out one undocumented immigrant,’ but you damaged a family of U.S. citizens,” Warren said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Expanded executive authority</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The early architects of the Trump administration’s immigration policies such as Steven Miller and Ken Cuccinelli have laid out a second term that would expand the use of executive authority to carry out mass deportations and curtail legal immigration.</p>
<p>Such policies include limiting humanitarian visas and parole and moving to end Temporary Protected Status, known as TPS, said ManoLasya Perepa, policy and practice counsel with the American Immigration Lawyers Association.</p>
<p>Like the first Trump administration, Perepa anticipates that there will be a slew of lawsuits to file injunctions, such as preventing the ending of TPS.</p>
<p>The Trump administration dealt with a flurry of lawsuits over an order to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which protects a little over half a million undocumented people brought into the United States as children without authorization.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court eventually blocked it and kept the program, but DACA is still at risk of being deemed unlawful in a separate suit that is <a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2023/01/29/lengthy-timeline-for-daca-legal-fight-puts-lives-on-hold-for-years/" target="_blank">likely to head again to the high court. </a></p>
<p>“I think anybody with a status that keeps getting renewed is really, really at risk,” she said. “All you’re doing is driving people into the shadows.”</p>
<p>With the courts likely to get involved, Trump has said he wants to go back to his policy that expanded expedited removals, which means if an undocumented person is in the country for two years without a court hearing or any type of authorization, they can be deported without a hearing before a judge.</p>
<p>That type of removal is limited to 100 miles from a border zone, but the Trump administration expanded that to the rest of the country.</p>
<p>“The reality is, if the (Trump) administration increases interior enforcement, technically, all of these people could be detained,” Perepa said.</p>
<p>The Migration Policy Institute, a think tank that researches migration, <a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/trump-deportations-unfinished-mission" target="_blank">has estimated</a> that “the expansion of expedited removal to the U.S. interior could apply to as many as 288,000 people.”</p>
<p>Miller, a senior White House adviser during the Trump administration, said on the right-wing podcast “The Charlie Kirk Show” in November 2023 that the U.S. military would need to be involved for those mass deportations to Mexico, which is “why Trump has talked about invoking the Alien Enemies Act.”</p>
<p>“Because of the logistical challenges involved in removing…you would need to build an extremely large holding area for illegal immigrants that at any given points in time, you know, could hold upwards of 50, 60, 70,000 illegal aliens while you are waiting to send them someplace, somewhere that would be willing to accept them,” Miller said.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/alien-and-sedition-acts" target="_blank">The Alien and Sedition Act, an 18th-century wartime law</a>, allows the executive branch to deport any noncitizen from a country that the U.S. is at war with and deport any noncitizen deemed dangerous.</p>
<p>The law can also be used for extraordinary measures that are not deportation, including the last time it was invoked after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. <a href="https://www.archives.gov/research/immigration/enemy-aliens/ww2" target="_blank">It led to the internment camps</a> of more than 120,000 people of Japanese descent, more than half of whom were U.S. citizens, as well as German and Italian nationals, during World War II.</p>
<p>Trump has vowed to use a title within the Alien and Sedition Acts to target drug dealers, gang members and cartel members.</p>
<p>“I will invoke the Alien Enemy Act, to remove all known or suspected gang members from the United States ending the scourge of illegal alien gang violence once and for all,” Trump said at a campaign stop in Reno, Nevada.</p>
<p>Cuccinelli, a former attorney general of Virginia and acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services during the Trump administration, wrote the policy section for the Department of Homeland Security for <a href="https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf" target="_blank">the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025</a> – a conservative “battle plan” for the next Republican president.</p>
<p>In that section, he laid out recommendations for an incoming Republican administration to curtail the use of temporary work visas for workers in agriculture, construction and hospitality; prevent U.S. citizens from qualifying for federal housing subsidies if they live with someone who is a noncitizen; and require driver’s license information to be shared with federal authorities; among other policies.</p>
<p>The Heritage Foundation did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Punishing states</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In a lengthy interview Trump conducted<a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2024/04/30/trump-says-hed-use-police-national-guard-and-possibly-the-military-to-expel-immigrants/" target="_blank"> with Time magazine</a>, he said he would withhold federal funding from states and local governments that don’t cooperate in deportation proceedings.</p>
<p>That could violate the 10th Amendment in the Constitution, said Mae Ngai, a historian and Asian American studies professor at Columbia University.</p>
<p>“States and municipalities cannot be coerced to enforcing federal laws,” she said, adding that immigration law is a federal matter. “You cannot force the police department or sheriffs … to pick up immigrants.”</p>
<p>State and local cooperation in detaining immigrants could be a challenge, said Julia Gelatt, associate director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute.</p>
<p>Legal challenges make it costly for local law enforcement to detain people solely to wait for immigration proceedings, and many local governments have decided not to hold people beyond their criminal detentions.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Funding issues</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Deploying the military for immigration enforcement and constructing detention camps would also come with a large price tag.</p>
<p>Those large expenses would have to be approved by Congress, which may not be a willing partner.</p>
<p>There are ways to get around the legislative branch, such as reshuffling money within the Department of Homeland Security, but they come with downsides, Bier of the Cato Institute said.</p>
<p>“That’s politically risky because if there’s any kind of natural disaster, and you’re using money to deport people that can have some big blowbacks in the affected areas,” he said.</p>
<p>The Trump administration did this in 2019, <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2019/08/27/dhs-reprogram-and-transfer-271-million-support-humanitarian-and-security-emergency" target="_blank">when it transferred $271 million</a> from the Federal Emergency Management Association to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. It also transferred $23.8 million from the Transportation Security Administration to ICE.</p>
<p>Trump could also reassign law enforcement agencies to tackle immigration enforcement, Bier said, but he would face pushback from affected agencies that have their own priorities.</p>
<p>“They’re not going to want to cooperate with just giving up on everything they’re trying to do,” Bier said.</p>

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)</p><p>CHICAGO — Vice President Kamala Harris accepted her party’s nomination for president Thursday evening, pitching her candidacy as an opportunity for the nation to move forward, rather than accept a dark future she said would follow a second election of her Republican opponent.</p>
<p>Harris on the last night of the Democratic National Convention took advantage of the largest television audience she’s likely to have at least until her first debate with Republican nominee Donald Trump next month.</p>
<p>The vice president told her life story to the millions of Americans watching, saying it informed her agenda meant to boost the country’s’ middle class.</p>
<p>She characterized herself as a lifelong public servant and unifier, in contrast to what she described as Trump’s divisive self-centeredness.</p>
<p>“My entire career, I have only had one client: the people,” she said. “And so, on behalf of the people, on behalf of every American, regardless of party, race, gender, or the language your grandmother speaks, on behalf of my mother and everyone who has ever set out  on their own unlikely journey, … on behalf of everyone whose story could only be written in the greatest nation on Earth, I accept your nomination for president of the United States of America.”</p>
<p>She professed her patriotism several times in her roughly 40-minute address. Near the close, she urged the Democrats in the arena and viewers at home to work for her election on behalf of the country.</p>
<p>“Let’s get out there and let’s fight for it,” she said “Let us write the next great chapter in the most extraordinary story ever told.”</p>
<p>Americans across the nation made their assessments. Yvette Young, a lifelong Philadelphia resident and project manager at SEPTA who attended a watch party at a Harris campaign office, said she thought it was an excellent speech and comprehensive.</p>
<p>“She touched on, I think, every issue,” Young said. “She wasn’t afraid to call Donald Trump out on his nonsense and put into perspective how he has harmed our country.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A middle-class childhood</h4>

	
<p>Harris has downplayed the historic nature of her candidacy — she is the first Black and South Asian woman to lead a major party ticket and would be the first woman president of any race — but expanded Thursday on the values her immigrant mother instilled in her.</p>
<p>Her mother, a scientist from India, “was tough, courageous, a trailblazer in the fight for women’s health,” she said.</p>
<p>Harris described her upbringing as middle class, saying she was raised mainly by her mom after her parents divorced. Harris’ father was a Jamaican student who met her mother at a civil rights meeting, Harris said Thursday.</p>
<p>The vice president promised to be a middle-class champion, creating what she called “an opportunity economy” that would unite labor, small businesses and workers. Additionally, she pledged to “end America’s housing shortage,” to lower the cost of everyday needs.</p>
<p>Ahead of the convention, Harris<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/harris-unveils-plan-curb-price-gouging-boost-child-tax-credit-tackle-rent-hikes" target="_blank"> unveiled policy details</a> to stop price gouging, boost the child tax credit, curb rent hikes and help first-time homebuyers.</p>
<p>“We know a strong middle class has always been critical to America’s success,” she said. “And building that middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. This is personal to me. The middle class is where I come from.”</p>
<p>Her remarks were applauded by another person at the watch party, Lindsay Davis, a Germantown resident and UX designer.</p>
<p>Davis believes that there’s a particular issue that Harris can talk about that can sway undecided voters.</p>
<p>“A lot of the stuff she’s already said about making it easier for first-time homebuyers to buy a house that was, like, huge,” she said. “I think that’s really big for, like, younger people that aren’t boomers, I guess Gen Z, Gen X, Gen whatever, all the Gens.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A sense of justice</h4>

	
<p>Harris’s mother also taught her daughters “never to complain about injustice, but to do something about it,” she said, repeating a line former first lady Michelle Obama used throughout a Tuesday speech.</p>
<p>She said the same sense of justice motivated her to become a prosecutor, which she did as the district attorney of San Francisco and attorney general of California before her election to the U.S. Senate in 2016.</p>
<p>As the top lawyer in California, Harris won a $20 billion settlement for homeowners in the state as part of a nationwide lawsuit against banks over predatory lending during the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
<p>North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, who was also his state’s attorney general at the time, said Thursday in remarks just before Harris spoke that he saw her demand much more than what the banks initially offered.</p>
<p>“America, we’ve got a lot of big fights ahead of us,” he said. “And we’ve got one hell of a fighter ready to take them on.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump’s ‘dark agenda’</h4>

	
<p>Harris described much of her policy objectives in contrast to her opponent, the former president seeking another term, Trump.</p>
<p>While her administration would work to expand reproductive rights, Trump would further restrict them, she said.</p>
<p>Trump would pursue a nationwide abortion ban “with or without Congress,” limit access to birth control and require women to report miscarriages, she said.</p>
<p>“Why is it that they don’t trust women?” she asked the packed United Center crowd. “Well, we trust women.”</p>
<p>She said if she is elected, and Congress passes a bill restoring the Roe v. Wade abortion decision, she will sign it into law. For that to happen, Democrats would likely need to not only control both chambers, but also have 60 votes in the Senate.</p>
<p>On foreign policy, Harris said Trump wouldn’t stand up to dictators, “because he wants to be an autocrat himself.”</p>
<p>She described November’s election as a “fight for America’s future.”</p>
<p>The crowd broke out in a chant: “We’re not going back.”</p>
<p>She also asked the audience to imagine how dangerous Trump would be in office after a July 1 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that said Trump could not be prosecuted for most actions he took in office.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Second woman candidate</h4>

	
<p>Harris addressed a packed crowd in which many women wore white, a nod to the women’s suffrage movement.</p>
<p>Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who gave a speech Monday, was the first woman to accept the presidential nomination of a major party at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, when she gave her acceptance speech in a white pantsuit.</p>
<p>But Harris dressed head to toe in black.</p>
<p>She took the stage to Beyoncé’s “Freedom,” a song the campaign has <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/black-women-quickly-mobilize-boost-kamala-harris-presidential-bid" target="_blank">made its anthem.</a> Beyoncé, however, did not appear in person, despite widespread rumors she would show up.</p>
<p>After Harris’ speech, what Democratic officials said were 100,000 red, white and blue balloons were released, a convention tradition. Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and his wife, Gwen Walz, held hands onstage and acknowledged the cheers of the delegates.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Unexpected’ path to nomination</h4>

	
<p>Harris acknowledged her abbreviated path to the nomination, which began just 32 days ago, was highly unusual.</p>
<p>After President Joe Biden dropped his reelection bid and endorsed Harris on July 21, the party quickly coalesced around the vice president.</p>
<p>She racked up the necessary delegates and after a short vetting period tapped Walz. They soon hit the campaign trail in the seven key battleground states – Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Throughout the whirlwind, she has praised Biden for his leadership and accomplishments.</p>
<p>She did again in the opening lines of her speech Thursday.</p>
<p>“Your record is extraordinary, as history will show,” she said. “And your character is inspiring.”</p>
<p>Republicans have criticized the process that led to Harris’ nomination, calling it a “coup” against Biden.</p>
<p>In a written statement ahead of Harris’ address Thursday, Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley repeated that claim and slammed Harris’ policy proposals as “the most radical agenda ever put forward at a major party convention.”</p>
<p>“After staging a coup to take the nomination from Joe Biden just weeks ago, Kamala Harris will take the stage at the DNC to share her dangerously liberal agenda with the Democrats gathered to coronate her in Chicago,” he said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Convention capstone</h4>

	
<p>Harris’ acceptance marked the end of a four-day convention focused on the theme of passing the torch to the next generation that was woven through the speeches of long-established Democrats in the party, such as former President Bill Clinton, who said he <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/bill-clinton-urges-democrats-work-harris-president-joy" target="_blank">loved “seeing all these young leaders.”</a></p>
<p>On the first night, Biden, who dropped out of the race last month, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-delivers-late-night-farewell-democrats-he-passes-torch-harris" target="_blank">delivered a farewell address to Democrats</a>, endorsing Harris. The Obamas Tuesday made the <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/hope-making-comeback-obamas-make-case-kamala-harris" target="_blank">case for Harris,</a> saying in her candidacy, “hope is making a comeback.”</p>
<p>As Harris gave her speech aimed at defining her candidacy and vision for the country as one of freedom and joy, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/frustrated-uncommitted-delegates-push-palestinian-american-speaker-dnc-nears-end" target="_blank">a sit-in protest occurred outside the United Center.</a> Dozens of Uncommitted delegates who advocated for a Palestinian American to have a speaking slot at the DNC said they had their request denied by the Harris campaign.</p>
<p>Inside the arena, Harris said negotiating an end to the war, with a return of Israeli hostages and a lasting cease-fire, was a top administration priority.</p>
<p>“President Biden and I are working to end this war, such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity,” she said.</p>
<p>At the watch party in Philadelphia, Alina Taylor, a special education teacher who lives in Upper Dublin, said as a Democratic committee person for her area, she plans to volunteer and canvass for the Harris campaign.</p>
<p>“I came down here because I’m fired up and I’m ready to go,” she said.</p>
<p>She said prior to Harris’ speech that she wants to hear her talk about the economy and what she plans on doing about reproductive rights.</p>
<p>“That’s so huge, because I want my daughters to have more rights than me, and I don’t want them to have less,” she said.</p>

</p><p>CHICAGO — Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz accepted the Democratic nomination for vice president Wednesday, showcasing his appeal on the third night of the Democratic National Convention as a candidate who can fuse a middle-class image to a fairly progressive record and effectively attack the Republican alternative.</p>
<p>A native of a small town in Nebraska, Walz is a former high school teacher, coach and Army National Guardsman whom presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris chose just a little more than two weeks ago as her running mate.</p>
<p>In his speech to delegates packed into the United Center, an introduction to millions of Americans, Walz made the case that Democrats’ policies were the ones more consistent with heartland values than those of Republicans, led by the presidential ticket of former President Donald Trump and Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance.</p>
<p>“This is a big part about what this election is about: freedom,” he said.</p>
<p>Republicans invoke freedom to pass restrictions on reproductive rights, allow corporations to pollute and permit banks to take advantage of customers, he said.</p>
<p>“But when we Democrats talk about freedom, we mean the freedom to make a better life for yourself and the people that you love, to make your own health care decisions, your kids to go to school without worrying about being shot dead,” he said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Coach Walz</h4>

	
<p>A night after former President Barack Obama attested to Walz’s authentic style by lightly mocking his worn flannel shirts, other speakers sought to brandish Walz’s image as a stereotypically sensible Upper Midwesterner.</p>
<p>Minnesota’s senior Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Benjamin Ingman, a former student and next-door neighbor of Walz’s, introduced the vice-presidential candidate.</p>
<p>“Tim Walz is the kind of the guy you can count on to push you out of a snowbank,” Ingman said, referring to the neighborly chore of freeing a vehicle stuck after a heavy snow. “I know this because Tim Walz pushed me out of a snowbank.”</p>
<p>While Ingman spoke, former members of Walz-coached football teams took the stage, wearing red-and-white Mankato West High School football jerseys.</p>
<p>Klobuchar praised Walz’s progressive policy wins as governor — signing laws to guarantee paid leave, provide school meals and cut taxes for families.</p>
<p>She also made note of Walz’s folksy appeal and humble background that is unusual at the highest levels of U.S. politics.</p>
<p>“A former football coach knows how to level the playing field,” Klobuchar said. “And a former public school teacher knows how to school the likes of J.D. Vance.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Freedom theme</h4>

	
<p>Walz argued that Democrats sought to expand freedom, a central theme of the Harris campaign, while Republicans worked to limit rights.</p>
<p>He mentioned fertility treatments, which he and his wife, Gwen, used to conceive their two children. After the U.S. Supreme Court repealed the nationwide right to an abortion, some Republicans have also opposed in vitro fertilization, a common fertility treatment. Gwen Walz clarified this week that the Walzes used a different fertility treatment that is not as controversial with anti-abortion advocates.</p>
<p>Still, Walz said the pain of infertility was “hell,” and in an emotional moment, he acknowledged Gwen and children Hope and Gus in the crowd, telling them they were his “entire world.”</p>
<p>The crowd cheered as the Walz family’s emotion-filled faces appeared on the screens in the United Center.</p>
<p>Walz promoted his record as governor, including the free school meals program and an expansion of reproductive rights, and framed them as in line with traditional American values.</p>
<p>“While other states were banning books from their schools, we were banishing hunger from ours,” he said. “We also protected reproductive freedom because in Minnesota, we respect our neighbors and the choices they make. Even if we wouldn’t make those same choices for ourselves, we’ve got a golden rule: Mind your own damn business.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Project 2025</h4>

	
<p>Walz blasted the Republican agenda, including the 900-plus page proposal published by the conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation.</p>
<p>Republicans, including the Trump campaign, have sought to distance themselves from the document, which includes several provisions that Democrats have been eager to criticize.</p>
<p>Walz said it showed Republicans would gut Social Security and Medicare, repeal the popular health care law known as Obamacare and restrict abortion nationwide.</p>
<p>He characterized Republicans as out of touch, extreme and — and he has for weeks — weird.</p>
<p>“It’s an agenda that served nobody except the richest and the most extreme amongst us, and it’s an agenda that does nothing for our neighbors in need,” he said. “Is it weird? Absolutely.”</p>
<p>Walz sought to position Democrats as the party of common sense, including on guns.</p>
<p>As a veteran and hunter, Walz was familiar with guns and supportive of gun rights. But he suggested there must be limits that many Republicans do not accept.</p>
<p>“I believe in the Second Amendment,” he said. “But I also believe our first responsibility is to keep our kids safe.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Call to action</h4>

	
<p>As president, he said, Harris would lower middle-class taxes, rein in drug costs and “stand up and fight for your freedom to live the life that you want to lead.”</p>
<p>Using another mainstay of his campaign speeches, Walz urged the Democratic delegates in the audience to work tirelessly until Election Day.</p>
<p>Walz’s acceptance pumped up the group of Democratic delegates from Minnesota, who stayed for roughly 30 minutes after the program ended on the United Center floor chanting “U-S-A,” “Harris-Walz,” “Minnesota” and other cheers.</p>
<p>In another ode to his state, musicians John Legend and Sheila E. performed “Let’s Go Crazy” by Minnesota native Prince before Walz took the stage.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Oprah endorsement</h4>

	
<p>Just before the odes to Walz began, TV talk show legend Oprah Winfrey, whose show was broadcast from Chicago for decades, made a surprise appearance on the convention stage.</p>
<p>Winfrey made the case for Harris as a barrier-breaking candidate and a deeply decent person.</p>
<p>Winfrey, who has backed every Democratic presidential candidate since Obama in 2008 but said she remains an independent voter, urged undecided voters to base their votes on the candidates’ character.</p>
<p>“Decency and respect are on the ballot in 2024,” she said. “And just plain common sense. Common sense tells you that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz can give us decency and respect.”</p>
<p>She criticized Republicans under Trump.</p>
<p>“Let us choose loyalty to the Constitution instead of loyalty to a single person,” she said</p>
<p>She appealed for an inclusive vision of politics, rejecting Vance’s dismissive description of some Democratic voters as “childless cat ladies.”</p>
<p>“Despite what some would have you think, we are not so different from our neighbors,” she said. “When a house is on fire, we don’t ask about the homeowner’s race or religion. We don’t wonder who their partner is or how they voted, no. We just try to do the best we can to save them. And if the place happens to belong to a childless cat lady, well, we try to get that cat out too.”</p>

She urged them to continue reaching out to Latino voters, a key voting bloc in this year’s election. (Photo by Ariana Figueroa/States Newsroom)</p><p>CHICAGO — Latino lawmakers and organizers Wednesday stressed their voting bloc as key to delivering battleground states to Democrats in November, as the Harris campaign launched a bilingual WhatsApp channel to target Latino voters.</p>
<p>“The Latino vote will be the deciding factor in this election,” actress and Democratic surrogate Eva Longoria said during a Hispanic Caucus meeting on the third day of the Democratic National Convention.</p>
<p>Members of Congress and officials from Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign told delegates how they were reaching out to Latino voters, including the launch of the bilingual WhatsApp channel.</p>
<p>“The channel will be the first-of-its-kind in an American presidential election, and will provide culturally relevant content that reflects the Latino community that already exists on the platform and serve as another tool to combat misinformation and disinformation,” the Harris campaign said in a release.</p>
<p>WhatsApp is a popular messaging tool among immigrant populations and Latinos, and it’s a free encryption messaging app that can be used globally.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/PI_2021.04.07_Social-Media-Use_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank">A Pew Research Center report</a> found that about a quarter of Americans use WhatsApp, but that 46% of Hispanic Americans use it compared to 23% of Black Americans and 16% of white Americans.</p>
<p>Julie Chavez Rodríguez, manager of the Harris campaign, launched the start of the WhatsApp campaign with a video message, noting that the channel will provide a “behind the scene” look at the campaign and information about Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Democratic Gov. Tim Walz.</p>
<p>The channel will be operated by “Latinos con Harris-Walz.”</p>
<p>Michelle Villegas, the national Latino engagement director for the Harris campaign, said the Latino vote is key to victory in three battleground states, Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>“These are places where Latino voters are going to help us win and beat the margin of victory in these races,” Villegas said.</p>
<p>Villegas said the campaign is also launching bilingual phone outreach and local organizations, as well as several coalitions like “Latino Men for Kamala.”</p>
<p>Former President Donald Trump has made some inroads with Latino voters, specifically with men, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/02/us/politics/trumps-support-among-latinos-grows-new-poll-shows.html" target="_blank">according to a recent poll by The New York Times. </a></p>
<p>“This is the first time that a presidential campaign in the United States has ever had a WhatsApp channel,” Villegas said. “It’s huge. It’s super exciting and super important, because we know that Latinos are communicating on WhatsApp.”</p>
<p>The app, which is a dominant source of communication, has also been rife with misinformation, something that Longoria noted Democrats needed to stay on top of, especially when that misinformation and disinformation is in Spanish.</p>
<p>“Our Spanish language brothers and sisters are being targeted with misinformation, and we have to help them,” she said.</p>
<p>Longoria, who has close ties to the Biden administration, said that she will also be doing Latino voter outreach on WhatsApp.</p>
<p>Last year, the White House <a href="https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/2023/06/19/were-just-trying-to-live-our-lives-daca-hits-11-year-mark-still-mired-in-the-courts/" target="_blank">hosted a screening</a> of the film “Flamin Hot,” which was Longoria’s directorial debut. The movie tells the legendary origin story of “Flamin’ Hot Cheetos,” a popular snack in the Latino community. The <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-05-16/flamin-hot-cheetos-richard-montanez" target="_blank">Los Angeles Times has debunked the tale</a>, but it’s still a popular rags-to-riches story.</p>
<p>Longoria added that Democrats need to talk about issues important to the Latino community, such as the economy and inflation.</p>
<p>“We have so much work to do,” Longoria said. “I think one of the big issues for Latinos, people think it’s always immigration, and that’s important, but the argument of the economy is something that I think we’re not articulating well enough to our Latino brothers and sisters.”</p>
<p>The deputy chief of staff and senior adviser to Harris, Sergio Gonzales, said that Latino voters are critical.</p>
<p>“We will not take any Latino vote for granted,” he said, adding that Harris also hails from a state with a high Latino population — California.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Polling on Latino voters</h4>

	
<p>Equis Research, which conducts research and polling specifically about Latino voters, <a href="https://www.weareequis.us/research/xssaug2024bgmemo" target="_blank">found in a recent poll t</a>hat Harris is ahead of Trump when it comes to registered Hispanic voters, 56% to 37%.</p>
<p>The poll found that Harris has also gained support from Latina women compared to when Biden was still in the race before he dropped out last month. For example, Biden was polling at 50% among Latina women and Harris is polling with about 59% support from Latinas.</p>
<p>“With the entrance of Kamala Harris, we are seeing results that are back in a historically normal range,” according to an analysis of the poll. “Relative to Biden, she sees rebounds across Latino subgroups, with the largest among young people.”</p>
<p>However, the report noted that Harris “remains a few points shy of what Biden received in 2020” across battleground states such as Arizona.</p>
<p>The CEO of the political organization Voto Latino, María Teresa Kumar, said that the states where the group is doing Latino voter registration include Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina and Texas.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">No congressional action</h4>

	
<p>U.S. Democratic Reps. Greg Casar of Texas and Delia Ramirez of Illinois said the Biden administration has continued to have an impact on immigration reform without Congress, such as with the recent implementation of deportation protections for undocumented spouses.</p>
<p>Immigration reform is virtually dead in a divided Congress. A bipartisan border security measure that was crafted in the Senate collapsed after Trump raised objections to it, wanting to campaign on the issue of immigration.</p>
<p>Instead, most immigration reform has come from the White House through rulemaking, like <a href="https://missouriindependent.com/briefs/biden-administration-to-issue-rule-expanding-daca-health-care-access/" target="_blank">expanding health care access</a> to uninsured people in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and the most recent executive action for undocumented spouses of U.S. citizens.</p>
<p><a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2024/06/18/biden-to-unveil-protections-for-some-undocumented-spouses-easier-daca-work-visas/" target="_blank">The deportation protection</a> for those married to a U.S. citizen is a one-time action that is expected to allow roughly 500,000 undocumented spouses and their children to apply for lawful permanent residence — a green card — under certain requirements.</p>
<p>Ramirez, whose husband is a DACA recipient, said immigrants and Latinos are “tired of waiting” for immigration reform. She said it’s an issue Harris should campaign on, because of the economic benefit that immigrants provide.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/60165" target="_blank">The Congressional Budget Office</a> has estimated an economic boost over the next year due to the contributions of immigrants, lowering the deficits by $990 billion over the 2024-2034 period and raising federal revenues by $1.2 trillion.</p>
<p>“We have a daughter of immigrants running to be our president,” Ramirez said of Harris’ parents — her father is a Jamaican immigrant and her late mother was an Indian immigrant. “This is our moment to lean in on the contributions of immigrants.”</p>

Bobby Scott (D-VA), ranking member of the House Committee on Education and Workforce. (Photo by Toya Sarno Jordan/Getty Images)</p></figure>
<p>The letter from the <a href="https://democrats-edworkforce.house.gov/imo/media/doc/osha_state_plan_letter_by_scott_adams.pdf" target="_blank">respective ranking members</a> of the committee and subcommittee — Reps. Bobby Scott of Virginia and Alma Adams of North Carolina — came in response to recent news reports over allegations surrounding the state OSHA agencies and employers in California and South Carolina.</p>
<p>“Workers deserve to be protected, not exploited,” Scott and Adams said in a statement Tuesday.</p>
<p>“If these allegations are true, it means that our federal funds, meant to ensure safe and fair workplaces, might be enabling exactly the opposite,” the two said, adding that it’s “crucial that we get to the bottom of this and hold those responsible accountable.”</p>
<p>Scott and Adams highlighted a February report from <a href="https://calmatters.org/politics/capitol/2024/02/california-farmworkers-safety/" target="_blank">Cal Matters</a> documenting allegations that staff from the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health might be tipping off employers about when inspections are going to occur.</p>
<p>Debra Lee, <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2024/06/06/governor-newsom-announces-appointments-6-6-24/" target="_blank">chief of the state agency</a> who was acting chief at the time of the report, expressed concerns about these allegations and wanted the agency to be informed in order to take appropriate action, according to Cal Matters.</p>
<p>The lawmakers also underscored a series of reports from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/12/14/us/roofing-children-immigrants.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share" target="_blank">The New York Times</a> on migrant children working dangerous jobs upon coming to the United States, including a story that sheds light on the dangers for those in roofing — <a href="https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/WHD/legacy/files/CL_Roofing.pdf" target="_blank">a job that is illegal</a> under the age of 18.</p>
<p>Scott and Adams pointed to the Times’ interview with a crew boss who reportedly “admitted violations of not only federal child labor rules but also OSHA standards that are notionally enforced by South Carolina’s state plan agency.”</p>
<p>The two called this account “particularly alarming,” writing in their letter that “if the employer in this news account is to be believed, this story raises questions not only about South Carolina’s compliance with the OSH Act’s requirements for state plan enforcement but also about the possibility of federal funds being used to help employers evade detection for child labor trafficking and oppressive child labor violations.”</p>
<p>Holly Beeson, counsel to the Office of Communications and Governmental Affairs at the South Carolina Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, told States Newsroom that “whenever a hazard or lack of compliance with an OSHA standard is reported, SC OSHA vets the complaint to determine whether an inspection should follow.”</p>
<p>“Both state and federal law prohibit prior notification of this inspection to an employer, and SC OSHA strictly adheres to this legal mandate,” Beeson said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Worker safety</h4>

	
<p>The Occupational Safety and Health Administration — part of the Department of Labor — was created through the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. The agency is tasked with <a href="https://www.osha.gov/aboutosha" target="_blank">ensuring that workers</a> have “safe and healthful working conditions free from unlawful retaliation.”</p>
<p>Several states, including California and South Carolina, have their own <a href="https://www.osha.gov/stateplans" target="_blank">OSHA-approved state plan</a>.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.osha.gov/stateplans/faqs" target="_blank">the agency</a> notes, “OSHA covers most private sector employers and workers in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the other United States (U.S.) jurisdictions — either directly through OSHA or through an OSHA-approved State Plan.”</p>
<p>Scott and Adams are asking for a response from the Department of Labor by Sept. 20 regarding questions such as how they would address any allegations of unlawful advance notice of inspections and challenges facing the department when trying to monitor and enforce state plans’ compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Act.</p>
<p>The Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration did not respond to a request for comment by time of publication on Tuesday.</p>

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)</p><p>CHICAGO — As he did in his first speech to a Democratic National Convention 20 years ago, former President Barack Obama emphasized the connections binding Americans together and called for a more positive national atmosphere on the second night of this year’s convention Tuesday, while rallying Democrats to campaign for Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>At the United Center, in a convention hosted by their hometown, Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama, who spoke immediately before the former president, scattered references to the 2008 and 2012 White House races he won as they made the case for Harris.</p>
<p>“America, hope is making a comeback,” Michelle Obama said, referring to the theme of her husband’s 2008 campaign and tying it to Harris.</p>
<p>The energy among the Democrats since Harris became a presidential candidate a month ago could be described as “the contagious power of hope,” she said.</p>
<p>The couple also trained criticism on Republican nominee former President Donald Trump, painting him as an agent of division and calling for voters to reject him in favor of a more inclusive nation.</p>
<p>“Donald Trump wants us to think that this country is hopelessly divided between us and them,” Barack Obama said. “Between the real Americans, who of course support him, and the outsiders who don’t.”</p>
<p>He called for Americans to turn aside that point of view.</p>
<p>Republicans in their response also sought to tie Harris to Obama.</p>
<p>“Democrats want to evoke memories of 2008,” Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley said in a written statement. “But this isn’t Barack Obama’s Democrat Party — Kamala Harris is even more dangerously liberal.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Michelle Obama’s change in tone</h4>

	
<p>In a marked shift from her convention speeches eight and four years ago, when she encouraged Democrats to take the moral high road in response to Trump’s attacks, Michelle Obama took a much more confrontational tone Tuesday night toward the Republican nominee.</p>
<p>“Who’s gonna tell him the job he is currently seeking might just be one of those Black jobs?” she said, in reference to a comment Trump had made about immigrants taking “Black jobs.”</p>
<p>Harris would be the second Black president, after Obama.</p>
<p>Earlier, with veiled shots at Trump, the former first lady contrasted him with Harris.</p>
<p>Harris “understands that most of us will never be afforded the grace of failing forward,” she said. “Who will never benefit from the affirmative action of generational wealth. If we bankrupt a business or choke in a crisis, we don’t get a second, third or fourth chance.”</p>
<p>Some Republicans have called Harris, a Black and South Asian woman, a “DEI hire,” an implication that her race and gender were more important than her career and character qualifications. Trump gained an inheritance from his father, who was also a real estate developer.</p>
<p>Trump oversaw bankrupted businesses before he entered politics. And Democrats have said he bungled the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Barack Obama also leveled attacks on Trump, calling him “a 78-year-old billionaire who has not stopped whining about his problems since he came down off his golden escalator” when he announced his 2016 presidential bid.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump alternative</h4>

	
<p>Both Obamas said Harris provided a strong alternative to Trump.</p>
<p>Not born into privilege like Trump, she has the empathy he lacks, Barack Obama said.</p>
<p>“In other words, Kamala Harris won’t be focused on her problems,” he said. “She’ll be focused on yours.”</p>
<p>Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Harris’ running mate, also provided a counterbalance to Trump, Obama said, adding that he loved Walz’s authentic Midwestern persona.</p>
<p>Both Obamas called on Democrats to work hard for Harris’ cause over the 11 weeks until Election Day.</p>
<p>Michelle Obama made “do something” a refrain of her speech.</p>
<p>“You know what we need to do,” the former first lady said. “Michelle Obama is asking you — no I’m telling y’all — to do something. This election is going to be close. In some states, just a handful of votes in every precinct could decide the winner.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Biden tribute</h4>

	
<p>Barack Obama dedicated the first portion of his roughly half-hour speech to honoring his vice president, President Joe Biden.</p>
<p>Biden guided the country out of the COVID-19 pandemic and led a strong economic recovery while lowering health care costs, Obama said.</p>
<p>And Biden deserved credit for sacrificing his political ambition by bowing out of his reelection race, he said.</p>
<p>“At a time when the other party had turned into a cult of personality, we needed a leader who was steady, and brought people together and was selfless enough to do the rarest thing there is in politics: putting his own ambition aside for the sake of the country,” Obama said. “History will remember Joe Biden as a president who defended democracy at a time of great danger.”</p>
<p>He nodded along as the crowd chanted “Thank you, Joe.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Appealing to unity</h4>

	
<p>Both Obamas repeated slogans from campaigns that had his name on the ballot and his presidency, seeking to tie his historic election victory to Harris’ campaign.</p>
<p>“On health care, we should all be proud of the progress we made through the Affordable Care Act,” Barack Obama said, referring to the major health care law he championed in his first term. “I noticed, by the way, that since it became popular they don’t call it Obamacare no more.”</p>
<p>Harris “knows we can’t stop there,” he continued, and would work to lower drug costs.</p>
<p>He also called for Americans to focus on common bonds.</p>
<p>“The ties that bind us together are still there,” he said. “We still coach Little League and look out for our elderly neighbors. We still feed the hungry in churches and mosques and synagogues and temples.”</p>
<p>In his keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, Obama also invoked Little League to stress national unity.</p>
<p>“The vast majority of us do not want to live in a country this bitter and divided,” he said Tuesday. “We want something better. We want to be better.”</p>
<p>The excitement for the Harris campaign showed that was a popular idea, he added.</p>
<p>To close his speech, he invoked the first president nominated at a Chicago convention, elected in the most bitterly divided period of American history — Abraham Lincoln.</p>
<p>“As much as any policy or program, I believe that’s what we yearn for: A return to an America where we work together and look out for each other, a restoration of what Lincoln called, on the eve of civil war, ‘our bonds of affection,’ when America taps what he called ‘the better angels of our nature,’” he said. “That’s what this election is all about.”</p>

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)</p><p>The Democratic National Convention held a ceremonial roll call of the states Tuesday, giving delegates on the floor of the United Center in Chicago a chance to show their support for Kamala Harris complete with corncob hats, DJ’d music, a surprise appearance from Atlanta rapper Lil Jon and enthusiastic cheers.</p>
<p>The tradition, which has long been part of presidential nominating conventions, was actually unnecessary this year. Democratic delegates <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/kamala-harris-officially-becomes-democratic-presidential-nominee" target="_blank">voted virtually</a> earlier this month to formally make Harris their nominee ahead of ballot deadlines in several states.</p>
<p>Harris was the only person to qualify for the ballot after President Joe Biden decided to end his reelection bid in late July, following a pressure campaign from Democrats that began after a concerning debate performance.</p>
<p>Tuesday’s lively in-person “celebratory” vote, accompanied by a live DJ who played a different song for every state and territory, began with delegates from Biden’s home state of Delaware before Democrats in the remaining states and territories voiced their support for the Harris-Walz ticket.</p>
<p>It ended with unofficial votes being cast by delegates from Minnesota, home of vice presidential nominee Tim Walz, and those from Harris’ home state of California.</p>
<p>In between, people within the arena and watching on television heard why delegates believe Harris and Walz represent the best path forward for the country.</p>
<p>Hans Storvick, who said Walz is his neighbor and former teacher, told delegates during Minnesota’s turn to speak that the vice presidential nominee “opened our eyes to the world.”</p>
<p>“He taught us how to talk about global issues with respect, curiosity and kindness; even and especially when we disagreed,” Storvick said. “But he wasn’t just a great teacher, he was also a great neighbor and friend. In fact, when he was in the midst of a budget battle as governor of our state, he still found time to attend my brother’s funeral.”</p>
<p>California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who introduced himself as being from the “great state of Nancy Pelosi,” said residents there pride themselves “on our ability to live together and advance together and prosper together across every conceivable and imaginable difference.”</p>
<p>“But the thing we pride ourselves most on is that we believe the future happens in California first,” Newsom said as Kendrick Lamar played in the background. “And, Democrats, I’ve had the privilege for over 20 years to see that future taking shape with a star in an Alameda courtroom by the name of Kamala Harris.”</p>
<p>“I saw that star fighting for criminal justice, racial justice, economic justice, social justice,” he added. “I saw that star get even brighter as attorney general of California, as a United States senator and as Vice President of the United States of America.”</p>
<p>The Georgia delegation, though, might have upstaged all of their fellow Democrats by securing a <a href="https://x.com/cspan/status/1826072599153266776" target="_blank">mini performance</a> from Lil Jon, who sang “turn out for what” to the music of his famous “Turn Down For What” song before the state cast its votes for Harris.</p>
<p>When the nearly 80 minutes of ceremonial voting wrapped up the DNC displayed a live video of <a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2024/08/20/harris-rallies-voters-in-milwaukee-on-second-night-of-dnc/" target="_blank">Harris at a campaign rally</a> at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the same venue where Republicans held their party convention just last month.</p>
<p>“We are so honored to be your nominees,” Harris said. “This is a people-powered campaign and together, we will chart a new way forward — a future for freedom, opportunity, of optimism and faith.”</p>

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)</p><p>CHICAGO –– After waiting nearly an hour to deliver a scheduled-for-prime-time speech that was pushed to nearly 11:30 p.m. Eastern time, President Joe Biden waited an extra three minutes at the lectern on the first night of the Democratic National Convention as chants from party faithful drowned out his attempts to begin.</p>
<p>When planning for the convention began, Biden was expected to speak, as the party’s nominee, on the final night.</p>
<p>Instead, he spoke Monday as a leader a few months away from retirement, and as a bridge to new Democratic leadership.</p>
<p>“I love my job,” he said as he approached the end of his remarks. “But I love my country more.”</p>
<p>In the final minutes of perhaps the final major political speech in a half-century-long career, Biden quoted a song by Gene Scheer.</p>
<p>“America, America, I gave my best to you,” he said.</p>
<p>Early and often as he spoke, the thousands of Democratic delegates at the United Center voiced their appreciation, delaying and interrupting him with chants of “We love Joe.”</p>
<p>Hours after another crowd, protesters opposed to Biden’s handling of Israel’s war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip, gathered outside the convention hall, Biden gave his strongest remarks to date on the conflict, calling for a cease-fire. He conceded the protesters “have a point.”</p>
<p>Biden’s address provided a glimpse of what an acceptance speech for a second Democratic nomination might have looked like. But instead of promising what he would do in a second term, he said Vice President Kamala Harris would continue the administration’s work.</p>
<p>Biden endorsed Harris as his replacement on the Democratic ticket when he withdrew from the race last month under pressure from Democratic leaders, following his debate performance in June.</p>
<p>In a moment that seemed to surprise Biden, Harris and second spouse Doug Emhoff joined the president and first lady on stage directly after the speech.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘The best volunteer’</h4>

	
<p>Throughout the address, Biden promoted his own record and said Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, possessed the same values and character that would lead to policies Democrats want.</p>
<p>“I promise I’ll be the best volunteer the Harris and Walz campaign has ever seen,” he said.</p>
<p>Much of his remarks were also focused on the Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump, whom Biden defeated in the 2020 election.</p>
<p>Biden’s appearance was bumped out of the prime-time block, as scores of earlier speakers and performers forced Democrats’ debut night further and further off schedule. Some had to be rescheduled.</p>
<p>“Because of the raucous applause interrupting speaker after speaker, we ultimately skipped elements of our program to ensure we could get to President Biden as quickly as possible so that he could speak directly to the American people,” convention officials said in a statement.</p>
<p>“We are proud of the electric atmosphere in our convention hall and proud that our convention is showcasing the broad and diverse coalition behind the Harris-Walz ticket throughout the week on and off the stage.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Infrastructure, gun safety, prescription drugs</h4>

	
<p>Biden promoted his record over nearly four years in office. The country was no longer in the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic, he said.</p>
<p>He said wages were trending up and inflation was moving down, though he noted there was still more to do on those issues.</p>
<p>He delivered a massive infrastructure bill, signed a bipartisan gun safety law and worked to bring costs of prescription drugs down.</p>
<p>Promoting the successes of his administration, Biden highlighted Harris’ role.</p>
<p>When he mentioned the passage of a major Democratic bill in 2022 to boost clean energy production, cap some prescription drug costs and other measures, the crowd responded with a chant of “Thank you, Joe.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Kamala, too,” Biden replied.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Middle East</h4>

	
<p>Biden also said he had much still to do and addressed an issue that has divided Democrats during the past year of his presidency: Israel’s war in Gaza.</p>
<p>He said his administration was working to get humanitarian aid into Gaza.</p>
<p>“And finally, finally, finally deliver a cease-fire and end this war,” he said, pounding the lectern with his fist. “Those protesters out in the street, they have a point. A lot of innocent people are getting killed on both sides.”</p>
<p>On other issues, he said Harris and Walz would continue his work.</p>
<p>“Kamala and Tim will make the child tax cut permanent,” he said, referring to a COVID 19-era provision that increased a tax credit for families.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Contrast with Trump</h4>

	
<p>Biden called Trump a tool of authoritarian leaders, such as Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>Biden repeated a story he told throughout the 2020 campaign that he decided to run for president and challenge Trump’s reelection after Trump excused a deadly rally of white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia.</p>
<p>Biden rejected political violence and professed a commitment to enduring democracy, a theme he sounded in his 2020 campaign that only gained more relevance after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters who sought to keep him in the White House.</p>
<p>Trump has again not said he would accept the results of an election loss, Biden said.</p>
<p>Electing Harris was a necessary step in protecting democracy, he said.</p>
<p>“Democracy has prevailed, democracy has delivered,” he said. “And now, democracy must be preserved.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Union message</h4>

	
<p>As he has through much of his half-century in national politics, Biden appealed to union members, a traditional Democratic constituency.</p>
<p>“Wall Street didn’t build America,” he said. “The middle class built America, and unions built the middle class.”</p>
<p>He said he was proud to have walked the picket line with striking member of the United Auto Workers.</p>
<p>Earlier in the evening, UAW President Shawn Fain in remarks to the crowd praised Biden for making history as the first president to walk a picket line.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Passing the torch</h4>

	
<p>Speakers throughout the evening praised Biden for his record in office and for passing the torch to Harris.</p>
<p>Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, a Biden ally who took Biden’s seat in the Senate after Biden was elected vice president, said Biden helped the nation recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and the Jan. 6 attack.</p>
<p>“On behalf of our nation, Joe, for your courage in fighting for our democracy, we thank you,” Coons said. “On behalf of our Democratic Party, for fighting for our Democratic values, we thank you.”</p>
<p>First lady Jill Biden said the president worked for causes larger than himself, which she was reminded of as she saw him “dig deep into his soul and decide to no longer seek reelection and endorse Kamala Harris.”</p>
<p>U.S. Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina, the third-ranking Democrat in the House for years, also praised Biden’s decision to make Harris his running mate, and to endorse her when he dropped out.</p>
<p>Talking to reporters after his official remarks, Clyburn said a Harris victory in November would bookend Biden’s role in Black presidential history. After serving eight years as vice president to the first Black president, Clyburn said, Biden chose the first Black vice president, Harris.</p>
<p>If Harris wins the November election, Clyburn said, “Joe Biden goes down in history as probably the most transformational president this country’s ever had.”</p>

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — As Vice President Kamala Harris prepares to give the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention Thursday, making her the first Black and South Asian woman to lead a major party ticket, her nomination has energized a strong and loyal voting bloc in the Democratic Party — Black women.</p>
<p>Since President Joe Biden <a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2024/07/21/breaking-president-joe-biden-bows-out-of-reelection-campaign/" target="_blank">last month bowed out</a> of his reelection race and <a href="https://x.com/JoeBiden/status/1815087772216303933" target="_blank">named Harris</a> as his choice for the nomination, her campaign has quickly <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/kamala-harris-will-be-democratic-presidential-nominee-dnc-announces" target="_blank">scooped up the necessary delegate votes</a>, raked in more than $300 million and galvanized the Democratic base. Black women are playing a major role in this rapid mobilization.</p>
<p>Emory University political scientist Andra Gillespie said in an interview with States Newsroom that Harris is benefiting from not only an influx of cash, but also an army of volunteers.</p>
<p>The campaign’s battleground states director, Dan Kanninen, told reporters in late July more than 360,000 volunteers have signed up to knock on doors, canvass and make phone calls.</p>
<p>“What we’ve seen happen in the last couple of weeks is an influx of resources that will allow Harris to mount as effective a mobilization campaign as she can,” Gillespie said.</p>
<p>All of this is key to mounting a competitive race, Gillespie said, especially in all-important Georgia.</p>
<p>In that state, Black women’s work to encourage turnout and register voters was credited with turning the state blue for Biden in 2020. The victory sent two Democratic U.S. senators to Congress, solidifying a split Senate in which Harris was the tiebreaker and in which a Democratic majority confirmed numerous federal judges to lifetime appointments — as well as the first Black woman named to the Supreme Court, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/analysis/national/national-politics/presidential-campaign-reset-arizona-georgia-and-nevada-move" target="_blank">The Cook Political Report with Amy Walters</a> moved Georgia from a “lean Republican” ranking to “toss-up” after Harris entered the presidential race, noting a 1 percentage point lead over her GOP opponent, former President Donald Trump. For comparison, Biden was trailing 2.5 percentage points behind Trump in the Peach State.</p>
<p>Keneshia Grant, an associate professor of political science at Howard University in Washington, D.C., said that when <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/president-joe-biden-bows-out-reelection-campaign-harris-vows-win-nomination-8" target="_blank">Biden first announced he was stepping down</a> July 21 <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/democratic-calls-new-nominee-ramp-biden-camp-pledges-stay-course" target="_blank">under pressure</a> from party leaders following his disastrous debate performance, it was not immediately clear that <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/what-know-about-vice-president-kamala-harris-endorsed-biden-his-successor" target="_blank">Harris</a> would be next in line. It took Biden a little over 30 minutes to endorse her as his chosen successor.</p>
<p>In the days before Biden’s announcement, South Carolina’s U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn urged the party to <a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2024/07/02/texas-u-s-house-member-calls-for-biden-to-withdraw-amid-debate-fallout/" target="_blank">coalesce around Harris</a>, should Biden no longer be on the ticket. Clyburn was pivotal in delivering Black support for Biden in 2020 and remains a close Biden ally.</p>
<p>“We should do everything we can to bolster her, whether she’s in second place or at the top of the ticket,” he said of Harris.</p>

<p>Grant said that Black women — often referred to as the backbone of the Democratic party — had signaled to top party members that “passing over this Black woman in this moment would not be tolerated.”</p>
<p>Within hours of Biden quitting the race, a Zoom call with organizers of #WinWithBlackWomen <a href="https://x.com/WinWithBLKWomen/status/1815300802359026153" target="_blank">drew in more than 90,000 participants</a> and raised more than $1.3 million to support Harris’ bid.</p>
<p>“The (Democratic) Party might not have had a notion of a Black woman as president, right now, but clearly the people feel differently and felt differently,” Grant said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Influence of ‘Divine Nine’</h4>

	
<p>As a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc., the first Black sorority, established in 1908 at Howard University, Harris has an untapped resource in <a href="https://nmaahc.si.edu/explore/stories/divine-nine-black-fraternities-sororities" target="_blank">the “Divine Nine</a>” – Black Greek-letter organizations, made up of four sororities and five fraternities.</p>
<p>Deborah Elizabeth Whaley, a professor of African American studies at the University of Iowa, said that Black sororities and fraternities are more than a social group. She added that they’ve been at the forefront of civil rights issues such as the women’s suffrage movement and anti-lynching legislation.</p>
<p>“The whole idea is that you’re coming together in the name of service to help Black communities as well as holding up academic excellence,” Whaley said.</p>
<p>As soon as Harris entered the race at the top of the ticket,  the Divine Nine, which boasts more than 2 million members, swung into action.</p>
<p>“One of the things that the Black sororities and (fraternities) are known for is voter registration,” Whaley said.</p>
<p>The National Pan-Hellenic Council, Inc. —  the governing body of the Divine Nine — announced it would undertake a major voter turnout mobilization campaign. Because the groups are nonprofits, they can’t endorse a candidate and must remain nonpartisan.</p>
<p>“This campaign will activate the thousands of chapters and members in our respective organizations to ensure strong voter turnout in the communities we serve,” the National Pan-Hellenic Council, Inc. said in a statement.</p>
<p>Harris’s sorority, AKA, formed its own political action committee on Aug. 9, <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/itemizer/committee/C00886036/2024" target="_blank">according to ProPublica’s</a> Federal Election Commission tracker.</p>
<p>Whaley said she’s not surprised Harris has prioritized inclusion of Black sororities, such as her visit to the <a href="https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/2024/07/24/harris-calls-on-zeta-phi-beta-members-to-mobilize-voters-ahead-of-november-election/" target="_blank">Zeta Phi Beta sorority conference in Indianapolis,</a> Indiana, when she was the likely Democratic presidential nominee, in late July.</p>
<p>“We know when we organize, mountains move,” Harris said to more than 6,000 sorority sisters. “When we mobilize, nations change. And when we vote, we make history.”</p>
<p>Whaley said that Black sororities are a “training ground to be of service to community, to be a leader, and to function effectively in a world where you are a member of a starkly marginalized group and you are a minority in terms of your gender.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A different tune</h4>

	
<p>On Harris’ first visit to the campaign headquarters in Delaware, before she addressed the staff, the song she walked out to was Beyoncé’s “Freedom.”</p>
<p>It’s a song that is played during all her campaign stops and, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/22/entertainment/beyonce-freedom-harris-campaign/index.html" target="_blank">according to CNN</a>, Beyoncé has given the campaign permission to use the 2016 song from her Grammy-nominated album, “Lemonade.”</p>
<p>Grant noted that in choosing that particular Beyoncé song, it not only signals to voters that Harris at 59 is a younger candidate — compared to Trump, who is 78 — but it’s a departure from the <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/07/25/remarks-first-lady-democratic-national-convention" target="_blank">catchphrase coined by former first lady</a> Michelle Obama at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, “When they go low, we go high.”</p>
<p>“From the things I’m seeing in the campaign and from her posture, she’s not saying ‘When you go low, I go low,’ but she is saying … ‘When you go low, we at least call you out on it,’” Grant said.</p>
<p>The song choice is also not lost on Kinitra Brooks, an associate professor and the Audrey and John Leslie Endowed Chair in Literary Studies in the Department of English at Michigan State University.</p>
<p>Brooks, who co-edited a collection of essays on Beyoncé’s “Lemonade,” said that the song is about more than breaking chains, but “the cost of freedom.”</p>
<p>“It takes hard work to achieve freedom, but also to maintain it,” she said. “I think that leads to the conversations that we’re having about the rollback of rights.”</p>
<p>As Harris has set out on a rapid-fire campaign tour in the battleground states of <a href="https://azmirror.com/2024/08/09/harris-and-walz-draw-huge-crowd-in-arizona-promise-action-on-immigration-abortion/" target="_blank">Arizona</a>, <a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2024/07/30/harris-challenges-trump-at-boisterous-georgia-state-rally-to-say-it-to-my-face-in-debate-dare/" target="_blank">Georgia</a>, Nevada and <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/election-2024/harris-and-walz-campaign-in-western-pennsylvania-for-first-time-as-running-mates/" target="_blank">Pennsylvania</a>, she has positioned her campaign as a “fight for the future,” and has accused the Trump campaign of focusing on the past.</p>
<p>“Across our nation, we have been witnessing a full-on assault on hard-won, hard-fought freedoms and fundamental rights,” Harris said at an Aug. 10 <a href="https://nevadacurrent.com/2024/08/11/harris-walz-energize-crowd-at-first-nevada-rally-as-democratic-presidential-ticket/" target="_blank">campaign rally in Las Vegas, Nevada</a>. “We are not going back.”</p>

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)</p><p>CHICAGO — Hillary Clinton, the first woman to clinch a major political party’s presidential nomination, on the first night of the Democratic National Convention praised Vice President Kamala Harris — the second woman in U.S. history to be nominated — for her bright vision for the nation and her ability to lead the country forward.</p>
<p>“The story of my life and the history of our country is that progress is possible, but not guaranteed,” Clinton told a packed crowd in the United Center. “We have to fight for it. And never, ever give up.”</p>
<p>Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, said that together, women have put “a lot of cracks in the highest, hardest glass ceiling.”</p>
<p>“On the other side of that glass ceiling is Kamala Harris taking the oath of office as our 47th President of the United States,” she said. “When a barrier falls for one of us, it … clears the way for all of us.”</p>
<p>Clinton said that Harris’ historic nomination, as the first Black and South Asian woman at the top of a major party ticket, is an opportunity for the country to progress.</p>
<p>Clinton said that every generation has “carried the torch forward,” and that Harris will carry that torch as she pushes for the restoration of abortion access, affordable housing and child care.</p>
<p>Harris has often promised to restore Roe v Wade, the Supreme Court ruling that gave Americans the constitutional right to an abortion. However, in order to pass legislation in Congress, Democrats would need to control the House and have 60 votes in the Senate to advance legislation past the filibuster.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Women in history</h4>

	
<p>Clinton highlighted Democratic women who had broken barriers throughout history. She cited the late U.S. Rep. Shirley Chisholm, the first woman to run for the Democratic Party presidential nomination, and the first Black person to seek to be a major party’s candidate for president, and the late U.S. Rep. Geraldine Ferraro, the first woman nominated for the vice presidency by a major political party.</p>
<p>Clinton said that accepting the presidential nomination was the greatest honor of her life. She touched on her loss to Donald Trump in 2016, and noted that despite it, there was a wave of women who ran for public office following Trump’s ascension to the White House.</p>
<p>“We refused to give up on America,” she said.</p>
<p>Clinton said that when she looks at Harris’ campaign she sees freedom.</p>
<p>“I see freedom from fear and intimidation, from violence and injustices, from chaos and corruption,” she said.</p>
<p>Harris indeed has framed her campaign as a fight for freedom, and as an effort to move forward as opposed to Trump and the GOP. Additionally, Beyonce’s song “Freedom” is the campaign’s anthem.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Harris speaks</h4>

	
<p>Harris, who made a brief surprise appearance before Clinton spoke, thanked President Joe Biden for his leadership before she stressed that the November elections are a fight for the future.</p>
<p>“This November, we will come together and declare with one voice, as one people, we are moving forward,” Harris said. “We all have so much more in common than what separates us.”</p>
<p>Harris is expected to give her speech accepting the nomination on Thursday night.</p>
<p>Clinton said that Harris would be “for the people,” which was also the theme of the first night of the convention. Clinton criticized Trump and said that the former president only cares about himself, not Americans.</p>
<p>She said that Democrats have Trump “on the run,” but urged them to not get too comfortable, even as Harris’ campaign has energized Democrats across the nation. Clinton warned Democrats to not rely on the polls, which have shown Harris either gaining on Trump or ahead, and said they must keep campaigning until November.</p>
<p>Since Biden suspended his reelection campaign, after a disastrous June debate that rattled his party’s belief in his ability to defeat Trump, several battleground states that were leaning toward Republicans, such as Georgia, Nevada and Arizona, moved to a “toss-up,”<a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/analysis/national/national-politics/presidential-campaign-reset-arizona-georgia-and-nevada-move" target="_blank"> according to The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter. </a></p>
<p>“No matter what the polls say, we can’t let up,” Clinton said.</p>

The DNC runs from August 19-22. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)</p><p>Democrats will gather in Chicago for their once-every-four-years convention, beginning Monday. Here’s a rundown:</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What is it?</h4>

	
<p>National political conventions are large gatherings of party officeholders, candidates and allies. They meet every four years to officially nominate candidates for president and vice president; to adopt a party platform, the list of policy proposals most party members agree on; and to celebrate and network.</p>
<p>This year, Vice President Kamala Harris has already been officially nominated through a virtual roll call vote earlier this month. A ceremonial roll call is still expected to be a part of the convention, and Harris will officially accept the nomination.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">When should I tune in?</h4>

	
<p>The convention runs from Monday, Aug. 19 to Thursday, Aug. 22.</p>
<p>Major news networks and a host of streaming platforms will broadcast the nightly events — usually speeches from high-profile members of the party — live. The prime-time program runs from 6:30 p.m. to 11 p.m. Eastern Time on Monday and 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.</p>
<p>Full schedules for prime-time speeches have not been disclosed, but the vice presidential candidate usually accepts the nomination on Wednesday night and the presidential nominee’s acceptance speech closes out the convention on Thursday night.</p>
<p>Former presidents and presidential nominees are also likely to have speaking roles.</p>
<p>During the day, delegates and party officials will hold various events and meetings, only some of which will be broadcast or even open to reporters, as the convention doubles as a huge networking event for Democratic politicians, strategists, activists and others.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How can I watch?</h4>

	
<p>Network and cable news TV stations generally air the prime-time programming from start to finish.</p>
<p>National Public Radio will also broadcast much of the convention.</p>
<p>Convention organizers will also be livestreaming the event on a host of platforms, including YouTube, X and TikTok. A full list of official livestreams is available <a href="https://demconvention.com/news/press-releases/how-to-watchdemocratic-national-convention-announces-streaming-partners-and-first-ever-vertical-streaming-platforms/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Where is the convention this year?</h4>

	
<p>Chicago is hosting the Democratic convention for the 12th time, the most of any city.</p>
<p>The major addresses in the evening will be at the United Center, an arena that fits tens of thousands for the city’s professional basketball and hockey teams, concerts or other events.</p>
<p>Daytime activities will be more spread out, with locations at McCormick Place, about 6 miles southeast of the United Center, and the River North neighborhood, about 2 ½ miles to the northeast.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How many people will be there?</h4>

	
<p>About 5,000 Democratic delegates, who have the formal duty of voting to approve the nominees for president and vice president, are expected to attend.</p>
<p>A total of about 50,000 people could be in town for the event, according to <a href="https://chicago2024.com/faqs/" target="_blank">the city</a>.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Will any celebrities be there? </h4>

	
<p>The 2016 Democratic National Convention — the last in-person convention Democrats held, since they moved the 2020 version online in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic — that nominated Hillary Clinton featured celebrities including singer Katy Perry and screenwriter/actor Lena Dunham.</p>
<p>The Republican National Convention in July included appearances by musical artist Kid Rock and professional wrestler Hulk Hogan during prime time.</p>
<p>A full list of participants for the Democratic convention this year has not yet been shared, but that has not stopped some fans of major music acts from <a href="https://sign.moveon.org/petitions/taylor-swift-and-beyonce-to-perform-together-at-the-dnc-convention-and-formally-support-harris" target="_blank">wishing</a> they’ll see their favorites at the event.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Where can I find fair, fearless and free reporting about the convention?</h4>

	
<p><a href="http://newsfromthestates.com" target="_blank">Right here!</a> And from your state’s newsroom, which you can find on <a href="https://statesnewsroom.com/newsrooms/" data-type="link" data-id="https://statesnewsroom.com/newsrooms/" target="_blank">this map. </a>States Newsroom is sending multiple reporters to cover the convention and will have in-depth coverage of the major events and more.</p>

The convention will be held Aug. 19-22. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Just a little over a month after she became a candidate for president in the biggest shakeup in generations of presidential politics, Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday will deliver a widely anticipated speech accepting the Democratic nomination at the party’s convention in Chicago.</p>
<p>Harris’ ascent to the top of the ticket after President Joe Biden changed course and said he would not seek reelection has breathed new life into the Democratic bid, with polls showing Harris — who is already <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/kamala-harris-will-be-democratic-presidential-nominee-dnc-announces" target="_blank">the party’s official nominee</a> after a virtual roll call earlier this month — faring much better than Biden was against Republican rival Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Over the course of four days, Democrats will look to capitalize on their base’s newfound enthusiasm for the campaign, with leading speakers aiming to rally the faithful around the party’s positions on reproductive rights, gun safety and voting rights, while <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/harris-ballot-democrats-work-build-momentum-bigger-youth-vote" target="_blank">making a strong pitch to young voters</a>. Harris will also be expected to further lay out her policy positions.</p>
<p>Harris’ nomination is historic. The daughter of immigrants, Harris is the first Black and South Asian woman selected to lead a major party ticket. She would be the first woman of any race to guide the nation as chief executive.</p>
<p>The party has not released an official detailed schedule of speakers, but a convention official confirmed that “current and past presidents are expected to participate in convention programming.” Biden and two former presidents, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, as well as former nominee Hillary Clinton, will all speak, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/12/us/politics/dnc-speakers-biden-obama-clinton.html" target="_blank">according to the New York Times.</a></p>
<p>Vice presidential candidate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is expected to address the convention Wednesday evening, with Harris’ acceptance speech closing out the convention Thursday, the convention official said.</p>
<p>The evening programming block will run from 6:30 p.m. to 11 p.m. Eastern Time on Monday and 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. the rest of the week.</p>
<p>In addition to the usual television broadcasts, the convention will livestream on several social media platforms, including YouTube, X, Instagram and TikTok. The official live stream will be available on <a href="https://demconvention.us9.list-manage.com/track/click?u=d68a84b1a4b0303a9452770cd&amp;id=e86e03e670&amp;e=a21b6b7198" target="_blank">DemConvention.com</a>.</p>
<p>Scores of Democratic caucus and council meetings, as well as state delegation breakfasts and gatherings, are also scheduled throughout the week’s daytime hours. Media organizations and outside groups are also holding daytime events that will feature Democratic officeholders and candidates.</p>
<p>Protests are also expected over the Biden administration’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war, with the backdrop of a <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2024/04/08/israel-hamas-war-sets-progressive-and-young-voters-on-collision-course-with-white-house/" target="_blank">delegation of uncommitted voters</a> who oppose the war.</p>
<p>As many as 25,000 protestors are expected over the course of the convention, according to DemList, a newsletter for Democratic officials and allies.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A contest transformed</h4>

	
<p>Harris’ entry into the race, nearly immediately after Biden <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/president-joe-biden-bows-out-reelection-campaign-harris-vows-win-nomination-8" target="_blank">announced on July 21</a> he would no longer seek reelection, energized Democrats distressed over Biden’s poor showings in polls against Trump, whose reelection bid Biden turned back in 2020.</p>
<p>A Monmouth University <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_US_081424/" target="_blank">poll published Aug. 14</a> showed a huge jump in enthusiasm for Democrats. The survey found 85% of Democratic respondents were excited about the Harris-Trump race. By comparison, only 46% of Democratic respondents said in June they were excited about a Biden-Trump race.</p>
<p>Harris is also seeing better polling numbers in matchups against Trump, with battleground-state and national surveys consistently shifting toward the Democratic ticket since Biden left the race.</p>
<p>Polls of seven battleground states <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/survey-research/2024-swing-state-project/fight-redefine-2024-race-president" target="_blank">published</a> by The Cook Political Report With Amy Walter on Aug. 14 showed Harris narrowly leading in five states — Arizona, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — and tied in Georgia and trailing in Nevada. All were improvements from Biden’s standing in the same poll in May.</p>
<p><a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3902" target="_blank">An Aug. 14 survey from Quinnipiac University</a> showed Harris with a 48%-45% edge in Pennsylvania. The 3-point advantage for Harris was within the poll’s margin of error.</p>
<p>Democrats hope to carry the momentum through the convention. Polls typically favor a party during and immediately after its national party gathering.</p>
<p>Despite the recent polling, Harris and Walz continue to describe themselves <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkwZ_A49hb8" target="_blank">as underdogs in the race</a>.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Campaign themes</h4>

	
<p>In her short time on the campaign trail, Harris has emphasized a few core messages.</p>
<p>She’s made reproductive rights a central focus, including the slogan “We are not going back” in her stump speech after describing Republicans’ position on abortion. Additionally, a Texas woman who had to leave the state for an emergency abortion will speak at the DNC, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/texas-woman-who-left-state-abortion-back-harris-convention-2024-08-15/" target="_blank">according to Reuters.</a></p>
<p>Harris has also played up her background as a prosecutor, drawing a contrast with Trump’s legal troubles.</p>
<p>Walz has highlighted his working-class background and military service, while attacking Republican positions to restrict reproductive rights and ban certain books in schools.</p>
<p>Walz’s <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/walz-first-solo-speech-vp-candidate-touts-dem-tickets-labor-union-ties" target="_blank">first solo campaign stop</a> since Harris selected him as her running mate was at a union convention, where he emphasized his union background as a high school teacher.</p>
<p>Walz was not initially considered the favorite to be Harris’ running mate, but his appeal as a Midwesterner with a record of winning tough elections and enacting progressive policies <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/minnesota-gov-tim-walz-picked-harris-her-running-mate-democratic-ticket" target="_blank">led to his selection</a> Aug. 6.</p>
<p>Harris has faced criticism for not sitting down for a formal media interview or holding a press conference since she became a candidate.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Platform in flux</h4>

	
<p>Democrats have not finalized their platform for 2024. Adopting a party platform is generally among the official items at a convention.</p>
<p>The party set <a href="https://democrats.org/news/dnc-releases-2024-party-platform-draft-outlining-historic-record-and-bold-agenda-for-president-biden-and-vice-president-harris-to-finish-the-job/" target="_blank">a draft platform</a> in July just eight days before Biden dropped his reelection bid. The document centered on the theme of “finishing the job” and mentioned Biden, then the presumptive nominee, 50 times and Harris 12.</p>
<p>Party spokespeople did not respond to an inquiry this week about plans for an update to the platform.</p>
<p>Reproductive rights will likely be a focus point of any policy wishlist.</p>
<p>Harris, during her time as vice president, has led the administration’s messaging on reproductive rights after the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion in the summer of 2022.</p>
<p>In her campaign speeches, she has often stressed the need to “trust women” and that the government should not be deciding reproductive health.</p>
<p>Harris has often promised that if she is elected, she will restore those reproductive rights, but unless Democrats control a majority in the U.S. House and 60 Senate votes, it’s unlikely she would be able to achieve that promise.</p>
<p>Since <a href="https://tennesseelookout.com/2022/06/24/updated-u-s-supreme-court-overturns-right-to-abortion-in-landmark-decision/" target="_blank">Roe v. Wade was overturned</a> in that Supreme Court decision, Democrats have campaigned on reproductive rights that expand beyond abortion and include protections for in vitro fertilization.</p>
<p><a href="https://democrats.org/where-we-stand/party-platform/" target="_blank">The 2020 party platform</a> focused on recovering from the coronavirus pandemic, the economy, quality health care, investing in education, protecting democracy and combating climate change.</p>
<p>Democrats are likely to continue to criticize the Project 2025 playbook — a blueprint by the Heritage Foundation, a think tank, to implement conservative policies across the federal government should Trump win in November.</p>
<p>Trump has disavowed the document, but has not detailed his own policy plans.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Chicago conventions</h4>

	
<p>The Democratic National Convention will take place in Chicago, a city with a long history of hosting the event. Democrats have held their convention in Chicago 11 times, first in 1864 and most recently in 1996.</p>
<p>This year’s will be the first in-person Democratic National Convention since 2016. It was upended due to the coronavirus pandemic and held virtually in 2020.</p>
<p>Throughout the four-day convention, there will be speeches and side events hosted by state Democratic party leaders.</p>
<p>The ceremonial roll call vote with delegates on the convention floor will take place Tuesday. The vice presidential nomination speech by Walz will be Wednesday night and on Thursday night, Harris will give her nomination acceptance speech.</p>
<p>The city is also preparing for massive protests from several groups on reproductive rights, LGBTQ protections, housing and an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, <a href="https://www.wbez.org/government-politics/dnc-2024/2024/08/12/dnc-democratic-national-convention-protests-kamala-harris-israel-gaza-lgbtq-reproductive-rights-cpd-police" target="_blank">according to WBEZ News. </a></p>
<p>The City Council of Chicago in January approved a ceasefire resolution, with Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson the tiebreaker, making it the largest city to call for an end to the Israel-Hamas war, in which<a href="https://apnews.com/article/gaza-war-hamas-dead-graves-40000-988d16b648e06e222f04964dc9440da0?taid=66bdedd74b96700001cc25c8&amp;utm_campaign=TrueAnthem&amp;utm_medium=AP&amp;utm_source=Twitter" target="_blank"> more than 40,000 Palestinians have died</a>.</p>
<p>The war followed an Oct. 7 attack from Hamas, in which <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2023/10/9/israel-hamas-war-in-maps-and-charts-live-tracker" target="_blank">nearly 1,200 people</a> were killed in Israel and hundreds taken hostage.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Road to nomination</h4>

	
<p>Harris’ acceptance speech will cap a five-year journey to her party’s nomination.</p>
<p>In 2019, the California senator announced a bid for president in the next year’s election, but <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/12/03/784443227/kamala-harris-drops-out-of-presidential-race" target="_blank">dropped out</a> before the first primary or caucus votes were cast after she failed to catch on with Democratic voters.</p>
<p>Biden later picked her as a running mate, and the two defeated Trump and then-Vice President Mike Pence in the 2020 election.</p>
<p>Biden launched a reelection campaign for 2024, but stepped aside after a disastrous debate performance in June spurred questions about his ability to campaign and serve for another four-year term.</p>
<p>After Biden bowed out, Harris <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/democratic-delegates-swiftly-give-harris-enough-support-clinch-presidential-nomination" target="_blank">quickly secured 99%</a> of delegates <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/kamala-harris-officially-becomes-democratic-presidential-nominee" target="_blank">to become the party’s likely nominee</a>. The virtual five-day vote secured her official nomination.</p>
<p>With less than three months until Election Day, Harris and Walz already have sprinted through battleground states including Arizona, Pennsylvania and North Carolina.</p>
<p>Their campaign has also pulled in more than $300 million, according to the campaign. Official Federal Election Commission records will be released in mid-October.</p>
<p>Harris and Trump have <a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2024/08/08/trump-agrees-to-sept-10-debate-with-harris-claims-two-more-upcoming/" target="_blank">agreed to a Sept. 10 </a>debate hosted by ABC News in Philadelphia. Trump proposed two more debates, and Harris has said she would be open to another one between the first debate and Election Day.<br />
Walz and Republican vice presidential candidate Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio have <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/mark-your-calendar-vp-candidates-walz-and-vance-debate-oct-1" target="_blank">agreed to an Oct. 1</a> debate on CBS News, in New York City.</p>

Harris and President Joe Biden held the event to talk about their administration’s efforts to lower drug costs. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris released her first detailed economic policy proposal Friday, laying out how she’d like to ease rent increases, boost first-time home buyers, end grocery price gouging and bolster the child tax credit.</p>
<p>The Harris campaign’s announcement said the proposals, most of which would need approval from Congress, would “address some of the sharpest pain points American families are confronting and bolster their financial security.”</p>
<p>“Vice President Harris has made clear that building up the middle class will be a defining goal of her presidency,” the announcement stated. “She will deliver for Americans who are demanding a new way forward towards a future that lifts up all Americans so that they can not just get by, but get ahead.”</p>
<p>Harris <a href="https://ncnewsline.com/briefs/harris-walz-campaign-launches-offices-in-rural-nc/" target="_blank">will campaign later Friday</a> in Raleigh, North Carolina, ahead of the Democratic National Convention beginning Monday, as both campaigns focus on a handful of swing states.</p>
<p>The economic plank of her plan seeks to curb the expenses that often come with building a family by expanding the child tax credit to the $3,600 per child that existed under the COVID-19 spending law that Democrats approved during the first months of the Biden administration. That provision has since expired.</p>
<p>Harris proposes increasing that credit to $6,000 for families that have children under a year old.</p>
<p>The maximum child tax credit is currently $2,000 per qualifying child for an individual making less than $200,000 annually or a couple filing jointly that makes less than $400,000.</p>
<p>There are several <a href="https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/individuals/child-tax-credit" target="_blank">qualifications</a> to receive a child tax credit, including that the child was under the age of 17 at the end of the year and that they are a U.S. citizen, U.S. national or U.S. resident alien.</p>
<p>The Earned Income Tax Credit, or EITC, would expand “to cover individuals and couples in lower-income jobs who aren’t raising a child in their home, cutting their taxes by up to $1,500,” according to the announcement.</p>
<p>Harris also pledged that no one making less than $400,000 annually would see an increase in new taxes, matching a promise that President Joe Biden has made throughout his time in the Oval Office.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Grocery price gouging</h4>

	
<p>The proposal says that if elected, Harris would seek Congress’ passage of a law to implement a ban on price gouging on groceries and other food as well as establish “rules of the road” that would bar companies from “excessive profits on food and groceries.”</p>
<p>Rising prices on groceries have been a major pain point for consumers, and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Thursday <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/%C2%A0im-entitled-personal-attacks-against-harris-trump-asserts" target="_blank">made the case</a> that prices are too high for American families, laying the blame for inflation at the feet of the Biden-Harris administration and insisting he’s the only person able to get prices back down.</p>
<p>To implement her grocery gouging plan, Harris proposes providing the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general with new authority to “impose strict new penalties” on companies that price gouge.</p>
<p>“Many big grocery chains that have seen production costs level off have nevertheless kept prices high and have seen their highest profits in two decades,” the proposal states. “While some food companies have passed along these savings, others still have not.”</p>
<p>“Price fluctuations are normal in free markets, but Vice President Harris recognizes there is a big difference between fair pricing and the excessive prices unrelated to the costs of doing business that Americans have seen in the food and grocery industry,” it says.</p>
<p>A Harris administration would also address “unfair mergers and acquisitions” that can contribute to higher prices on food and groceries, the Harris plan says.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Expansion of drug pricing controls</h4>

	
<p>Harris hopes to expand a price ceiling for insulin that Democrats established in their signature climate change, health care and tax package known as the Inflation Reduction Act or IRA.</p>
<p>That section of the law, which only applies to Medicare,<a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/bd5568fa0e8a59c2225b2e0b93d5ae5b/aspe-insulin-affordibility-datapoint.pdf" target="_blank"> caps the price of insulin</a> per month at $35. Harris’ proposal looks to expand that to “everyone” while setting the maximum out-of-pocket cost for other prescriptions at $2,000.</p>
<p>The plan would increase the pace that Medicare is allowed to negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies.</p>
<p>“Vice President Harris and Governor Walz will also work with states to cancel medical debt for millions of Americans and to help them avoid accumulating such debt in the future, because no one should go bankrupt just because they had the misfortune of becoming sick or hurt,” according to the proposal.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Boosting home building</h4>

	
<p>The economic plan released Friday includes numerous changes that could ease the increasing costs of renting and purchasing a home for the first time.</p>
<p>Harris would seek to bolster home building throughout the country by 3 million units during the next four years by taking “down barriers that stand in the way of building new housing, including at the state and local levels.”</p>
<p>A Harris-Walz administration would call on Congress to create a tax incentive for construction companies that build “starter homes” that would then be sold to first-time home buyers.</p>
<p>The announcement says the new tax incentive would “complement the Neighborhood Homes Tax Credit that encourages investment in homes that would otherwise be too costly or difficult to develop or rehabilitate.”</p>
<p>Harris’ proposal calls for up to $25,000 in down payment assistance for first-time home buyers who have paid rent on time for at least two years.</p>
<p>The proposal says that if implemented, the down payment financial aid would go out to more than 4 million people over four years.</p>
<p>Harris also pressed lawmakers to address the rising cost of rent by approving two bills that have been introduced in Congress, but haven’t gained any ground.</p>
<p>One <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/2224" target="_blank">bill</a> would reduce the incentive for large firms to buy more than 50 single-family rental homes. The legislation would bar those companies “from deducting interest or depreciation on those properties,” according to a <a href="https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/sherrod-brown-colleagues-bill-crack-down-corporate-investors-buy-local-homes-housing-prices" target="_blank">summary</a> of the measure.</p>
<p>The second rental proposal asks Congress to approve a <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/3692" target="_blank">bill</a> that would “crack down on companies that help landlords increase rents in already high-priced markets,” according to a <a href="https://www.welch.senate.gov/welch-and-wyden-introduce-legislation-to-crack-down-on-companies-that-inflate-rents-with-price-fixing-algorithms/" target="_blank">summary</a>.</p>
<p>“Vice President Harris knows that our nation’s housing affordability crisis is making it hard for tens of millions of Americans to make ends meet while putting the American Dream of homeownership out of reach for too many working families,” the proposal states. “That’s why she will launch an urgent and comprehensive four-year plan to lower housing costs for working families and end America’s housing shortage.”</p>
<p>The Harris-Walz campaign also announced Friday that the ticket would<a href="https://penncapital-star.com/election-2024/harris-and-walz-to-kick-off-pennsylvania-bus-tour-in-pittsburgh/" data-type="link" data-id="https://penncapital-star.com/election-2024/harris-and-walz-to-kick-off-pennsylvania-bus-tour-in-pittsburgh/" target="_blank"> hold a bus tour</a> in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and the surrounding area on Sunday, just ahead of the Democratic National Convention.</p>
<p>Harris; her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz; second gentleman Doug Emhoff; and first lady of Minnesota Gwen Walz will all participate in the tour of Allegheny and Beaver counties.</p>

(Photo by Jabin Botsford-Pool/Getty Images)</p><p>Former President Donald Trump asked a New York court Thursday to delay until after November’s presidential election his sentencing for the 34 state felonies the court convicted him of in May.</p>
<p>Judge Juan Merchan scheduled a sentencing hearing for Sept. 18. But that date overlaps with early voting in the presidential election and gives Trump too little time to appeal a potential ruling against him on a request to vacate the conviction, which Merchan is scheduled to issue two days prior, attorneys Todd Blanche and Emil Bove wrote to Merchan <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25045316-20240814-letter-to-justice-merchan-re-sentencing-adjournment" target="_blank">in a letter</a> dated Wednesday.</p>
<p>The one-page letter was not on the court’s official docket Thursday morning, but Blanche provided a copy to States Newsroom and said it had been filed with the court.</p>
<p>Merchan’s schedule is unrealistic and ignores several related issues, Trump’s attorneys wrote.</p>
<p>A sentencing proceeding could improperly affect voters’ perception of Trump leading up to Election Day, and Merchan’s daughter’s ties to elected Democrats could undermine the public’s faith in the court, they wrote.</p>
<p>While Merchan has rejected three requests from Trump that he recuse himself from the case because of his daughter’s employment at a company that produces advertising campaigns for Democrats, Trump’s lawyers said delaying the sentencing would help mitigate any potential appearance of a conflict of interest.</p>
<p>Trump’s Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, continue to discuss the case on the campaign trail. And the founder of the firm where Merchan’s daughter works has expressed his support for Harris on social media, Blanche and Bove wrote.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Election entanglements</h4>

	
<p>The Sept. 18 sentencing is also scheduled “after the commencement of early voting in the Presidential election,” they wrote.</p>
<p>“By adjourning the sentencing until after that election … the Court would reduce, even if not eliminate, issues regarding the integrity of any future proceedings,” they wrote.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania law allows the earliest voting, according to a<a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/early-in-person-voting" target="_blank"> database</a> compiled by the National Conference of State Legislatures. Pennsylvania counties are permitted to hold early voting 50 days before Election Day, which is Sept. 16.</p>
<p>It is unclear if any counties in the key battleground state are planning to make voting available that soon.</p>
<p>No other states allow voting before Sept. 18, according to the NCSL database. Blanche did not answer an emailed question about what early voting he was referring to in the letter.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Presidential immunity</h4>

	
<p>Trump’s attorneys said the sentencing hearing should also be moved to accommodate another issue in the case: Trump’s presidential immunity argument.</p>
<p>Trump has asked for his conviction to be overturned following a U.S. Supreme Court decision that ruled presidents were entitled to a broad definition of criminal immunity for acts they take in office.</p>
<p>Merchan set a Sept. 16 date to rule on the request the state conviction be set aside, but Trump’s attorneys said that does not leave enough time for Trump to appeal a potentially unfavorable ruling on the immunity issue.</p>
<p>“The requested adjournment is also necessary to allow President Trump adequate time to assess and pursue state and federal appellate options in response to any adverse ruling,” they wrote.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court decision that established presidential immunity arose from a pretrial appeal, they wrote.</p>
<p>A New York jury<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-found-guilty-34-felony-counts-ny-hush-money-trial-10" target="_blank"> convicted</a> Trump in May of 34 felony counts of falsified business records, making him the first former president to be convicted of a felony. Trump was accused of sending $130,000, through attorney  Michael Cohen, to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the weeks before the 2016 election to buy her silence about<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/porn-star-stormy-daniels-nyc-hush-money-trial-alleges-sexual-encounter-trump" target="_blank"> an alleged sexual encounter</a> years earlier.</p>
<p>Merchan initially set sentencing for July 11.</p>
<p>But after the Supreme Court<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/presidential-immunity-covers-some-official-acts-supreme-court-rules-trump-case" target="_blank"> ruled on July 1</a> that presidents enjoy full immunity from criminal charges for their official acts, the New York judge agreed to delay sentencing to first rule on how the Supreme Court decision affected the New York case.</p>
<p>While much of the conduct alleged in the New York case took place before Trump was in office, his attorneys have argued that the prosecution also included investigations into Oval Office meetings with Cohen that could be impermissible under the Supreme Court’s standard.</p>

<p>Sept. 18 is also the date that GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump is scheduled for his sentencing in his hush money trial, in which he <a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2024/05/30/breaking-trump-found-guilty-on-34-felony-counts-in-ny-hush-money-trial/" target="_blank">was convicted on all 34 counts </a>of falsifying business records in an attempt to conceal payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels in an effort to influence the 2016 presidential election.</p>
<p>In a letter dated Wednesday, but made public Thursday, attorneys for Trump asked the judge overseeing his sentencing to delay it until after the presidential election, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/15/politics/trump-hush-money-sentencing-delay/index.html" target="_blank">according to CNN. </a></p>
<p>Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris <a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2024/08/08/trump-agrees-to-sept-10-debate-with-harris-claims-two-more-upcoming/" target="_blank">are scheduled for a presidential debate</a> Sept. 10, hosted by ABC News.</p>

(Photo by Adam Gray/Getty Images)</p><p>Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said Thursday he sees no need to switch the tactics or tone of his bid for the White House now that Vice President Kamala Harris is the Democratic nominee instead of President Joe Biden.</p>
<p>Speaking during a press conference at his golf club in New Jersey, the former president began with 45 minutes of comments on a myriad of issues before he took more than a dozen questions from reporters.</p>
<p>Trump argued that there was no need to limit his personal criticism of Harris since there are several criminal trials ongoing against him and because she has called him “weird” several times.</p>
<p>“I think I’m entitled to personal attacks,” Trump said. “I don’t have a lot of respect for her. I don’t have a lot of respect for her intelligence. And I think she’ll be a terrible president.”</p>
<p>Numerous Republicans, including former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who challenged Trump for the nomination though she now says <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/22/politics/nikki-haley-donald-trump/index.html" target="_blank">she will vote for him</a>, have called for Trump to focus more on the policy differences between the two political parties, and less on his personal grievances with Harris.</p>
<p>Trump, for example, sought to question Harris’ racial identity during his <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-insults-harris-makes-false-claims-quarrels-black-journalists-conference" target="_blank">panel interview</a> at the National Association of Black Journalists late last month.</p>
<p>Trump gave Thursday’s press conference outside and spoke while standing in between two tables of groceries and what appeared to be a large, blue doll house.</p>
<p>He used the props to make a case that prices are too high for American families, laying the blame for inflation at the feet of the Biden-Harris administration and insisting he’s the only person able to get prices back down.</p>
<p>Trump brushed aside his polling numbers in swing states, some of which have him trailing or inside the margin of error, in the match-up with Harris.</p>
<p>“I tend to poll low,” Trump said. “In some cases, really low.”</p>
<p>He also said that if reelected in November he hoped to develop a “friendly” relationship with Iran and to “get along” with China. The GOP has repeatedly criticized Democrats for being too lenient with both countries.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Another public meltdown’</h4>

	
<p>The Harris-Walz campaign released a mock advisory for the press conference before it began Thursday, writing in an email that Trump was preparing to “hold another public meltdown in Bedminster, New Jersey.”</p>
<p>“Not so fresh off NABJ, Florida, and Twitter glitches, Donald Trump intends to deliver another self-obsessed rant full of his own personal grievances to distract from his toxic Project 2025 agenda, unpopular running mate, and increasing detachment from the reality of the voters who will decide this election,” the campaign wrote. “These remarks will not be artificial intelligence, but they certainly will lack intelligence.”</p>
<p>Spokesperson James Singer released a written statement afterward that Trump “huffed and puffed his opposition to lowering food costs for middle and working class Americans and prescription drug costs for seniors before pivoting back to his usual lies and delusions.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Race remains in flux</h4>

	
<p>Despite the new momentum at the top of the Democratic presidential ticket and Trump insisting he’s on track to win, neither candidate yet has a clear path to victory this November, experts say.</p>
<p>The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter, a nonpartisan publication that analyzes campaigns and rates whether races are leaning toward one political party or the other, has placed six states in its “toss-up” category for the Electoral College.</p>
<p>Arizona’s 11, Georgia’s 16, Michigan’s 15, Nevada’s six, Pennsylvania’s 19 and Wisconsin’s 10 Electoral College votes could go to either Harris or Trump when voting wraps up, according to the political publication’s <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/presidential-race-ratings" target="_blank">reporting</a>.</p>
<p>Minnesota, Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District and New Hampshire are all rated as leaning toward Harris with a total of 15 votes, while North Carolina and its 16 votes are leaning toward Trump.</p>
<p>All the other states are categorized as “solid” or “likely” going to either Trump or Harris, underlining the close nature of the campaign.</p>
<p>Walter told reporters on a call Thursday that Harris has a chance to sway swing voters during her speech to the Democratic National Convention next week.</p>
<p>“She has an opportunity here in that people are going to be more interested in watching this convention, certainly, than they were a month ago when Biden was on the top of the ticket,” she said. “And it’s an opportunity to speak beyond the Democratic base.”</p>
<p>The prime-time speech will give Harris a forum to address the major criticisms of her presidential run, including that she’s too liberal, isn’t the best person to handle the economy and that she’s weak on immigration policy, Walter said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump and his temperament</h4>

	
<p>Greg Strimple, president of GS Strategy Group, which is partnering with the Cook Political Report on a swing state project looking at voters’ views toward the candidates, said one of the bigger challenges for Trump’s campaign is getting the candidate to stay on message.</p>
<p>“This race has shifted from being a referendum on Biden’s age and economy to being a referendum on Trump and his temperament,” Strimple said on the call. “And despite the fact that Donald Trump is unable to get out of his way at the moment, his campaign is running ads that are right on message.”</p>
<p>If Trump and his campaign aligned to push their belief that Harris is “too liberal, too inexperienced and a continuation of Biden on the economy,” that could help them to regain ground in polling and with voters ahead of Election Day, he said.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot of talk right now about the race being over, and I just kind of caution everyone that there is a path for Trump — it’s just whether he can take it,” Strimple said.</p>
<p>Patrick Toomey, a partner at BSG, which is also part of the swing state project, said on the call that voters shouldn’t rule out ups and downs in support for the candidates in the months ahead, citing potential upheaval from hurricane season or the ongoing wars in the Middle East.</p>
<p>“It’s just worth keeping in mind how many dramatic twists and turns there have been in this race so far,” Toomey said. “And the idea that because we’ve had this reset now things are set and nothing is going to change going forward, would be a mistake.”</p>

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The 2024 battle for control of Congress centers on just a handful of Senate races and about two dozen House seats, putting considerable pressure on those candidates to win over voters as party leaders and super PACs funnel millions of dollars into their campaigns.</p>
<p>The incumbents representing those states and congressional districts will spend nearly all of their time campaigning between now and Election Day, with Congress in session just three weeks ahead of Nov. 5. They’ll be fighting off challengers who will be on the home front the entire time.</p>
<p>Republicans aim to increase their slim majority in the House of Representatives and flip the Senate, while Democrats are hoping to hang onto their majority in the upper chamber and regain control of the House.</p>
<p>Experts interviewed by States Newsroom said the outcome will be determined by multiple factors, including turnout, ticket splitting and the trajectory of the presidential campaign, which underwent an abrupt change with the exit of President Joe Biden and the nomination of Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic candidate.</p>
<p>At stake is whether Harris or Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, faces a Congress friendly to their ambitions or another two years of a deeply divided government in the nation’s capital. Biden has <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/congress-limps-toward-end-disappointing-session-just-78-laws-show" target="_blank">struggled with</a> a GOP House and a Senate narrowly controlled by Democrats during the past two years.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot of energy on both sides for these congressional races, because of just how close the margins are going to be in the House and Senate,” said Casey Burgat, assistant professor and legislative affairs program director at George Washington University.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Senate GOP control?</h4>

	
<p>The Senate is trending toward a Republican majority, though that will be determined by voters in Michigan, Montana, Nevada and Ohio, all of which are considered toss-ups by the Cook Political Report with Amy Walter, a respected non-partisan publication.</p>
<p>If the GOP picks up any one of those four seats, that would give Republicans at least a 51-seat majority in the chamber after winning the West Virginia seat that’s currently held by Joe Manchin III, thought to be nearly certain in the GOP-dominated state.</p>
<figure id="attachment_39057" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:383px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/img_2188/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-39057 " src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2188-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="383" height="255" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2188-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2188-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2188-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2188-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2188-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger&#8217;s decision to run for governor leaves her 7th Congressional seat open but the district leans blue, political forecasters say. (Charlotte Rene Woods / Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p>Democrats maintaining those four seats as well as three others classified as “lean Democrat” by the Cook Political Report would leave control of a 50-50 Senate to the results of the presidential election, since the vice president casts tie-breaking votes in that chamber.</p>
<p>The Senate map is highly favorable to Republicans, who are defending 11 seats in safely red states, while Democrats are trying to hold on to 23 seats, with seven of those in purple states.</p>
<p>While the entire 435-member House of Representatives is up for reelection every two years, senators are elected to six-year terms, leaving about one-third of the chamber up for reelection in evenly numbered years.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Eyes on Montana</h4>

	
<p>Robert Saldin, professor of political science at the University of Montana, said during an interview that Democratic Sen. Jon Tester will need to get voters in the state who support Trump to split their tickets if Tester is going to secure reelection.</p>
<p>“One of the secrets to Tester’s success over the years is that he has been able to distinguish himself from stereotypes of the national Democratic Party,” Saldin said. “And that’s going to be really important again, obviously, because Trump is on the ticket, and is certainly going to carry the state by a very wide margin.”</p>
<p>Republican challenger Tim Sheehy could potentially have a bit of an easier time getting elected this November in the deeply Republican state, he said.</p>
<p>“All he has to do is get people who are voting for Trump to also vote for him. And in fact, he can probably lose some tens of thousands of voters and still be okay,” Saldin said.</p>
<p>Sheehy, however, is somewhat disadvantaged by not having run in a competitive GOP primary, leaving him to move directly into a high-stakes general election.</p>
<p>“He is a political novice,” Saldin said. “He didn’t have a practice run in the primary. And here he is fresh out of the gate in one of the most expensive, most watched, most hyped Senate elections in the country. And so he’s having to learn as he goes.”</p>
<p>One factor that could benefit Tester over Sheehy is <a href="https://dailymontanan.com/2024/08/02/gianforte-revives-debunked-abortion-claim-for-ballot-initiative/" target="_blank">a ballot question addressing abortion access</a> in the state that is likely to go before voters in November, Saldin said.</p>
<p>“That should give at least a little nudge in the direction of the Democrats,” Saldin said.</p>
<p>A dozen other states have approved or could approve <a href="https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/dashboard/ballot-tracker-status-of-abortion-related-state-constitutional-amendment-measures/" target="_blank">abortion ballot questions</a>, including Arizona, Florida, Maryland and Nevada.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">In Ohio, edging away from national politics</h4>

	
<p>Paul A. Beck, academy professor of political science at The Ohio State University, said Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown has sought to separate himself from national political figures throughout this reelection bid.</p>
<p>“I think he really wants to make this a local contest, a statewide contest, not a national contest,” Beck said. “And so he’s going to do everything he can to not appear on the stage with the Democratic nominees for president, and everything he can to try to define himself as somebody who is above partisan politics.”</p>
<p>Brown was elected to the House in 1992 before winning election to the Senate in 2006. He secured reelection in 2012 and 2018, though Republican candidate Bernie Moreno is looking to end that streak this year.</p>
<p>Beck said <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2024/08/05/who-is-funding-ohios-redistricting-amendment/" target="_blank">a ballot question about redistricting</a> could help boost turnout, potentially increasing Brown’s chances.</p>
<p>“It’s going to energize voters and is going to produce higher turnout on the left than it will on the right, and that could be a factor in 2024,” Beck said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Incumbent clout</h4>

	
<p>Sitting members of Congress have historically held an advantage that may help the party that holds more members seeking to return to Capitol Hill for the 119th Congress.</p>
<p>“Reelection rates in the House have never dropped below 85%, and have recently stretched to highs of 98% in 2004 and 97% in 2016,” according to <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2023/10/incumbent-politicians-enjoy-record-reelection-in-aging-congress/" target="_blank">analysis</a> from Miro Hall-Jones at OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan organization that reports on the role of money in U.S. politics. “While the Senate is more susceptible to shifts in public opinion — reelection rates dropped as low as 50% in 1980 at the dawn of the Reagan Revolution — incumbent senators have retained their seats in 88% of races since 1990.”</p>
<p>Every single one of the 28 senators seeking reelection two years ago was able to convince voters in their home states to give them another term, marking the first time that has happened in American history, according to the analysis.</p>
<p>Michigan and Arizona Senate races could then present a bigger challenge for Democrats, since both those seats are open due to the upcoming retirements of Michigan Sen. Debbie Stabenow and Arizona independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema.</p>
<p>Michigan is currently rated as a toss-up by the Cook Political Report while Arizona is rated as “lean Democrat.”</p>
<p>In the House, the 11 seats held by Republicans and considered by the Cook Political Report <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/house-race-ratings" target="_blank">to be toss-ups</a> all are held by an incumbent seeking reelection, while two of the Democrats’ 11 toss-up seats are open.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">House majority</h4>

	
<p>The contest for who controls the House after November is “razor thin,” said Burgat from George Washington University. With Republicans holding on by a slim margin, Democrats only need a net gain of four seats to capture the majority.</p>
<p>“Whether it goes Democratic or Republican, it’s not going to be by much,” Burgat said.</p>
<p>While Democrats and Republicans will focus much of their attention on the 22 toss-up races, they’ll also be funneling resources toward the campaigns that are rated as only leaning in their direction, as opposed to being likely or solid seats.</p>
<p>The Cook Political Report has eight seats held by GOP lawmakers as leaning in Republicans’ favor while 14 races, all Democratic-held seats except one, are in districts that “lean Democrat.”</p>
<p>That makes a total of about 44 competitive House races, according to the Cook Political Report’s analysis.</p>
<p>Among the closely watched congressional districts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both parties are eyeing open seats in California, Colorado, Michigan and Virginia.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Michigan’s 7th and 8th districts, now held, respectively, by Democrats Elissa Slotkin, who is seeking the state’s open Senate seat, and the retiring Dan Kildee, are rated by the Cook Political Report as toss-ups.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Virginia’s 7th Congressional District, being vacated by Democrat Abigail Spanberger, who will focus on a run for governor, is expected to lean blue.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>California Democratic Rep. Katie Porter’s district also leans towards Democrats. Porter decided to leave the seat for an unsuccessful Senate run.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Colorado’s 3rd, abandoned by Republican Lauren Boebert, who shifted to a friendlier district, leans Republican, according to the Cook Political Report.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>One open seat each in Maryland and New Hampshire is rated as likely Democrat by the prognosticator.</li>
</ul>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">DCCC ads</h4>

	
<p>The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is throwing big money where races are competitive, zeroing in on 15 media markets including those in Arizona, Colorado, Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. The official campaign arm of House Democrats <a href="https://dccc.org/dccc-ie-reserves-28-million-in-first-round-of-tv-and-digital-ads-for-2024-cycle/" target="_blank">announced</a> a $28 million initial ad buy in June, spending double on digital ads compared to 2022, according to the organization.</p>
<p>The DCCC maintains that House Democrats “have always had multiple paths to reclaim the majority in November — including our 27 Red to Blue candidates in districts across the country working to defeat extreme Republicans who are out-of-touch with their communities,” spokesperson Viet Shelton told States Newsroom in a written statement.</p>
<p>Shelton said voters are “fed up with these politicians who are more interested in obeying Trump, voting for abortion bans, and giving tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations, while ignoring the needs of the middle class.”</p>
<p>The DCCC sees pickup opportunities in the 16 districts Biden won in 2020 that are currently held by Republicans.</p>
<p>Among them are five seats in California, four in New York, two in Arizona, and one each in New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Virginia. Nebraska also saw incumbent GOP Rep. Don Bacon’s district go to Biden.</p>
<p>The switch to Harris at the top of the Democratic ticket could boost challengers in heavily college-educated districts, according to the Cook Political Report’s latest analysis of the field.</p>
<p>Those include Arizona’s 1st Congressional District held by GOP Rep. David Schweikert, New Jersey’s 7th occupied by freshman Thomas Kean Jr., and New York’s 17th held by Mike Lawler, also in his first term. All are rated as Republican toss-ups by the Cook Political Report.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Frontline candidates</h4>

	
<p>But the DCCC campaign has vulnerable Democratic incumbents to worry about as well. The organization has identified 31 as “frontline” members, meaning their purple districts are what campaigners describe as “in play.”</p>
<p>Among them is 40-year Democrat Marcy Kaptur, who has held Ohio’s 9th Congressional District, in the state’s northwest region, since 1983.</p>
<p>Other vulnerable Democrats include Reps. Yadira Caraveo in Colorado’s 8th, Jared Golden in Maine’s 2nd, Don Davis in North Carolina’s 1st, Gabe Vasquez in New Mexico’s 2nd, Emilia Sykes in Ohio’s 13th, Susan Wild and Matt Cartwright in Pennsylvania’s 7th and 8th districts, and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez in Washington’s 3rd.</p>
<p>The National Republican Congressional Committee did not respond to requests for comment, but the House GOP campaign arm <a href="https://www.nrcc.org/2024/06/27/nrcc-ie-reserves-45-7-million-in-first-round-of-ad-reservations-to-grow-the-house-majority/" target="_blank">announced</a> in late June a $45.7 million initial ad buy across 29 media markets, with large chunks going to metro areas in Los Angeles; New York City; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Anchorage, Alaska; Denver, Colorado; Detroit, Michigan; Portland, Oregon; and Omaha, Nebraska.</p>
<p>The ad buy — an offensive “to grow our majority,” NRCC Chair Richard Hudson said in a press release — will specifically target 13 districts currently held by Democrats.</p>

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON —  The U.S. Department of Agriculture plans to embark on a year-long study beginning next month that will test samples for evidence of highly pathogenic avian influenza from former dairy cattle moved into meat production.</p>
<p>Emilio Esteban, the under secretary for food safety at the USDA, told reporters on a call Tuesday the new testing program follows three studies undertaken during the spring and summer that all found beef in the nation’s food supply is safe to eat.</p>
<p>“However, we want to move forward with an additional step,” Esteban said. “And what this means is that when those carcasses are tested, they are held and are not going to go into commerce until we get the results back.”</p>
<p>The virus, also referred to as bird flu or H5N1, has been found in wild bird and domestic poultry flocks within the United States for years. But the ongoing outbreak in dairy cattle has forced animal and human health experts to establish testing for a new community of agriculture workers and livestock.</p>
<p>The news of additional testing for the country’s meat supply came alongside the results of a study from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that reinforced the safety of pasteurized dairy products.</p>
<p>Steve Grube, chief medical officer for the FDA’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, said that the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/alerts-advisories-safety-information/updates-highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza-hpai#secondtesting" target="_blank">most recent round of dairy product testing</a> included 167 foods that were processed in 27 states in June and July.</p>
<p>“None of the product samples contained viable H5N1, reaffirming that pasteurization is effective,” he said. “The second survey was intended to address geographic and product gaps from the initial sampling of the commercial milk and dairy product supply that the FDA conducted during April and May.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Testing milk in bulk tanks</h4>

	
<p>Federal officials have also launched a voluntary program for farmers to test the milk in bulk tanks for H5N1, a step that’s intended to make it easier for them to move their cows between states without having to individually test each one.</p>
<p>Eric Deeble, deputy under secretary for marketing and regulatory programs at USDA, said the department’s Farm Service Agency has approved 23 of the 35 applications it has received so far to help ease the financial burden on dairy farmers who take their herds out of production after testing positive.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/disaster-assistance-program/emergency-assist-for-livestock-honey-bees-fish/index" target="_blank">program</a> — known as Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-raised Fish — has approved more than $1 million in payments.</p>
<p>The price paid to farmers is based on a formula that includes the price of milk from the preceding month as well as the number of dairy cattle that contract H5N1.</p>
<p>Deeble said on the call with reporters that of the approved applications, a dozen are from Colorado, which has seen a sharp increase in the number of positive H5N1 tests within its dairy industry.</p>
<p>Deeble argued the uptick is due to certain factors within the state and cautioned people against assuming that if testing was increased in other areas of the country, the number of positive H5N1 tests for dairy cattle would spike.</p>
<p>“I don’t think that it is accurate necessarily to extrapolate from the situation in Weld County, Colorado,” Deeble said. “Weld County and Colorado dairy in particular is rather unique in the degree to which the dairies are all closely associated with one another; both spatially and the way in which there is a lot of movement between the facilities.”</p>
<p>“It is a tightly integrated dairy community that’s isolated from much of the rest of the state, and there is a lot of connectivity between the premises in the way in which they use vehicles, support services, milk trucks,” Deeble added.</p>
<p>During the last 30 days, five states have had dairy cattle test positive for H5N1, including Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, South Dakota and Texas.</p>
<p>Colorado holds a disproportionate number of cases with 26 of the <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/hpai-confirmed-cases-livestock" target="_blank">dairy herds to test positive</a>, while the other four states combined hold a total of six herds.</p>
<p>Other mammals <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/mammals" target="_blank">diagnosed</a> with H5N1 during the last six weeks are overwhelmingly in Colorado, which has found the virus in house mice, deer mice, domestic cats, a desert cottontail and a prairie vole.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Effect on cats</h4>

	
<p>Public health officials said during the call Tuesday they are beginning to look more closely at when and why cats are being affected by the spread of H5N1.</p>
<p>Barn cats as well as those that hunt outside, coming into regular contact with wild birds that hold a reservoir of H5N1, have tested positive for the virus before.</p>
<p>But a <a href="https://www.colovma.org/cvma-news/influenza-a-highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza-h5n1-in-domestic-cats/" target="_blank">report</a> from the Colorado Veterinary Medical Association earlier this month noted that two of the six cats diagnosed with H5N1 in that state this year “were indoor only cats with no direct exposures to the virus.”</p>
<p>Public health officials on the call were unable to answer a question about how indoor-only cats would have come into contact with H5N1.</p>
<p>Experts on the call cautioned that as fall approaches, wild birds will begin migrating and dairy farmers will likely ship their cattle at higher rates, both of which could lead to an uptick in the number of positive cases of H5N1 being reported in dairy cattle as well as other animals.</p>

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)</p><p>Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz made his first solo campaign appearance as the Democratic vice presidential candidate Tuesday, telling a union audience in Los Angeles that the Democratic ticket led by Vice President Kamala Harris would prioritize worker-friendly policies.</p>
<p>Walz appeared to tailor most of his 20-minute speech to the audience of members of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, a 1.4-million-member union of public-sector workers.</p>
<p>Walz, who was a union member as a public school teacher in southern Minnesota before he won a U.S. House seat in 2006, praised the policies Harris championed as part of President Joe Biden’s administration, and those he pushed as Minnesota governor.</p>
<p>Walz and Harris come from working-class backgrounds, he said, noting that Harris worked at McDonald’s as a student.</p>
<p>“Vice President Harris took that work ethic, goes to work every single day to make sure families don’t just get by, but they get ahead,” he said.</p>
<p>Harris led the administration’s work to eliminate barriers to organizing and cast the tiebreaking vote in the U.S. Senate to pass the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill in 2021 that Walz said kept public-sector workers employed during the pandemic.</p>
<p>As governor, Walz said he made it easier to form unions, strengthened worker protections and banned “those damn captive audience meetings for good,” referring to meetings employers can mandate workers attend ahead of union votes to discourage support for organizing.</p>
<p>Both Walz and Harris have walked on picket lines with striking workers, he said.</p>
<p>Walz is the second person who has been a union member to appear on a presidential ticket since Ronald Reagan, who led the Screen Actors Guild before a career in politics, in 1984. Unlike the two-term Republican president, who engaged in a high-profile standoff with the federal air traffic controllers’ union, Walz told the audience he would not “lose (his) way” once elected.</p>
<p>Former President Donald Trump was also a member of SAG-AFTRA, the successor organization to the Screen Actors Guild, when he ran for president in 2016 and 2020. Trump, who was nominated by Republicans in July as their presidential candidate, is no longer a member.</p>
<p>Walz called on the union audience to get involved in campaign organizing, saying that if the group could mobilize friends and neighbors, it could make a difference in an election that could be decided by tens of thousands of votes in a few key states.</p>
<p>“This is going to be a close, tough race,” he said. “But if each of us does an extra shift, an extra hour, a little bit more, we get to wake up on that morning after the election and know that the work we did transformed the lives for millions, transformed generations, impacted the world.”</p>
<p>He closed with a campaign slogan Harris has been using, leading the crowd in a chant of, “When we fight, we win.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Attack on GOP</h4>

	
<p>Walz asked for organized labor to help turn out Democratic voters in November.</p>
<p>“I know I’m preaching to the choir a little bit today,” he said. “But the choir needs to sing.”</p>
<p>Trump and his running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, were “not in the choir” of union supporters, Walz said.</p>
<p>Trump has said he supports “right-to-work” laws that make union organizing difficult, Walz said.</p>
<p>Walz related a conversation he’d had with United Autoworkers President Shawn Fain in which the labor leader called Trump a derisive name for an anti-union worker over his position on such laws.</p>
<p>“I saw our friend Shawn Fain at the UAW had a name for that, he called him a scab,” Walz said. “That’s not name-calling, it’s an observation in fact, just to be clear.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Project 2025</h4>

	
<p>A second Trump administration would work to “put the screws to working people,” Walz said, noting that sections of the “Project 2025 to-do list” call for restricting union organizing and reducing overtime.</p>
<p>Project 2025 is a list of policy goals developed by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, with input from former Trump administration officials. Democrats have worked to tie Trump to the document they describe as radically conservative.</p>
<p>Trump has denied any involvement in its drafting and has not committed to working toward it if elected.</p>
<p>Walz, a former high school football coach, said Trump was “playing dumb” about the contents of Project 2025.</p>
<p>“I’m a football coach at heart,” he said. “I’ll tell you one thing I know for sure is, if you’re going to take the time to draw up a playbook, you’re damn sure going to use it.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Broader message</h4>

	
<p>Walz also peppered his remarks with messages seemingly meant for a broader general-election audience, advocating for reproductive rights and criticizing restrictions on book bans some Republican states have led against gender or race-based content and Trump’s position on cutting taxes for the wealthy.</p>
<p>Highlighting the campaign’s theme of freedom, Walz said the government should not be involved in “personal choices” about how to start a family, what books to read or whether to join a union.</p>
<p>“This country is great because we have a golden rule that makes things work. We mind our own damn business on those things,” he said.</p>
<p>He also defended against criticisms of his record in the Army National Guard that has come under scrutiny from Republicans, including Vance, who is a Marine Corps veteran. They have said Walz exaggerated his role and left his unit months before it was deployed to Iraq in 2005.</p>
<p>Walz said he was proud of his 24 years of service in the National Guard, which only ended in 2005 so he could run for Congress, where he joined the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee.</p>
<p>“I’m proud of my service to this country,” he said. “And I firmly believe you should never denigrate another person’s service record. Anyone brave enough to put on that uniform for our great country, including my opponent, I just have a few simple words: Thank you for your service and sacrifice.”</p>
<p><em>CLARIFICATION: An earlier version of this report said Walz was the first former union member since Ronald Reagan to appear on a presidential ticket, after he said during his speech he was the first union member since Reagan. He is the second person who has been a union member to be on a presidential ticket since 1984.</em></p>

(Photo by Jim Vondruska/Getty Images)</p><p>Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee for president, selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate Tuesday in a move meant to boost the Democratic ticket’s appeal in key Midwestern states and with blue-collar voters.</p>
<p>Walz, a former social studies teacher and Army National Guard veteran who won challenging elections in a rural U.S. House district before running for governor in 2018 and winning reelection in 2022, balances Harris geographically and demographically, while bringing a history of campaign wins in purple-to-red areas and a governing record among the most progressive of any contender to join the ticket.</p>
<p>“One of the things that stood out to me about Tim is how his convictions on fighting for middle class families run deep,” Harris wrote in a statement. “It’s personal. As a governor, a coach, a teacher, and a veteran, he’s delivered for working families like his own. We are going to build a great partnership. We start out as underdogs but I believe together, we can win this election.”</p>
<p>Walz was also seen as the preferred vice presidential pick of the party’s progressive wing, especially as an alternative to Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro. Harris <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/vp-speculation-hits-fever-pitch-harris-announcement-expected-very-soon" target="_blank">interviewed both governors</a>, and U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, in Washington Sunday as she whittled down her shortlist.</p>
<p>Little known until recently outside his home state to all but the closest political observers, Walz’s laid-back style and approachable demeanor — and straightforward attacks on Republican rivals Donald Trump and J.D. Vance — over weeks of consistent national TV appearances won praise from Democratic officials and strategists who have struggled to break Trump’s hold over white voters without college degrees.</p>
<p>Walz, 60, emerged in recent weeks as one of the party’s top communicators through the power of a single adjective for Republicans and their policy goals.</p>
<p>“These are weird people on the other side,” Walz said in a July 23 interview on MSNBC. “They want to take books away, they want to be in your exam room … These are weird ideas.”</p>
<p>Despite the best efforts of President Joe Biden’s abandoned reelection bid to describe Republicans under Trump’s leadership as a threat to U.S. democracy and reproductive rights who couldn’t be trusted to responsibly govern, the attacks didn’t stick and Trump continued to climb in the polls.</p>
<p>But shortly after Biden’s July 21 exit from the race, Democrats embraced the succinct message that has been credited to the Minnesota governor.</p>
<p>“I am loving Tim Walz on TV,” Rebecca Pearcey, a Democratic strategist, told States Newsroom in a July interview on potential vice presidential picks for Harris.</p>
<p>“I love that he’s just so down-to-earth and so pithy and that he’s like, ‘These guys are weird,’” she added. “That’s exactly it — we are overcomplicating what this message has to be.”</p>
<p>In a statement, Shapiro said he was grateful to have been considered for Harris’ running mate and would continue his work as governor, calling that role “the highest honor” of his life.</p>
<p>Shapiro congratulated Walz, saying he would be an “exceptionally strong addition to the ticket.” He said he would work to help the Harris-Walz ticket win in November.</p>
<p>“Vice President Kamala Harris has my enthusiastic support – and I know that Governor Tim Walz is an exceptionally strong addition to the ticket who will help Kamala move our country forward,” he wrote. “Over the next 92 days, I look forward to traveling all across the Commonwealth to unite Pennsylvanians behind Kamala Harris’ campaign to defeat Donald Trump, become the 47th President of the United States, and build a better future for our country.”</p>
<p>According to his official schedule, Shapiro is scheduled to speak at Walz’s first public appearance with Harris, a rally in Philadelphia Tuesday evening.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Far-left radical’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Shortly after reports of the Walz choice surfaced, Trump’s campaign blasted him in a statement that sought to undercut his appeal to rural Midwestern voters and tie him to Harris’ Bay Area background, potentially previewing the attacks Walz will see throughout the three months leading up to Election Day.</p>
<p>“It’s no surprise that San Francisco Liberal Kamala Harris wants West Coast wannabe Tim Walz as her running-mate – Walz has spent his governorship trying to reshape Minnesota in the image of the Golden State,” Trump campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.</p>
<p>“If Walz won’t tell voters the truth, we will: just like Kamala Harris, Tim Walz is a dangerously liberal extremist, and the Harris-Walz California dream is every American’s nightmare.”</p>
<p>Leavitt highlighted Walz’s signature on a bill to require the state move to 100% non-carbon energy by 2040.</p>
<p>A political action committee associated with Trump also slammed the Minnesota governor.</p>
<p>A written statement from MAGA Inc. criticized Walz’s positions on transgender rights and immigration, as well as his response to the riots in Minneapolis after police there killed George Floyd, an unarmed Black man.</p>
<p>The PAC also sought to tie Walz to a federal fraud case in the state that saw <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2024/06/07/five-feeding-our-future-defendants-found-guilty-two-acquitted-in-sprawling-fraud-case/" target="_blank">five convicted</a> in federal court of taking federal COVID-19 relief money intended to feed needy children. The case dealt with a nonprofit, but a June report from the state auditor found the state’s Department of Education failed to properly oversee the federal payments.</p>
<p>“Governor Tim Walz and Kamala Harris will get along just great,” the statement said. “They’re both far-left radicals that don’t know how to govern.”</p>
<p>Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who is also from San Francisco, said in an appearance on MSNBC’s Morning Joe on Tuesday that characterizations of Walz as far-left were “mystifying.”</p>
<p>“To characterize him as left is so unreal,” Pelosi <a href="https://x.com/Morning_Joe/status/1820815933637537872" target="_blank">said</a>. “He’s right down the middle. He’s a heartland-of-America Democrat.”</p>
<p>As the top Democrat on the U.S. House Veterans Affairs Committee, Walz made “tremendous, tremendous gains” for veterans, Pelosi said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Communicating rural values</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Walz, who grew up in a rural community in Nebraska, has slammed national Republicans for a relentless focus on cultural issues. He’s trained that criticism recently on Vance, a U.S. senator from Ohio whose rise to Republican vice presidential nominee was built on his controversial book detailing the lives of people in impoverished rural areas of Kentucky.</p>
<p>Vance and Republicans have “obsessions” with taking away rights, Walz has said, especially related to reproductive rights and education that includes discussion of gender and sexuality.</p>
<p>“The golden rule that makes small towns work so we’re not at each other’s throats all the time in a little town is: Mind your own damn business,” Walz told MSNBC’s Jen Psaki on July 25. “I don’t need him (Vance) to tell me about my family, I don’t need him to tell me about my wife’s health care and her reproductive rights, I don’t need him telling my children what books to read.”</p>
<p>Walz instead projects a pragmatic vision of Democratic governance.</p>
<p>“They scream socialism, we just build roads and we build schools and we build prosperity into this,” he told Psaki.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Working-class message</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>As governor, Walz has notched a series of policy wins he can boast to the party’s progressive wing about. He signed laws to offer free meals to all public school students, expand abortion access and legalize some recreational uses of THC.</p>
<p>But the sometimes bespectacled former high school teacher and football coach, who has donned t-shirts and hunting caps in national TV hits, also projects an image of Midwestern pragmatism.</p>
<p>That may help balance voters’ views of a Democratic ticket led by Harris, who would be the first woman president, the first president of South Asian descent and the second Black president, and who is seen as more liberal than most in the party after climbing the ranks through Democratic primaries in California.</p>
<p>Christopher Devine, a political scientist at the University of Dayton, said Walz’s appeal is not unlike that of Harris’ last running mate.</p>
<p>“Walz has a message that kind of reminds me of Joe Biden’s appeal, kind of a working-class focus,” he said. “He can speak from a rural background, he’s been a teacher and a coach and has a military background as well. He seems to me like he’s someone who could maybe help with kind of a working-class message.”</p>
<p>The campaign will depend on Walz to carry that message to neighboring Wisconsin and other crucial Rust Belt states such as Michigan and Pennsylvania.</p>

(Photo by Jemal Countess/Getty Images for Community Change)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans and two independents blocked a bipartisan tax package Thursday that would have temporarily expanded the child tax credit and revived tax breaks for some business activities.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1182/vote_118_2_00230.htm" target="_blank">48-44</a> procedural vote to advance the package was largely viewed as a messaging exercise by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer ahead of the August recess and continued ramp up to the general election in November, when the presidency and control of Congress are on the line. Virginia Democratic U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine cast a &#8220;yea&#8217; vote to advance the measure, while Virginia&#8217;s U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, also a Democrat, did not vote.</p>
<p>The vote on the tax bill was the Senate’s last until it returns in September. The House left for August recess a full week ahead of the Senate.</p>
<p>During a post-vote press conference, Schumer said, “American families lost.”</p>
<p>“Today, Senate Republicans boldly told the American people we refuse to help you in 2024, and we want to be frank, Republicans voted no because of partisanship, not policy,” the New York Democrat said.</p>
<p>Not all Senate Republicans voted against the bill. Those who voted yes included: Sens. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, Josh Hawley of Missouri and Rick Scott of Florida.</p>
<p>Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, independents who generally caucus with the Democrats, voted no.</p>
<p>Schumer switched his vote from yes to no as a way to enter a motion to reconsider, a routine maneuver.</p>
<p>Eight senators did not vote Thursday, including Democrat John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, and Republicans Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, John Hoeven of North Dakota, Mitt Romney of Utah, Tim Scott of South Carolina, Warner, and Republican vice presidential candidate and Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance. <a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2024/07/16/sen-menendez-convicted-of-bribery-other-charges-in-corruption-trial/#:~:text=Bob%20Menendez%20was%20convicted%20Tuesday,%E2%80%9Cshocking%20levels%20of%20corruption.%E2%80%9D" target="_blank">Convicted felon</a> and soon-to-be <a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2024/07/23/sen-menendez-to-resign-ending-storied-career-capped-by-bribery-conviction/#:~:text=Gray%2FGetty%20Images)-,Sen.,was%20convicted%20on%20corruption%20charges." target="_blank">former</a> Democrat Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey also did not vote.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Show vote,’ Republicans say</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>A large swath of Senate Republicans, including their top tax writer, Mike Crapo of Idaho, the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Finance, has remained opposed to the legislation, which needed 60 votes to advance in the closely divided upper chamber.</p>
<p>Crapo panned the cloture vote on the floor ahead of time as a “doomed-to-fail show vote” that is “focused on election year messaging.”</p>
<p>“If the Democrats are serious about helping these working families, I’m ready to push for an extension of those changes beyond 2025. I’ve maintained a willingness to negotiate a bill that provides meaningful relief to Americans now,” Crapo said.</p>
<p>Taxation has risen on the list of campaign issues as the Trump-era tax law is set to expire at the end of 2025, teeing up a major debate for the next administration and Congress.</p>
<p>“I offered to make changes,” Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat and chair of the Senate Finance Committee, said on the floor ahead of the vote. “I met with a significant number of Senate Republicans personally.”</p>
<p>“This is a thoroughly bipartisan bill — 357 votes in the House of Representatives. Every Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee voted for this bill.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Child tax credit and the campaigns</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In a recent interview with news personality Megyn Kelly, Vance accused the likely Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, of being opposed to the child tax credit, a statement that has been <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/jul/30/jd-vance/kamala-harris-has-worked-to-expand-the-child-tax-c/" target="_blank">debunked</a>.</p>
<p>Democrats, including Harris, are <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/06/21/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-at-child-tax-credit-event/" target="_blank">on</a> <a href="https://x.com/VP/status/1767697362334400984" target="_blank">the</a> <a href="https://x.com/VP/status/1634690668164677633" target="_blank">record</a> advocating for a permanent expanded child tax credit similar to the pandemic-era version — a poverty reducer, according to census <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/working-papers/2022/demo/SEHSD-wp2022-24.html" target="_blank">data</a> — that eliminated the income requirement, raised the amount per child and provided the refund in monthly installments.</p>
<p>The Democratic Party immediately pounced on the absence of Vance from Thursday’s vote.</p>
<p>“When the American people vote in November, they’ll remember that when Vance had a chance to show up for working families, he was nowhere to be found,” Democratic National Committee spokesperson Aida Ross said in a statement after the vote.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Temporary tax cuts for families, businesses</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7024" target="_blank">bicameral, bipartisan package</a> brokered by Wyden and Missouri’s Rep. Jason Smith, chair of the GOP-led House Committee on Ways and Means, received overwhelming approval in the House in January in a  <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/202430" target="_blank">357-70</a> vote.</p>
<p>The lawmakers hailed their formula to pay for the bill by clawing back a fraud-ridden <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/understanding-the-employee-retention-credit-offset-in-the-bipartisan-tax-bill/" target="_blank">pandemic tax break</a>. However, the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget <a href="https://www.crfb.org/blogs/how-much-would-wyden-smith-tax-deal-cost" target="_blank">warned</a> that the policies “would add significantly to the already massive federal debt” if extended beyond their 2025 expiration dates.</p>
<p>The legislation would have <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/congress-looking-expanding-child-tax-credit-again-who-would-benefit" target="_blank">increased</a> the current $2,000 child tax credit through 2025 by adjusting it for inflation to $2,100 and raising the refundability limit — the actual amount families could see in their tax refunds — to $1,800 for tax year 2023, $1,900 for 2024 and $2,000 for 2025, up from the current $1,600 cap.</p>
<p>Additionally the bill includes a provision that would allow families to claim a previous year’s income, if higher than the current year, when calculating the tax credit — a measure that <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/expanded-child-tax-credit-stranded-us-senate-gop-comparisons-welfare" target="_blank">drew fierce opposition</a> from Senate Republicans who likened it to welfare.</p>
<p>The bill also would have temporarily restored business’ ability to fully expense domestic research and development as well as immediately deducting 100% of equipment purchases and other investments the same year of the transaction  — both <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-a-comparison-for-businesses" target="_blank">incentives</a> under the 2017 Trump tax law that have phased out or are phasing out incrementally.</p>
<p>Business owners, CEOs and a union official <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/business-owners-union-leader-urge-us-senate-move-ahead-soon-stalled-tax-package" target="_blank">urged</a> the Senate Finance Committee in March to move forward on the bill.</p>
<p>Also included in the legislation: increasing the amount of low-income housing tax credits, relieving double taxation for residents of Taiwan, and <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/one-year-after-ohio-train-derailment-congress-mulling-tax-break-relief-payments" target="_blank">tax exemption for relief payments</a> to victims of the massive 2023 train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio — though the IRS largely took care of this <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-many-payments-to-individuals-affected-by-east-palestine-train-disaster-are-tax-free-new-guidance-could-help-those-in-ohio-pennsylvania-west-virginia#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20%E2%80%94%20The%20Internal%20Revenue%20Service,%2C%20Ohio%2C%20are%20not%20taxable." target="_blank">in June</a>.</p>
<p>Supporters of the legislation range from the Business Roundtable, which represents American CEOs, to the Economic Security Project, an organization that advocates for increased tax credits and guaranteed basic income initiatives.</p>
<p>Anna Aurilio, senior campaign director for Economic Security Project Action, said in a statement following the vote that Republican senators were “selfishly picking politics over parents and brazenly disregarding this important opportunity to help families succeed right now.”</p>
<p>“The expanded Child Tax Credit was a critical tool for millions of parents who were struggling to afford the necessities and should be made permanent in the 2025 tax reform fight,” Aurilio said.</p>

Ford/Maryland Matters)</p><p>CHICAGO — Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump Wednesday underwent questioning from a National Association of Black Journalists panel in a turbulent session during which he falsely claimed Vice President Kamala Harris “happened to turn Black” during her political career.</p>
<p>Through the roughly 35-minute combative event, the former president rarely answered questions, lied and exaggerated, attacked Harris, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, and criticized one of the Black journalists interviewing him, ABC News correspondent Rachel Scott.</p>
<p>“I think it’s disgraceful that I came here in good spirit,” Trump said. “I love the Black population of this country.”</p>
<p>The discussion was also moderated by Kadia Goba, a politics reporter at Semafor, and Harris Faulkner, a Fox News anchor.</p>
<p>Many NABJ members strongly opposed Trump’s visit, especially <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/what-a-stupid-question-trump-demeans-three-black-female-reporters-in-two-days/2018/11/09/272113d0-e441-11e8-b759-3d88a5ce9e19_story.html" target="_blank">given his treatment of high-profile Black women</a> journalists, and the announcement of his appearance sparked a major backlash. Members were also critical about the lack of transparency around the invitation to Trump and the inclusion of a moderator from the conservative Fox network.</p>
<p>Trump attacked ABC’s Scott and called her questions “rude” and her media outlet a “fake news network.”</p>
<p>Scott asked Trump why Black voters should trust him, especially after Trump has made false claims that political rivals such as former President Barack Obama were not born in the United States, has <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/trump-dines-with-white-supremacist-renewing-questions-about-gops-leadership-and-values" target="_blank">dined with a white supremacist</a> at his Florida residence and has slammed Black journalists.</p>
<p>“I don’t think I’ve ever been asked a question in such a horrible manner,” Trump said.</p>

<p>Scott pressed Trump about Republican members of Congress who have referred to Harris, who is the first Black woman and woman of Asian American descent to serve as vice president, as a so-called DEI hire. She asked if that was acceptable language.</p>
<p>Trump didn’t answer the question and asked Scott to define DEI, which she said stood for diversity, equity and inclusion.</p>
<p>Trump then questioned whether Harris was Black.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black and now she wants to be known as Black,” Trump said. “So I don’t know, is she Indian or is she Black?”</p>
<p>Harris attended Howard University, a historically Black college in Washington, D.C., and is a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc., a historic Black sorority. Her father is Jamaican, and her late mother was an Indian immigrant.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Harris in Houston</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Harris, who was endorsed by President Joe Biden after he bowed out of a reelection campaign, was invited by NABJ to take questions as well, but her confirmation is pending, the organization said. She was traveling Wednesday to Houston for events including a campaign stop.</p>
<p>NABJ President Kenneth Lemon said that the organization is working on a virtual session with Harris in September.</p>
<p>On Trump’s participation in the panel, Harris campaign Black Media Director Jasmine Harris, who is not related to the vice president, said in a statement, “Let’s remember exactly who this man is.”</p>
<p>“Not only does Donald Trump have a history of demeaning NABJ members and honorees who remain pillars of the Black press, he also has a history of attacking the media and working against the vital role the press play in our democracy,” she said.</p>
<p>Harris campaign Communications Director Michael Tyler said in a statement that Trump’s behavior during the interview was hostile.</p>
<p>“Trump lobbed personal attacks and insults at Black journalists the same way he did throughout his presidency – while he failed Black families and left the entire country digging out of the ditch he left us in,” Tyler said. “Donald Trump has already proven he cannot unite America, so he attempts to divide us.”</p>
<p>White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, asked at the White House press briefing about Trump’s visit to the convention, said, “That’s a campaign stop for him.”</p>
<p>The Trump campaign has used the invitation to argue that the former president has <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/news/98364d47-2468-4df3-a21b-43517338eb12" target="_blank">grown support among Black voters.</a> Before Biden suspended his campaign in mid-July, a majority of Black voters aligned with voting for Biden, about 77%, and about 18% of Black voters indicated they would vote for Trump in the 2024 presidential election, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/race-and-ethnicity/2024/05/20/an-early-look-at-black-voters-views-on-biden-trump-and-election-2024/" target="_blank">according to a May Pew Research Center report</a>.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">NABJ fact-checking</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In an email to members Wednesday morning, Lemon stressed that the organization’s invitation was not an endorsement and that there would be <a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2024/jul/31/live-trump-fact-check-nabj-convention/" target="_blank">live fact-checking from PolitiFact</a> during the session. Members who attended were not allowed to ask questions.</p>
<p>“While we acknowledge the concerns expressed by our members, we believe it is important for us to provide our members with the opportunity to hear directly from candidates and hold them accountable,” Lemon said. “We also want to provide our members with the facts.”’</p>
<p>Nichelle Smith, an independent investigative journalist from Virginia, said after the panel that it was clear where Trump stood with the Black community.</p>
<p>“I thought he was horribly rude to Rachel Scott and I commend her and the other woman on the panel for not soft balling and asking hard questions out the gate because I doubt he has rarely been confronted with hard questions by Black women,” she said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">NABJ tradition</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Inviting a presidential candidate during an election year is an NABJ tradition since 1976. Former presidents have attended and participated in either a press conference or other question-and-answer formats, such as George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Obama. In 2016, <a href="https://www.poynter.org/reporting-editing/2016/journalists-grill-hillary-clinton-at-nabjnahj-conference/" target="_blank">Hillary Clinton attended</a>, but Trump, who was also invited, did not.</p>
<p>The announcement late Monday that Trump would show up caused a firestorm among NABJ members. Karen Attiah, a columnist with the Washington Post, resigned from her position as NABJ Convention Co-chair.</p>
<p>“While my decision was influenced by a variety of factors, I was not involved or consulted with in any way with the decision to platform Trump in such a format,” Attiah, who was the 2019 NABJ Journalist of the Year, said.</p>
<p>April Ryan, a White House correspondent for TheGrio, a media company geared toward Black Americans, and NABJ’s 2017 Journalist of the Year, objected to the session<a href="https://x.com/AprilDRyan/status/1818280170077196559" target="_blank"> in a social media post.</a></p>
<p>“The reports of attacks on Black women White House correspondents by the then president of the United States are not myth or conjecture, but fact,” she said.</p>
<p>During his first term, Trump often sparred with the White House press corps, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/09/business/media/trump-retaliation-reporters-april-ryan.html" target="_blank">he was particularly harsh when it came to Black women</a> journalists, such as Ryan, Abby Phillip from CNN and Yamiche Alcindor, a White House correspondent for PBS.</p>
<p>Ryan, who typically bore the brunt of those attacks, said the decision to hold a panel with Trump was “a slap in the face to the Black women journalists … who had to protect themselves from the wrath of this Republican presidential nominee who is promoting an authoritarian agenda that plans to destroy this nation and her democracy with his Project 2025.”</p>
<p>Editorial Director of Epicenter NYC Femi Redwood, who chairs NABJ’s LGBTQ+ task force, <a href="https://x.com/femiredwood/status/1818310461462339848" target="_blank">wrote in </a>a social media post that the panel was not made aware of Trump’s invite and objected, “considering the damage he has caused Black queer and trans people — including those who are journalists and members of NABJ.”</p>
<p>“I’m disappointed that in a space where so many queer and trans members still feel vulnerable will now feel even more unsafe due to Trump being invited and the possibility of his most vicious followers coming to the hotel to support him,” she said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Some defenders</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Some NABJ members did defend the decision, such as Leroy Chapman Jr., the editor-in-chief of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.</p>
<p>“Here is what we need to ‘normalize’ — candidates for office standing before journalists, answering questions,” he said <a href="https://x.com/AJCLeroyChapman/status/1818236975062634621" target="_blank">in a social media post.</a></p>
<p>A handful of pro-Trump supporters were able to attend the event, such as radio personality P Rae Easley of Chicago, who cheered when Trump went on stage.</p>
<p>In a States Newsroom interview, she said that Trump has done a lot for the Black community.</p>
<p>“You got to be a fool to continue to support the policies” of the Biden administration, she said.</p>
<p>Goba asked about Trump’s support for giving police officers immunity. She asked about Sonya Massey, an unarmed Black woman who called 911 for help and was shot and killed by a deputy.</p>
<p>“Why should someone like that officer get immunity?” Goba asked.</p>
<p>Trump said that he didn’t know the case well and said an officer could make an “innocent mistake.”</p>
<p>“Sometimes very bad decisions are made, they’re not made from an evil standpoint, but they’re made from the standpoint of they made a mistake,” Trump said.</p>
<p>Scott, who covers Congress, asked about the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol and about the law enforcement officers who were injured by the mob of pro-Trump supporters. She asked Trump if Jan. 6 rioters who have been convicted in the courts should be pardoned.</p>
<p>Trump didn’t answer the question and brought up Minnesota, criticizing protests there and across the nation that erupted after a video was publicized showing a white police officer kneeling on the neck of George Floyd, a Black man, who died.</p>
<p>The officer, Derek Chauvin, was later convicted of murder.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">J.D. Vance questions </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Goba asked Trump about his running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, and his comments demeaning single women, calling them “childless cat ladies.”</p>
<p>Trump never answered the question and went off-topic, attacking Democrats and <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/apr/08/donald-trump/donald-trump-explains-his-abortion-policy-with-fal/" target="_blank">falsely claiming that they were allowing abortions after birth</a>.</p>
<p>Scott also asked Trump about comments Vance has made about how people with children should be allowed to have more votes than those without.</p>
<p>“One of the bedrock principles of American life is, one person, one vote,” Scott said. “I just want to be clear here, is that the position of your campaign?”</p>
<p>Trump said that the campaign did not believe families should receive more votes and defended Vance.</p>
<p>“He is very family oriented,” Trump said.</p>
<p>Trump then veered into immigration and <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/jan/12/donald-trump/trumps-claim-that-millions-of-immigrants-are-signi/" target="_blank">falsely claimed that noncitizens were voting in federal elections</a>, which is already illegal and rarely happens.</p>
<p>After the event, Trump Senior Advisor Lynne Patton issued a statement, criticizing the media for “unprofessional commentary directed toward” the former president.</p>
<p>“Today’s biased and rude treatment from certain hostile members of the media will backfire massively,” Patton said. “This will be their undoing in 2024.”</p>

(Photo by Octavio Jones/Getty Images)</p><p>Voter intimidation, an exodus of election workers fed up with harassment and continued misinformation and disinformation campaigns threaten the integrity of the November elections, officials with the government watchdog group Common Cause said Tuesday.</p>
<p>This year will be the first presidential election since “the big lie,” Common Cause President Virginia Kase Solomón said on a video call with reporters.</p>
<p>She was referring to the effort by then-President Donald Trump and his allies to undermine Trump’s reelection loss in 2020 by promoting a series of unfounded conspiracy theories and encouraging supporters to obstruct Congress’ certification of the results on Jan. 6, 2021.</p>
<p>Common Cause is a nonpartisan organization and Solomón and other speakers did not mention Trump, who is again the Republican nominee for president, by name.</p>
<p>But Solomón said the country’s election integrity was damaged by the 2020 experience, with many veteran election workers opting to leave the profession rather than deal with the threats and harassment from believers in election conspiracies.</p>
<p>“We’re still living with the legacy of those lies,” she said. “They’ve undermined the faith of many Americans in our elections and fed anger and heated rhetoric … Those lies have also led to threats and harassment to election officials who have seen massive turnover in their ranks.”</p>
<p>On top of those challenges, election workers and voters also must deal this cycle with improving generative artificial intelligence tools that make disinformation easier than ever, Common Cause experts said.</p>
<p>And state laws, such as a measure that went into effect in Florida after the 2022 elections to cancel automatic delivery of vote-by-mail ballots, promise further confusion and disenfranchisement, they said.</p>
<p>To combat those threats to election integrity, the group is gearing up for campaign-season education drives.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Threats of violence</h4>

	
<p>Instances of actual political violence remain rare, said Suzanne Almeida, a Common Cause director of state operations who also leads the group’s work on political violence.</p>
<p>But threats, militant language, doxing and other harassment continue, Almeida said.</p>
<p>That has affected election workers, with a recent<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/poll-election-officials-finds-concerns-about-safety-political" target="_blank"> study</a> from the left-leaning Brennan Center for Justice finding that 38% of election workers had experienced threats and more than half of local election officials feared for their safety.</p>
<p>While surveys, including a recent University of California-Davis<a href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/news/headlines/new-study-looks-at-attitudes-towards-political-violence/2023/09" target="_blank"> study</a>, show that voters of both parties reject political violence, “candidates who have large platforms” have used them to drive turnout, Almeida said.</p>
<p>“We are seeing the normalization of hate, violent rhetoric, violent threats and harassment as a viable political strategy,” she said.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Trump campaign did not respond to a message seeking comment Tuesday.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">AI and misinformation</h4>

	
<p>Intentional efforts to disinform voters and accidental spreading of misinformation remain a growing problem, Common Cause’s media and democracy program director Ishan Mehta said.</p>
<p>The expansion and improvement of generative artificial intelligence makes it easier to create and spread fraudulent campaign content.</p>
<p>“The ubiquity of these tools means that you don’t have to be a computer expert anymore to have misinformation that would convince a lot, over half the population,” Mehta said.</p>
<p>Social media platforms that surged misinformation enforcement after Jan. 6 have now backed off enforcing misinformation, he said.</p>
<p>Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of X, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/27/us/politics/elon-musk-kamala-harris-deepfake.html" target="_blank">tweeted</a> a doctored video of likely Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris over the weekend. Musk, who has endorsed Trump, bought the platform in 2022. He boasts 192 million followers.</p>

    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Deploying poll monitors</h4>

	
<p>While predicting widespread violence on Election Day would not happen, Common Cause Pennsylvania Executive Director Philip Hensley-Robin anticipated some instances of political violence or intimidation.</p>
<p>The group would send “hundreds of poll monitors” across the commonwealth to record such instances, with monitors who will also be trained in deescalation, he said.</p>
<p>Hensley-Robin began his remarks by acknowledging the “tragic events” of the assassination attempt on Trump at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, but said the “isolated incident” would not deter voters from turning out.</p>
<p>He also anticipated that some would mount “spurious” lawsuits to “disenfranchise voters and undermine public confidence” in the election, but predicted those would be quickly dismissed.</p>
<p>Trump’s campaign lost scores of lawsuits challenging 2020 election results.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Voter outreach</h4>

	
<p>Solomón said Common Cause would be reminding voters to be on the lookout for misinformation and disinformation, especially from AI, and that it’s likely Election Day will end without a clear winner in the presidential race, a situation that has encouraged conspiracy theories about election fraud.</p>
<p>“That’s not a sign that anything is wrong,” she said.</p>
<p>The group will also be in touch with election workers to understand their needs and to offer assistance, she said.</p>
<p>She added that democracy had to be proactive.</p>
<p>“In the 2020 election, I think there was a false narrative that came out of that, and that was that democracy held and did what it was supposed to do,” she said. “And one of the things that I like to remind people of is that democracy did not hold. We made it hold.”</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — Legislation aimed at protecting children online sailed through the U.S. Senate Tuesday, marking what could be the first update since the late 1990s for companies who interact with minors on the internet.</p>
<p>Senators approved the package of two bills in <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1182/vote_118_2_00221.htm" target="_blank">a 91-3 vote</a>, a rare bipartisan landslide in the tightly divided body, despite loud and fervent opposition from civil liberties and LGBTQ organizations that say the measures would hand the government power to subjectively censor content.</p>
<p>The three no votes were cast by Republicans Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky and Democrat Ron Wyden of Oregon.</p>
<p>If passed by the House, the <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/protection-kids-social-media-platforms-advances-us-senate" target="_blank">legislative package would require</a> producers of platforms popular among children and teens to follow new rules governing advertising, algorithms and collection of personal data.</p>
<p>House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has expressed interest in “working to find consensus in the House.”</p>
<p>President Joe Biden released a statement Tuesday calling the Senate vote a “crucial bipartisan step forward” and said the bill dovetails with measures he advocated for in his first State of the Union Address.</p>
<p>“There is undeniable evidence that social media and other online platforms contribute to our youth mental health crisis. Today our children are subjected to a wild west online and our current laws and regulations are insufficient to prevent this. It is past time to act,” Biden said, adding that tech companies need to be “accountable for the national experiment they are running on our children for profit.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Families asked for federal help</h4>

	
<p>The package contains two bills moving together: the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/1628/cosponsors?s=1&amp;r=1&amp;q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22children+and+teens+online+privacy+protection+act%22%2C%22children%22%2C%22and%22%2C%22teens%22%2C%22online%22%2C%22privacy%22%2C%22protection%22%2C%22act%22%5D%7D" target="_blank">Children and Teens Online Privacy Protection Act</a>, which is mainly targeted at regulating the collection of personal data, and the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/1409/cosponsors" target="_blank">Kids Online Safety Act</a>, a bill that has been a lightning rod of criticism from outside groups.</p>
<p>A bipartisan group of senators points to <a href="https://www.congress.gov/event/117th-congress/senate-event/330808/text" target="_blank">years</a> <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-takes-aim-fake-pills-containing-deadly-fentanyl-sold-social-media" target="_blank">of</a> <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/committee-activity/hearings/big-tech-and-the-online-child-sexual-exploitation-crisis" target="_blank">hearings</a> and meetings with tragedy-struck families — including those whose children struggled with eating disorders and died by suicide — as the motivation behind the proposals.</p>
<p>Sen. Marsha Blackburn, of Tennessee, one of the Kids Online Safety Act’s original sponsors, said the legislation is a “safety by design bill, a duty of care bill that gives kids and parents a toolbox so that they can protect themselves.”</p>
<p>“A message that we’re sending to big tech: kids are not your product, kids are not your profit source, and we are going to protect them in the virtual space,” Blackburn, a Republican, said at a press conference following the vote.</p>
<p>Blackburn co-led the bill dubbed the Kids Online Safety Act with Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut.</p>
<p>Sen. Ed Markey, who championed the last protections passed by Congress in late 1990s, said “back in 1998 only birds tweeted, a gram was a measurement of weight, and so we need to update the law.”</p>
<p>The Massachusetts Democrat joined Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana in co-sponsoring the Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act.</p>
<p>Markey likened addictive social media products to those of the tobacco industry in previous decades, and cited public health warnings attributing increasing childhood mental health issues to the platforms.</p>
<p>“So we have to give the tools to parents and to teenagers and children to be able to protect themselves, and that would be my message to my colleagues in the House. We cannot avoid this historic moment,” Markey said at the press conference.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer praised the legislation’s passage in the Senate and said the parents of affected teens are “the reason we succeeded today.”</p>
<p>“I’ve heard the terrible stories: children, teenagers, perfectly normal, then some algorithm captures them online by accident, and they end up committing suicide shortly thereafter,” the New York Democrat said in a statement. “You imagine being a parent and living with that.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">New rules for platforms</h4>

	
<p>The original two bills, rolled into one legislative vehicle, respectively outline “duty of care” rules requiring platform creators to consider broad mental health categories when designing and operating their products as well as a prohibition of the use of personal data for targeted marketing.</p>
<p>The legislation would also mandate that platforms create an “easy-to-understand privacy dashboard” detailing how a minor’s personal information is collected, used and protected.</p>
<p>Other measures would include a prohibition on hidden algorithms, mechanisms for minors or parents to remove data, parental controls to restrict financial transactions and annual public reports from the platforms on “reasonably foreseeable” harms to children and teens and efforts underway to prevent them.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Enforcement</h4>

	
<p>The new policies, if enacted, would be enforced by the Federal Trade Commission and any civil actions would be prosecuted by states in U.S. district court with advance notice to the FTC.</p>
<p>The legislation defines the online platforms as public-facing websites, social media applications, video games, messaging applications or video streaming services that are “used, or reasonably likely to be used, by a minor.”</p>
<p>Snap, the company behind the popular platform Snapchat, issued a statement specifically praising the Senate’s passage of the Kids Online Safety Act.</p>
<p>“The safety and well-being of young people on Snapchat is a top priority,” a Snap spokesperson said in a statement provided to States Newsroom. “That’s why Snap has been a long-time supporter of the Kids Online Safety Act. We applaud Senators Blackburn, Blumenthal and the roughly 70 other co-sponsors of this critical legislation for their leadership and commitment to the privacy and safety of young people.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Opponents see ‘dangerous’ measure</h4>

	
<p>A coalition of organizations advocating for First Amendment rights, privacy and the interests of LGBTQ minors urged the House to vote no on the legislation, criticizing it as “blatantly unconstitutional.”</p>
<p>Evan Greer, director of the tech policy group Fight For the Future, also lambasted the bill as “dangerous and misguided” and “wildly broad.”</p>
<p>The coalition largely takes issue with the Kids Online Safety Act’s “duty of care” provision that requires companies to “prevent and mitigate” harms associated with anxiety, depression, eating disorders, substance use disorders and suicidal behaviors.</p>
<p>During a joint virtual press conference hosted by the groups during the Senate vote, Greer described the provision as “a blank check for censorship of any piece of content that an administration could claim is harmful to kids.”</p>
<p>“What that means in practice, is that for example, a Trump administration FTC would get to dictate what types of content platforms can recommend or even show to younger users,” Greer said, referring to Republican presidential nominee and former President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Jenna Leventoff, senior policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, said the Kids Online Safety Act is “nothing more than a thinly veiled effort to censor information that some consider objectionable”</p>
<p>“If enacted, KOSA could lead to information about health care, gender, identity, politics and more being removed from social media. And kids note that censorship will make them less and not more safe,” Leventoff said. “As one student recently told me, they don’t get sex education in school, and if information about sex is removed from the internet because platforms fear liability for hosting it, how else can they learn about sex?”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Teens in opposition</h4>

	
<p>The ACLU brought roughly 300 teens to Capitol Hill Thursday to lobby against the legislation.</p>
<p>Dara Adkinson, of the organization TransOhio, said the legislation is “truly terrifying.”</p>
<p>Adkinson questioned whether state and federal authorities could argue that content about climate change or the nation’s history of slavery causes anxiety and should therefore be regulated.</p>
<p>Regarding content about transgender youth, Adkinson said: “We know there (are) people out there that would like us to not exist and having the lack of visibility of the kinds of resources found on the internet is the first step for many of these folks.”</p>
<p>Greer said the coalition is concerned about the role of “big tech” in society. Advocates would support a “heavily modified” version of the Kids Online Safety Act that focuses on regulating business practices, including targeted advertising or videos that automatically play and encourage continuous, addictive scrolling habits.</p>
<p>Greer said their organization is neutral on the legislation targeted at protecting children’s privacy, but that they would like to see comprehensive legislation that protects minors and adults alike.</p>
<p>“Censorship and privacy do not go together, and these should not be moving together,” Greer said.</p>

<p>Biden announced the “Not Above the Law Amendment” Monday along with endorsing other changes for the nation’s highest bench, potentially setting the tone and focus for the Democrat’s final months in office after he exited the 2024 race in favor of Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>The proposal, released by the White House without text and detailed by Biden in a Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/07/29/joe-biden-reform-supreme-court-presidential-immunity-plan-announcement/" target="_blank">op-ed</a>, comes as public trust in the high court flags after recent ethics scandals and the overturning of Roe v. Wade that bucked popular opinion on abortion.</p>
<p>Biden is urging Congress to pass 18-year term limits for justices, with a president appointing a new justice every two years, and to approve enforceable conduct and ethics rules that would require disclosure of gifts, bar public political activity and ensure recusal from cases where a justice or their spouse has a financial or political stake.</p>
<p>Biden’s plan to “restore faith” in the nation’s highest court will likely hit a roadblock in the Republican-led U.S. House and in the Senate, where Democrats hold a slim edge and any reforms could struggle to gain the necessary 60 votes. A constitutional amendment would also require passage in three-fourths of the states.</p>
<p>U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson called Biden’s proposal “dead on arrival.”</p>
<p>Writing in the Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/07/29/joe-biden-reform-supreme-court-presidential-immunity-plan-announcement/?pwapi_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJyZWFzb24iOiJnaWZ0IiwibmJmIjoxNzIyMjI1NjAwLCJpc3MiOiJzdWJzY3JpcHRpb25zIiwiZXhwIjoxNzIzNjA3OTk5LCJpYXQiOjE3MjIyMjU2MDAsImp0aSI6IjI5ODkwY2VjLTYwZTItNDZmZi1hOWZkLWQwOTJjZmI5MGNjMSIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9vcGluaW9ucy8yMDI0LzA3LzI5L2pvZS1iaWRlbi1yZWZvcm0tc3VwcmVtZS1jb3VydC1wcmVzaWRlbnRpYWwtaW1tdW5pdHktcGxhbi1hbm5vdW5jZW1lbnQvIn0.ZjQ4R9u8pwlIKd0l230VD0f20mb0V140Kw3gTFopyfM" target="_blank">op-ed</a>, Biden said a lack of legal repercussions for former President Donald Trump’s role in the violent Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, intended to stop the peaceful transfer of power from one elected administration to another, is “only the beginning.”</p>
<p>“The only limits will be those that are self-imposed by the person occupying the Oval Office,” he wrote.</p>
<p>He also referenced recent behavior from the court <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/clarence-thomas-scotus-undisclosed-luxury-travel-gifts-crow" target="_blank">uncovered</a> by ProPublica’s investigative journalists — including gifts and luxury travel given to the justices from political donors — as cause for alarm.</p>
<p>“What is happening now is not normal, and it undermines the public’s confidence in the court’s decisions, including those impacting personal freedoms. We now stand in a breach,” Biden wrote.</p>
<p>Biden is expected to speak on his plan Monday afternoon when he commemorates the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act at the Lyndon B. Johnson Library in Texas.</p>
<p>Public Citizen, a group that advocates for changes at the Supreme Court, issued a statement Monday praising Biden’s proposal.</p>
<p>“The dramatic drop in public confidence in the Supreme Court both undercuts the Court’s legitimacy and endangers the legitimacy of the judicial branch as a whole,” wrote Lisa Gilbert, the organization’s co-president. “It is also critical that we undo the damage caused by the overreaching SCOTUS decision in the presidential immunity case and ensure that no person — including the president — is above the law.”</p>
<p>Johnson panned Biden’s announcement as a “radical overhaul” and “logical conclusion to the Biden-Harris Administration and Congressional Democrats’ ongoing efforts to delegitimize the Supreme Court.”</p>
<p>“It is telling that Democrats want to change the system that has guided our nation since its founding simply because they disagree with some of the Court’s recent decisions,” the Louisiana Republican said in a statement Monday.</p>
<p>But various acts of Congress have changed the court since the nation’s founding, including the number of seats on the bench, which have ranged from five to 10. The number of seats on the court was fixed at nine shortly after the Civil War, <a href="https://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/educational-resources/about-educational-outreach/activity-resources/about#:~:text=Over%20the%20years%2C%20various%20Acts,the%20United%20States%20Supreme%20Court." target="_blank">according</a> to the court’s historical information that details the changes. In 1925, an act granted the justices the power to decide whether to hear a case, also known as certiorari.</p>
<p>The Republican National Committee issued a statement accusing Biden’s plan of being “Kamala’s scheme to pack the Supreme Court with far-left, radical judges who will render decisions based on politics, not the law — and insulate her dangerously liberal policy positions from scrutiny if she’s elected.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Democrats decry the court</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Efforts to pass an enforceable code of conduct at the Supreme Court are already underway among Democratic lawmakers.</p>
<p>Reps. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the GOP-led House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, another Democratic committee member, introduced legislation last month that would prohibit justices from receiving gifts valued over $50, according to their offices.</p>
<p>The two lawmakers <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/pair-us-house-dems-add-chorus-calling-alito-thomas-recusals%C2%A0" target="_blank">hosted</a> a roundtable in early June excoriating the court after Chief Justice John Roberts refused to take action when the New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/16/us/justice-alito-upside-down-flag.html" target="_blank">revealed</a> that an upside-down U.S. flag — a sign of protest — flew outside Justice Samuel Alito’s Virginia home shortly after the Jan. 6 riot.</p>
<p>House progressives unsuccessfully <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/progressives-urge-alito-recusal-jan-6-cases-us-supreme-court" target="_blank">urged</a> Alito to recuse himself from two cases related to Jan. 6, including Trump’s appeal for immunity from federal election subversion charges.</p>
<p>A Supreme Court ethics <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/359/text?s=1&amp;r=4&amp;q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22supreme+court+ethics%22%5D%7D" target="_blank">bill</a> sponsored by Rhode Island’s Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/ethics-rules-supreme-court-justices-approved-party-line-vote-us-senate-panel" target="_blank">advanced</a> out of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary along party lines a year ago but has not received a floor vote.</p>

The president addressed reasons for abruptly ending his run for a second term after initially rejecting calls from some top Democrats to do so, and outlined what he hopes to accomplish in his remaining months in office. (Photo by Evan Vucci-Pool/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden explained his decision not to seek reelection during a prime-time address from the Oval Office on Wednesday, saying now is the time to turn over power to the next generation.</p>
<p>“I’ve made it clear that I believe America is at an inflection point — one of those rare moments in history when the decisions we make now will determine the fate of our nation and the world for decades to come,” Biden said. “America is going to have to choose between moving forward or backward, between hope and hate, between unity and division.”</p>
<p>The 11-minute speech was the first time Biden spoke at length on camera since releasing a letter Sunday withdrawing as the Democratic Party’s presumptive presidential nominee. He will continue to serve out his term.</p>
<p>Biden has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, who has received support from enough delegates to clinch the party’s official nomination during <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/democrats-approve-virtual-vote-delegates-pick-presidential-nominee" target="_blank">a virtual roll call vote slated for early August.</a></p>
<p>Biden called into a campaign rally earlier this week, but had only given off-camera or brief remarks since announcing his decision to step aside while sidelined with COVID-19.</p>
<p>Calls for Biden to bow out began after his performance during the first presidential debate on June 27 raised significant concerns among Democrats and others about his age and cognitive abilities.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Speaking directly to Americans in his address, Biden said he believed his record, leadership and vision for the country’s future “all merited a second term.”</p>
<p>“But nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy and that includes personal ambition,” Biden said. “So I’ve decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. That’s the best way to unite our nation.”</p>
<p>Biden said that while there is “a time and a place for long years of experience in public life,” there is also a time for “younger voices.”</p>
<p>“And that time and place is now,” Biden said.</p>
<p>During his remaining six months in office, Biden said he planned to continue pressing for gun control, reproductive rights, voting rights and an end to all forms of violence, including political.</p>
<p>Biden said he wanted to secure an end to the war in Gaza and bring home the hostages that Hamas took when it attacked Israel on Oct. 7.</p>
<p>He said he planned to press for changes to the Supreme Court, calling it essential for democracy.</p>
<p>Biden also recounted the numerous laws enacted since he became president as well as his efforts to hold the NATO alliance together following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>He said he hoped Americans understood how “grateful” he was for his decades as an elected official.</p>
<p>“I ran for president four years ago because I believed, and I still do, that the soul of America was at stake, the very nature of who we are was at stake,” Biden said.</p>
<p>Harris, he said, has the experience, strength and capability to lead the country following the November elections.</p>
<p>“The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule — the people do,” Biden said. “History is in your hands, the power is in your hands, the idea of America lies in your hands. We just have to keep the faith and remember who we are.”</p>

The day before, Cheatle testified before the House Oversight and Accountability Committee on the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump. (Photo by Kent Nishimura/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON —  U.S. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned Tuesday, following widespread outrage that her agency failed to prevent the assassination attempt on former President Donald J. Trump during a July 13 campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Cheatle’s resignation <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/secret-service-director-faces-mounting-calls-resign-over-trump-assassination-attempt" target="_blank">follows an intense congressional hearing</a> where Democrats and Republicans demanded she step down after they grew dissatisfied with her answers about how a gunman was able to get within shooting range of the former president. In the hearing, Cheatle noted that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting.</p>
<p>According to an email <a href="https://apnews.com/article/secret-service-director-trump-rally-8b1b13cece2ff25590c81093032dceb4" target="_blank">obtained by The Associated Press</a>, Cheatle said to her staff that she took “full responsibility for the security lapse.”</p>
<p>Ronald L. Rowe, the U.S. Secret Service Deputy Director will serve as acting Director of the Secret Service, Department of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement.</p>
<p>“I appreciate his willingness to lead the Secret Service at this incredibly challenging moment, as the agency works to get to the bottom of exactly what happened on July 13 and cooperate with ongoing investigations and Congressional oversight,” Mayorkas said. “At the same time, the Secret Service must effectively carry on its expansive mission that includes providing 24/7 protection for national leaders and visiting dignitaries and securing events of national significance in this dynamic and heightened threat environment.”</p>
<p>The Secret Service declined to comment and deferred to DHS.</p>
<p>“I am responsible for leading the agency, and I am responsible for finding the answers to how this event occurred and making sure that it doesn’t happen again,” Cheatle said during Monday’s House Committee on Oversight and Accountability hearing.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Task force will still investigate</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said even though Cheatle has stepped down, he still plans to continue with plans to form a bipartisan task force to investigate the security failures that led to the attempted assassination, in which <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/campaigns-elections/trump-campaigns-in-western-pennsylvania-with-rally-in-butler-county/" target="_blank">Trump was shot and his right ear injured. </a></p>
<p>“Her resignation is overdue,” Johnson told reporters. “It certainly was the director, but there may be others in the line of authority who are also culpable in what happened in the errors and mistakes there.”</p>
<p>Johnson said the task force will continue “to ensure that those mistakes do not happen again.”</p>
<p>On Trump’s social media site, Truth Social, the former president wrote that the Biden administration “did not properly protect me, and I was forced to take a bullet for Democracy. IT WAS MY GREAT HONOR TO DO SO!”</p>
<p>In a statement, President Joe Biden thanked Cheatle for her service and said he plans to appoint a new director soon.</p>
<p>“As a leader, it takes honor, courage, and incredible integrity to take full responsibility for an organization tasked with one of the most challenging jobs in public service,” Biden said.</p>
<p>He added that an independent review, which he directed the Department of Homeland Security to undertake shortly after the shooting, will “get to the bottom of what happened on July 13.”</p>
<p>“We all know what happened that day can never happen again,” Biden said.</p>
<p>Sen. Chuck Grassley, Republican of Iowa, and Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, Democrat of Nevada,<a href="https://www.grassley.senate.gov/news/news-releases/grassley-and-cortez-masto-next-secret-service-director-must-be-senate-confirmed" target="_blank"> issued a joint statement</a> in which they said they have introduced bipartisan <a href="https://www.grassley.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/protect_act1.pdf" target="_blank">legislation</a> that would require all future directors of the Secret Service be subject to confirmation by the Senate and serve a single 10-year term.</p>
<p>“Our bill is a crucial step toward providing the transparency and accountability that Congress and the American people deserve from the Secret Service,” Grassley said. “In light of former Director Cheatle’s resignation, Congress must now move quickly to pass our legislation and put a qualified individual at the agency’s helm.”</p>
<p>Cortez Masto said that by requiring the director of the Secret Service to be confirmed by the Senate, this will “ensure the same level of oversight as other federal law enforcement agencies and support our hardworking agents in doing the best job they can.”</p>
<p>Mayorkas also praised Cheatle for her work, noting her 29 years of service.</p>
<p>“Over the past two years, she has led the Secret Service with skill, honor, integrity, and tireless dedication,” Mayorkas said in a statement. “She is deeply respected by the men and women of the agency and by her fellow leaders in the Department of Homeland Security.”</p>

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)</p><p>MILWAUKEE — Donald Trump in an unusual speech accepting the GOP presidential nomination Thursday at the fourth and final night of the Republican National Convention gave a detailed account about the attempt on his life last weekend when a gunman shot at him during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>“I will tell you exactly what happened. And you’ll never hear it from me a second time because it’s actually too painful to tell,” Trump said in his first public remarks about the shooting that killed one rally goer and injured two others. The gunman was killed by law enforcement at the scene.</p>
<p>Turning his head to look at a chart, which was later displayed on multiple screens inside the Fiserv Forum, is what saved his life, Trump said.</p>
<p>“I heard a loud whizzing sound and felt something hit me really, really hard on my right ear,” Trump recalled. “I said to myself, ‘Wow, what was that? It can only be a bullet.’ I moved my hand to my right ear, brought it down, and my hand was covered with blood.”</p>
<p>Trump said he knew immediately that he was “under attack” and praised the Secret Service agents for rushing on stage to shield him with their own bodies, calling them “great people” who took “great risk,” to applause from the crowd.</p>
<p>He thanked the supporters in attendance last weekend for not panicking and stampeding, which can cause injuries and deaths during a mass shooting.</p>
<p>Trump in his 90-minute remarks appeared to seriously reflect on how close he came to being killed at one point, commenting that he wasn’t sure he was meant to survive the attack.</p>
<p>“I’m not supposed to be here tonight,” Trump said, before the crowd began chanting, “Yes, you are!”</p>
<p>“I stand before you in this arena only by the grace of Almighty God,” he added.</p>
<p>Republicans’ bestowal of the nomination on Trump at the finale of their convention is significant in that he becomes the first convicted felon to accept a major political party’s presidential nod. Trump still faces charges in multiple criminal cases after one of the cases was dropped earlier this week.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Divine intervention seen</h4>

	
<p>Trump’s comments about being saved by God followed days of politicians from throughout the country claiming the bullet only grazing his ear was an act of divine intervention.</p>
<p>Pastor Lorenzo Sewell, from Detroit, said earlier in the night that people “can’t deny the power of God” in Trump’s life.</p>
<p>“You can’t deny that God protected him, you cannot deny that it was a millimeter miracle that was able to save this man’s life,” Sewell said. “Could it be that Jesus Christ preserved him for such a time as this?”</p>
<p>“Could it be that the King of Glory, the Lord God, strong and mighty, the God who is mighty in battle, protected Donald Trump, because he wants to use him for such a time as this?” Sewell added.</p>
<p>Tucker Carlson, former Fox News television personality and conservative pundit, said that “a lot of people” are wondering what’s going on following the shooting on Saturday.</p>
<p>“Something bigger is going on here. I think people who don’t even believe in God are starting to think, ‘Well, maybe there’s something to this,’” Carlson said. “And I’m starting to think it’s going to be okay, actually.”</p>
<p>Trump wore a white bandage on his right ear concealing the wound he received <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/campaigns-elections/trump-campaigns-in-western-pennsylvania-with-rally-in-butler-county/" target="_blank">last Saturday before Secret Service agents rushed to shield him</a> from bullets.</p>
<p>Trump spoke about Corey Comperatore, a former fire chief attending the rally with his family, who was <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/campaigns-elections/fbi-identifies-shooter-in-assassination-attempt-on-trump-at-butler-rally/" target="_blank">killed in the shooting</a> as well as the two people who were injured.</p>
<p>Trump called Comperatore a “highly respected” fire chief before walking over to his fire jacket and helmet, which had been placed on the stage, and kissing the helmet in a solemn moment.</p>
<p>Trump said he spoke with Comperatore’s wife as well as the two injured people earlier in the day, who were doing “very well” in recovering from their injuries. The convention then observed a moment of silence for Comperatore.</p>

    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">GOP seeks unity as Democrats debate Biden’s fate</h4>

	
<p>The Republican National Convention and Trump’s acceptance speech provided a prime opportunity for the GOP to show unity as Democrats <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/california-rep-schiff-latest-democrat-call-biden-drop-out" target="_blank">increasingly questioned</a> whether President Joe Biden should formally become their nominee in the weeks ahead.</p>
<p>Trump repeatedly criticized Democrats’ policies and said they were a threat to the country’s future, though he only mentioned Biden once, saying the damage the current president could inflict on the country is “unthinkable.”</p>
<p>“If you took the 10 worst presidents in the history of the United States… and added them up, they will not have done the damage that Biden has done,” Trump said.</p>
<p>Voters, he said, must “rescue our nation from failed and even incompetent leadership” by voting for him and Republicans during November’s election.</p>
<p>“This will be the most important election in the history of our country,” Trump said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘The stakes have never been higher,’ Biden campaign says</h4>

	
<p>Biden-Harris Campaign Chair Jen O’Malley Dillon released a written statement rebuking Trump’s speech, saying he “rambled on for well over an hour.”</p>
<p>“He failed to mention how he had inflicted pain and cruelty on the women of America by overturning Roe v Wade. He failed to mention his plan to take over the civil service and to pardon the January 6th insurrectionists,” Dillon wrote.</p>
<p>Biden, on the other hand, is “running for an America where we defend democracy, not diminish it,” she wrote.</p>
<p>“The stakes have never been higher,” Dillon wrote. “The choice has never been more clear. President Biden is more determined than ever to defeat Donald Trump and his Project 2025 agenda in November.”</p>
<p>DNC Chair Jaime Harrison said in a written statement that in “Trump’s Republican Party, there’s only space for unquestioning loyalists who will put him above our democracy, above our freedoms, and above working families.”</p>
<p>“Over the past four days, we’ve seen speakers endorse a far-right, dangerous vision that would see Americans’ basic liberties stripped away and replace the rule of law with the rule of Trump,” Harrison wrote. “No amount of desperate spin can change how unpopular and out of touch their disastrous plans are for the American people.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">No stain left by Jan. 6</h4>

	
<p>Trump’s speech solidified a significant turnaround for the former president, who earned rebukes from many of the party’s leaders following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.</p>
<p>The events of that day, which led to the deaths of police officers and ended the country’s centuries-long peaceful transition of power, would traditionally have been viewed as a black spot by the party that lauds itself as supporting “law and order” as well as the country’s founding principles.</p>
<p>Instead, Trump has succeeded in convincing his supporters that the people convicted for violent acts should be pardoned as “political prisoners” and the several court cases against him are about his politics and not his actions.</p>
<p>Top Trump campaign official Chris LaCivita <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/top-trump-adviser-says-2024-election-not-over-until-inauguration-day" target="_blank">refused</a> to say earlier Thursday during an event near the RNC whether Trump would continue to campaign on the promise to pardon Jan. 6 defendants, or “hostages” as he has described them numerous times.</p>
<p>Trump said Thursday night that nothing would prevent him from becoming president following November’s election.</p>
<p>“Our resolve is unbroken and our purpose is unchanged — to deliver a government that serves the American people better than ever before,” Trump said.</p>
<p>“Nothing will stop me to this vision, because our vision is righteous and our cause is pure,” Trump added. “No matter what obstacle comes our way, we will not break, we will not bend, we will not back down and I will never stop fighting for you.”</p>
<p>Trump’s loss of the popular vote and the Electoral College four years ago led him to make false claims about election fraud, which never bore fruit. Judges threw out numerous court challenges.</p>
<p>Trump <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/fueled-lies-trump-charged-seeking-overturn-2020-election-6" target="_blank">faces federal felony charges</a> that he conspired to create false slates of electors in seven states and attempted to obstruct the certification of the 2020 presidential election results.</p>
<p>That, however, hasn’t stopped Trump from repeating the claim and making it a hallmark of his third run for the Oval Office.</p>
<p>Trump reiterated many of those incorrect claims during his speech to applause and cheers from the crowd gathered inside Fiserv Forum.</p>
<p>“They used COVID to cheat,” he said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump: ‘We must not criminalize dissent’</h4>

	
<p>Despite his incessant encouragement of rally chants during the 2016 campaign to lock up former Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton, and a  <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-floats-imprisoning-political-opponents-rcna155543" target="_blank">willingness</a> to explore jailing his rivals if he wins in November, Trump said “we must not criminalize dissent or demonize political disagreement.”</p>
<p>In addition to the federal 2020 election subversion charges, Trump faces racketeering charges in Georgia, sentencing over a guilty verdict in New York, and federal charges over allegedly stealing and hiding classified government documents after leaving the Oval Office.</p>
<p>Federal District Judge Aileen Cannon on Monday <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-judge-dismisses-trump-classified-documents-criminal-case" target="_blank">dropped</a> the classified documents case on the grounds that the government illegally appointed a special counsel to prosecute it. The Department of Justice has since appealed.</p>
<p>The former president reminded the crowd of the “major ruling that was handed down from a highly respected federal judge.”</p>
<p>“If the Democrats want to unify our country, they should drop these partisan witch hunts,” Trump said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Stop wars with a telephone call’</h4>

	
<p>Trump said the “planet is teetering on the edge of World War Three” and he will “end every single international crisis that the current administration has created.”</p>
<p>Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 “would have never happened if I was president,” he said, repeating the same claim about the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas on Israel.</p>
<p>“I tell you this, we want our hostages back and they better be back,” Trump said later in the speech about Israeli-American hostages still in Hamas captivity.</p>
<p>Trump praised Victor Orbán — the Hungarian prime minister known for his authoritarian streak — which the crowd cheered. He also touted his friendship with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.</p>
<p>He said the press criticized him for his congeniality with Kim, but “it’s nice to get along with someone who has a lot of nuclear weapons,” Trump said.</p>
<p>“I could stop wars with a telephone call,” Trump said, but immediately followed with a promise to “build an Iron Dome missile defense system to ensure that no enemy can strike our homeland.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump’s ‘only crime’ is ‘loving America’</h4>

	
<p>Speakers rallying the crowd before Trump’s appearance on Thursday exalted his golf game and business management style, and defended the former president, who they say supports them through long-established ties.</p>
<p>“To me, he is my friend,” Trump’s attorney Alina Habba said tearfully.</p>
<p>“Sham indictments and baseless allegations will not deter us, because the only crime President Trump has committed is loving America,” she said.</p>
<p>Trump’s 2020 election subversion case has sat in a holding pattern for months while he appealed his claim of presidential immunity to the U.S. Supreme Court. The justices returned the case to the trial court after <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/presidential-immunity-covers-some-official-acts-supreme-court-rules-trump-case" target="_blank">issuing</a> a 6-3 majority opinion in early July that grants broad immunity for former presidents’ official acts.</p>
<p>Trump was <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-found-guilty-34-felony-counts-ny-hush-money-trial-10" target="_blank">convicted</a> of 34 felonies in New York state court for falsifying business records related to a hush money payment by his personal lawyer to a porn star ahead of the 2016 election.</p>
<p>However, the New York judge handling the case has <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-ny-sentencing-delayed-after-us-supreme-court-presidential-immunity-ruling-3" target="_blank">delayed</a> Trump’s sentencing while his lawyers challenge the case, arguing the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling opens questions about what evidence against a former sitting president can be admitted to court.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Pompeo says no Putin in Ukraine under Trump</h4>

	
<p>Mike Pompeo, Trump’s former CIA director and secretary of State, blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and deaths of its civilians on “weakness” of the Biden administration.</p>
<p>“Last week, we saw what it meant — that Children’s Hospital bombed, innocents killed — it did not have to be,” Pompeo said, referring to the July 8 Russian <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/07/08/nx-s1-5033075/russia-ukraine-war-missile-strike-childrens-hospital-kyiv" target="_blank">strike</a> on the medical facility in Kyiv.</p>
<p>World leaders from NATO etched a path for Ukraine to join the alliance at the July summit in Washington, D.C, and pledged more resources for the nation that Russia further invaded in February 2022.</p>
<p>Trump has long criticized NATO, dismissing the post-WWII alliance’s core tenet that an attack against one is an attack against all and threatening to withdraw over funding.</p>
<p>In February he <a href="https://apnews.com/article/nato-trump-delinquent-defense-allies-c1f7de696ff6ca06e4088f49b93122e1" target="_blank">told</a> a rally crowd in South Carolina that he would “encourage (Russia) to do whatever the hell they want” to “delinquent” member countries that do not pay 2% of their GDP on defense.</p>
<p>All members agreed to a 2% commitment in 2014, and 23 are <a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_49198.htm" target="_blank">on track</a> to meet the target this year, according to the alliance.</p>
<p>On Wednesday night at the RNC, Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/ohios-jd-vance-pitches-swing-state-votes-accepting-nod-trump-vp-0" target="_blank">echoed</a> Trump’s words and declared “no more free rides for nations that betray the generosity of the American taxpayer.”</p>

(Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)</p><p>MILWAUKEE — Republicans speaking at a concealed carry event on Tuesday, just days after a gunman attempted to kill their presidential nominee, insisted the party won’t change its stance on Second Amendment rights.</p>
<p>Attendees at the one-hour session, hosted by the U.S. Concealed Carry Association near the Republican National Convention, weren’t actually able to conceal carry any firearms, since it was held inside a Secret Service security checkpoint.</p>
<p>But those in attendance heard from Trump campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita and three members of Congress about what the plans will be for gun rights should they sweep Congress and the White House during November’s elections.</p>
<p>“I think what we’ll see is a continuation of supporting and defending the Second Amendment and where that really comes into play is the judiciary, the appointment of judges,” LaCivita said. “And so that is clearly, you know, one of the largest impacts that President Trump had clearly during his first term was a remake of the judiciary.”</p>
<p>Florida U.S. Rep. Kat Cammack, speaking with reporters after the event, said that the GOP was “absolutely not” considering changing its support for Second Amendment rights. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Saturday was injured by a gunman at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. One person was killed and two others were injured. The shooter was killed at the scene.</p>
<p>“I stand 1,000% convicted in the fact that the Republican Party will always stand for the Constitution and the Second Amendment and our right to bear arms,” Cammack said. “One deranged individual, who clearly needed help, he is not going to change the United States Constitution and our right as Americans to bear arms. Absolutely not.”</p>
<p>Cammack said it is “shocking” and “inappropriate” for any lawmaker to call for changes to gun laws in the wake of “tragic events” like mass shootings. She criticized Democrats for not making similar comments following the Trump shooting.</p>
<p>“The thing that has been really shocking to me, is you see right after tragic events, many politicians and pundits come out and they say, ‘This is the time to have the discussion about gun control’ when clearly… that’s not appropriate,” she said.</p>
<p>“In this case, I have gone through and seen the messaging of some of my colleagues, and I don’t see those same calls for gun control in the aftermath of this incident,” Cammack added. “So it makes me think that there’s a bit of a disingenuous attitude on some of the remarks that they’ve been making.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Hunters, gun owners</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>During the panel discussion, Cammack said Republicans need to talk to the 10 million hunters and gun owners throughout the country who are not registered to vote to ensure they change that and go to the polls in November.</p>
<p>“That is a missed opportunity for us as 2A advocates to make sure that we are actually doing the work to secure that victory, because we cannot turn the corner into January and start talking about how we’re going to do national reciprocity, if we don’t have the votes,” Cammack said.</p>
<p>A nationwide concealed carry reciprocity law would likely require a state with stricter concealed carry laws to recognize an out-of-state concealed carry permit.</p>
<p>USCCA writes on its website that “(r)eciprocity simply means a concealed carry permit or license is valid beyond the issuing state.”</p>
<p>“States may have full reciprocity, recognizing all out-of-state permits, or partial reciprocity, specifying agreements with select states,” the website states, referring to state-level laws. “The negotiation and recognition of these agreements depend on the willingness of states to cooperate. Whatever the agreement, carriers must follow the laws of the state in which they are carrying, and those may be different from the issuing state. “</p>
<p>Wisconsin U.S. Rep. Scott Fitzgerald said during the panel that gun rights advocates must pay close attention to lawmakers at the state and federal level, since changes to gun ownership laws are generally incremental and not sweeping.</p>
<p>“I think that, you know, we have to be diligent as legislators that protect the Second Amendment to say, ‘No, wait a minute, you know, this is a constitutional guarantee right,’” Fitzgerald said. “So you can continue to pass bill after bill after bill with some cute type of name that would lead people to believe that it’s about security. But we have to be diligent.”</p>

(Photo by Steven Hirsch-Pool/Getty Images)</p><p>MILWAUKEE —The federal classified documents case against former President Donald Trump was dismissed Monday by a Florida judge on the grounds that the Department of Justice unlawfully appointed special counsel Jack Smith.</p>
<p>The order, while likely to be appealed, makes the possibility even more remote that Trump will be tried before the election on any of the federal charges pending against him. The order came on the first day of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, during which Trump will be officially nominated as the 2024 GOP presidential candidate.</p>
<p>Trump, who on Saturday <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/campaigns-elections/trump-campaigns-in-western-pennsylvania-with-rally-in-butler-county/" target="_blank">was injured</a> at a Pennsylvania rally in what is being investigated as an attempted assassination, has also been <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/fueled-lies-trump-charged-seeking-overturn-2020-election-6" target="_blank">federally charged</a> in Washington, D.C., for his alleged attempts to subvert the 2020 presidential election results. The case is pending as a result of the U.S. Supreme Court’s <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/presidential-immunity-covers-some-official-acts-supreme-court-rules-trump-case" target="_blank">presidential immunity decision</a>.</p>
<p>In May, Trump was <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-found-guilty-34-felony-counts-ny-hush-money-trial-10" target="_blank">convicted</a> of 34 felonies in New York state court for falsifying business records related to a hush money payment ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Trump’s sentencing has been <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-ny-sentencing-delayed-after-us-supreme-court-presidential-immunity-ruling-3" target="_blank">delayed</a> until September while the court reviews the federal immunity decision.</p>
<p>Trump has also been indicted in Georgia on racketeering charges — though the case is bogged down in personnel matters — and has been ordered to pay hundreds of millions in penalties following multiple civil suits.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump reaction: Dismiss all ‘witch hunts’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Trump, who arrived in Milwaukee Sunday, wrote on his social media platform Monday that all cases against him should be dropped following the attempt on his life by the 20-year-old gunman identified by law enforcement as the shooter. The gunman was killed at the scene.</p>
<p>“As we move forward in Uniting our Nation after the horrific events on Saturday, this dismissal of the Lawless Indictment in Florida should be just the first step, followed quickly by the dismissal of ALL the Witch Hunts — The January 6th Hoax in Washington, D.C., the Manhattan D.A.’s Zombie Case, the New York A.G. Scam, Fake Claims about a woman I never met (a decades old photo in a line with her then husband does not count), and the Georgia ‘Perfect’ Phone Call charges,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.</p>
<p>House Speaker Mike Johnson declared the ruling “good news for America and for the rule of law” and a “critically important step” in unifying the country after Saturday’s shooting in Western Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>In a statement issued from Milwaukee, the Louisiana Republican said</p>
<p>“House Republicans repeatedly argued that Special Counsel Jack Smith abused his office’s authority in pursuit of President Trump, and now a federal judge has ruled Smith never possessed the authority in the first place.”</p>
<p>“As we work to unify this country following the failed assassination attempt of President Trump, we must also work to end the lawfare and political witch hunts that have unfairly targeted President Trump and destroyed the American people’s faith in our system of justice,” Johnson continued.</p>
<p>Republican lawmakers largely echoed Johnson.</p>
<p>House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik of New York said in a statement that she applauds District Judge Aileen Cannon’s “courage and wisdom” to dismiss the case brought by the “corrupt” special counsel.</p>
<p>“Case Dismissed! Big win for the rule of law,” South Carolina Congressman Ralph Norman wrote on X.</p>
<p>The GOP’s Rep. Clay Higgins of Louisiana also posted on the platform: “Winning. More to come. MAGA.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The dismissal order</h4>

<p>In Monday’s 93-page <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24807240-trumpdocumentscase" target="_blank">order</a>, Cannon wrote Smith’s appointment violates two clauses of the U.S. Constitution that govern how presidential administrations and Congress appoint and approve “Officers of the United States” and how taxpayer money can be used to pay their salaries and other expenses.</p>
<p>“Upon careful study of the foundational challenges raised in the Motion, the Court is convinced that Special Counsel’s Smith’s prosecution of this action breaches two structural cornerstones of our constitutional scheme—the role of Congress in the appointment of constitutional officers, and the role of Congress in authorizing expenditures by law,” wrote Cannon, who sits on the bench in the Southern District of Florida.</p>
<p>She was nominated by Trump in 2020 and <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1162/vote_116_2_00228.htm" target="_blank">confirmed</a> by the U.S. Senate later that year.</p>
<p>In February, Trump’s team filed the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.648653/gov.uscourts.flsd.648653.326.0.pdf" target="_blank">motion</a> to dismiss the <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/67490070/united-states-v-trump/?order_by=desc&amp;page=2" target="_blank">case</a>, accusing Smith of being unlawfully appointed and paid.</p>
<p>The classified documents case against Trump presented a historic first for the United States — a former sitting president had never been charged with federal crimes.</p>
<p>A federal grand jury handed up a 37-count indictment in June 2023 charging the former president and his aide Walt Nauta with felonies related to mishandling classified documents after his term in office, including storing them at his Florida Mar-a-Lago estate.</p>
<p>A little over a month later a new indictment was handed up, adding new charges against the former president and also adding Trump’s Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos De Oliveira as a co-defendant.</p>
<p>Cannon’s order dismisses the July 2023 <a href="https://www.justice.gov/storage/US-v-Trump-Nauta-De-Oliveira-23-80101.pdf" target="_blank">superseding indictment</a>.</p>
<p>The court will now close the case and cancel any scheduled hearings. Any pending motions are considered moot, according to Cannon’s order.</p>
<p>The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Democrats slam ‘misguided ruling’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Cannon’s dismissal of the case was met with shock from Democrats, who view Trump’s alleged mishandling of classified documents as a serious, prosecutable offense.</p>
<p>The indictment against Trump detailed how U.S. government documents marked “secret” and “confidential” were stored at Mar-a-Lago, an active social club in Palm Beach, in a ballroom, bathroom and shower, bedroom, office space and storage area.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement Monday that the “breathtakingly misguided ruling flies in the face of long-accepted practice and repetitive judicial precedence.”</p>
<p>“It is wrong on the law and must be appealed immediately. This is further evidence that Judge Cannon cannot handle this case impartially and must be reassigned,” the New York Democrat said.</p>
<p>Conor Lamb, a former congressman from Pennsylvania, wrote on X that Saturday’s failed assassination on Trump does not exonerate him from taking and keeping classified records as he left the Oval Office.</p>
<p>“In the same way that the Secret Service’s failure to protect Trump was unacceptable, it was unacceptable for Trump to fail to protect our country’s secrets.  Trump is a victim of the 1st but that doesn’t change that he is the perpetrator of the 2nd.  Accountability for both,” Lamb wrote.</p>
<p>Not Above the Law, a coalition of 150 organizations, issued a statement calling the ruling “flatly wrong.”</p>
<p>“The special counsel statute is clear. Its constitutionality has been upheld by multiple courts in the past, and Judge Cannon has no grounds to reject such a well-settled principle,” read the statement signed by the organization’s four co-chairs.</p>
<p>“Accountability, protecting the rule of law, and justice cannot be further delayed. We expect Judge Cannon’s ruling not only to be swiftly appealed, but also promptly reversed,” continued the statement from Lisa Gilbert, co-president of Public Citizen; Praveen Fernandes, vice president of the Constitutional Accountability Center; David Sievers, interim organizing director at MoveOn; and Brett Edkins, managing director for policy and political affairs at Stand Up America.</p>

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Thousands of Republicans will gather in Milwaukee beginning Monday for the party’s presidential nominating convention — a typically joyous occasion that will likely take on a different tone this year after a gunman shot at Donald Trump, injuring him, on Saturday.</p>
<p>Trump, who will be formally nominated as the GOP’s presidential nominee on Thursday, still plans to attend the convention and officials stress the four-day event will go on as normal.</p>
<p>The shooting at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania is being i<a href="https://penncapital-star.com/campaigns-elections/fbi-identifies-shooter-in-assassination-attempt-on-trump-at-butler-rally/" target="_blank">nvestigated as an attempted assassination</a> and the FBI identified the shooter as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, of Bethel Park, Pa. The U.S. Secret Service “neutralized the shooter, who is now deceased,” the Secret Service said.</p>
<p>Trump, who has been declared “safe” by the Secret Service, posted on social media Sunday morning that he was still looking “forward to speaking to our Great Nation this week from Wisconsin.”</p>
<p>“Thank you to everyone for your thoughts and prayers yesterday, as it was God alone who prevented the unthinkable from happening,” Trump wrote. “We will FEAR NOT, but instead remain resilient in our Faith and Defiant in the face of Wickedness. Our love goes out to the other victims and their families. We pray for the recovery of those who were wounded, and hold in our hearts the memory of the citizen who was so horribly killed. In this moment, it is more important than ever that we stand United, and show our True Character as Americans, remaining Strong and Determined, and not allowing Evil to Win.”</p>
<p>Senior advisors to the Trump campaign Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita released a statement hours after the shooting on Saturday to say that the former president wasn’t changing his plans.</p>
<p>“President Trump looks forward to joining you all in Milwaukee as we proceed with our convention to nominate him to serve as the 47th President of the United States,” Wiles and LaCivita wrote in a joint statement. “As our party’s nominee, President Trump will continue to share his vision to Make America Great Again.”</p>
<p>Reince Priebus, chairman of the MKE 2024 Host Committee, said in a separate statement that he was “heartbroken that reports indicate that at least one innocent person has been killed and perhaps others have been injured. This horrific violence has no place in America.”</p>
<p>“Guests have already begun to arrive in Wisconsin, and we look forward to working with the Republican National Committee to welcome everyone to Milwaukee this week,” Priebus added.</p>
<p>Political party conventions are designated as National Special Security Events, or NSSEs, and come with extremely heightened security compared to a typical campaign rally.</p>
<p>The Secret Service will have at least two security perimeters around the Fiserv Forum in downtown Milwaukee and the city itself will be swarming with additional federal, state and local law enforcement officers.</p>
<p>The convention will still host speeches throughout the week and the dozens of side events hosted by state Republican Parties and conservative organizations were still expected to continue, though likely with a more somber mood than was planned before the shooting.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">GOP platform</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Party conventions have traditionally served as an opportunity for the GOP to showcase its candidates up and down the ballot and unify behind their presidential nominee after sometimes divisive primaries.</p>
<p>They’re also the point every four years, with at least one exception, when party leaders release their key policy goals for the next four years.</p>
<p>The RNC released its trimmed-down party platform the week prior to the convention, after foregoing one entirely in 2020. And while many Republicans in Congress said during interviews they either support it, or hadn’t read it, some were critical it adopts Trump’s position that abortion access be left up to states — one of the top issues in the presidential race.</p>
<p>The platform wraps in longtime party goals as well as others tied to Trump. But it also competes with attention drawn to the Heritage Foundation’s massive far-right Project 2025 policy agenda, which Trump has repeatedly disavowed.</p>
<p>Democrats and President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign have targeted the document spearheaded by former Trump administration officials — which says the president should work with Congress on abortion policy — as an example of an extreme GOP agenda.</p>
<p>The Heritage Foundation is scheduled to host an all-day “policy fest” on Monday at the RNC Convention, headlined by conservative media personality Tucker Carlson and former Utah Congressman Jason Chaffetz, among others.</p>
<p>The RNC convention could also be the showcase for Trump announcing his running mate, after months of speculation about who would get the nod. As of Friday, Trump had not revealed his pick, though <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/calm-conservative-confident-what-gop-senators-want-trumps-vice-presidential-pick" target="_blank">speculation centered </a>around Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum.</p>
<p>There was also little information available ahead of the convention as to the lineup and schedule of speakers in official sessions throughout the week, which culminates with the nomination of Trump on Thursday and his speech.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Unhappiness over abortion stance</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>GOP members of Congress said in interviews that took place days before the shooting they would have liked to have seen a national abortion ban in the platform.</p>
<p>Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, the top Republican on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said he preferred the GOP’s last official platform, which called for a nationwide abortion ban after 20 weeks.</p>
<p>“I’m pro-life and I like the way it was previously,” Cassidy said.</p>
<p>Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst said while she hadn’t read the full platform, she had read the section about abortion, as well as a few others.</p>
<p>“I am pro-life and I am always going to be adamantly pro-life,” Ernst said. “And I think what we’re going to have to do is work very hard to educate the American people on the value of life. So would I like to see more robust (language) in the platform? Certainly. But that’s not the way it’s going to be. So we’re just going to have to continue fighting for life.”</p>
<p>Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford said the platform places a “new emphasis on the states” to regulate abortion access, largely as a result of Trump pressing for that structure in an attempt to appeal to independent voters, though Lankford said it won’t bind Republicans in Congress.</p>
<p>“Obviously, this is a platform that’s wrapped around him, it’s a new model for presidential platforms to be wrapped around the candidate,” Lankford said.</p>
<p>Trump has shifted the GOP platform away from pressing for a nationwide law, in part, because he doesn’t believe the votes are there at the moment, Lankford said. But that doesn’t mean Republican lawmakers will stop talking about their beliefs or working to build support for a nationwide law.</p>
<p>“It’s a common ground statement,” Lankford said of the platform. “But for those of us that believe in the value of every single child — and we should do whatever we can to be able to protect the lives of children — we will continue to be able to speak out on those things.”</p>
<p>Mike Pence, former Indiana governor and vice president during Trump’s first term in office, released a <a href="https://advancingamericanfreedom.com/vice-president-pence-on-rnc-platform-a-profound-disappointment-to-pro-life-republicans/" target="_blank">statement</a> saying the “RNC platform is a profound disappointment to the millions of pro-life Republicans that have always looked to the Republican Party to stand for life.”</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, this platform is part of a broader retreat in our party, trying to remain vague for political expedience,” he wrote.</p>
<p>Pence called on delegates attending the RNC convention to “restore language to our party’s platform recognizing the sanctity of human life and affirming that the unborn child has a fundamental right to life which cannot be infringed.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Shorter, vaguer</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://cdn.nucleusfiles.com/be/beb1a388-1d88-4389-a67d-c1e2d7f8bedf/2024-gop-platform-july-7-final.pdf?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=ncl_amplify&amp;utm_campaign=240708-2024_gop_platform_make_america_great_again&amp;utm_content=ncl-4NsN8UE5x2&amp;_nlid=4NsN8UE5x2&amp;_nhids=Yy5JhERzJ" target="_blank">16-page platform</a> is much shorter than years past and is at times vague about the goals the Republican Party hopes to accomplish if voters give them unified control of the federal government during the next two years.</p>
<p>The official document was put together behind closed doors.</p>
<p>It says that after nearly 50 years, “because of us,” the ability to regulate abortion has “been given to the States and to a vote of the People.”</p>
<p>“We will oppose Late Term Abortion, while supporting mothers and policies that advance Prenatal Care, access to Birth Control, and IVF (fertility treatments),” the new RNC platform states.</p>
<p>The 2016 Republican Party <a href="https://prod-cdn-static.gop.com/media/documents/DRAFT_12_FINAL%5B1%5D-ben_1468872234.pdf" target="_blank">platform</a>, by contrast, was 66 pages long and mentioned abortion more than 30 times, calling for Congress to pass legislation that banned abortion after 20-weeks gestation.</p>
<p>That previous platform also said that the RNC respected “the states’ authority and flexibility to exclude abortion providers from federal programs such as Medicaid and other healthcare and family planning programs so long as they continue to perform or refer for elective abortions or sell the body parts of aborted children.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Nothing going to happen up here in the Senate’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas said that it’s extremely unlikely either political party gets the 60 votes needed to advance abortion legislation through the legislative filibuster in the Senate, making the states the more practical place to enact laws.</p>
<p>“There’s not 48 votes on this issue one way or the other up here, let alone 60,” Marshall said. “There’s nothing going to happen up here in the Senate in the near future, if forever.”</p>
<p>Marshall said that Republicans “won” in getting the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade and that the issue is now left up to voters.</p>
<p>Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley said a full GOP platform shorter than in previous years is a good development, since people might actually read it.</p>
<p>“Nobody’s gonna read the Sears catalog, like previous ones,” Grassley said. “And I think if we can get people to read the Republican platform, it’ll be a great thing for the campaign. I think it’d be a great thing for government generally.”</p>
<p>Grassley said he couldn’t make a judgment about the new abortion language, since he didn’t remember the language from the 2016 platform.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Voters expect all of GOP on same page</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Alabama Sen. Katie Britt said she hadn’t read through the platform, but that she was encouraged some anti-abortion groups expressed support for the new language.</p>
<p>“I’m proud to be pro-life and proud to support the party and President Trump,” Britt said.</p>
<p>Voters, she said, expect to hear from a unified Republican Party during convention week as well as from one that focuses on policy.</p>
<p>“I think people want a secure border, they want stable prices, they want a more secure world,” Britt said. “And I think we need to talk about those things — talk about not only where we are, but our vision for moving forward.”</p>
<p>Sen. Steve Daines of Montana, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, didn’t directly answer a question about whether he supports removing a nationwide abortion ban from the party’s platform.</p>
<p>“Look, I think they did good work on the platform,” Daines said. “We’re a party that believes in life, we’re a pro-life party. I think they did a good job.”</p>
<p>West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito said that voters want to hear Republicans unified at the convention.</p>
<p>“I think they want to hear a unifying message for the future,” Capito said. “I think they want to hear how things will be different and better, especially on the economy and border and international. And I just think, you know, a united front is probably the most important.”</p>
<p>Arkansas Sen. John Boozman said the GOP should emphasize how it differs from Democrats during the RNC Convention.</p>
<p>“I think that they need to hear a message of unity and the contrast between what Republicans can accomplish on inflation and border,” Boozman said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">National treasures, women’s sports</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The RNC’s<a href="https://cdn.nucleusfiles.com/be/beb1a388-1d88-4389-a67d-c1e2d7f8bedf/2024-gop-platform-july-7-final.pdf?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=ncl_amplify&amp;utm_campaign=240708-2024_gop_platform_make_america_great_again&amp;utm_content=ncl-4NsN8UE5x2&amp;_nlid=4NsN8UE5x2&amp;_nhids=Yy5JhERzJ" target="_blank"> new platform</a> includes familiar GOP policy goals as well as some that came along after Trump became the party’s nominee eight years ago.</p>
<p>For example, it calls for Republicans to “promote beauty in Public Architecture and preserve our Natural Treasures. We will build cherished symbols of our Nation, and restore genuine Conservation efforts.”</p>
<p>It also calls on GOP lawmakers to “support the restoration of Classic Liberal Arts Education,” though it doesn’t detail that particular issue.</p>
<p>The rest of the platform is pretty standard for the types of initiatives and policy goals that Republicans have traditionally pursued.</p>
<p>For example, it calls on Republicans to slash “wasteful Government spending,” “restore every Border Policy of the Trump administration,” make provisions from the 2017 tax law permanent and “will keep men out of women’s sports.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump running mate</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The RNC convention could also include Trump announcing who will campaign with him at the top of the ticket.</p>
<p>His last running mate, Pence, began distancing himself from Trump after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, which included calls from the mob to kill Pence, and the construction of a scaffold for public hangings on the National Mall.</p>
<p>Pence was in the Capitol building that day and was removed from danger by his security detail as the pro-Trump mob beat police officers, broke into the building and disrupted Congress’ certification of Biden as the country’s next president.</p>
<p>Trump, without revealing his vice presidential selection, wrote Thursday on social media that he is “looking very much forward to being in Milwaukee next week.”</p>
<p>“The great people of Wisconsin will reward us for choosing their State for the Republican National Convention. From there we go on to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! See you next week,” he posted on Truth Social, his online platform where he regularly publishes comments and statements.</p>
<p>The vice presidential candidate typically gives a speech on Wednesday night, so Trump is expected to make his announcement before then.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Project 2025</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Conservative operatives striving to elect Trump to the White House have been circulating the 922-page Project 2025 <a href="https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf" target="_blank">plan</a> for nearly 15 months.</p>
<p>Spearheaded by the Heritage Foundation, in conjunction with more than 100 organizations, the policy agenda titled “Mandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise” presents a roadmap should Trump win in November.</p>
<p>The “goal is to assemble an army of aligned, vetted, trained, and prepared conservatives to go to work on Day One to deconstruct the Administrative State,” according to the organization’s description of the mandate.</p>
<p>The lengthy mandate sets forth core promises to “restore the family” and overhaul government agencies.</p>
<p>The document states that “(i)n particular, the next conservative President should work with Congress to enact the most robust protections for the unborn that Congress will support while deploying existing federal powers to protect innocent life and vigorously complying with statutory bans on the federal funding of abortion.”</p>
<p>The mandate is just one pillar under the multi-pronged “Project 2025: Presidential Transition Project” that also includes a presidential administration training academy and a 180-day “playbook” aimed “to bring quick relief to Americans suffering from the Left’s devastating policies.” The project is <a href="https://www.project2025.org/about/about-project-2025/" target="_blank">led</a> by two former Trump administration officials.</p>
<p>The Biden-Harris campaign and Democrats have repeatedly criticized Project 2025 in comments and campaign emails.</p>
<p>“If implemented, Project 2025 would be the latest attempt in Donald Trump’s full on assault on reproductive freedom,” Vice President Kamala Harris said at a rally in North Carolina on Thursday.</p>
<p>Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said during a press conference Thursday that the plan is “dangerous, it’s dastardly and it’s diabolical.”</p>
<p>“Project 2025, the Trump and extreme MAGA Republican agenda, will criminalize abortion care and impose a nationwide ban on reproductive freedom,” Jeffries said.</p>
<p>Trump and his campaign deny any connection to the project.</p>
<p>“I know nothing about Project 2025. I have not seen it, have no idea who is in charge of it, and, unlike our very well received Republican Platform, had nothing to do with it,” Trump wrote Thursday on his social media platform Truth Social.</p>
<p>“The Radical Left Democrats are having a field day, however, trying to hook me into whatever policies are stated or said. It is pure disinformation on their part,” he continued. “By now, after all of these years, everyone knows where I stand on EVERYTHING!”</p>
<p>Trump has delivered keynote speeches at Heritage Foundation events <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?435817-1/president-trump-remarks-heritage-foundation" target="_blank">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.jacksonville.com/story/news/trump/2022/04/21/donald-trump-visiting-amelia-island-heritage-foundation-meeting/7397314001/" target="_blank">times</a>. An <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/11/politics/trump-allies-project-2025/index.html" target="_blank">analysis</a> by CNN showed 140 former Trump administration staffers were involved in the project. Kevin Roberts, Heritage Foundation president, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/20/us/politics/republican-president-2024-heritage-foundation.html" target="_blank">told</a> the New York Times in April 2023 that Trump had been briefed on the project.</p>

<p>Biden declined to say if the incident, which is under investigation by the Secret Service, was an assassination attempt.</p>
<p>“I have an opinion, but I don’t have any facts,” Biden said, speaking from the Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, police department, near his vacation home there. “So I want to make sure we have all the facts before I make some comment.”</p>
<p>Biden said he hadn’t spoken to Trump yet, but that he hoped to talk with him by phone soon.</p>
<p>“I have tried to get a hold of Donald. He’s with his doctors. Apparently he’s doing well,” Biden said. “I plan on talking to him shortly. I hope when I get back to the telephone.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump on social media</h4>

	
<p>Trump posted on social media after Biden’s remarks concluded that he wanted to offer “condolences to the family of the person at the Rally who was killed, and also to the family of another person that was badly injured.”</p>
<p>“It is incredible that such an act can take place in our Country,” Trump wrote. “Nothing is known at this time about the shooter, who is now dead.”</p>
<p>Trump added that he was “shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear.”</p>
<p>“I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin,” Trump wrote. “Much bleeding took place, so I realized then what was happening.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘We cannot condone this’</h4>

	
<p>Biden said during his public comments the type of violence that took place <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/campaigns-elections/trump-campaigns-in-western-pennsylvania-with-rally-in-butler-county/" target="_blank">during the rally</a> was unacceptable and should never happen.</p>
<p>“There is no place in America for this kind of violence. It’s sick,” Biden said. “It’s one of the reasons why we have to unite this country. We cannot allow for this to be happening. We cannot be like this. We cannot condone this.”</p>
<p>Trump, he said, should have been able to have the rally without any violence.</p>
<p>“The idea that there’s political violence or violence in America like this is just unheard of, it’s just not appropriate,” Biden said. “Everybody must condemn it.”</p>
<p>Vice President Kamala Harris also issued a statement saying she had been briefed on the incident.</p>
<p>“Doug and I are relieved that he is not seriously injured. We are praying for him, his family, and all those who have been injured and impacted by this senseless shooting,” she said of Trump.</p>
<p>“Violence such as this has no place in our nation,” Harris wrote. “We must all condemn this abhorrent act and do our part to ensure that it does not lead to more violence.”</p>

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden dug in on his 2024 reelection bid Thursday at a solo press conference following the NATO summit in Washington, despite a growing list of rank-and-file Democrats and high-profile supporters urging him to abandon his campaign over suspected health concerns.</p>
<p>The highly anticipated press conference followed weeks of speculation about Biden’s ability to hold office and whether he should remain in the 2024 presidential election against former President Donald Trump. His performance, while markedly stronger than his <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-and-trump-trade-insults-accusations-lying-acrimonious-presidential-debate" target="_blank">devastating debate performance</a>, still included a notable gaffe and could leave questions open.</p>
<p>In response to the first question, about if Vice President Kamala Harris would be an able candidate against Trump, Biden mixed up their names.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t have picked Vice President Trump to be vice president if I didn’t think she was not qualified to be president,” he said.</p>
<p>Biden fielded a wide range of questions from reporters from both the U.S. and overseas for just less than an hour. The meeting with the press came exactly two weeks after the June 27 debate, during which Biden stumbled repeatedly, spoke in a hoarse voice and appeared unable to finish some sentences.</p>
<p>Biden and the White House have repeatedly attributed the debate as a “bad night” and pointed to clean results from his last three annual physical examinations.</p>
<p>Asked directly about congressional Democrats’ <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-camp-works-stem-growing-democratic-unease-over-reelection-prospects" target="_blank">unease</a> about his candidacy, Biden said he had made a final decision to remain in the race, but was working to show doubters he was up to the task and responding to criticism that he could not handle impromptu questioning.</p>
<p>“I’m determined on running,” he said. “But I think it’s important that I allay fears by seeing — let them see me out there.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Not stepping aside</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>He added that delegates pledged to him through the Democratic nominating process should be free to vote their conscience, but that no one had a better alternative to his candidacy against Trump, the presumed Republican candidate.</p>
<p>“I believe I’m the best qualified to govern and I think I’m the best qualified to win,” Biden said. “But there are other people who could beat Trump, too, but it’s awful hard to start from scratch.”</p>
<p>Asked if he would step aside if his polling data showed Harris could beat Trump, Biden said he would not, unless it also showed he could not win.</p>
<p>“No one’s saying that,” he added in a whisper. “No poll says that.”</p>
<p>Harris is seen as the likeliest replacement for Biden if he were to leave the race.</p>
<p>A trickle of congressional Democrats calling for him to leave the race <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/texas-us-house-member-calls-biden-withdraw-amid-debate-fallout" target="_blank">since</a> July 2 <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-camp-works-stem-growing-democratic-unease-over-reelection-prospects" target="_blank">turned</a> to a stream this week — with some reports indicating a poor performance Thursday night could give way to a flood.</p>
<p>Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a decades-long friend of Biden’s, <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/nancy-pelosi-it-s-up-to-biden-to-decide-if-he-s-going-to-run-214554181531" target="_blank">urged</a> colleagues in an MSNBC interview Wednesday to “let (Biden) deal with this NATO conference, this is a very big deal.”</p>
<p>At the time Biden began his Thursday press conference, 14 Democrats in Congress had explicitly called for him to leave the race, with others suggesting it.</p>
<p>Shortly after the press conference concluded, two more, Connecticut’s Jim Himes and California’s Scott Peters, called on Biden to step aside.</p>
<p>Biden should “make room for a new generation of leaders,” Himes, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, wrote in a statement <a href="https://x.com/jahimes/status/1811558379661185359" target="_blank">posted to X</a>.</p>
<p>Peters’ statement was <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/07/11/congress/how-dem-lawmakers-viewed-bidens-performance-00167743" target="_blank">provided to Politico</a>.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Emphasis on foreign policy</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Biden, who has rarely held press conferences, consulted a list of reporters and took questions that ranged from his fitness to serve as president to his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.</p>
<p>He lauded his accomplishments in office and said his job performance showed he was still up for the job.</p>
<p>“If I slow down, I can’t get the job done, that’s a sign that I shouldn’t be doing it,” he said. “But there’s no indication of that yet. None.”</p>
<p>Biden — a former chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee — appeared more comfortable on foreign policy questions than he was discussing his political future, providing in-depth answers on the Israel-Hamas war, China’s growing influence on the world stage and Ukraine’s war with Russia.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump mocks Biden</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>While Biden’s voice and grasp on the issues appeared stronger than he was at the debate, he still made several speaking mistakes, including the confusion between his vice president and Trump.</p>
<p>Trump mocked the mix-up on his social media platform Truth Social with a post saying “Great job, Joe!”</p>
<p>Later, Biden said Harris was qualified to be president and that is why he picked her as a running mate. His comments were worthy of attention given Harris would likely become the nominee if Biden were to step down.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Biden attacks Trump on NATO</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Biden declared the summit a “great success” and underlined the U.S. commitment to the alliance and to Ukraine’s war against Russia.</p>
<p>“For those who thought NATO’s time had passed, they got a rude awakening when Putin invaded Ukraine. Some of the oldest and deepest fears in Europe roared back to life because once again a murderous madman was on the march. This time, no one cowered in appeasement, especially the United States,” Biden said.</p>
<p>Prior to taking questions, he attacked Trump’s record of disparaging NATO and its foundational commitment to defend fellow member nations. The former president has threatened to withdraw from NATO and accused allies of shortchanging the organization’s defense coffers.</p>
<p>“A strong NATO is essential to American security, and I believe the obligation of Article Five is sacred. And I remind all Americans, Article Five was invoked only once in NATO’s long history, and that was to defend America after 9/11,” Biden said.</p>
<p>The three-day summit largely centered on Russia’s ongoing bombardment and occupation of parts of Ukraine. World leaders promised a path for Ukraine to join the alliance, and the event culminated with the U.S. joining two dozen allies in signing the Ukraine Compact to “(a)ffirm that the security of Ukraine is integral to the security of the Euro-Atlantic region and beyond.”</p>
<p>Biden <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?536945-1/president-biden-meets-ukrainian-president-zelensky" target="_blank">sat down</a> with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy earlier Thursday to underscore military assistance including “working with our NATO allies to ensure Ukraine is flying F-16s this summer.”</p>
<p>Zelenskyy thanked Biden for his “support and personal statement” following Russia’s strike on a children’s hospital in Kyiv Monday. Biden shook his head and responded the attack was “sick.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Another flub</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Between his meeting with Zelenskyy and the press conference, Biden introduced the Ukrainian president at a separate event to sign the compact, but mistakenly called him President Putin — the Russian leader at war with Zelenskyy’s country — before correcting himself.</p>
<p>When asked about the blunder, Biden acknowledged that he made the mistake but said that he corrected it immediately.</p>
<p>“I thought it was the most successful conference I’ve attended in a long time and find me a world leader who didn’t think it was,” he replied.</p>
<p>Biden did not stumble earlier in the week <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2024/07/09/biden-commends-nato-strength-pledges-more-aid-for-ukraine-against-russia/" target="_blank">when he delivered remarks</a> at NATO’s 75th anniversary event; rather, his voice remained steady and firm as he opened the ceremony for leaders from the 32 member nations.</p>

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. House on Thursday passed a measure to reverse an Education Department rule seeking to extend federal discrimination protections for LGBTQ students, though President Joe Biden has vowed to veto the legislation should it land on his desk.</p>
<p>House passage of the resolution on a party-line vote, <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2024354?Page=2" target="_blank">210-205</a>, is part of a barrage of GOP pushback at the state and federal levels to the <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/house-speaker-johnson-betsy-devos-lead-attack-title-ix-rule-protects-lgbtq-kids" target="_blank">Biden administration’s final rule for Title IX</a> since its April release. For all schools that receive federal funding, the rule protects against discrimination for students based on “sex stereotypes, sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex characteristics.”</p>
<p>Twenty-six states with GOP attorneys general have <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/more-half-states-sue-block-biden-title-ix-rule-protecting-lgbtq-students" target="_blank">sued to block</a> the rule, and courts have temporarily blocked it from going into effect in 14 states on August 1.</p>
<p>The 14 states with temporary blocks are: Alaska, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, Ohio, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming.</p>
<p>Illinois GOP Rep. Mary Miller <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-title-ix-regulation-targeted-republicans-congress" target="_blank">introduced the legislation</a> in early June. A week later, the Republican-controlled House Committee on Education and the Workforce approved it. Miller’s resolution seeks to reverse the rule through the <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF10023" target="_blank">Congressional Review Act</a>, a procedural tool Congress can use to overturn certain actions from federal agencies.</p>
<p>In the Senate, Mississippi Republican Cindy Hyde-Smith <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-joint-resolution/96" target="_blank">also introduced legislation</a> in June to try to block the final rule under the same tool. The Senate version has gathered over 30 Republican cosponsors.</p>
<p>Rep. Virginia Foxx — chairwoman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce and a fierce opponent of the administration’s final rule — said during the floor debate Wednesday that she wanted to preserve Title IX, which helped equalize funding for women’s sports and education programs beginning in 1972.</p>
<p>“Title IX ushered in a golden era for women’s competition and education,” the North Carolina Republican said. “There is sanctity in the community and tradition of these memories, these spaces and these opportunities for young girls.”</p>
<p>Regardless of whether the attempt to roll back the measure is successful in the Democratic-controlled Senate, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SAP-HJRes-165.pdf" target="_blank">Biden</a>’s veto threat leaves virtually no possibility it could be adopted this year.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Democrats, LGBTQ advocates in opposition </h4>

	
<p>Democrats and LGBTQ advocates have described the effort to overturn the rule as motivated by misinformation and fear.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, this resolution has been clouded by misinformation, unfounded fears and with some, just hatred of transgender individuals,” said Rep. Bobby Scott, a Virginia Democrat and ranking member of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, during the debate.</p>
<p>Oregon’s Rep. Suzanne Bonamici — ranking member of the House Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education — said the resolution was “another attempt to undercut this administration’s efforts to empower survivors and protect all Americans from discrimination.”</p>
<p>“If Republicans truly cared about protecting women and children, they would stop this prejudiced rhetoric and take action on bills that would actually protect women from discrimination and harassment and defend women’s reproductive health care, make child care more affordable, preserve opportunities in workplaces for all parents, especially women,” Bonamici said.</p>
<p>Scott called on the House to “reject these narratives and focus on real issues of safety and equity.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Final rule blocked in more states </h4>

	
<p>Meanwhile, challenges to the rule are playing out in a handful of federal courts.</p>
<p>Last week, Judge John Broomes of the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas temporarily blocked the measure from taking effect in the Sunflower State, along with Alaska, Utah and Wyoming.</p>
<p>Broomes also halted the rule from taking effect in “the schools attended by the members of Young America’s Foundation or Female Athletes United, as well as the schools attended by the children of the members of Moms for Liberty,” all groups that sued alongside the four states, per the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ksd.152561/gov.uscourts.ksd.152561.53.0.pdf" target="_blank">order</a>.</p>
<p>Under Broomes’ order, the rule is also halted in an Oklahoma public school attended by a minor who is one of the plaintiffs.</p>
<p>In June, U.S. District Judge Terry Doughty of Louisiana <a href="https://lailluminator.com/2024/06/13/title-ix-transgender/" target="_blank">issued a temporary injunction</a> barring the final rule from taking effect there, along with Idaho, Mississippi and Montana.</p>
<p>In Kentucky federal court, Chief Judge Danny Reeves <a href="https://kentuckylantern.com/2024/06/17/us-judge-in-kentucky-blocks-biden-title-ix-rules-says-sex-gender-identity-not-the-same-thing/" target="_blank">temporarily blocked the final rule</a> in the Bluegrass State, plus Tennessee, Ohio, Indiana, West Virginia and Virginia. Reeves rejected the department’s request for a partial stay of the injunction while its appeal plays out, per a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.kyed.104801/gov.uscourts.kyed.104801.117.0.pdf" target="_blank">Wednesday court filing</a>.</p>
<p>The Education Department has confirmed it is appealing the other two rulings but did not have an update Wednesday on whether it is filing a notice of appeal on the most recent ruling in the Kansas federal court.</p>
<p>The spokesperson reiterated earlier this week that the agency has “asked the trial courts to allow the bulk of the final rule to take effect in these states as scheduled, on August 1, while the appeals are pending.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">LGBTQ advocacy groups push back on GOP effort</h4>

	
<p>Allen Morris, policy director for the advocacy group National LGBTQ Task Force, said the vote was part of a pattern of anti-LGBTQ policy measures.</p>
<p>“When you look at the rise in hatred and the rise in violence and the rise of young LGBTQ individuals not having the support that they need, where suicide rates are high, it is disappointing to see our opposition go against us with such a high level of intention,” he said.</p>
<p>Morris told States Newsroom that “a lot of what is happening with this extremism is not founded in truth.”</p>
<p>“It is founded in ways to spew hate and to spew fear. It is a lot of fear mongering, and it’s anything to make people feel like their backs are up against the wall, or as if they don’t have the power,” he said.</p>
<p>Echoing a previous statement, a spokesperson for the Department of Education said it “does not comment on pending legislation” and emphasized that all schools receiving federal funding are obligated to comply with the new regulations as a condition of receiving those funds.</p>
<p>The department has yet to finalize a separate rule establishing new criteria for transgender athletes.</p>

Jon Tester (D-MT) departs the Capitol on July 8, 2024 in Washington, DC. Several Democratic members of Congress have urged President Joe Biden to withdraw from the presidential race after his June 27 debate against presumed Republican nominee Donald Trump. Concerns about Biden's age and perceived slowing down have intensified, with critics fearing these issues could undermine his ability to effectively challenge Trump in the upcoming election. (Kent Nishimura/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Democrats in Congress called on President Joe Biden to prove to voters that he is up for another four years in the Oval Office, though many in interviews pledged to stick with him as the presumptive nominee as they returned to the Capitol on Monday following the Fourth of July recess.</p>
<p>Questions over Biden’s ability to continue with his reelection campaign dominated the nation’s capital throughout the day. Biden shipped a defiant letter to Hill Democrats and unexpectedly called in to a popular morning MSNBC show to make his case. At the White House, reporters engaged in a tense back-and-forth with Biden press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre over the president’s mental fitness.</p>
<p>Most significantly, the comments about Biden’s future from more than 20 lawmakers came just ahead of crucial meetings Tuesday, when Senate and House Democrats will huddle separately to work out the path ahead for Biden’s reelection bid.</p>
<p>The decision about whether to back Biden is especially tough for vulnerable senators, who are seeking to hold the chamber against long odds, and House members from swing districts full of Republican voters.</p>
<p>Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, a close confidant to Biden, defended the president when asked by States Newsroom whether Biden can steer the narrative back to policy issues and away from questions about his cognitive function, following his shaky debate performance on June 27.</p>
<p>“I’m really struck no one’s asked me a question about should Donald Trump drop out, should Donald Trump have a neurological exam, should Donald Trump be facing Republicans calling for him to step aside given his demonstrably immoral, unhinged conduct? He’s a convict,” Coons said, referring to the former president and presumptive GOP nominee. “In my view, Joe Biden has won our primaries, has won our confidence and deserves our support.”</p>
<p>Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet said Democrats must be level-headed about whether to encourage Biden to withdraw as their presumptive nominee, arguing that it is now more of a moral question than a political one.</p>
<p>“I think it is really important for us, as Democrats, to have an open discussion and to have an open debate to ensure that we are on a path to winning the White House, to winning the Senate, to winning the House,” Bennet said. “And I think that’s an act, not of disloyalty, but an act of loyalty.”</p>
<p>This year’s election is especially critical for Democrats in swing districts and purple states, and party leaders need to ensure the top of the ticket can help those people, not hinder them, said Bennet, who is not up for reelection.</p>
<p>Rep. Melanie Stansbury of New Mexico said she wants House Democrats to unify at Tuesday morning’s party meeting.</p>
<p>“My hope is that Democrats come to a reasonable consensus about the path forward, which is that we have to defeat Donald Trump,” Stansbury said.</p>
<p>“And right now we’ve got to work like hell to make sure that people understand the consequences of reelecting Donald Trump. He is a convicted felon, he is a perpetrator in the January 6th (attack), he is all the things that we know he is. And so while I understand the media focus on the current moment, we really need to shift back to the real danger,” Stansbury said.</p>
<p>The unease among congressional Democrats came after a handful of senior House Democrats on Sunday said Biden should step down on a private phone call with Democratic leaders, according to media reports. Rep. Adam Smith of Washington publicly called on Biden to exit the race Monday.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The Biden defenders</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin said his confidence in Biden is “high,” but he understands “the reality of the challenges that he faces and we face since the debate.”</p>
<p>“It’s raised a national discussion about his competence and the ability to finish the campaign,” Durbin said.</p>
<p>The Illinois lawmaker said he has been discussing alternatives to Biden with colleagues, but so far hasn’t heard a name he’s willing to endorse publicly.</p>
<p>Durbin said he does worry that if Biden remains the nominee, the focus will stay on his health and not on the issues that Democrats want to be front and center in the campaign.</p>

	</div>

	
<p>Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine said he told voters in his home state over the Fourth of July week that he respects Biden and “never had reason to question his ability to be a patriot, put the country first. And I’m sure he’ll make a decision that does that.”</p>
<p>“And that decision is going to be one that I support,” he said.</p>
<p>Kaine said that Biden often does better talking to smaller groups of voters and suggested his campaign get him in that setting more often, if they want to alleviate concerns.</p>
<p>“Okay, he had a bad debate performance. But when he interacts with everyday folks who are going through challenges, talking about their aspirations and how to achieve them, that’s his strong suit,” Kaine said. “And I’ve seen him do that again and again and again. And I hope the campaign will find ways for him to do that because he does it better than anybody.”</p>
<p>California Rep. Ami Bera said Biden has a pretty good chance to outrun his debate performance, especially considering all the bad headlines that came out during the 2016 Trump campaign.</p>
<p>“Donald Trump came back from ‘Access Hollywood,’ right?” Bera said. “So there’s a long time in this campaign cycle. It was always going to be a close race, but it’s going to be hard if we’re not on the same page.”</p>
<p>Bera called on Biden to meet with Democrats in Congress and for the party to be honest about polling and fundraising.</p>
<p>“I think that the debate was not a good debate. It was one that gave a lot of folks pause,” Bera said. “But the president has said he’s committed to running. At this juncture, having a divided house doesn’t make sense. That’s why my advice is, he ought to come to the Democrats or ought to invite us to meet with him somewhere else. And we all ought to get on the same page.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Congressional Black Caucus chair supportive of Biden</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Nevada Democratic Rep. Steven Horsford, who also chairs the Congressional Black Caucus, said he decided to support Biden’s ongoing candidacy after talking with voters in his district.</p>
<p>“I’m a frontline member in a battleground state. I have as tough of a district as anyone here in the House and I’ve been a frontliner for the last three cycles,” Horsford said. “What my constituents have said is they voted for President Joe Biden, and they expect their representative to honor their vote and the will of the people. And there’s a process and that process should not be overturned by a few select members in Congress.”</p>
<p>Sen. Alex Padilla of California said he remains steadfast in his support for Biden.</p>
<p>“I would encourage my colleagues to take all the time and energy that we’re spending on this topic and put it into voter outreach and organizing for November,” he said.</p>
<p>New Mexico Sen. Ben Ray Luján said he continues to back Biden and is confident that he will win reelection in November.</p>
<p>“What I want to see is President Biden out and about, like we saw this weekend, talking to more people at rallies and areas and just being himself,” Luján said. “I think that he’s the best when he’s just himself and chatting with people.”</p>
<p>Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chair Nanette Barragán said she supports Biden and isn’t focused on what the risk could be if voters don’t gain more confidence in his health.</p>
<p>“I think he can win. He has won. He has ideas. He’s got plans,” Barragán said. “When I talk to people, even people who’ve been undecided have said ‘The president has ideas and he has a track record. The other person is just going up there and telling lies.’”</p>
<p>Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto said that she continues to back Biden because of his record while in the White House.</p>
<p>“He’s been there every step of the way supporting Nevadans as we came through the pandemic, as we fight for a woman’s right to choose, as we lower costs for families, and fighting for affordable housing,” Cortez Masto said. “He’s been on the picket lines with so many in my state. So at the end of the day, I know he’s good for Nevada, and so I stand with him.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">More defenders</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden said Democrats have “a lot of work to do” to get Biden reelected in November, but said “that’s always the case.”</p>
<p>And while the debate was a “rough night,” he said, there will be many more of those if Trump is reelected president in November.</p>
<p>“You want a lot of rough nights? You’re gonna get four years of them if you elect Donald Trump,” Wyden said.</p>
<p>Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, who is also chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said he will continue to back Biden.</p>
<p>“I support Joe Biden. He is our nominee,” Peters said. “I’m confident he will win and we’re going to be able to hold the Senate as well.”</p>
<p>New Jersey Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman said Democrats need to unify “to protect this democracy” and brushed aside a question about whether Biden is being honest with himself about his health.</p>
<p>“I don’t believe that he’s ever done anything that suggests to me that he’s a liar, like his opponent,” Watson Coleman said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Conversations are healthy’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said she has confidence in Biden to do the right thing, but didn’t say what exactly she believes that is.</p>
<p>“I think the conversations are healthy,” Shaheen said. “I expect him to do what’s in the best interest of the country.”</p>
<p>Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey said, “the most important thing right now is to beat Donald Trump. Talking to you all is not gonna necessarily help that.”</p>
<p>Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who is up for reelection in Wisconsin, would not answer reporters directly when asked if she supports Biden.</p>
<p>“I support the Democratic ticket,” she said.</p>
<p>Rep. Jared Huffman of California said the Democratic Caucus meeting Tuesday, which will be private, will be “important” and that he wasn’t ready to comment further on Biden’s reelection bid.</p>
<p>“I support continuing this conversation and winning the election,” Huffman said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Not answering questions</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse refused to answer repeated questions from reporters on Capitol Hill, saying he wanted to wait to hear what his colleagues say during the Tuesday closed-door lunch.</p>
<p>Several senators, including Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine, quickly bypassed reporters or pointed them to written statements they’ve issued.</p>
<p>Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland declined to comment “because we’re still in the middle of the whole thing.”</p>
<p>“We’re all working for the best solution,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Senators with tough races</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Vulnerable U.S. senators, who have so far been quiet, issued statements Monday addressing Biden’s ability to remain in the presidential campaign.</p>
<p>Sen. Jon Tester of Montana said in a written statement Biden “has got to prove to the American people—including me—that he’s up to the job for another four years,” according to media <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/4760277-tester-says-biden-must-prove-hes-up-to-the-job/" target="_blank">reports</a>.</p>
<p>“Meanwhile, I’ll continue to do what I’ve always done: Stand up to President Biden when he’s wrong and protect our Montana way of life,” Tester said in his statement.</p>
<p>Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio said on the campaign trail Monday that he’s heard concerns from voters regarding Biden moving forward in the race, according to an NBC News <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/live-blog/trump-biden-election-2024-live-updates-rcna160227" target="_blank">report</a>.</p>
<p>“I’m not a pundit. I’ve talked to people across Ohio. They have legitimate questions about whether the president should continue his campaign, and I’ll keep listening to people,” Brown said.</p>
<p>Washington Sen. Patty Murray, the president pro tempore and chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, issued a written statement highly critical of Biden remaining the nominee.</p>
<p>“I have a deep appreciation and strong respect for Joe, who has led a historic first term as President,” Murray wrote.</p>
<p>“Still, we need to see a much more forceful and energetic candidate on the campaign trail in the very near future in order for him to convince voters he is up to the job,” she said. “At this critical time for our country, President Biden must seriously consider the best way to preserve his incredible legacy and secure it for the future.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Parkinson’s disease specialist</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Administration officials defended Biden on Monday during a 75-minute, and at times tense, press briefing where reporters largely questioned Biden’s capacity to continue his reelection bid.</p>
<p>Jean-Pierre told reporters the president has cleared detailed neurological exams during each of his three annual physicals, the last one being in February.</p>
<p>The exams “have been detailed, they have been extensive,” she said, refusing to confirm names of medical specialists, for security reasons in a lengthy back-and-forth with reporters.</p>
<p>Journalists pressed Jean-Pierre about a Monday <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/08/us/politics/parkinsons-expert-white-house.html" target="_blank">report</a> in the New York Times that a Parkinson’s disease specialist from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center visited the White House eight times from July 2023 to March. Parkinson’s is a “progressive disorder that affects the nervous system and the parts of the body controlled by the nerves,” <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/parkinsons-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20376055" target="_blank">according to</a> the Mayo Clinic.</p>
<p>Jean-Pierre said “thousands” of military personnel come to the White House.</p>
<p>“Has the president been treated for Parkinson’s? No. Is he being treated for Parkinson’s? No, he’s not. Is he taking medication for Parkinson’s? No. So those are the things I can give you full-blown answers on, but I’m not going to confirm a specialist, or any specialist, that comes to the White House,” Jean-Pierre said.</p>
<p>Jean-Pierre repeatedly stated that Biden receives regular “verbal check-ins” with his doctor, usually while he is exercising.</p>
<p>The White House released a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Letter7.8.24.pdf" target="_blank">two-page memo </a>much later Monday that Dr. Kevin Cannard “was the neurological specialist that examined President Biden for each of his annual physicals.”</p>
<p>“His findings have been made public each time that I have released the results of the President’s annual physical,” wrote Dr. Kevin O’Connor, physician to the president. “President Biden has not seen a neurologist outside of his annual physical.”</p>
<p>Cannard has been the Neurology Consultant to the White House Medical Unit for 12 years and has held regular clinics for “active-duty members” at the White House, according to the letter.</p>
<p>The president is scheduled to spend most of the week with NATO leaders at the summit in Washington, D.C., and will give a solo press conference Thursday evening.</p>
<p>National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said during the press briefing “we’re not picking up any signs of (concerns) from our allies at all.”</p>
<p>Kirby dismissed questions that Biden’s debate performance could be illustrative of his communications with his international counterparts.</p>
<p>“What I saw in that debate is not reflective of the man and the leader and the commander-in-chief that I have spent many, many hours with over the last two-and-a-half years, in terms of the specificity of the way he probes, the questions he asks,” Kirby said. “Heck, just this morning he was asking me questions about a situation on the European continent that I couldn’t answer, and I told him I’d have to get back to him.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Biden pushes back with letter, calls in to ‘Morning Joe’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24794331-bidenletterjuly8" target="_blank">letter</a> to congressional Democrats, Biden <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-tells-congressional-dems-he-staying-race-urges-end-speculation" target="_blank">wrote</a> Monday that he is “firmly committed to staying in this race, to running this race to the end, and to beating Donald Trump.”</p>
<p>He then called into MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” for a live phone <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe" target="_blank">interview</a> during which he criticized Democrats urging him to exit the race as “elites.”</p>
<p>“I’m getting so frustrated by the elites — now I’m not talking about you guys — the elites in the party, ‘Oh, they know so much more.’ Any of these guys that don’t think I should run, run against me. Announce for president, challenge me at the convention,” he said to hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski.</p>
<p>When asked by Brzezinski whether he can assure Americans that he won’t have another performance like the June 27 debate, Biden responded, “Look at my career, I’ve not had many of those nights.”</p>
<p>The live interview came one day after Biden held a rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where he was joined by U.S. Sen. John Fetterman, Rep. Madeleine Dean and Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. Austin Davis.</p>
<p>Biden began the weekend with a 22-minute <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-first-tv-interview-debate-denies-medical-condition-it-was-bad-episode" target="_blank">interview</a> Friday night with ABC’s George Stephanopoulos during which he attributed his debate performance to a “bad episode.”</p>
<p>The first sign of waning Democratic support appeared July 2 when Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas became the first sitting congressional Democrat <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/texas-us-house-member-calls-biden-withdraw-amid-debate-fallout" target="_blank">to call on Biden to withdraw</a> from the 2024 race.</p>

(Photo used with permission of ABC News)</p><p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden on Friday in his first televised interview since the presidential debate defended his reelection bid and rejected calls that he should step aside amid growing anxiety among some Democrats about his mental and physical state.</p>
<p>The 22-minute<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/abc-news-anchor-george-stephanopoulos-exclusive-interview-biden/story?id=111695695" target="_blank"> interview </a>with ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos came as some lawmakers and other prominent Democrats have said Biden should suspend his campaign and let someone else become the official nominee. Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner is &#8220;attempting to assemble a group of Democratic senators to ask President Biden to exit the presidential race,&#8221; <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/05/mark-warner-joe-biden-exit-race-democratic-senators/" target="_blank">according</a> to the Washington Post.</p>
<p>But Biden said that’s unnecessary, distilling his actions during the June 27 debate as simply a “bad night.”</p>
<p>“It was a bad episode, no indication of any serious condition,” Biden said. “I was exhausted. I didn’t listen to my instincts in terms of preparing and it was a bad night.”</p>
<p>Biden refused to answer a question about what he would do if allies and friends in Congress urged him to leave the presidential campaign.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to answer that question. It’s not going to happen,” Biden said.</p>
<p>Members of Congress and Democratic governors <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/democrats-reel-terrible-biden-debate-performance-he-defends-candidacy%C2%A0" target="_blank">have expressed concern</a> with Biden remaining the presumptive nominee ever since he struggled to answer questions and had moments where he appeared confused during the <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-and-trump-trade-insults-accusations-lying-acrimonious-presidential-debate" target="_blank">first presidential debate</a>.</p>
<p>Biden brushed aside Virginia Sen. Mark Warner’s plans to convene Democratic senators on Monday to discuss the future of Biden’s bid, which multiple news organizations <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/05/mark-warner-joe-biden-exit-race-democratic-senators/" target="_blank">reported</a> Friday. Both chambers of Congress will return to Washington next week.</p>
<p>“Mark is a good man,” Biden said, before incorrectly claiming Warner “tried to get the nomination” for president — Warner in 2006 <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna15234727" target="_blank">said</a> he would not make a bid. “Mark and I have a different perspective. I respect him.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Biden won’t commit to cognitive exam</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Stephanopoulos pressed Biden during the interview on whether he really has the mental and physical stamina to remain president for another four years, and whether Biden is being honest with himself about his age.</p>
<p>“I believe so,” Biden said. “I wouldn’t be running if I didn’t think I did. Look, I’m running again because I think I understand best what has to be done to take this nation to a completely new level.”</p>
<p>Biden repeatedly declined to commit to taking a cognitive exam, suggesting that his schedule and daily work load are evidence enough he’s up to the task of being president.</p>
<p>“I have a cognitive test every single day. Every day I have that test, everything I do,” Biden said. “You know, not only am I campaigning, I’m running the world.”</p>
<p>Biden added that there are 125 days left in the campaign and that people should watch him in the months ahead to determine if he’s suitable to be reelected to the highest position in the government.</p>

<p>The ABC News interview aired just hours after Biden <a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2024/07/05/defiant-biden-tells-wisconsinites-im-staying-in-the-race/" target="_blank">held a rally</a> in Madison, Wisconsin, where he repeatedly criticized the Republican presumptive presidential nominee, Donald Trump.</p>
<p>This November’s presidential election, Biden said, should be about character, honesty and decency.</p>
<p>“Let’s focus on what really matters: We’re running against the biggest liar and the biggest threat to our democracy in American history,” Biden said. “That’s not hyperbole.”</p>
<p>Biden sought to shift the attention from his performance at the debate to flubs Trump has made over the years, including in a Fourth of July speech in 2019 when the former president said securing the airports was essential during the Revolutionary War.</p>
<p>“He said George Washington’s army won the Revolution by taking control of the airports from the British,” Biden said before crossing himself somewhat jokingly. “Talk about me misspeaking — airports from the British in 1776? It’s true, he is a stable genius.”</p>
<p>Trump, at the time, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-blames-teleprompter-revolutionary-war-airports-flub-n1026931" target="_blank">criticized the teleprompter</a> for the comment.</p>
<p>Biden during the rally listed off what he views as his accomplishments, including canceling some student loan debt, nominating Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court, signing a same-sex marriage bill, approving gun safety policies and working with Congress on a sweeping climate change law.</p>
<p>“I’m not letting one, 90-minute debate wipe out three-and-a-half years of work,” Biden said.</p>
<p>During the next four years, Biden said, whoever holds the Oval Office will appoint at least two new justices to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Should that be Trump, a recent <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/presidential-immunity-extends-some-official-acts-supreme-court-rules-trump-case" target="_blank">ruling from the justices </a>on presidential immunity could lead to a challenging time for the country, Biden said.</p>
<p>“For over two centuries, America’s been a free, democratic nation,” Biden said. “And I’ll be damned if in the year 2024 — just two years before our 250th anniversary as a nation — I’ll let Donald Trump take this away.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Illinois Dem congressman says Biden should quit</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Biden briefly spoke with reporters in the White House pool after the rally, saying he was determined to stay in the race and brushing aside calls from some lawmakers for him to withdraw.</p>
<p>When asked by a reporter about Warner suggesting Biden let another person take over as the party’s presidential candidate, Biden said Warner “is the only one considering that.”</p>
<p>Later in the evening, Illinois Democratic Rep. Mike Quigley said on MSNBC that Biden should step aside.</p>
<p>“Mr. President, your legacy is set. We owe you the greatest debt of gratitude,” Quigley <a href="https://x.com/allinwithchris/status/1809367054845386771" target="_blank">said</a>. “The only thing that you can do now to cement that for all time and prevent utter catastrophe is to step down and let someone else do this.”</p>

(Photo by Brendan McDermid-Pool/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — U.S. presidents enjoy full immunity from criminal charges for their official “core constitutional” acts, but no immunity for unofficial acts, the Supreme Court ruled Monday, sending former President Donald Trump’s case back to the lower courts.</p>
<p>The justices left open the question of how far official acts can reach, possibly reshaping the contours of the American presidency.</p>
<p>Trump escalated his immunity claim to the nation’s highest bench after two lower courts <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-claim-presidential-immunity-turned-down-federal-appeals-court-dc" target="_blank">denied</a> his request for protection from federal criminal charges alleging he schemed to overturn the 2020 presidential results.</p>
<p>The decision about the presumptive Republican presidential nominee’s actions while in office likely <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/delayed-supreme-court-ruling-makes-trump-trial-2020-charges-unlikely-election" target="_blank">closes the door</a> to any chance that Trump’s election subversion case could go to trial before Election Day.</p>
<p>The justices took up the case in February but did not hear <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-floats-return-trial-court-trump-presidential-immunity-case" target="_blank">oral arguments</a> until April 25.</p>
<p>The trial court must now grapple with whether Trump’s alleged conduct to spread false information about the 2020 election results and conspiring to overturn them qualified as official presidential action.</p>
<p>In a 6-3 <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf" target="_blank">opinion</a>, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote that the president is subject to criminal prosecution for unofficial acts, “like everyone else.”</p>
<p>“But unlike anyone else, the President is a branch of government, and the Constitution vests in him sweeping powers and duties,” Roberts wrote. “Accounting for that reality—and ensuring that the President may exercise those powers forcefully, as the Framers anticipated he would—does not place him above the law; it preserves the basic structure of the Constitution.”</p>
<p>The Supreme Court held that Trump’s conversations with Department of Justice officials regarding the election results were official but left unanswered questions about other conduct named in Department of Justice special counsel Jack’s Smith <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.258149/gov.uscourts.dcd.258149.1.0_2.pdf" target="_blank">indictment</a> of Trump.</p>
<p>“​​Certain allegations—such as those involving Trump’s discussions with the Acting Attorney General—are readily categorized in light of the nature of the President’s official relationship to the office held by that individual,” the opinion reads. “Other allegations— such as those involving Trump’s interactions with the Vice President, state officials, and certain private parties, and his comments to the general public—present more difficult questions.”</p>
<p>In a dissenting opinion, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote the decision makes the president “immune from criminal prosecution if he used the trappings of his office to violate criminal law.”</p>
<p>“If the occupant of that office misuses official power for personal gain, the criminal law that the rest of us must abide will not provide a backstop,” Sotomayor wrote. “With fear for our democracy, I dissent.”</p>
<p>Trump <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-makes-one-last-presidential-immunity-argument-us-supreme-court" target="_blank">claimed</a> in court filings that he could not be prosecuted for actions he took while still in office. His legal team also argues that former presidents cannot be tried in the court of law unless they are first impeached by the U.S. House and convicted by the Senate.</p>
<p>The indictment, which a federal grand jury handed up in August 2023, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/fueled-lies-trump-charged-seeking-overturn-2020-election-6" target="_blank">alleges</a> Trump knowingly spread falsehoods to his supporters, plotting with co-conspirators to overturn results in seven states and eventually working his base into a frenzy that culminated in a violent attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, the day Congress was to certify electoral votes.</p>
<p>DOJ’s Smith <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.258149/gov.uscourts.dcd.258149.1.0_2.pdf" target="_blank">charged</a> the former president with conspiracy to defraud the United States; conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding; obstruction of, and attempt to obstruct, an official proceeding; and conspiracy against rights.</p>

Biden and Trump are facing off in the first presidential debate of the 2024 campaign. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)</p><p>President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump pitched to undecided voters Thursday night during the first debate of the presidential campaign — trading insults over their policy differences, immigration and who represents a threat to democracy.</p>
<p>During the debate from CNN’s headquarters in Atlanta, the two men argued over who can do better for Americans during the next four years on a broad swath of issues, ranging from the economy to climate change to foreign policy. Each repeatedly accused the other of lying.</p>
<p>Biden early in the debate spoke softly at several points, coughed and gave several somewhat confusing answers. At one point, Biden appeared to lose his train of thought and ended an answer with the statement that “we finally beat Medicare.”</p>
<p>The two disagreed sharply over access to reproductive rights, including abortion, with Trump arguing Democrats’ position is “radical” and Biden saying that leaving decisions up to the states has been “terrible” for women.</p>
<p>Biden, 81, and Trump, 78, did not shake hands at the beginning, a break from past debates.</p>
<p>Near the end of the debate, Trump said political violence was “totally unacceptable,” though he went on to downplay the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, defending the conduct of his mob of supporters.</p>
<p>Trump initially did not directly answer a question about whether he would accept the results of the election if he lost. When pressed by moderator Dana Bash, Trump conditioned his answer.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Jabs over personal conduct</h4>

	
<p>Even with rules meant to minimize crosstalk, the debate — moderated by Bash, anchor and chief political correspondent, and Jake Tapper, anchor and chief Washington correspondent — saw many moments of acrimony.</p>
<p>While Trump had harsh words about Biden’s border policy and Biden blasted his predecessor for appointing Supreme Court justices who overturned the constitutional right to an abortion, they saved their harshest criticism for the other’s personal conduct.</p>
<p>Referring to reports that, as president, Trump said veterans killed in action in France during World War II were “suckers and losers,” Biden, invoked his son, Beau, who was a National Guard veteran and later died of brain cancer.</p>
<p>“My son was not a loser and was not a sucker,” Biden told his predecessor, scowling. “You’re the sucker. You’re the loser.”</p>
<p>Trump denied he ever made the remark, first reported in The Atlantic and confirmed in other reports.</p>
<p>Biden at several times attacked Trump’s credibility and truthfulness, saying after one answer, “Every single thing he said is a lie.”</p>
<p>“I never heard so much malarkey in my whole life,” he said in response to another of Trump’s answers.</p>
<p>Trump brought up the conviction of Biden’s son, Hunter, on federal gun charges this year. And he said that Joe Biden could face prosecution for his performance on border security.</p>
<p>Trump and his legal team <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-floats-return-trial-court-trump-presidential-immunity-case" target="_blank">argued in front of the Supreme Court</a> in April that presidents have absolute immunity from criminal prosecution.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump’s conviction</h4>

	
<p>Thursday’s event was the first presidential debate where one participant was a convicted felon.</p>
<p>A New York state jury in May <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-found-guilty-34-felony-counts-ny-hush-money-trial-10" target="_blank">found Trump guilty</a> of 34 felony counts for falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels for an affair she testified they had that Trump didn’t want to harm his 2016 election prospects.</p>
<p>Trump has denied the affair and it hasn’t affected his support within the GOP, though his sentencing July 11 could affect his campaign strategy.</p>
<p>Trump rejected his criminal conviction during the debate and reiterated his stance that he didn’t have a sexual relationship with an adult film star.</p>
<p>“I didn’t have sex with a porn star,” Trump said, marking the first time such words, or anything near them, have been uttered during a presidential debate.</p>
<p>“I did nothing wrong, we have a system that was rigged and disgusting,” Trump said. “I did nothing wrong.”</p>
<p>Trump also responded to the question by referring to Hunter Biden.</p>
<p>“When he talks about a convicted felon, his son is a convicted felon,” Trump said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Jan. 6 disagreement</h4>

	
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court is <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/delayed-supreme-court-ruling-makes-trump-trial-2020-charges-unlikely-election" target="_blank">expected to release a ruling </a>within days in another trial involving Trump, this time on whether presidents enjoy complete immunity from criminal prosecution for their actions while in office.</p>
<p>The justices’ decision will determine whether a federal trial against Trump for election interference stemming from his actions on Jan. 6, 2021 can proceed.</p>
<p>During the debate, Trump said that “on January 6 we were respected all over the world,” but that changed after Biden took office.</p>
<p>Trump seemed to imply that the people who stormed the Capitol building were “innocent” and “patriotic,” saying that “you ought to be ashamed of yourself” for those people being in prison.</p>
<p>Biden said that Trump encouraged the “folks” who attacked the U.S. Capitol building and U.S. Capitol Police officers.</p>
<p>“If they’re convicted, he says he wants to commute their sentences,” Biden said, criticizing Trump’s behavior that day. “These people should be in jail. They should be the ones held accountable.”</p>
<p>Biden rejected the idea that the people who attacked the police and disrupted the electoral certification were patriots.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Divide on abortion rights</h4>

	
<p>Reproductive rights — including access to abortion — sharply divided Biden and Trump, who sparred over which political party’s stance is better.</p>
<p>Trump said that he agreed with the U.S. Supreme Court’s <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-rejects-attempt-limit-access-abortion-pill-6" target="_blank">decision earlier this month</a> to leave access to mifepristone, one of two pharmaceuticals used in medication abortion, in place. And he said he wouldn’t seek to limit access if elected president in November.</p>
<p>“I agree with their decision to have done that, and I will not block it,” Trump said, adding that the Supreme Court’s earlier decision to overturn the constitutional right to an abortion was a good thing.</p>
<p>“We brought it back to the states and the country is now coming together on this issue,” Trump said. “It’s been a great thing.”</p>
<p>Trump said he supports exceptions for rape, incest or the life of the woman.</p>
<p>Biden rejected Trump’s classification that Democrats are “radical” on abortion policy and said he supports reinstating the protections that existed under Roe v. Wade.</p>
<p>“It’s been a terrible thing,” Biden said of leaving decisions about abortion access up to state lawmakers, comparing it to leaving civil rights decisions up to the states.</p>
<p>Trump said during an interview with Time magazine <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-leaves-door-open-banning-medication-abortion-nationwide" target="_blank">released in April </a>that his campaign was on the brink of releasing a policy regarding mifepristone, one of two pharmaceuticals used in medication abortion. The campaign has yet to release that policy.</p>
<p>Trump suggested that he would be okay with states limiting or barring access to contraception during a May interview with a Pittsburgh TV news station. But he quickly <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-signals-hes-open-state-limits-contraceptive-access-then-insists-hes-not" target="_blank">walked back those comments</a> in a social media post.</p>
<p>The Heritage Foundation, a conservative-leaning think tank, has suggested that another Trump administration could block the mailing of mifepristone by enforcing the Comstock Act.</p>
<p>The group included the proposal along with dozens of others in Project 2025, its <a href="https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf" target="_blank">920-page blueprint</a> for a second Trump administration.</p>
<p>The 1873 anti-obscenity law <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/1873-law-banned-mailing-boxing-photos-could-it-block-abortion-pills-too" target="_blank">hasn’t been enforced in decades </a>and is referred to as a “zombie law” by reproductive rights organizations, but it is still technically a law.</p>
<p>A future Republican attorney general seeking to enforce the law to block the mailing of mifepristone would likely see the law challenged in court, likely working its way up to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Mifepristone is one of two pharmaceuticals used in medication abortions, which are approved for up to 10 weeks gestation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The two-drug regimen accounts for about 63% of all abortions within the United States, according to the Guttmacher Institute.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">First of two debates</h4>

	
<p>The two presidential debates this year are a departure from past years, with both candidates <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/three-presidential-debates-one-vp-debate-scheduled-ahead-2024-election" target="_blank">ditching the proposed schedule</a> from the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates.</p>
<p>Biden and Trump <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/cnn-sets-first-biden-trump-presidential-debate-june-27-atlanta" target="_blank">later agreed</a> to two debates, the one held Thursday by CNN and another one on Sept. 10 that will be hosted by ABC News.</p>
<p>CNN opted to hold its debate at its studios in Atlanta, Georgia, without an audience. Thursday night’s debate was also earlier than any other presidential debates, which have traditionally begun in September or October.</p>
<p>The television news network created frustration ahead of the debate with the White House Correspondents Association when it decided to keep the pool, the group of journalists that travel everywhere with the president, out of the room.</p>
<p>Kelly O’Donnell, president of the WHCA, released a statement Thursday afternoon that the organization was “deeply concerned that CNN has rejected our repeated requests to include the White House travel pool inside the studio”</p>
<p>“The pool is there for the ‘what ifs?’ in a world where the unexpected does happen,” wrote O’Donnell, who is also the senior White House correspondent for NBC News. “A pool reporter is present to provide context and insight by direct observation and not through the lens of the television production.”</p>
<p>CNN’s rules also said that neither Biden nor Trump was allowed to bring props or pre-written notes into the debate area.</p>
<p>Each stood behind “a uniform podium” and was not allowed to interact with campaign staff during the two commercial breaks.</p>
<p>Biden was scheduled to travel with first lady Jill Biden to Raleigh, North Carolina, immediately after the debate wrapped. They’re set to participate in campaign events on Friday morning before traveling to New York later in the day.</p>
<p>The Bidens are then expected to travel to Red Bank, New Jersey, on Saturday for more campaigning before heading back to Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland.</p>
<p>Trump will attend a campaign rally Friday afternoon in Chesapeake, Virginia. In a release announcing the event, Trump criticized Biden on inflation, crime and drug addiction, and immigration.</p>

(U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Theoplis Stewart II)</p><p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden will pardon U.S. military veterans who were discharged or convicted under military law for consensual same-sex relations, the administration announced Wednesday.</p>
<p>The White House could not provide an exact number of veterans who will be pardoned, but the administration estimates thousands were convicted over several decades and may be eligible.</p>
<p>The convictions were enforced under a military law that prohibited certain types of sex from May 1951 to December 2013.</p>
<p>When asked why Biden chose now to pardon the veterans, senior administration officials told reporters on a call Tuesday that Biden is “committed to doing everything he can to ensure that the culture of the armed forces reflect the values that make us an exceptional nation and to maintaining the finest fighting force in the world.”</p>
<p>The officials continued that Biden is “taking this historic step to ensure that we live up to our sacred obligation to care for all service members, veterans and their families.”</p>
<p>Biden said in a statement Wednesday that he is “righting an historic wrong by using my clemency authority to pardon many former service members who were convicted simply for being themselves.”</p>
<p>“Our Nation’s service members stand on the frontlines of freedom, and risk their lives in order to defend our country,” Biden said in the written statement.</p>
<p>“Despite their courage and great sacrifice, thousands of LGBTQI+ service members were forced out of the military because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Some of these patriotic Americans were subject to court-martial, and have carried the burden of this great injustice for decades.”</p>
<p>Administration officials said guidance will be posted on the Department of Defense website for veterans to apply for proof they are eligible for pardon under the proclamation.</p>
<p>Veterans can then use the certificate of proof to apply to their respective military branch for a discharge upgrade.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Military law and consensual sex</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Biden’s Wednesday proclamation effectuates the pardons for any veterans, alive or deceased, who were discharged or convicted in military court under <a href="https://www.sapr.mil/public/docs/ucmj/UCMJ_Article125_Sodomy.pdf" target="_blank">Article 125</a> of the Uniform Code of Military Justice for consensual sexual relationships.</p>
<p>While the law prohibited forceful sex acts with minors and animals, Article 125 also banned “unnatural carnal copulation” — defined as oral or anal sex — with another person of the same or opposite sex.</p>
<p>The military code was updated in 2013 to reflect that only forceful, not consensual, sexual acts could be penalized.</p>
<p>Administration officials acknowledged that Article 125 is not the only military law that targeted LGBTQ+ service members.</p>
<p>Senior administration officials told reporters that while the proclamation is narrowly focused on convictions under Article 125, the Department of Justice has been instructed to flag any other clemency applications for veterans penalized for sexual orientation or gender identity under other military statutes.</p>
<p>The U.S. military has a decades-long history of anti-LGBTQ+ policies. The armed forces outright banned gay and lesbian service members during World War II.</p>
<p>In 1993, President Bill Clinton set a “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy, essentially allowing LGBTQ+ members to serve in the military, so long as they didn’t make their sexual orientation public.</p>
<p>The policy was <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-bill/2965?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22H.R.+2965%22%7D&amp;s=6&amp;r=3" target="_blank">repealed</a> under President Barack Obama.</p>
<p>Days after his inauguration, Biden issued an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/25/executive-order-on-enabling-all-qualified-americans-to-serve-their-country-in-uniform/" target="_blank">executive order</a> overturning a ban on transgender service members.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Pardon power</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The Constitution <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46179" target="_blank">empowers</a> the president with several ways to forgive crimes against the United States. The president can fully pardon, or lift, punishments without qualification for individuals or groups of people; commute, or reduce, an offender’s sentence; or issue a reprieve, basically delaying an offender’s sentence.</p>
<p>Clemency applications are processed through the Justice Department’s Office of the Pardon Attorney.</p>
<p>Biden <a href="https://www.justice.gov/pardon/presidential-proclamation-marijuana-possession#:~:text=On%20October%206%2C%202022%2C%20President%20Biden%20announced%20a%20full%2C,people%20with%20those%20prior%20offenses." target="_blank">issued</a> sweeping pardons in October 2022 and December 2023 for marijuana offenses.</p>

It is the site of the press center for media covering the CNN debate between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump on Thursday. (Photo by Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder)</p><p>President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump will get a crucial opportunity to reach undecided voters and set the terms for the 2024 presidential campaign at Thursday night’s debate in Atlanta.</p>
<p>Partisans on either side have already made up their minds about which candidate they’ll support. And with this year’s race serving as a rematch of 2020, many Americans have already formed strong and possibly unchangeable opinions about the candidates.</p>
<p>Yet there is a sizable group of voters who haven’t decided who they’ll support in November, Christopher Stout, a professor of political science at Oregon State University, said in an interview with States Newsroom.</p>
<p>“On one hand, opinions about Joe Biden and Donald Trump are baked in,” Stout said. “On the other hand, there’s a lot of people who aren’t paying any attention to politics and this is their first time thinking about the 2024 election.”</p>
<p>For Biden, a major objective will be to show voters the 81-year-old incumbent can be energetic and forceful, Stout and political strategists said.</p>
<p>Trump, 78, may focus on appealing to voters in the ideological middle and wavering Republicans who want a conservative candidate but are turned off by the former president’s antics.</p>
<p>On policy, each candidate has issues they will capitalize on as strengths. Trump will probably press Biden on immigration and inflation, while Biden undoubtedly will be eager to criticize Trump on reproductive rights.</p>
<p>The debate, sponsored by CNN, will be moderated by the network’s Jake Tapper and Dana Bash and begin at 9 p.m. Eastern, with no studio audience. It is set to last for 90 minutes and will air live on CNN with simulcast available for other cable and broadcast networks.</p>
<p>Each candidate’s microphone will be muted while the other is speaking. No props are allowed but each man will be given a pen, pad and bottle of water, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/25/politics/how-to-watch-cnn-debate/index.html" target="_blank">CNN said.</a></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Can Trump be boring?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Trump could gain ground with moderate and independent voters by appearing steady.</p>
<p>After winning the presidency in 2016, Trump lost to Biden in 2020 amid a sense that Republican-leaning voters were weary of his unorthodox style and tendency to create scandal.</p>
<p>“If he’s boring and he looks like a typical politician, that’s going to be a big plus for him,” Stout said. “If he looks like a typical politician and he seems more moderate, then there’s the opportunity to bring back a set of voters who were once Republican who have now left the party.”</p>
<p>At the same time, there’s likely not too much down side for Trump if he does go off-script, as voters have come to expect outlandish comments and behavior, Republican strategist Doug Heye said.</p>
<p>“Donald Trump is gonna say something crazy,” Heye said. “That is all factored in and that’s not changing anybody’s mind.”</p>
<p>Heye cited recent remarks Trump has made about shark attacks, electrocution from oversized batteries and taking his shirt off to reveal psychic wounds inflicted by political opponents.</p>
<p>In a move reminiscent of his reality-show past, Trump has teased a possible announcement of <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/calm-conservative-confident-what-gop-senators-want-trumps-vice-presidential-pick" target="_blank">his vice presidential pick</a> at the debate.</p>
<p>But even if voters expect some degree of eccentricity from Trump, that will not help him win over the undecided voters who will decide the election, said Rodell Mollineau, a co-founder and partner at the Washington-based strategy firm ROKK Solutions and a veteran of Democratic campaigns.</p>
<p>“If you’re actually trying to reach voters, I’m not sure how Trump ranting and raving, talking about delusional conspiracy theories, helps him win independent voters,” Mollineau said.</p>
<p>Trump will face an additional unique challenge if he tries to look like a traditional presidential candidate: his <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-found-guilty-34-felony-counts-ny-hush-money-trial-10" target="_blank">34 felony convictions</a> in New York last month and the three other felony prosecutions against him pending, including two related to his efforts to overturn his loss in the 2020 election that led to the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection.</p>
<p>“I’m watching to see how he talks about or doesn’t talk about his many court dalliances and the conviction and whatever else he has hanging over his head,” Mollineau said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Can Biden be forceful?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Biden faces different questions he must answer.</p>
<p>Voters have doubts about the incumbent’s ability, due in part to his age, inclination for misspeaking and a concerted effort by Republicans and GOP-aligned media to portray Biden as past his prime.</p>
<p>“I think Biden in part is going to be trying to overcome the image that Trump and Republicans in general have been very successful in creating,” University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock said.  “They’ve been working on this now for at least five years, and that is the image of Biden being too old, being not up to it physically or mentally to continue to serve as president for another four years.”</p>
<p>Biden countered that narrative — at least temporarily — with an exuberant performance at <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-warns-freedom-and-democracy-are-under-attack-fierce-state-union-address" target="_blank">the State of the Union address</a> this year, several observers said.</p>
<p>Matching that energy will help him have a positive debate, they said.</p>
<p>But Heye noted that despite rave reviews from Democrats, the president’s State of the Union performance did not improve his standing in polls.</p>
<p>“The reaction from Democrats was: game changer,” Heye said. “And if we look at the polling, the game didn’t change at all.”</p>
<p>Biden would also benefit by reminding voters of his policy record, and contrasting it with Trump’s, Stout and Mollineau said.</p>
<p>“It will advantage him if he can talk about policy,” Stout said. “People don’t know the things he has done and so there’s hope maybe to inform people and sway the electorate.”</p>
<p>Biden should target left-leaning voters by reminding them of his achievements on climate and the environment and his administration’s efforts to create jobs, Stout said.</p>
<p>Mollineau added that Biden must remind voters of Trump’s tumultuous time in office and Biden’s achievements thus far, while balancing that message with an acknowledgment that many Americans are unsatisfied.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">An early debate</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The debate, which will be broadcast from CNN’s Georgia headquarters, comes much earlier in the election cycle than usual, even before the party conventions that typically symbolize the start of the general election.</p>
<p>The candidates agreed to the unusual schedule after rejecting a proposal from the Commission on Presidential Debates, a nonpartisan organization that has organized the events for decades, typically with three meetings between presidential candidates and one between would-be vice presidents.</p>
<p>All debates are usually in the fall.</p>
<p>This year’s June schedule could give the candidates a chance to frame the race moving forward, as many voters will be tuning in to the contest for the first time.</p>
<p>But the nearly 19 weeks remaining until Election Day could also mean a candidate with a weak performance has time to recover, or that a strong performance could diminish.</p>
<p>“I do not believe anyone is going to either win or lose the election this week,” Mollineau said.</p>
<p>Bullock, the Georgia professor, differed.</p>
<p>Because of the unpopularity of both candidates, and the sense that voters will be choosing the one they view as “the least of two evils,” either could provide a voter’s “final straw,” he said.</p>
<p>“They may hear something coming out of the mouths of one of these and say, ‘Yeah, that’s it,’” Bullock said. “‘That’s the final straw. I can’t support that one. It helps me make up my mind to go with the other person.’”</p>

(Photo by sdominick/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Though the new version of the form to apply for federal financial student aid has had its fair share of highly publicized hiccups, U.S. Under Secretary of Education James Kvaal says the department has made a lot of progress in the past couple of months.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://studentaid.gov/help/fafsa" target="_blank">Free Application for Federal Student Aid</a> — better known as FAFSA — got a makeover after Congress passed the <a href="https://studentaid.gov/help-center/answers/article/fafsa-simplification-act" target="_blank">FAFSA Simplification Act</a> in late 2020. But users faced glitches and technical errors during the Dec. 30 soft launch and past the Jan. 8 official debut for the 2024-25 form, which covers the upcoming school year.</p>
<p>Advocates voiced concerns over the form’s failure to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/24/politics/fafsa-inflation-fix-income/index.html" target="_blank">adjust for inflation</a>, its <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/miscalculation-in-fafsa-formula-is-another-unforced-error" target="_blank">formula miscalculation</a> and its <a href="https://fsapartners.ed.gov/knowledge-center/library/electronic-announcements/2024-04-01/update-tax-data-received-fa-ddx-and-manually-entered-information" target="_blank">tax data errors</a>, prompting processing delays the department has worked to fix. The federal agency has also taken steps to address major issues that prevented parents without Social Security numbers from completing the form.</p>
<p>“We’re fixing things at a rapid pace, and we’ve been keeping the community updated. We have an <a href="https://fsapartners.ed.gov/knowledge-center/topics/fafsa-simplification-information/2024-25-fafsa-issue-alerts" target="_blank">issues guide</a> on the website that lets people know the problems we’re aware of and what the potential solutions are. In almost every case now, there is a way for students to submit the form,” Kvaal told States Newsroom in an interview.</p>
<p>“It may be a customer service experience that is not what we originally designed, and so we’re gonna continue to try and make this process easier and faster for all students, including those whose parents may not have Social Security numbers, but it is possible now for everyone to submit a FAFSA,” Kvaal said.</p>
<p>He oversees higher education and financial aid, including the Office of Federal Student Aid, which is the largest student financial aid provider in the country.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">More than 11 million FAFSA submissions</h4>

	
<p>Kvaal said the department has already received more than 11 million FAFSA submissions for the 2024-25 school year.</p>
<p>Last week, the <a href="https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-announces-jeremy-singer-fafsa-executive-advisor-office-federal-student-aid" target="_blank">department said</a> it has made “significant progress” in closing the gap in FAFSA submissions to an 8% decrease compared to this time last year, down from a nearly 40% decrease in March.</p>
<p>For both undergraduate and graduate students, the FAFSA form is a key indicator for financial aid eligibility, which comes in the form of grants, loans, work-study funds and scholarships.</p>
<p>The form is also not exclusive to first-year college students, and those already enrolled <a href="https://studentaid.gov/apply-for-aid/fafsa/renew" target="_blank">must renew their application</a> each academic year.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">&#8216;It’s still not perfect for all applicants&#8217; </h4>

	
<p>Though the department has made progress to address major known issues, “the system, certainly six months after it opened, is still not a totally functioning system,” said MorraLee Keller, senior director of strategic programming at the National College Attainment Network, a nonprofit membership and advocacy organization.</p>
<p>“Right now, the form is working for a lot of applicants, but it’s still not perfect for all applicants,” she added.</p>
<p>The organization <a href="https://www.ncan.org/page/fafsatracker" target="_blank">monitors FAFSA completion</a> for graduating high school seniors nationally and compares those figures to the previous school year. Keller said “one thing that we’re seeing is the class of &#8217;24, at this point in time, is almost 13 percentage points behind in the rate at which the seniors have filed a FAFSA” this past academic year.</p>
<p>“We are significantly behind in the number of FAFSAs, particularly for our graduating seniors, so that is ultimately probably going to have an impact in enrollment because completing a FAFSA is a pretty good indicator about whether you plan to enroll in college this fall,” Keller said.</p>
<p>Tennessee, Louisiana, Illinois, Washington, D.C., and Texas have the highest percentages of high school seniors completing the FAFSA form, according to NCAN’s tracker. Nevada, Florida, Arizona, Utah and Alaska have the lowest percentages. In Virginia, 44% of seniors — or 45,850, down from 51,597 last year — have completed the FAFSA.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kvaal said he thinks “it’s important to note that just about everybody can get their FAFSA through the process now.” He added that “there are some specific instructions that people in certain situations need to follow carefully” and encouraged applicants to pay careful attention to the instructions and help hints.</p>
<p>“The FAFSA is broadly available, and it’s not accurate to say that there are students who can’t get through them,” he said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">New strategy</h4>

	
<p>In early May, the federal agency launched the <a href="https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-launches-next-phase-fafsa-support-strategy-boost-completion-rate-among-high-school-students" target="_blank">FAFSA Student Support Strategy</a>, which has now provided more than “$30 million in funding and counting and has reached more than 180 organizations across the country” in an attempt to get more students to complete the form, according to the <a href="https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-announces-jeremy-singer-fafsa-executive-advisor-office-federal-student-aid" target="_blank">department</a>.</p>
<p>The department also recently announced that Jeremy Singer, current president of the College Board, would serve as the new FAFSA executive adviser.</p>
<p>In late May, U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said the department has <a href="https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/secretary-cardona-outlines-steps-modernizing-office-federal-student-aid" target="_blank">taken steps</a> aimed at “modernizing” the Office of Federal Student Aid, including the department’s search for a new chief operating officer, per a <a href="https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/secretary-cardona-outlines-steps-modernizing-office-federal-student-aid" target="_blank">news release</a>. That person would replace <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2024/04/26/richard-cordray-federal-student-aid/" target="_blank">Richard Cordray</a>, who, in the midst of backlash and criticism toward the department over the botched rollout, said in April he would depart.</p>
<p>Part of the department’s efforts, Cardona said, include conducting a “full-scale review” of the Office of Federal Student Aid’s “current and historical organization, management, staffing, workflow structures, business processes, and operations” and hiring an independent consulting firm.</p>
<p>The department is also reviewing “contracts and acquisition procedures” in an effort to hold vendors accountable, Cardona said.</p>
<p><strong>If I haven’t filled out the 2024-25 FAFSA form, what should I do? </strong></p>
<p>Though students have until <a href="https://studentaid.gov/apply-for-aid/fafsa/fafsa-deadlines" target="_blank">June 30, 2025,</a> to complete the 2024-25 FAFSA form, deadlines vary based on individual colleges and states. (Many colleges, including those in Virginia, have priority deadlines, meaning you&#8217;ll need to meet those to get the best chance at financial aid. Virginia students who are not eligible for FAFSA may qualify for <a tabindex="0" href="https://www.schev.edu/financial-aid/financial-aid/federal-state-financial-aid/vasa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virginia Alternative State Aid, or VASA.)</a></p>
<p>Kvaal encouraged anyone considering college this fall to visit <a href="http://studentaid.gov" target="_blank">Studentaid.gov</a> and fill out the FAFSA as soon as possible.</p>
<p>“If you had been hearing that there were challenges with the form or people were encountering obstacles, we’ve made a lot of progress in making the form work in recent weeks, and most people, their form is getting through in one to three days, and we’re sending information to colleges that they need to make financial aid offers,” he said.</p>
<p>Keller also encouraged families to not give up on completing the form.</p>
<p>“The time is not gone — get your FAFSA filed this summer if you want to go to school this fall,” she said.</p>

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The Democratic National Committee has taken a significant step toward formally designating Joe Biden as the party’s presidential nominee before the Democratic convention in August — a move that’s necessary to place him on the Ohio ballot for November’s election, States Newsroom has been told.</p>
<p>DNC members finalized their vote Thursday to move forward with an all-virtual roll call vote after 360 members voted in favor, two voted against and five abstained, according to a spokesperson.</p>
<p>In addition, the DNC will offer an online portal for Democrats to say what they want to see included in the national party platform as it is constructed ahead of the convention.</p>
<p>DNC Chair Jaime Harrison wrote in a statement that during the first term of the Biden-Harris administration, “we’ve seen the incredible outcomes that can result when democratic ideas are put into action.”</p>
<p>“I’m excited to announce that this year, through our testimony portal, we’ll be able to hear from more Americans and receive more input than ever before as we chart the road to the 2024 Democratic National Convention,” Harrison wrote. “We’ll build a platform that is rooted in the collective experience of Americans and mobilize people to vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in November.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virtual roll call</h4>

	
<p>In order to nominate Biden and Harris before the Ohio deadline, the DNC’s Credentials Committee and the Rules Committee will next need to adopt their reports to allow the virtual roll call, which will formally nominate Biden and Harris, to take place before the convention.</p>
<p>The DNC Convention is scheduled to begin in Chicago on Aug. 19, but the state of Ohio <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2024/05/28/dems-say-they-will-get-around-biden-ohio-ballot-issue-by-holding-virtual-roll-call-before-deadline/" target="_blank">requires that </a>presidential candidates are formally nominated at least 90 days before Election Day.</p>
<p>The DNC is also moving forward with plans to hold some version of the traditional roll call during the convention, though the party is looking to “build on the success” of the roll call vote held during the all-virtual 2020 presidential nominating convention, necessitated by the pandemic.</p>
<p>The DNC spokesperson told States Newsroom that the goal for this year’s convention-week nomination is to pull in more Americans beyond the delegates who are in Chicago at the United Center.</p>
<p>Democrats, the spokesperson said, are looking to revive elements of the 2020 roll call vote, which they called “Roll Call Across America.”</p>
<p>The all-virtual nomination during the 2020 convention featured Democratic delegates voting from historic and sometimes quirky locations.</p>
<p>Those included the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Alabama, the Joseph R. Biden Jr. Railroad Station in Delaware, a cornfield in Iowa, an art studio and community center in Louisiana, a field of grazing cattle in Montana, Biden’s childhood home in Pennsylvania and a beach in Rhode Island where a chef held a plate of fried calamari.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Democratic platform </h4>

	
<p>In addition to working toward the nomination of Biden and Harris, the DNC is preparing to build the official Democratic platform in the weeks ahead.</p>
<p>The DNC planned to open the online portal Friday that will allow all Democrats to fill out a form detailing what they want to see in this year’s party platform, the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>There will be a version in <a href="https://demconvention.com/platform-testimony/" target="_blank">English</a> as well as one in <a href="https://demconvention.com/es/testimonio-para-la-plataforma-del-partido/" target="_blank">Spanish</a>.</p>
<p>The first Platform Committee meeting will be July 16, followed by the Rules Committee meeting on July 19 and the Credentials Committee’s first meeting on July 21.</p>
<p>Those meetings will be held the same week that Republicans gather in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to hold their convention and formally nominate Donald Trump as their presidential candidate.</p>
<p>All the DNC’s committee meetings will be virtual and streamed online for anyone to watch. Each committee includes about 200 people from the 57 states and territories.</p>
<p>The DNC on Friday also <a href="https://democrats.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Drafting-Committee-Members.pdf" target="_blank">announced</a> the 15 members of the platform drafting committee.</p>
<p>That list includes Chair Louisa Terrell, former director of the White House Office of Legislative Affairs; former Labor Department Secretary Marty Walsh; Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison; Ted Kaufman, who worked in Biden’s U.S. Senate office before serving as the U.S. senator from Delaware; Jeremy Bash, who previously worked as the chief of staff at the CIA and the U.S. Department of Defense; Rebecca Brocato, who previously worked as a special assistant to Biden and as the National Security Council senior director for legislative affairs; Marla Blunt-Carter, who worked as the projects manager and director of constituent services in Biden’s Senate office as well as the senior adviser and political strategist for U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester; Joelle Gamble, former deputy director of the National Economic Council; Josh Hsu, former counsel and chief legal adviser for Vice President Harris; Angela Kelley, the chief adviser for policy and partnerships at the American Immigration Council and at the American Immigration Lawyers Association; former South Carolina state Sen, Marlon Kimpson; Rohini Kosoglu, former deputy assistant for Biden and domestic policy adviser for Harris; Lori Lodes, executive director at Climate Power, a political organization focused on addressing climate change; Jeff Peck, who worked for Biden on the Senate Judiciary Committee as general counsel and staff director in the late 1980s and early 1990s; Bharat Ramamurti, former deputy director for the National Economic Council; and Hilda Solis, secretary of labor during the Obama administration.</p>
<p>The drafting committee’s first meeting will be July 11. It will be held virtually and available for anyone to watch on the DNC’s YouTube page.</p>
<p>Democratic National Convention Committee Chair Minyon Moore wrote in a statement that during the “final sprint to the 2024 Democratic National Convention, we look forward to drawing upon our party’s rich diversity and hearing from Americans from all walks of life as we chart the course for the next four years under the leadership of President Biden and Vice President Harris.”</p>
<p>“The Democratic Party’s strength is our diversity and, together, we will build a platform that reaffirms who we are as Democrats and sets us on the path to victory once again this November.”</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court Friday upheld a federal law that bars people subject to domestic violence restraining orders from owning a firearm.</p>
<p>In an 8-1 decision on United States v. Rahimi, Chief Justice John Roberts <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/22-915_8o6b.pdf" target="_blank">wrote in the opinion </a>that “our Nation’s firearm laws have included provisions preventing individuals who threaten physical harm to others from misusing firearms.”</p>
<p>“When an individual has been found by a court to pose a credible threat to the physical safety of another, that individual may be temporarily disarmed consistent with the Second Amendment,” Roberts wrote.</p>
<p>Justice Clarence Thomas, a staunch advocate of the Second Amendment, was the lone dissent.</p>
<p>Thomas argued that the question before the court was not if someone can have their firearms taken away under the Second Amendment, but instead whether the “Government can strip the Second Amendment right of anyone subject to a protective order — even if he has never been accused or convicted of a crime. It cannot.”</p>
<p>The White House and gun safety advocates welcomed the long-awaited decision as a major victory.</p>
<p>“No one who has been abused should have to worry about their abuser getting a gun,” President Joe Biden said in a statement. “As a result of today’s ruling, survivors of domestic violence and their families will still be able to count on critical protections, just as they have for the past three decades.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">2022 decision</h4>

	
<p>This was the first major test of the 2022 Supreme Court decision — New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association v. Bruen — that struck down a New York law limiting carrying firearms in the open in a decision from the high court that <a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2022/06/23/u-s-supreme-court-expands-gun-rights-in-striking-down-new-york-concealed-carry-law/" target="_blank">greatly expanded gun rights</a>. Thomas wrote that decision.</p>
<p>Because of the Bruen decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit vacated Zackey Rahimi’s conviction on the grounds that the federal law violated his Second Amendment rights.</p>
<p>In 2019, Rahimi <a href="https://www.justice.gov/media/1304601/dl?inline#:~:text=In%20December%202019%2C%20Rahimi%20and,knocking%20her%20to%20the%20ground." target="_blank">assaulted</a> his girlfriend in Arlington, Texas, and threatened to shoot her if she told anyone, according to the Department of Justice. That led to a restraining order that suspended his handgun license and prohibited him from possessing firearms.</p>
<p>But Rahimi did not adhere to that order and then threatened another woman with a gun, and two months later opened fire in public five times.</p>
<p>J. Matthew Wright, a federal public defender in North Texas who argued for his client, Rahimi, declined to comment on the decision.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Roberts says appeals court was wrong</h4>

	
<p>Roberts argued the court’s decision in Bruen does “not help Rahimi,” and said the 5th Circuit’s decision was wrong in its methodology.</p>
<p>Roberts said instead of reviewing the circumstances in which the federal law “was most likely to be constitutional, the panel instead focused on hypothetical scenarios where the provision might raise constitutional concerns.”</p>
<p>He said that lower courts have misunderstood the methodology the high court used in the Bruen decision and that those “precedents were not meant to suggest a law trapped in amber.”</p>
<p>Roberts said that lower courts should discern “[w]hy and how the regulation burdens” on the Second Amendment right “are central to this inquiry.”</p>
<p>“For example, if laws at the founding regulated firearm use to address particular problems, that will be a strong indicator that contemporary laws imposing similar restrictions of similar reasons fall within a permissible category of regulations,” he said. “As Bruen explained, a challenged regulation that does not precisely match its historical precursors ‘still may be analogous enough to pass constitutional muster.’”</p>
<p>Liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a concurring opinion in which she said while she agreed with the Rahimi decision, she still believed Bruen was wrongly decided. However, she added the decision “clarifies Bruen’s historical inquiry.”</p>
<p>“Rather than asking whether a present-day gun regulation has a precise historical analogue, courts applying Bruen should ‘conside(r) whether the challenged regulation is consistent with the principles that underpin our regulatory tradition,’” she said.</p>
<p>Sotomayor said in the Rahimi case, the government did not identify a “founding-era or Reconstruction-era law that specifically disarmed domestic abusers,” but that it didn’t need to because there is “shared principle” in restricting gun use by those who pose a threat.</p>
<p>“History has a role to play in Second Amendment analysis, but a rigid adherence to history, (particularly history predating the inclusion of women and people of color as full members of the polity), impoverishes constitutional interpretation and hamstrings our democracy,” she said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Historical precedent</h4>

	
<p><a href="https://tennesseelookout.com/2023/11/08/u-s-supreme-court-considers-case-dealing-with-gun-rights-and-domestic-violence/" target="_blank">During oral arguments in November before the court</a>, U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, representing the Biden administration, argued that the 5th Circuit misinterpreted the Bruen decision.</p>
<p>She said there is historical precedent in the ability of Congress to “disarm those who are not law-abiding, responsible citizens.”</p>
<p>Under a 1994 federal law, anyone who has been convicted in any court of a “misdemeanor crime of domestic violence,” and, or, is subject to domestic violence protective orders, is prohibited from purchasing and having possession of firearms and ammunition.</p>
<p>During those oral arguments, the justices — both liberal and conservative — seemed to side with Prelogar’s argument that the federal law is in line with the longstanding practice of disarming dangerous people and does not violate an individual’s Second Amendment rights.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10209983/" target="_blank">More than half of female homicide victims are killed</a> by current or former male intimate partners. Firearms are used in more than 50% of those homicides.</p>
<p>More than two dozen states have laws that prevent someone subject to an order in a domestic violence case from buying or possessing a gun and ammunition.</p>
<p>Some of those states <a href="https://giffords.org/lawcenter/gun-laws/policy-areas/who-can-have-a-gun/domestic-violence-firearms/" target="_blank">include</a> Alabama, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin. Virginia <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/northam-signs-landmark-gun-control-bills-recommends-tweaks-to-two-others/">enacted laws</a> in 2016 and 2020 to establish and strengthen gun laws to protect domestic violence survivors.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Protecting victims</h4>

	
<p>Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-statement-supreme-courts-decision-united-states-v-rahimi" target="_blank">statement</a> the decision upheld a law that “protects victims by keeping firearms out of the hands of dangerous individuals who pose a threat to their intimate partners and children.”</p>
<p>“As the Justice Department argued, and as the Court reaffirmed today, that commonsense prohibition is entirely consistent with the Court’s precedent and the text and history of the Second Amendment,” Garland said.</p>
<p>Angela Ferrell-Zabala, the executive director of the gun safety advocacy group Moms Demand Action, said in a statement that the court’s decision will ensure that “millions across the country will be protected over the desires of gun rights extremists.”</p>
<p>“This is a win for the gun safety movement and another loss for the gun lobby hellbent on putting lives in danger,” Ferrell-Zabala said.</p>
<p>Douglas Letter, the chief legal officer of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, said in a statement that he hopes lower courts will follow the advice from Friday’s ruling.</p>
<p>“Guns are the number one weapon of choice for domestic abusers, and there is no reason why anyone who is a known danger should be permitted access to firearms,” Letter said.</p>

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Top Democratic campaign officials Thursday pressed their case for control of Congress and the White House by pointing toward the upcoming two-year anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court overturning the constitutional right to an abortion.</p>
<p>More than a dozen Democrats also introduced legislation in Congress to prevent a future Republican administration from using an 1873 law, known as the Comstock Act, to bar mailing abortion medication.</p>
<p>On a call with reporters, the three campaign leaders said voters must flip the House from red to blue, keep Democrats in control of the Senate against the long odds and ensure President Joe Biden stays in the Oval Office to prevent the GOP from potentially implementing nationwide restrictions on reproductive rights.</p>
<p>Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison, Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Vice Chair Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chair Rep. Suzan DelBene of Washington repeatedly said that Democrats would restore nationwide protections for abortion access if given unified control of government.</p>
<p>They, however, didn’t provide a clear road map for what Democrats would do on reproductive rights, including access to contraception and in vitro fertilization, if divided control of government continues.</p>
<p>Instead, they pointed to what Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, might do in the event voters elect him president during November’s elections.</p>
<p>“We need to be clear that Trump and MAGA Republicans want to ban abortion and they have a plan to do it through executive action without any bill ever passing Congress; because they believe that politicians should have the power to make these decisions for women, whose lives and stories they will never know,” Smith said on the call.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Comstock Act fears</h4>

	
<p>The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, has released “Project 2025,” a lengthy document that outlines what it believes Trump should do during a second term.</p>
<p>The Trump campaign hasn’t endorsed the document or said it would seek to implement it in full or in part, though a former Trump administration official led its development.</p>
<p>The proposal includes using the Comstock Act —  a law enacted more than 150 years ago to prevent the mailing of obscene materials, contraceptives and anything that could produce an abortion — to bar the shipment of medication abortion throughout the United States.</p>
<p>Smith on Thursday introduced a three-page bill that would eliminate that as a possibility, though the legislation may not advance in the Senate and is very unlikely to make it through the GOP-controlled House before November.</p>
<p>Medication abortion, which includes mifepristone and misoprostol, accounts for about 63% of abortions nationwide, according to the Guttmacher Institute. The two pharmaceuticals are also used for miscarriage care. Misoprostol has other medical uses, as well.</p>
<p>The Comstock Act, enacted in 1873, originally barred the mailing of materials considered lewd or obscene at the time, but is written so broadly that it has been used to bar boxing photographs, art and information about contraception.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title18-section1461&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim" target="_blank">law</a> explicitly prohibits mailing “every article or thing designed, adapted, or intended for producing abortion, or for any indecent or immoral use.” Smith’s bill would seek to eliminate those provisions.</p>
<p>Smith, when asked about the Comstock Act on the call Thursday, said the “zombie law” could be used to make medication abortion illegal without a vote in the Congress.</p>
<p>“It’s very clear what their plan is,” Smith said of Republicans. “And so this is another example of the very clear choice that American voters have.”</p>
<p>DelBene, who is leading Democrats’ campaign arm in the House, said on the call that Republicans are already trying to change when and how Americans have access to various reproductive rights by attaching amendments to the must-pass government funding bills.</p>
<p>“This election is fundamentally about our rights, our freedoms, our democracy and our future,” DelBene said. “House Republicans have made it clear they’re willing to do anything to take those away.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A divided Congress predicted</h4>

	
<p>The most likely outcome of November’s elections isn’t currently unified Democratic control in the eyes of some analysts however.</p>
<p>Three experts at Moody’s Analytics released an <a href="https://www.economy.com/getfile?q=EA99E998-560D-4A12-85DE-3727A7EBE9A8&amp;app=download" target="_blank">analysis</a> this week, showing the most probable result is that Biden will remain president with a divided Congress.</p>
<p>That scenario had a 40% probability, while a Republican sweep had a probability of 35%. Trump winning the presidential election and gaining a divided Congress had a 15% probability. A Democratic sweep had a 10% probability, according to the report.</p>
<p>The most likely scenario of Biden remaining president with a split Congress suggests that the GOP would flip the Senate and the Democrats would regain the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>“With the retirement of West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin, the deep-red state will almost surely elect a Republican senator, leaving the Senate evenly divided,” the report states. “But while recent polling shows that Senate races in Arizona, Maryland, Montana, Nevada and Ohio are close, Republicans need to take only one of these seats to regain the majority.”</p>
<p>“Each race has its own story, but helping the Republicans’ cause is angst over inflation and heightened concern over the immigrant crisis at the southern border,” the report adds.</p>
<p>The analysis goes on to say that “federal judicial decisions on redistricting efforts have also leaned in Democrats’ favor, boosting their chances” of regaining control of the House.</p>
<p>“Also, given that incumbents win reelection more than 90% of the time, the relatively high number of congressional retirements relative to previous cycles creates the potential for more change in the body,” the analysis states.</p>
<p>The report details the four outcomes of November’s election as well as the various economic scenarios that would play out under either a Biden or a Trump presidency for the next four years.</p>
<p>The report was written by Chief Economist Mark M. Zandi, Director/Senior Economist Brendan La Cerda and Economist Justin Begley.</p>

(Screenshot from committee webcast)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The only reason John Arthur is able to be a public school teacher is because his wife makes much more money than he does.</p>
<p>Arthur —  the 2021 Utah Teacher of the Year  — testified on Thursday at a hearing in the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions on the challenges facing public school teachers.</p>
<p>Arthur, who is also a member of the National Education Association and holds National Board Certification, pointed to pay as the main reason for both teachers leaving the profession and parents not wanting their children to become teachers.</p>
<p>“The No. 1 solution to addressing the issues we face must be increasing teachers’ salaries,” said Arthur, who teaches at Meadowlark Elementary School in Salt Lake City, Utah.</p>
<p>Gemayel Keyes, a teacher at Gilbert Spruance Elementary School in Philadelphia, told the committee that even as an educator, he still has an additional part-time job.</p>
<p>The special education teacher spent most of his career in education as a paraprofessional. At the time he moved into that role, the starting annual salary was $16,000 and the maximum was $30,000.</p>
<p>“It’s still pretty much the same,” he said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Minimum teacher salary </h4>

	
<p>Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, <a href="https://www.sanders.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/03.09.23-Sanders-Pay-Teachers-Act-text.pdf" target="_blank">introduced a bill</a> in March 2023 that would set an <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/766/all-actions" target="_blank">annual base salary</a> of $60,000 for public elementary and secondary school teachers.</p>
<p>“We understand that the children, young people of this country, are our future and there is, in fact … nothing more important that we can do to provide a quality education to all of our young people, and yet, for decades, public school teachers have been overworked, underpaid, understaffed, and maybe most importantly, underappreciated,” Sanders said in his opening remarks.</p>
<p>“Compared to many other occupations, our public school teachers are more likely to experience high levels of anxiety, stress and burnout, which was only exacerbated by the pandemic,” he said.</p>
<p>Sanders said 44% of public school teachers are quitting their profession within five years, citing “the extremely low pay teachers receive” as one of the primary reasons for a massive U.S. teacher shortage.</p>
<p>For the 2023-24 school year, a whopping 86% of K-12 public schools in the country documented challenges in hiring teachers, according to an October report from the <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/whatsnew/press_releases/10_17_2023.asp" target="_blank">National Center for Education Statistics</a>.</p>
<p>In Virginia, where the <a href="https://www.nea.org/resource-library/educator-pay-and-student-spending-how-does-your-state-rank?utm_medium=paid-search&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_campaign=rankings-estimates-report&amp;utm_content=&amp;ms=ads-rankings-estimates-report-se&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw0MexBhD3ARIsAEI3WHLwd8Qv-rHoH2JAUdRK2yLx0JOW7PQuh_NVgkB-n_mqchU8BZSoYAAaAi8SEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank">average teacher pay is $63,103</a>, there were roughly <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/17/legislation-to-bring-va-teacher-pay-to-national-average-gets-bipartisan-support/">3,600 vacancies in 2023</a>, according to Virginia Department of Education. The state&#8217;s new two-year budget provides for a 3% increase in teacher&#8217;s salaries.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Maryland sets $60,000 minimum </h4>

	
<p>But a minimum annual teacher salary of $60,000 is not far off for every state.</p>
<p>In Maryland, the <a href="https://marylandmatters.org/2024/06/03/blueprint-blues-local-leaders-cite-school-reform-plans-progress-problems/" target="_blank">Blueprint for Maryland’s Future</a> raises the starting salary for teachers to $60,000 a year by July 2026.</p>
<p>William E. Kirwan, vice chair of Maryland’s Accountability and Implementation Board, said the multi-year comprehensive plan, passed in 2021 in the Maryland General Assembly, “addresses all aspects of children’s education from birth to high school completion, including most especially, the recruitment, retention and compensation of high quality teachers.”</p>
<p>Kirwan said the “Blueprint’s principle for teacher compensation is that, as professionals, teachers should be compensated at the same level as other professionals requiring similar levels of education, such as architects and CPAs.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">An &#8216;allocation issue&#8217;</h4>

	
<p>Sen. Bill Cassidy, ranking member of the committee, dubbed Democrats’ solution of creating a federal minimum salary for teachers as a “laudable goal.”</p>
<p>But he noted that “the federal government dictating how states spend their money does not address the root cause of why teachers are struggling to teach in the classroom.”</p>
<p>“More mandates and funding cannot be the only answer we come up with. We must examine broken policies that got us here and find solutions to improve,” the Louisiana Republican said.</p>
<p>Nicole Neily, president and founder of Parents Defending Education, a parents’ rights group, argued that “schools don’t have a resource issue” but rather an “allocation issue.”</p>
<p>“There’s a saying: ‘Don’t tell me where your priorities are, show me where you spend your money, and I’ll tell you what they are.’ Education leaders routinely choose to spend money on programs and personnel that don’t directly benefit students,” said Neily.</p>
<p>Neily pointed to a 2021 report from the <a href="https://www.heritage.org/education/report/equity-elementary-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-staff-public-schools" target="_blank">Heritage Foundation</a>, which found that “standardized test results show that achievement gaps are growing wider over time in districts with (chief diversity officers).” Such staff members commonly encourage efforts at diversity, equity and inclusion in schools.</p>
<p>Robert Pondiscio, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, said “higher pay does not ease the burden we place on teachers or add hours to their day.”</p>
<p>“By all means, raise teacher pay, but do not assume that it will solve teacher shortages or keep good teachers in the classroom. Poor training, deteriorating classroom conditions, shoddy curriculum and spiraling demands have made an already challenging job nearly impossible to do well and sustainably,” he added.</p>

(Kena Betancur/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Scientists debated the origins of COVID-19 on Tuesday, trading barbs over whether the bulk of evidence available points to a natural spillover event from a wild animal or a virus designed in a lab and then let loose through an inadvertent leak.</p>
<p>The hearing in front of the U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee was part of ongoing efforts in Congress to apply the lessons learned during the pandemic to prevent or blunt the next outbreak.</p>
<p>Gregory Koblentz, associate professor and director of the Biodefense Graduate Program at George Mason University in Virginia, said during the <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/hearings/origins-of-covid-19-an-examination-of-available-evidence/" target="_blank">two-hour hearing</a> that debate continues in the scientific community about the origins.</p>
<p>“The possibility that SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately developed as a biological weapon has been unanimously rejected by all U.S. intelligence agencies,” Koblentz testified. “While the intelligence community is divided on the origin of the pandemic, most of the agencies have determined that the virus was not genetically engineered.”</p>
<p>Residents in Wuhan, China, were first diagnosed with “an atypical pneumonia-like illness” in December 2019, according to a COVID-19 <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/museum/timeline/covid19.html" target="_blank">timeline</a> from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>Initial cases all appeared linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market at the time, though there has since been much speculation about the types of research taking place at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.</p>
<p>Koblentz said he believes the available evidence points to a spillover event from an animal, though he added a “research-related accident can’t be ruled out at this time.”</p>
<p>The lack of transparency and data from the Chinese government has significantly hindered scientists’ efforts to unify around the origin of COVID-19, he said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Scientists battle over lab vs. spillover</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Richard Ebright, board of governors professor of chemistry and chemical biology and laboratory director at the Waksman Institute of Microbiology at Rutgers University in New Jersey, testified he believes a “large preponderance of evidence indicates SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, entered humans through a research incident.”</p>
<p>Ebright also leveled criticism at fellow panelist Robert Garry, who, along with a handful of co-authors, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9" target="_blank">published an opinion article</a> in the journal nature medicine in March 2020, titled “The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2.”</p>
<p>In the commentary, Garry and the other scientists wrote, “we do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible.”</p>
<p>Ebright said during Tuesday’s hearing that the opinion article represented “scientific misconduct up to and including fraud,” a characterization that Garry rejected during the hearing.</p>
<p>“The authors were stating their opinion, but that opinion was not well-founded,” Ebright said. “In March of 2020, there was no basis to state that as a conclusion, as opposed to simply being a hypothesis.”</p>
<p>Garry, professor and associate dean of the School of Medicine at Tulane University in Louisiana, argued on behalf of the spillover event during the hearing, testifying that the virus likely didn’t move directly from a bat to humans, but went to an unidentified intermediary animal.</p>
<p>“The bat coronaviruses are viruses that are spread by the gastrointestinal route,” Garry said. “For a virus like this to become a respiratory virus — it’s just going to require too many mutations, too many changes for a bat virus to spill directly over to a human being. That could only really happen in nature with replication through an intermediate animal.”</p>
<p>Garry also defended gain-of-function research during the hearing, arguing that it has had some beneficial impact, though he noted that it does need “appropriate safeguards and restrictions.”</p>
<p>Lawmakers and pundits have used several, often evolving, definitions for gain-of-function research in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The American Society for Microbiology <a href="https://asm.org/getmedia/24ebbde0-d618-4a8a-901c-6e297e6f92aa/HD-918-ASM-GoF-FactSheet-final.pdf" target="_blank">defines</a> it as techniques “used in research to alter the function of an organism in such a way that it is able to do more than it used to do.”</p>
<p>When research is “responsibly performed” on highly transmissible and pathogenic viruses, it can lead to advances in public health and national security, Garry testified.</p>
<p>“Without gain-of-function research, we’d have no Tamiflu. Without gain-of-function research, we wouldn’t have a vaccine to prevent cancer caused by infection by the human papilloma virus,” Garry said. “And without gain-of-function research, we won’t be able to identify how novel viruses infect us. And if we don’t know how they infect us, we cannot develop appropriate treatments and cures for the next potential pandemic creating virus.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Oversight of funding, research </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan raised several questions about whether there’s enough oversight of how the United States spends research dollars as well as what mechanisms are in place to monitor how private entities conduct certain types of research.</p>
<p>“While their research has the potential to cure diseases and boost our economy, unless they accept federal funding, there is very little federal oversight to ensure that private labs are engaged in safe and ethical research,” she said.</p>
<p>Koblentz from George Mason University said there is much less oversight of biosafety and biosecurity for private research facilities that don’t receive federal funding.</p>
<p>“In order to expand the scope of oversight to all privately funded research, (it) would require legislative action,” Koblentz said.</p>
<p>Congress, he said, should establish a national bio-risk management agency that would have authority over biosafety and biosecurity “regardless of the source of funding.”</p>
<p>“At the end of the day, it shouldn’t matter where the funding comes from in terms of making sure this research is being done safely, securely and responsibly,” Koblentz said.</p>
<p>Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul, ranking member on the committee, said the panel will hold an upcoming hearing specifically on gain-of-function research, including what steps Congress should take to ensure it doesn’t put the public at risk.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The next pandemic</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Committee Chairman Gary Peters, a Michigan Democrat, said during the hearing that lawmakers “must learn from the challenges faced during this pandemic to ensure we can better protect Americans from future potential biological incidents.”</p>
<p>“Our government needs the flexibility to determine the origins of naturally occurring outbreaks, as well as potential outbreaks that could arise from mistakes or malicious intent,” Peters said.</p>
<p>Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney, after listening to some of the debate, expressed exasperation that so much attention is going toward what caused the last pandemic and not on how to prepare for the next one.</p>
<p>“Given the fact that it could have been either, we know what action we ought to take to protect from either,” Romney said. “And so why there’s so much passion around that makes me think it’s more political than scientific, but maybe I’m wrong.”</p>
<p>The United States, he said, shouldn’t be funding gain-of-function research and should “insist” that anyone who receives federal funding follow the standards of the International Organization for Standardization.</p>

(Photo Illustration by Mario Tama/Getty Images)</p><p>Nearly three weeks after the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration proposed loosening a federal prohibition on marijuana, the next phases of policy fights over the drug’s status are starting to take shape.</p>
<p>Public comments, which the DEA is accepting on the proposal until mid-July, will likely include an analysis of the economic impact of more lenient federal rules.</p>
<p>Administrative law hearings, a venue for opponents to challenge executive branch decisions, will likely follow, with marijuana’s potential for abuse a possible issue.</p>
<p>Congress, meanwhile, could act on multiple related issues, including banking access for state-legal marijuana businesses and proposals to help communities harmed by the decades of federal prohibition.</p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Earl Blumenauer, a Democrat from Oregon and longtime advocate for legalizing marijuana who’s retiring at the end of the year, is encouraging his colleagues to build on the administration’s action by taking up bills on those related issues.</p>
<p>The politics of the issue should favor action, even in the face of an upcoming campaign season that typically slows legislative action, Blumenauer said in a May 17 interview, noting the popularity of a more permissive approach to the drug.</p>
<p>“Congress may not do a lot between now and November, but they should,” the 14-term House member said. “Because it’s an election year, there’s no downside to being more aggressive.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Economic impact</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/05/21/2024-11137/schedules-of-controlled-substances-rescheduling-of-marijuana#print" target="_blank">proposed rule</a> published in the Federal Register last month, the DEA specifically asked commenters to weigh in on the economic impacts of moving the drug from Schedule I to the less-restrictive Schedule III list under the federal Controlled Substances Act.</p>
<p>That will likely mean the agency will consider the impact of allowing state-legal marijuana businesses to deduct business expenses from their federal taxes, Mason Tvert, a partner at Denver-based cannabis policy and public affairs firm Strategies 64, said in an interview. Under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/280E" target="_blank">current law</a>, no deductions are allowed.</p>
<p>That issue is seen by advocates, including Blumenauer and f<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-dems-launch-renewed-push-full-marijuana-legalization" target="_blank">ellow Oregon Democrat Ron Wyden</a>, who chairs the tax-writing U.S. Senate Finance Committee, as paramount for the industry.</p>
<p>Thousands of state-legal businesses struggle to earn a profit or operate at a loss under the current system, Blumenauer said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Potential for abuse</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The DEA typically looks at three factors when assessing how strictly to regulate a drug: its medicinal value, potential for abuse relative to other drugs and ability to cause physical addiction.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/d1b41750bb7210f6/63765434-full.pdf" target="_blank">2023 analysis</a> by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that looked at data from states where medicinal marijuana is legal showed that “there exists some credible scientific support for the medical use of marijuana.”</p>
<p>That finding could lead DEA to look at other factors, Tvert said.</p>
<p>“The battleground that we’ll see will be around how we define potential for abuse,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Agencies split?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>But the DEA proposed rule revealed a divided view among government agencies about the drug’s potential harms, Paul Armentano, the deputy director for the longtime leading advocacy group National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, told States Newsroom.</p>
<p>The text of the proposed rule shows “a lack of consensus” among HHS, the Attorney General’s Office and the Drug Enforcement Administration, he said.</p>
<p>“There are several points in the DEA’s proposed rule where they express a desire to see additional evidence specific to concerns that the agency has about the potential effects of cannabis, particularly as they pertain to abuse potential and potential harms,” Armentano said.</p>
<p>“The HHS addresses those issues, but the DEA essentially says, ‘We’d like to see more information on it.’”</p>
<p>Kevin Sabat, the president and CEO of the anti-legalization group Smart Approaches to Marijuana, agreed that the DEA did not appear to agree with the HHS conclusion that medical uses exist.</p>
<p>The proposed rule “just brings up all these issues with the HHS’s determination and it basically invites comment on all those issues,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Administrative law hearing</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Sabat’s group will also be petitioning for a DEA administrative hearing, he said. An administrative law judge could rule that the proposal should not go through or that it should be amended to remain stricter than the initial proposal described.</p>
<p>“We’re going to highlight the fact that, first of all, this does not have approved or accepted medical use,” he said.</p>
<p>Tvert said the accepted medical value question is likely not to be a major factor in an administrative law hearing. Several medical organizations and states that allow medicinal use have already endorsed its medicinal value, he said.</p>
<p>Instead, the focus will turn to the drug’s potential for abuse, he said.</p>
<p>“What will be critical is looking at cannabis relative to other substances that are currently II or III or not on the schedule, and determining whether cannabis should be on Schedule I when alcohol is not even on the schedules and ketamine is Schedule III.”</p>
<p>As of June 6, nearly 12,000 people had commented on the proposal in the 18 days since its publication.</p>
<p>While opinion polls show that most Americans favor liberalizing cannabis laws — a Pew Research Center <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/03/26/most-americans-favor-legalizing-marijuana-for-medical-recreational-use/#:~:text=Nearly%20six%2Din%2Dten%20Americans,not%20be%20legal%20at%20all." target="_blank">survey in March</a> found 57% of U.S. adults favor full legalization while only 11% say it should be entirely illegal — the public comments so far represent a full spectrum of views on the topic.</p>
<p>“This rule is a horrible idea, this should remain in Schedule I,” one comment read. “Marijuana is a gateway drug and ruins lives.”</p>
<p>“There are no negative side effects to its use,” another commenter, who favored “fully” legalizing the substance, wrote. “Its not harmful. The only harm is what the government has done to me and America. Shame on the people that continue to oppose this. Seriously shame on anyone that would stand in the way of this change.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Congressional action?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Blumenauer authored a memo last month on “the path forward” for reform as the rescheduling process plays out.</p>
<p>He listed four bills for Congress to consider this year.</p>
<p>One, sponsored by House Democrats, would remove cannabis from the Controlled Substance Act schedule entirely and expunge prior offenses.</p>
<p>A bipartisan bill would make changes to the banking laws to allow state-legal businesses greater access to loans and other financial services.</p>
<p>Another, cosponsored with Florida Republican Brian Mast, would allow Veterans Administration health providers to discuss state-legal medicinal marijuana with veteran patients.</p>
<p>Blumenauer has also co-written language for appropriations bills that would prevent the Department of Justice from prosecuting marijuana businesses that are legal under state or tribal law.</p>
<p>“All of these things are overwhelmingly popular, they’re important, we have legislative vehicles and supporters,” he said.</p>
<p>Still, there may be disagreements about what to pursue next.</p>
<p>Recent years have seen disagreements among Democratic supporters of legalization over whether to prioritize banking or criminal justice reforms.</p>
<p>A banking overhaul has much greater bipartisan support, and advocates on all sides of the issue agree it’s the most likely to see congressional action.</p>
<p>But some who support changes to banking laws in principle object to focusing on improving the business environment without first addressing the harms they say prohibition has caused to largely non-white and disadvantaged communities.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-law-still-treats-marijuana-illegal-drug-creating-headaches-states" target="_blank">recently as 2021</a>, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer described banking reform legislation as too narrow. Sen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, called it a “common-sense policy” but said that he favored a more comprehensive approach.</p>
<p>“I’ve gone around with Cory on that,” Blumenauer said. “More than anybody in Congress, I’m in favor of the major reforms, and we’ve been fighting for racial justice and equity … but (racial justice and banking reforms) are not mutually exclusive.”</p>
<p>In September, <a href="https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-statement-on-safer-banking-act" target="_blank">Booker agreed</a> to co-sponsor the banking reform bill after winning a promise from Schumer that a separate bill to help expunge criminal records would also receive a vote. Neither measure has actually received a floor vote.</p>
<p>In a statement following the administration’s announcement on rescheduling, Booker praised the move, but called for further action from Congress.</p>
<p>That includes passing a bill he’s sponsored that would decriminalize the drug at the federal level, expunge the records of people convicted of federal marijuana crimes and direct federal funding to communities “most harmed by the failed War on Drugs,” according to <a href="https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-schumer-wyden-lead-reintroduction-of-cannabis-administration-and-opportunity-act-legislation-to-end-federal-prohibition-of-cannabis" target="_blank">a summary</a> from Booker’s office.</p>
<p>“We still have a long way to go,” Booker said in the statement on rescheduling. “Thousands of people remain in prisons around the country for marijuana-related crimes. They continue to bear the devastating consequences that come with a criminal history.”</p>
<p>Blumenauer said Congress should act on the proposals that have widespread support from voters.</p>
<p>“This not low-hanging fruit, this is having them pick it up off the ground,” he said. “There is no other controversial issue that has as much bipartisan support that’s awaiting action.”</p>

(John Moore/Getty Images)</p><p>Aiming to send a message, the Biden administration recently spotlighted its indictments and convictions in cases involving threats to election officials or workers.</p>
<p>But with no letup in reports of attacks, some elections professionals say federal law enforcement still isn’t doing enough to deter bad actors and ensure that those on the front lines of democracy are protected this fall.</p>
<p>“Election officials by and large have no confidence that if something were to happen to them, there would be any consequences,” said Amy Cohen, the executive director of the National Association of State Election Directors. “It is very clear that we are not seeing a deterrent effect.”</p>
<p>A U.S. Justice Department spokesman declined to comment for this story, instead directing States Newsroom to a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/voting/election-threats" target="_blank">webpage</a> for the department’s Election Threats Task Force.</p>
<p>Launched by the Justice Department in 2021 in response to the wave of harassment of election officials that followed the 2020 election, the Election Threats Task Force works closely with local law enforcement and U.S. attorney’s offices around the country to investigate threats.</p>
<p>In going after those who make threats against election workers, the Justice Department is honoring a foundational purpose: The department was created in 1870 in part to protect the voting rights of southern Blacks during Reconstruction.</p>
<p>Run by John Keller, a top official in the Justice Department’s Public Integrity Section, the task force also includes the Criminal Division’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, the Civil Rights Division, the National Security Division, and the FBI. It also works with several other government agencies, including the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and the Department of Homeland Security.</p>
<p>Since its launch, the task force has brought charges in 17 cases, according to the department’s <a href="https://www.justice.gov/voting/election-threats" target="_blank">tally</a>. Eight cases have resulted in prison time, with sentencing scheduled in several more.</p>
<p>In one case, brought in Nevada, the defendant was acquitted.</p>
<p>In March, a Massachusetts man received a three-and-a-half-year sentence — the longest won by the task force to date — for sending an online message to an Arizona election official warning her a bomb would be detonated “in her personal space” unless she resigned.</p>
<p>A Texas man received the same sentence last August for posting threatening messages targeting two Maricopa County, Arizona officials and their families, and separately calling for a “mass shooting of poll workers” in precincts with “suspect results.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Each of these cases should serve as a warning’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Attorney General Merrick Garland highlighted these convictions and others in a May 13 speech at a task force meeting.</p>
<p>“Each of these cases should serve as a warning,” declared Garland. “If you threaten to harm or kill an election worker, volunteer, or official, the Justice Department will find you. And we will hold you accountable.”</p>
<p>But those prosecutions amount to only a tiny share of what the Justice Department <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/13/us/politics/election-workers-threats.html" target="_blank">has said</a> is over 2,000 reports of threats or harassment submitted by the election community to the FBI since the task force was launched in 2021. Around 100 of those were investigated, according to the Justice Department.</p>
<p>The small number of investigations and prosecutions is largely due to free speech concerns. Legal experts say that anything short of a direct and explicit threat to cause physical harm may well be protected speech under the First Amendment.</p>
<p>“A true threat is a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence,” Keller has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-JhI1l6_y8&amp;t=426s" target="_blank">said</a>. “If they don’t cross that line into invoking violence, they are generally not going to constitute a criminally prosecutable threat.”</p>
<p>Still, as the 2024 vote approaches, there’s little evidence that the volume of attacks against the people who run elections has declined, or that election workers feel safer.</p>
<p>A recent Brennan Center <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/poll-election-officials-finds-concerns-about-safety-political" target="_blank">survey</a> found that more than half of local election officials said they were concerned about the safety of their colleagues or staff — around the same number as in 2022, the year of the last federal election. Around a quarter worry about being assaulted at home or at work.</p>
<p>“This is a widespread issue in the elections community,” said Tammy Patrick, the CEO for programs for the National Association of Election Officials, and a former election official in Maricopa County. “It’s happening all across the country. It’s not just a question of it being in swing states, or just being in the city or whatever. It’s happening in a way that is a concerted campaign to create and sow chaos.”</p>
<p>“There is some feeling that the task force is a political tool,” said another election expert, “that allows the administration to say they care and they’re doing something.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Troubling episodes but little followup</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In March 2022, anti-fraud activists, accompanied by the local GOP chair, showed up at the office of Michella Huff, the election director for Surry County, North Carolina.</p>
<p>Huff said the activists tried to pressure her to give them access to county voting machines, citing what they said were flawed voter rolls. The group repeatedly threatened to have Huff ousted from her job if she didn’t cooperate, and said they planned to return with the local sheriff, though they did not do so.</p>
<p>Huff declined to provide access to the machines, and reported the episode to the state election board’s investigations unit.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the board did not respond to an inquiry about whether the report was forwarded to federal law enforcement.</p>
<p>Election security advocates have <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23785738-susan-greenhalgh-letter" target="_blank">urged</a> the FBI to do more to probe efforts by supporters of former President Donald Trump to gain access to voting machines in other states, warning that the breaches could have allowed for voting machine software to be compromised.</p>
<p>Huff said she never heard from law enforcement on any level, despite speaking publicly about the episode.</p>
<p>Though Huff wasn’t physically threatened, she said she’d still like to have seen federal authorities do more to respond.</p>
<p>“If it is truly a threat, I think every threat needs to be looked at serious(ly), and it needs to be considered as to what the intent was, if it was successful, and what the repercussions would be if it had been successful,” said Huff. “A threat is a threat.”</p>
<p>More overt efforts to physically intimidate election workers also have at times spurred little law enforcement followup.</p>
<p>The night before South Carolina’s 2022 primaries, a Republican candidate who has promoted lies about the 2020 election posted a message on the conservative social media site Telegram, to a group of anti-fraud activists.</p>
<p>“For all of you on the team tomorrow observing the polls, Good Hunting,” the message <a href="https://www.rules.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/cramer_testimony.pdf" target="_blank">said</a>. “We have the enemy on their back foot, press the attack. Forward.”</p>
<p>During the voting period, groups of activists showed up at multiple polling places to verbally harass, photograph, and film election workers as they did their jobs, recounted Aaron Cramer, the executive director of the Charleston County Board of Voter Registration and Elections.</p>
<p>The activists called the police to at least one polling site, falsely alleging evidence of fraud by election staff. The police came, but made no arrests — though the episode left the site’s lead poll manager shaken, Cramer said.</p>
<p>Cramer said his office provided detailed reports on both the Telegram message and the harassment at polling sites to the Department of Homeland Security, as well as to the state election commission.</p>
<p>“We took that threat pretty seriously,” he said, referring to the Telegram message.</p>
<p>He said he received a response from DHS saying the report was being looked into, but heard nothing after that.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what the conclusions were, or what occurred after submitting that information,” Cramer said.</p>
<p>But Cramer added that the experience produced a successful effort to increase collaboration with local, state, and federal authorities — with the result that the county is much better prepared to respond to, and anticipate, similar incidents this year.</p>
<p>“When you’re on the defense, you’re kind of reacting to everything, and I think that’s how the past was,” said Cramer.  “And now we’re being proactive.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘I dread November for you guys’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Patrick, of the National Association of Election Officials, said that while she understands the need to avoid running afoul of the First Amendment, authorities must balance legitimate free speech concerns with their urgent duty to protect those conducting elections.</p>
<p>And, she suggested, they may not always be getting that balance right.</p>
<p>“We need to be really careful that we’re not allowing people to yell fire in a crowded theater,” Patrick said.  “And that we’re not allowing people to use what they are potentially claiming as their freedom of speech as a way of creating chaos in a system, or to threaten individuals who are just trying to do their job.”</p>
<p>In addition, election professionals say they’ve complained for years that after they submit reports about threats and harassment to the FBI, there’s often a lack of follow-up beyond an acknowledgment of receipt.</p>
<p>Of course, law enforcement frequently can’t share details about their work, even with those who were targeted, in order not to compromise an investigation. But Patrick said even basic information could be helpful.</p>
<p>“Even letting them know that the report is being worked, so it doesn’t just go into the void, and a victim knows there’s going to be a knock-and-talk, gives the individual who made that report some sense of closure,” Patrick said, referring to when federal agents show up to speak with a suspect at their home.</p>
<p>The problem may be exacerbated by a lack of understanding among some in the elections world about what federal law enforcement can and can’t do. Many election officials, said Cohen, of the National Association of State Election Directors, want front-end help with steps like bolstering physical security to better prepare for incidents.</p>
<p>“Law enforcement, and especially federal law enforcement, is only coming at the back end,” said Cohen. “Their goal is not prevention or recovery, their goal is prosecution. And it has taken our community, I think, a long time to understand what we should be expecting from DoJ.”</p>
<p>Ultimately, said Cohen, the prosecutions brought by the Justice Department appear to have done little to reduce the number of threats election workers are subject to today.</p>
<p>“I’m really grateful that DOJ has secured convictions in Arizona,” said Cohen. “But I don’t think securing convictions in Arizona three years later has actually deterred anything in Arizona.”</p>
<p>Indeed, Arizona has been a hotbed for election misinformation, and its election officials continue to be targeted by a consistent stream of threats, according to multiple <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/28/us/politics/kari-lake-maricopa-election-threats.html" target="_blank">reports</a>.</p>
<p>Huff, the county election director in North Carolina, said that with a major election approaching, members of the public often express sympathy for her and her staff — an acknowledgement that the vitriol they’ve been facing is only likely to get stronger.</p>
<p>“Out in public, I get that,” Huff said — ‘Boy, I dread November for you guys.’”</p>

(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden, speaking from the site of the D-Day invasion in Normandy, France, said Friday that those who support democracy must remember what World War II soldiers sacrificed and live up to those ideals.</p>
<p>Biden’s remarks came during commemoration of the 80th anniversary of D-Day and sought to tie the threats to democracy in the 1940s to those that exist today in the United States and Europe.</p>
<p>“American democracy asks the hardest of things — to believe that we’re part of something bigger than ourselves,” Biden said. “So democracy begins with each of us.”</p>
<p>Biden spoke from the Ranger Monument at Pointe du Hoc, where former President Ronald Reagan in 1984 <a href="https://voicesofdemocracy.umd.edu/ronald-reagan-normandy-speech-point-du-hoc/" target="_blank">delivered a memorable speech</a> on the invasion’s 40th anniversary.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.abmc.gov/Pointe-du-Hoc" target="_blank">monument</a>, constructed by the French, sits eight miles west of the Normandy American Cemetery and was built to honor the members of the American Second Ranger Battalion.</p>
<p>Biden walked in to give the speech alongside Scott Desjardins, the superintendent of the Normandy American Cemetery, who later told reporters that he spoke with the president about the battle.</p>
<p>“I explained to him that when the Rangers were still living, they would tell us climbing up the cliff was not the difficult part,” Desjardins told White House pool reporters. “Holding onto this terrain for two and a half days, being outnumbered, is really the amazing thing about Pointe du Hoc.”</p>
<p>First Sergeant Gavin Stith, U.S. Army, 2nd Ranger Battalion, and his spouse, Kourtney Stith, attended the speech alongside about 150 other people. U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken both attended as well.</p>
<p>​Pfc <a href="https://bestdefensefoundation.org/veteran/pfc-john-m-wardell/" target="_blank">John M. Wardell</a>, 99, from New Jersey, who landed in France on June 18, 1944, was seated in the audience as well and spoke with Blinken, according to pool reports.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Standing up to dictators</h4>

	
<p>Biden said during the <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?536195-1/president-biden-delivers-remarks-pointe-du-hoc-normandy-france" target="_blank">12-minute speech</a> the soldiers who stormed the beach in 1944 had decided that it was necessary to stand up to a dictator who threatened democracy in Europe and that people today must live up to that benchmark.</p>
<p>“Does anyone doubt that they would want America to stand up against (Russian leader Vladimir) Putin’s aggression here in Europe today?” Biden asked.</p>
<p>“They fought to vanquish a hateful ideology in the &#8217;30s and &#8217;40s,” Biden added. “Does anyone doubt they wouldn’t move heaven and earth to vanquish the hateful ideologies of today? These rangers put mission and country above themselves. Does anyone believe they would exact any less from every American today?”</p>
<p>Biden met earlier in the day with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and announced a $225 million aid package for the country to assist in its war against Russia’s invasion.</p>
<p>Biden told Zelenskyy during the meeting that his country’s efforts to win the war are “remarkable” and apologized for how long it took Congress to approve the latest round of military and humanitarian assistance.</p>
<p>“I apologize for the weeks of not knowing what’s going to pass in terms of funding because we had trouble getting the bill that we had to pass that had the money in it,” Biden said during the Zelenskyy meeting. “Some of our very conservative members were holding it up. But we got it done finally.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Be part of something bigger than ourselves’</h4>

	
<p>Biden said during his speech at Pointe du Hoc the Allied soldiers who scaled those cliffs on D-Day, all of whom are deceased, would ask every American today to “stay true to what America stands for.”</p>
<p>“They’re not asking us to give or risk our lives, but they are asking us to care for others in our country more than ourselves,” Biden said. “They’re not asking us to do their job. They’re asking us to do our job; to protect freedom in our time, to defend democracy, to stand up to aggression abroad and at home, to be part of something bigger than ourselves.”</p>
<p>If Americans wish to honor the sacrifices of our country’s WWII soldiers, they must “ensure that our democracy endures and the soul of our nation endures,” he said.</p>
<p>Biden did not mention the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, former President Donald Trump, by name, but Democrats have repeatedly stressed the danger they believe Trump poses to democracy.</p>
<p>Biden <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/80th-anniversary-d-day-invasion-biden-and-macron-honor-wwii-veterans-normandy" target="_blank">spoke Thursday</a> at the Normandy American Cemetery near Omaha Beach about the bravery of the soldiers who stormed the beaches on D-Day and the allied forces who worked together to defeat Nazi Germany and end the Holocaust.</p>

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WASHINGTON — An attempt to reinforce Americans’ access to contraception failed Wednesday when U.S. Senate Republicans blocked a bill from advancing toward final passage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1182/vote_118_2_00190.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">51-39 procedural vote </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">required at least 60 senators to move forward, but fell short after GOP lawmakers said the measure was too broad as well as unnecessary. Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Maine Sen. Susan Collins, both Republicans, broke with their party and voted to advance the legislation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats argued during debate on the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/4381/text" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">12-page bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that it would provide a safety net should a future Supreme Court overturn two cases that ensure married and unmarried Americans have the right to make decisions about when and how to use contraception. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GOP senators contended the vote was mere politics and that if Democrats were serious about safeguarding access to contraception for future generations, they’d work with Republicans on a bipartisan bill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevada Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen said the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the constitutional right to an abortion in the Dobbs decision two years ago showed women how quickly things can change. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It demonstrated that a fundamental right, the right of women to make decisions over their own bodies, could be taken away in the blink of an eye,” Rosen said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women, she said, can’t rely solely on the Supreme Court to uphold the cases that have guaranteed Americans access to contraception for more than 50 years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Contraception has been safely used by millions of women for decades,” Rosen said. “It’s allowed women to take control over their own bodies — to decide when they want to start a family, how many kids they have, who they want to start a family with.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For these very same reasons, the right to contraception has been a target of anti-choice extremists for years,” Rosen added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Minority Whip John Thune, the South Dakota Republican seeking to become the chamber’s next GOP leader, said the bill was meant to “provide a talking point for Democratic candidates.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These votes have nothing to do with legislating and everything to do with boosting Democrats’ electoral chances, he hopes, in this fall’s election,” Thune said, referring to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation was a non-starter with many Republicans, Thune said, because it didn’t carve out the conscience protections that exist under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/103rd-congress/house-bill/1308#:~:text=Religious%20Freedom%20Restoration%20Act%20of%201993%20%2D%20Prohibits%20any%20agency%2C%20department,government%20may%20burden%20a%20person's" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">federal law,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> enacted in 1993 after being sponsored by Schumer, established “a heightened standard of review for government actions that substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Sales of contraceptives</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats’ bill would have protected “an individual’s ability to access contraceptives” and “a health care provider’s ability to provide contraceptives, contraception, and information related to contraception.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation would have barred state and federal governments from prohibiting the sale of any contraceptives or blocking “any individual from aiding another individual in voluntarily obtaining or using any contraceptives or contraceptive methods.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill defined contraception as “an action taken to prevent pregnancy, including the use of contraceptives or fertility-awareness-based methods and sterilization procedures.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Democrats </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-dems-decry-limits-abortion-access-house-dems-unveil-contraception-bill" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">introduced an identical bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in that chamber on Tuesday, though it’s unlikely to get a vote while Republicans remain in control. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Larry Sabato, who heads the Center For Politics at the University of Virginia, called the effort “a good move for Democrats” to still try. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The problem they&#8217;re going to have is most people don&#8217;t believe that Republicans would actually [prohibit birth control],” Sabato said. “Now the obvious comeback for that is ‘Well, did you think they would abolish Roe v Wade?’ Because people didn&#8217;t believe that either — and then it happened.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But since the overturn of federal abortion protections, access to contraception has come into question as </span><a href="https://stateline.org/2022/05/19/some-states-already-are-targeting-birth-control/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">some states have targeted it </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and a recent Alabama Supreme Court</span><a href="https://alabamareflector.com/2024/02/19/alabama-supreme-court-ruling-could-end-ivf-treatments-in-state/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ruling </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">declared embryos used for in vitro fertilization as people.</span><b> </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the vote on the contraception bill, Schumer moved to schedule a procedural vote next week on legislation that would guarantee access to in vitro fertilization. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schumer said during a press conference afterward that vote would give Americans an opportunity to “see where Republicans stand on the so very important issue” of reproductive rights.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Supreme Court opinion</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supreme Court Associate Justice Clarence Thomas stirred up concerns about access to contraception two years ago when he wrote a </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">concurring opinion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Dobbs case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thomas wrote that the justices should “reconsider all of this Court’s substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">None of the other nine justices joined Thomas in writing that opinion, likely signaling they didn’t agree with some or all of it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 1965 Griswold v. Connecticut case was the first time the court recognized that married couples’ constitutional privacy rights extend to decisions about contraception. That ruling struck down a Connecticut state law that barred access to contraceptives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Supreme Court, in 1972, extended the right to make private decisions about contraception to unmarried people in the Eisenstadt v. Baird ruling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the release of Thomas’ concurring opinion, Democrats and reproductive rights organizations immediately began pressing for federal laws that would reinforce current contraception access. Congress has not passed any so far. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mini Timmaraju, president and chief executive officer of Reproductive Freedom for All, said during a press conference with Senate Democrats on Wednesday before the vote that women should talk with their mothers and grandmothers about when they were first able to obtain birth control. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we talk about the generations of women in this country who didn’t have access to birth control, we’re just talking about my mother’s generation — 1965,” Timmaraju said. “It was not that long ago and that should really be a wake-up call.” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">White House, Biden campaign weigh in</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration signaled its support for Senate Democrats’ bill hours before the vote, writing in a </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/SAP-S4381.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statement of Administration Policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the measure “would protect the fundamental right to access contraception and help ensure that women can make decisions about their health, lives, and families.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Women must have the freedom to make deeply personal health care decisions, including the right to decide if and when to start or grow their family,” the policy states. “Now is the time to safeguard the right to contraception once and for all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden-Harris campaign held a press call on reproductive rights Wednesday morning to highlight the differences between the presidential candidates on reproductive rights, including access to abortion, contraception and in vitro fertilization. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden-Harris Campaign Manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said during the call that Donald Trump, Republicans’ presumptive nominee for president, couldn’t be further away from Biden on access. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rodriguez said Trump’s </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-leaves-door-open-banning-medication-abortion-nationwide" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">comments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during an interview with TIME magazine in April and his </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-signals-hes-open-state-limits-contraceptive-access-then-insists-hes-not" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to a local Pennsylvania TV news station in May show he’s not supportive of women’s reproductive rights. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decisions about contraception, abortion and in vitro fertilization belong to women and their doctors, “not politicians and the government,” Rodriguez said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">North Carolina Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, a member of the Biden-Harris campaign’s advisory board, said on the call this year’s election will be a “defining moment” for the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican efforts to restrict access to reproductive health care, he said, mean they are trying to “control women.” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Ernst alternative proposal </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst said during debate on the bill that Democrats’ legislation went too far and pressed for the Senate to take up </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/4447/text?s=5&amp;r=1&amp;q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22ernst%22%7D" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a bill she introduced </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">earlier this week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The measure has since gained nine co-sponsors including Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Steve Daines of Montana, Todd Young of Indiana, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Ted Cruz of Texas, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, James E. Risch of Idaho and John Cornyn of Texas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iowa Republican Rep. Ashley Hinson plans to introduce the companion bill in the House, according to an announcement from Ernst’s office. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With my bill, we’re ensuring women 18 and over can walk into any pharmacy, whether in Red Oak, Iowa, or Washington, D.C., and purchase a safe and effective birth control option,” Ernst said. “This Republican bill creates a priority review designation for over-the-counter birth control options to encourage the FDA to act quickly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ernst said she was “encouraged” that one over-the-counter oral contraceptive has been approved and is available, but that should be “just a starting point.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The four-page bill would encourage the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to approve additional over-the-counter oral contraceptives and “direct the Comptroller General of the United States to conduct a study on federal funding of contraceptive methods.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation would require the secretary of the Health and Human Services Department to give priority review to a supplemental application for oral contraceptives “intended for routine use.” But it does not extend that to “any emergency contraceptive drug” or “any drug that is also approved for induced abortion.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Access to over-the-counter oral birth control that receives FDA approval so that it no longer requires a prescription would be available for people over 18.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">States, including Virginia, can still control contraceptives access — for now</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While federal politicians continue their back and forth over legislating contraception access, states can still take their own stances on the matter. Virginia already tried to do so earlier this year in a measure that cleared both the House of Delegates and state Senate before being vetoed by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, joined Schumer and the other U.S. senators Wednesday for a press conference outside of the Capitol. She had carried Virginia’s own right-to-contraception act months prior. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin had stated support for contraception and initially attempted to amend Price’s bill. While hers would have codified protections whether or not the Griswold and Eisenstadt rulings are upheld or repealed, his amendment — which the legislature rejected — would have aligned Virginia with the rulings. He then vetoed the bill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gov. Younkin unfortunately taught us again that actions mean more than words,” she said Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Likewise, U.S. Sen Tim Kaine, D-Va., said in a call with States Newsroom affiliate the Virginia Mercury that he was not surprised the state measure passed with bipartisan support, but that he was surprised to see Youngkin veto it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you really want to reduce abortions, contraception access is a way to do it,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price and Virginia state Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield, plan to reintroduce their proposal during Virginia&#8217;s next legislative session and again until it is passed. As Virginia governors cannot serve consecutive terms, a new person will be elected to helm the state come 2026. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginians may still have hope since we will soon have a new governor due to our own state term limits,” Price said. “But other states may be stuck with governors like him for years.”</span></p>

<div class="entry-content single-content">
<p>The Criminalizing Abused Substance Templates, or <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1549/all-info" target="_blank">CAST</a>, Act would redefine the criminal penalty for producing counterfeit drugs using a pill press. Counterfeiting drugs is already illegal as outlined in the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/jm/jm-9-100000-controlled-substances-act" target="_blank">Controlled Substances Act</a>  but no penalty is included in the law.</p>
<p>Under CAST, it would be illegal to possess a pill press mold with the intent to produce schedule I or II drugs, a crime <a href="https://kustoff.house.gov/media/press-releases/kustoff-re-introduces-criminalizing-abused-substance-templates-cast-act" target="_blank">punishable</a> for up to 20 years.</p>
<p>CAST was <a href="https://spanberger.house.gov/posts/spanberger-applauds-u-s-senate-introduction-of-her-bipartisan-bill-to-crack-down-on-illegal-pill-presses-combat-illicit-fentanyl" target="_blank">introduced</a> in the House by Reps. Abigail Spanberger, a Virginia Democrat, and David Kustoff, a Tennessee Republican, in October 2019 and it was reintroduced in March 2023.</p>
<p>The bill got a boost earlier this month when Sens. Bill Cassidy, R-La., and Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., <a href="https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-hassan-introduce-bill-to-crack-down-on-illegal-pill-presses/" target="_blank">introduced</a> it in the upper chamber.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Overdoses and deaths</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The bill particularly targets the production and distribution of opioids, especially fentanyl. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid with an incredibly high potency, about 100 times more than morphine. As a result, it’s often mixed into other drugs to increase strength, sometimes in lethal doses.</p>
<p>Synthetic opioids are the main drivers of opioid overdoses. Between 2020 and 2021, deaths involving synthetic opioids like illegally made fentanyl <a href="https://www.dea.gov/resources/facts-about-fentanyl" target="_blank">rose</a> by 55%, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration.</p>
<p>Opioid-related and other drug poisoning deaths per 100,000 people are <a href="https://statehealthcompare.shadac.org/rank/197/opioidrelated-and-other-drug-poisoning-deaths-per-100000-people-by-drug-type#1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52/127/37/233/false/highest" target="_blank">highest</a> in West Virginia, the District of Columbia, Delaware, Tennessee and Kentucky.</p>
<p>Lawmakers attribute this rise in fentanyl-related deaths to the counterfeit market and drug trafficking.</p>
<p>“The overdose crisis and the rising scourge of fentanyl are undoubtedly made worse by the rise in use of illicit pill presses to manufacture counterfeit drugs,” Spanberger said in a statement about her legislation.</p>
<p>“By stepping up penalties for narcotics traffickers who use illicit pill presses to manufacture drugs, our bipartisan legislation would empower our law enforcement officers to crack down on these criminals and prevent dangerous substances — such as fentanyl — from being pressed into illicit pills and sold on our streets.”</p>
<p>Much of the illicit fentanyl sold in the U.S. contains at least a potentially lethal dose of fentanyl, 2 mg. A DEA study found that 42% of tested pills contained this amount or more, some as much as 5.1 mg.</p>
<p>Lawmakers said they want to ensure law enforcement officials have the necessary tools to stop the production and sale of these drugs.</p>
<p>“Strengthening penalties for the criminals creating these counterfeit drugs can help get them off the market,” said Hassan in a statement. “This bipartisan legislation will help ensure that law enforcement officials have the tools that they need to crack down on criminals making counterfeit drugs.”</p>
<p>According to the DEA, because lethal doses of fentanyl are often mixed in with other drugs, it can be “possible for someone to take a pill without knowing it contains fentanyl.” Cassidy said the CAST Act could prevent these deaths.</p>
<p>“No one should have to worry if their medicines are counterfeit or laced with fentanyl,” he said.</p>

<p>The first-ever criminal trial of a former U.S. president wrapped up in Manhattan, marking an extraordinary moment in American history not only for a former leader, but for one who is seeking to again hold the Oval Office. Trump, the Republican Party’s presumed 2024 presidential nominee, is now a convicted felon.</p>
<p>The jury deliberated for more than 11 hours, beginning Wednesday just before 11:30 a.m. Eastern and delivering the verdict to Justice Juan Merchan just after 5 p.m. Thursday, according to reporters at the courthouse.</p>
<p>New York does not allow recording in the courtroom but provides public <a href="https://ww2.nycourts.gov/press/index.shtml" target="_blank">transcripts</a> of the proceedings. States Newsroom <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/prosecution-rests-trump-hush-money-trial-after-former-fixer-cohen-grilled" target="_blank">covered the trial</a> in person on May 20.</p>
<p>Trump now faces <a href="http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/lawssrch.cgi?NVLWO:" target="_blank">penalties</a> ranging from probation to up to four years in prison for each <a href="http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/lawssrch.cgi?NVLWO:" target="_blank">charge</a> of falsifying business records in the first degree.</p>
<p>Merchan set a sentencing date for July 11 at 10 a.m. That’s just days before the Republican National Convention, where Trump is expected to be officially nominated as the party’s presidential candidate.</p>
<p>New York state prosecutors charged 34 felonies against the former president for each of the 11 invoices, 11 checks, and 12 ledger entries tied to reimbursing his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen.</p>
<p>Cohen, often referred to as Trump’s former “fixer,” <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/star-witness-trump-trial-tells-plot-conceal-porn-star-hush-money-payments" target="_blank">said during trial testimony</a> that he wired $130,000 to adult film star and director Stormy Daniels days before the 2016 election to silence her about an <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/porn-star-stormy-daniels-nyc-hush-money-trial-alleges-sexual-encounter-trump" target="_blank">alleged sexual encounter</a> with Trump.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-declines-witness-stand-testimony-his-first-trial-concludes" target="_blank">Three criminal cases</a>, two federal and one in Georgia, also still hang in the balance for Trump, but the likelihood of another trial happening before November’s election is slim.</p>
	<div class="newsroomSidebarContainer ">
	<div class="newsroomSidebar">After former President Donald Trump was found guilty of 34 felony criminal counts Thursday afternoon, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin weighed in on the verdict on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.</p>
<div>&#8220;The American people see this for what it is: a politically motivated prosecution orchestrated by those who want to &#8216;get&#8217; President Trump,&#8221; Youngkin <a href="https://x.com/GlennYoungkin/status/1796306200683741636" target="_blank">wrote</a>. &#8220;On November 5th, Americans will render their verdict on Joe Biden’s failed leadership based on the issues that affect them everyday.&#8221;</div>
<div></div>
<div>Virginia House Minority Leader Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah used the same platform to air his view of the verdict.</div>
<p>&#8220;As a prosecutor and criminal defense attorney for the past 27 years, I have never been so struck by this level of fundamental unfairness in a criminal proceeding,&#8221; Gilbert <a href="https://x.com/cToddGilbert/status/1796294093330317745" target="_blank">wrote</a>. &#8220;This was a rigged show trial, replete with legal errors, obvious biases and political agendas.&#8221;</p>
<p>House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, kept his remarks on Trump&#8217;s verdict brief, simply <a href="https://x.com/DonScott757/status/1796288052555383038" target="_blank">writing</a> &#8220;DAMN! All counts?!&#8221; on X.</p>
<div>Senate Finance and Appropriations Committee Chair Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, reacted to the news of Trump&#8217;s conviction with sharp words about the former president and his political prospects in Virginia ahead of the presidential election in November.</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8220;I am hopeful that the newly convicted thug will still be legally allowed to waste his time campaigning in Virginia so he can continue costing Republicans multiple elections for running on his platform,&#8221; Lucas <a href="https://x.com/SenLouiseLucas/status/1796299812771450928" target="_blank">wrote</a> on X.</div>
	</div>
	</div>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump speaks after verdict</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Trump briefly spoke to news cameras outside the courtroom, criticizing the proceeding as a “rigged, disgraceful trial.”</p>
<p>“The real verdict is going to be Nov. 5 by the people, and they know what happened here and everybody knows what happened here,” Trump said in remarks <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?536021-101/president-trump-speaks-guilty-verdict-hush-money-trial&amp;live" target="_blank">live-streamed and cataloged</a> on C-SPAN.</p>
<p>As he has repeated almost daily for the cameras, Trump again called Merchan a “conflicted” judge and falsely claimed the case “was done by the Biden administration.”</p>
<p>The charges were <a href="https://manhattanda.org/district-attorney-bragg-announces-34-count-felony-indictment-of-former-president-donald-j-trump/#:~:text=Manhattan%20District%20Attorney%20Alvin%20L,and%20after%20the%202016%20election." target="_blank">brought</a> by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, whom Trump described during his post-verdict comments as “Soros-funded,” a common mantra from Trump’s party referring to Hungarian-American billionaire philanthropist George Soros.</p>
<p>During his roughly three-minute remarks, Trump also referred to immigration at the U.S. Southern border, a major campaign rallying cry for Republicans.</p>
<p>“We don’t have the same country anymore. We have a divided mess. We’re a nation in decline, serious decline. Millions and millions of people pouring into our country right now,” Trump said before exiting the hallway without answering shouted questions from reporters.</p>
<p>Despite being a convicted felon, Trump will still be able to vote in November in Palm Beach County, Florida, where he is registered, as long as he is not incarcerated.</p>
<p>That’s because Florida law only bars voting for convicts tried in a separate state if that state also restricts them; a 2021 New York law <a href="https://elections.ny.gov/voting-after-incarceration" target="_blank">restored</a> voting rights for convicted felons following a release from prison and regardless if they are on parole, according to <a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2024/may/29/trump-verdict-countdown-what-happens-after/" target="_blank">reporting</a> by PolitiFact.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">House speaker sees ‘shameful day in American history’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Republicans in Congress and other top GOP officials gathered with Trump at the courthouse for support <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/gop-politicians-rush-manhattan-line-behind-trump-hush-money-trial-continues" target="_blank">during the trial</a> and members of the GOP immediately decried the verdict.</p>
<p>U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican who was among those who made the trek, released a statement saying the verdict marked “a shameful day in American history.”</p>
<p>“Democrats cheered as they convicted the leader of the opposing party on ridiculous charges, predicated on the testimony of a disbarred, convicted felon,” Johnson wrote. “This was a purely political exercise, not a legal one.”</p>
<p>Johnson was referring to the testimony from Cohen, who served time in prison for campaign finance crimes related to hush money payments.</p>
<p>Sen. Joni Ernst, an Iowa Republican, blasted it as the result of an unfair political process.</p>
<p>“This was never about justice. It was always about politics,” she <a href="https://x.com/SenJoniErnst/status/1796297715791597620" target="_blank">wrote on X</a>. “ Americans see through Democrats’ weaponization of our justice system and this sham trial as a desperate attempt to persecute Trump and block his re-election.”</p>
<p>The Trump campaign almost immediately solicited donations following the verdict, posting a link on his Truth Social platform to his WinRed donation portal.</p>
<p>Trump’s son Eric Trump reacted on X with “May 30th, 2024 might be remembered as the day Donald J. Trump won the 2024 Presidential Election.”</p>
<p>Video <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/05/30/nyregion/trump-trial-verdict?source=nyt_sports" target="_blank">posted</a> from reporters outside the courthouse showed a black SUV driving slowly outside the courthouse while members of the news media held cameras and some scattered in the crowd waved Trump flags and shouted “we love you.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘The jury has spoken’ </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In a Thursday evening press conference, Bragg thanked the jurors and his team of prosecutors.</p>
<p>While affirming the case’s historical importance, Bragg said his office worked the case as they would any other, countering the GOP narrative that the case was politically motivated.</p>
<p>The case was decided on “the evidence and the law alone,” he said.</p>
<p>“Donald J. Trump is guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree to conceal a scheme to corrupt the 2016 election,” he said.</p>
<p>“While this defendant may be unlike any other in American history, we arrived at this trial – and ultimately today at this verdict – in the same manner as every other case that comes to the courtroom doors: By following the facts and the law, and doing so without fear or favor.”</p>
<p>Bragg praised “the 12 everyday New Yorkers,” who paid careful attention to a complicated documents-based case to reach a unanimous decision. The jurors’ service represented the “cornerstone” of the “phenomenal” U.S. system of justice, he said.</p>
<p>Asked if he wanted to respond to any of the personal attacks Trump launched against him and his prosecution team, Bragg declined.</p>
<p>Another reporter asked Bragg about criticism of his investigation of the case and his decision to bring a prosecution.</p>
<p>“I did my job. Our job is to follow the facts and the law without fear or favor. And that’s exactly what we did here,” he said.</p>
<p>“Many voices out there,” he added. “The only voice that matters is the voice of the jury. And the jury has spoken.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trials in limbo in D.C., Georgia, Florida</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The verdict brought to a close the historic first criminal proceeding against a former sitting American president, albeit at the state level.</p>
<p>Trump is currently mired in a fight for absolute immunity from federal criminal charges <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/fueled-lies-trump-charged-seeking-overturn-2020-election-6" target="_blank">accusing</a> him of scheming to overturn the 2020 presidential election results.</p>
<p>A U.S. Supreme Court decision on his immunity claim is pending. Justices <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-floats-return-trial-court-trump-presidential-immunity-case" target="_blank">heard arguments</a> in the case on April 25.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Florida, federal District Judge Aileen Cannon has indefinitely postponed the U.S. case against Trump for mishandling and refusing to return classified documents that he hid at his Mar-a-Lago estate after he left office.</p>
<p>Trump faces another state case in Georgia, along with several co-conspirators, on racketeering and conspiracy charges related to the state’s 2020 presidential election results. The case has been held up due to <a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2024/05/09/future-of-fulton-case-against-trump-muddled-as-appeals-court-considers-attempt-to-disqualify-willis/" target="_blank">pretrial disputes</a> over alleged misconduct by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Biden campaign reacts</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>A spokesman for President Joe Biden’s campaign, Michael Tyler, said in a statement that the verdict showed “no one is above the law” and that Trump remained a threat to democracy whom voters should reject.</p>
<p>“Donald Trump has always mistakenly believed he would never face consequences for breaking the law for his own personal gain,” Tyler wrote. “But today’s verdict does not change the fact that the American people face a simple reality. There is still only one way to keep Donald Trump out of the Oval Office: at the ballot box. Convicted felon or not, Trump will be the Republican nominee for president.”</p>
<p>“The threat Trump poses to our democracy has never been greater,” Tyler continued. “He is running an increasingly unhinged campaign of revenge and retribution, pledging to be a dictator ‘on day one’ and calling for our Constitution to be ‘terminated’ so he can regain and keep power. A second Trump term means chaos, ripping away Americans’ freedoms and fomenting political violence – and the American people will reject it this November.”</p>
<p>The Biden White House had much less to say.</p>
<p>Ian Sams, a spokesperson for the White House Counsel’s Office, said in a one-sentence email: “We respect the rule of law, and have no additional comment.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Members of Congress speak out</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, said in a statement the guilty decision from the jurors represented “a devastating defeat for any American who believes in the critical legal tenet that justice is blind.”</p>
<p>“This verdict will not withstand an appeal, and was only brought as an attempt to interfere with the 2024 election,” Scalise wrote. “The radical partisan Democrats behind this abuse of our justice system will not prevail. The voters will settle this on November 5th.”</p>
<p>Rhode Island Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, chair of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee’s federal courts subcommittee, released a statement saying that an “individual who has been convicted of 34 felony counts and shows zero respect for the rule of law is not fit to lead the greatest nation in the world.”</p>
<p>“It’s only in honest courtrooms that the former president has been unable to lie and bully his way out of trouble,” Whitehouse said. “Americans trust juries for good reason.”</p>
<p>North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis posted on social media that he was “shocked by the verdict considering that this case should have never been brought forward.”</p>
<p>“From the beginning, it was clear that a radical, politically-motivated state prosecutor was using the full weight of his office to go after President Trump at the same time he turned a blind eye to violent criminals,” Tillis wrote. “I expect and hope that President Trump will appeal this verdict to address fundamental questions, including whether President Trump received a fair trial and whether the Manhattan D.A. even had jurisdiction on a federal election matter.”</p>
<p>Minnesota Democratic Rep. Betty McCollum said the jury’s decision showed that America’s justice system functioned the way it was supposed to.</p>
<p>“Today our system of justice worked, and former President Trump was found guilty on all 34 counts by a jury of American citizens,” McCollum wrote on social media. “No person is above the law.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A ‘sham’ or an ‘affirmation’? </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds wrote in a statement the trial was a “sham.”</p>
<p>“For years, Democrats like Alvin Bragg have been trying to put President Trump in jail with complete disregard for our democracy and the will of the American people,” Reynolds wrote. “The only verdict that matters is the one at the ballot box in November where the American people will elect President Trump again.”</p>
<p>Florida Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz wrote on social media that the jury’s guilty verdict wasn’t political.</p>
<p>“A former president being convicted is nothing to be celebrated, but it is an affirmation that nobody is above the law,” Moskowitz wrote. “This verdict was reached by a jury of Trump’s peers, by citizens of the American justice system, not by a judge or by a political opponent.”</p>
<p>Ohio Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, rejected the verdict, writing on social media it was a “travesty of justice.”</p>
<p>“The Manhattan kangaroo court shows what happens when our justice system is weaponized by partisan prosecutors in front of a biased judge with an unfair process, designed to keep President Trump off the campaign trail and avoid bringing attention to President Biden’s failing radical policies,” Jordan wrote.</p>
<p>Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine posted on social media the “verdict is proof that no one is above the law in this country.”</p>
<p>“It’s also tragic in this way — Americans put the reins of leadership in the hands of a person whose character is so far beneath the office that no rational adult would ever encourage young people to emulate … his behavior,” Kaine wrote.</p>
<p>“Trump’s lack of character has caught up to him,” Kaine added. “And Americans — once again — have received a clear warning about a person who wants to seize leadership once again. I pray that we heed the warning.”</p>
<p>House Committee on Oversight and Accountability Chairman James Comer, a Kentucky Republican, said Thursday was a “sad day for all Americans.”</p>
<p>“This verdict in New York is another example of Democrats being relentless in their pursuit to weaponize the courts, abuse America’s judicial system, and target President Joe Biden’s political opposition,” Comer wrote. “One thing is clear: Democrats are afraid to face Donald Trump. Americans will make their voices heard this November.”</p>
<p>Former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, the Republican nominee for the state’s open U.S. Senate seat, urged restraint in a social media post.</p>
<p>“Regardless of the result, I urge all Americans to respect the verdict and the legal process,” Hogan wrote. “At this dangerously divided moment in our history, all leaders — regardless of party — must not pour fuel on the fire with more toxic partisanship. We must reaffirm what has made this nation great: the rule of law.”</p>

<p>Nearly all of the clean school buses purchased will be electric, at 92%, according to the administration.</p>
<p>“This announcement is not just about clean school buses, it’s about the bigger picture,” EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan said during a call with reporters on Tuesday, prior to the announcement. “We are improving air quality for our children, reducing greenhouse gas pollution and expanding our nation’s leadership in developing the clean vehicles of the future.”</p>
<p>Low-income, rural and tribal communities — accounting for approximately 45% of the selected projects —  are slated to receive roughly 67% of the total funding, per the administration.</p>
<p>Regan noted how “low-income communities and communities of color have long felt the disproportionate impacts of air pollution leading to severe health outcomes that continue to impact these populations.”</p>
<p>As for business and economic opportunities, Regan pointed to the development of new, well-paying manufacturing jobs and investment in local businesses stemming from the increasing demand for these clean school buses.</p>
<p>“As more and more schools make the switch to electric buses, there will be a need for American-made batteries, charging stations and service providers to maintain the buses supercharging and reinvigorating local economies,” he added.</p>
<p>The Clean School Bus Program has now collectively awarded nearly $3 billion to fund approximately 8,500 electric and alternative fuel buses for over 1,000 communities across the United States, according to the administration.</p>
<p>The program started through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed by Congress and signed by President Joe Biden, which includes $5 billion over five years to transform the country’s existing school buses with “zero-emission and low-emission models,” per the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/cleanschoolbus" target="_blank">EPA</a>.</p>
<p>Among many negative health and environmental effects, especially for communities of color, diesel exhaust exposure can lead to major health conditions such as asthma and respiratory illnesses, according to the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/dera/learn-about-impacts-diesel-exhaust-and-diesel-emissions-reduction-act-dera" target="_blank">EPA</a>.</p>
<p>Exposure to diesel exhaust can also “worsen existing heart and lung disease, especially in children and the elderly,” the agency said.</p>

Patty Murray in November to inform her that he couldn’t transfer his GI bill benefits to his children, he wasn’t expecting congressional action to solve the problem.</p>
<p>He simply just wanted to let the Washington state Democrat know, he told States Newsroom in an exclusive interview.</p>
<p>With a child about to head to college, Pat, who didn’t want his last name used, had recently been told by the Army that he couldn’t transfer his education benefits to them because he received the Purple Heart after he was medically discharged. This rule does not apply to those who receive the medal while still in service.</p>
<p>Murray and Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, introduced a bipartisan bill Thursday aimed at closing that loophole.</p>
<p>The legislation, titled the <a href="https://www.murray.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Purple-Heart-final-text.pdf" target="_blank">Purple Heart Veterans Education Act</a>, would permit retroactive award recipients who served on or after Sept. 11, 2001 to transfer their education benefits to one or more dependents. It was unveiled just ahead of Memorial Day, when the nation honors its deceased service members.</p>
<p>“As the daughter of a Purple Heart recipient, I’ve seen firsthand the enormous sacrifices Purple Heart veterans make to defend our freedoms, and I feel strongly that we should be doing absolutely everything we can to help all veterans and their families thrive,” Murray said in a statement Thursday.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t make any sense that service members who are awarded a Purple Heart after their service can’t transfer their GI benefits to their dependents, while those who receive it during their service can—and I am grateful to Pat, my constituent in Washington state who brought this gap in the law to my attention,” continued Murray, a senior member of the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs.</p>
<p>“Our legislation will close this loophole and allow more children of Purple Heart veterans to further their education. I want to thank Senator Tillis for joining me on this legislation and I’ll be working hard to get it passed into law.”</p>
	<div class="newsroomSidebarContainer ">
	<div class="newsroomSidebar">Virginia recognizes Purple Heart recipients and their service in a variety of ways and has historic connections to the award. The oldest military honor in the United States, the Purple Heart dates back to 1782 when it was established by then-General George Washington — a native of Westmoreland County, Virginia — to commemorate the bravery of select Continental Army soldiers during the American Revolution.</p>
<div></div>
<div>&#8220;Sergeant William Brown was awarded the decoration for his gallantry while assaulting British positions at Yorktown in October 1781,&#8221; according to the <a href="https://armyhistory.org/the-purple-heart-the-story-of-americas-oldest-military-decoration-and-some-soldier-recipients/" target="_blank">Army Historical Foundation</a>.</div>
<div>
<div></div>
<div>The Military Order of the Purple Heart, &#8220;the only veterans service organization comprised strictly of &#8216;combat&#8217; veterans,&#8221; is headquartered in Springfield, Virginia. The organization created the <a href="https://www.purpleheart.org/PurpleHeartTrail" target="_blank">Purple Heart Trails</a> program; the trail&#8217;s origin point is in Virginia at Mt. Vernon, where Washington is buried, and extends the length of Interstate 95 through the state.</div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<div>Gov. Glenn Youngkin decreed August 7, 2023 as Purple Heart Day in Virginia and the state offers special license plates commemorating the prestigious award.</div>
</div>
</div>
	</div>
	
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Glitch in education benefits</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Pat was medically discharged from the U.S. Army and retroactively received a Purple Heart for his actions during Iran’s retaliatory missile barrage in January 2020 on an Iraq airbase, after a U.S. drone strike killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani.</p>
<p>The Army later approved 39 Purple Hearts for service members who experienced the attack, <a href="https://www.armytimes.com/news/your-army/2021/12/08/army-approves-31-purple-hearts-for-2020-iran-missile-attack/" target="_blank">according</a> to a December 2021 report by the Army Times.</p>
<p>As his teenager looks to enroll at Central Washington University next year, Pat found out that by law his education benefits would only be available for transfer if he had received the award while still in service.</p>
<p>“My thought was, ‘I doubt that legislators would have done that intentionally.’ I just thought, you know, people probably just didn’t think about how that happens — that some people are going to get retroactive Purple Hearts, or for whatever reason in evaluating them, they’re delayed. So it’s not like an unusual thing,” Pat said in a phone interview.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t thinking much was going to happen, but I just wanted to write Senator Murray, who is my local senator, and let her know the issue. They responded by saying, ‘That’s an oversight on our part, and we want to make good on that.’”</p>
<p>Pat said he’s “grateful for Sen. Murray” and hopes his action is able to help other Purple Heart veterans. For now, his family is moving forward with the college enrollment process for his child, he said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Benefits and dependents</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Among the provisions in the legislation, Murray and Tillis’ bill would also allow veterans to split up 36 months worth of benefits to each of their dependents. For example, they could transfer 20 months to one and 16 months to another.</p>
<p>The bill, if enacted, would also prohibit the benefits from being treated as marital property or a marital estate asset.</p>
<p>And, the bill would permit dependents to access unused benefits if their veteran family member has died.</p>
<p>“Purple Heart recipients are heroes who honorably served our country at great costs, and this oversight that prevents servicemembers who received this distinguished award after their service from transferring their GI bill benefits to their dependents needs to be corrected immediately,” Tillis said in a statement Thursday.</p>
<p>“I am proud to co-introduce this commonsense legislation with Senator Murray to close this loophole and ensure every Purple Heart recipient and dependents are able to further their education,” continued Tillis, who also sits on the Senate’s Veterans’ Affairs Committee.</p>
<p>The number of veterans who retroactively received the Purple Heart after their post-9/11 service is unclear. The bill is estimated to cost $500,000 in mandatory spending over 10 years, according to an informal analysis provided to Murray’s office by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.</p>
<p>The bill has received praise from veterans groups, including the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, not every veteran’s service and sacrifice on behalf of the United States of America is fully recognized while they’re still in uniform,” IAVA CEO and Iraq War veteran Allison Jaslow said in a statement Thursday.</p>
<p>“The Purple Heart Veterans Education Act ensures that those veterans who’ve endured bodily harm on behalf of our nation, but weren’t recognized for it until their service concluded, are able to turn that recognition into an investment in the education of their loved ones.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">More Purple Heart recipients</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have “greatly increased” the number of Purple Heart recipients as the Department of Defense has added some traumatic brain injuries as a recognized condition for the award, <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R42704" target="_blank">according</a> to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until a <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/3218?r=1&amp;q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22hr+3218%22%5D%7D" target="_blank">2017 law</a> that Purple Heart recipients were able to receive full post-9/11 GI Bill benefits regardless of their length of service. Previously, the recipients had to have 36 months of active service.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense does not maintain a record of the number of recipients, according to the CRS, but by law they do maintain a publicly accessible list with the permission of the veteran or next of kin.</p>
<p>Military historians and the National Purple Heart Hall of Honor <a href="https://www.thepurpleheart.com/questions/" target="_blank">estimate</a> about 1.8 million Purple Hearts have been awarded since 1932. The Army Historical Foundation <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/26365598" target="_blank">estimated</a> as of 2016 that 30,000 Purple Hearts had been awarded since 2001. The CRS <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R42704" target="_blank">cited</a> this statistic.</p>

(Douglas Sacha/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The race to harness the tax code is in full swing as economists and advocates across the political spectrum view the expiring Trump-era tax law as an opportunity to advance their economic priorities.</p>
<p>Democratic Rep. Suzan DelBene of Washington said Wednesday that reworking the tax code will be “a reflection of what your values are.”</p>
<p>DelBene, who sits on the U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means Subcommittee on Tax Policy, said her priorities include modernizing the tax code, raising revenue via carbon fees on imported goods, and making permanent an expanded child tax credit akin to the temporary changes in place during the pandemic.</p>
<p>“The top line is starting from what our values and goals are, and then looking at what the policies are that help us get there,” DelBene said at a Politico-sponsored discussion on proposed tax law changes.</p>
<p>The early morning event at Washington’s Union Station brought together tax experts and advocates from Georgetown University Law Center, the Urban Institute, the Heritage Foundation and Groundwork Collaborative.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Tax overhaul</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The massive tax overhaul ushered in under the Trump administration permanently cut the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%. The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/hr1/BILLS-115hr1enr.pdf" target="_blank">2017 law</a>, championed by Republicans as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, also put in place several temporary measures for corporations and small businesses. Some are phasing out or already expired, including immediate deductions for certain investments.</p>
<p>Temporary changes for households included marginal tax rate cuts across the board, a doubling of the child tax credit, and a near doubling of the standard deduction — all of which are set to expire Dec. 31, 2025.</p>
<p>A bipartisan bill to temporarily <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/business-owners-union-leader-urge-us-senate-move-ahead-soon-stalled-tax-package" target="_blank">extend the expiring business incentives</a> and <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/congress-looking-expanding-child-tax-credit-again-who-would-benefit" target="_blank">expand the child tax credit</a> beyond 2025 sailed through the U.S. House in late January, but has been stalled by U.S. Senate Republicans who <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/expanded-child-tax-credit-stranded-us-senate-gop-comparisons-welfare" target="_blank">oppose</a> some of the child tax credit expansion proposals.</p>
<p>A May 2024 nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/60271" target="_blank">report</a> estimated extending the tax cuts would cost roughly $4.6 trillion over 10 years. The bulk of the cost would stem from keeping in place individual tax cuts, according to an <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/the-new-cost-for-2025-tax-cut-extensions-5-trillion/" target="_blank">analysis</a> of the report by the Bipartisan Policy Center.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/congress-should-revisit-2017-tax-laws-trillion-dollar-corporate-rate-cut-in" target="_blank">Critics</a> of the 2017 law point to a recent March <a href="https://patrick-kennedy.github.io/files/TCJA_KDLM_2024.pdf" target="_blank">analysis</a> from academics and members of the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Federal Reserve that shows that the law’s benefits flowed to the highest earners.</p>
<p>DelBene said revisiting the corporate tax rate, <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/05/09/2024/corporate-tax-rate-hike-jason-smith" target="_blank">even on the Republican side</a>, is “on the table” and lawmakers will be talking about “where the TCJA wasn’t about investing and making sure that we were being fiscally responsible.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Incredibly bullish’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, said Wednesday she’s “incredibly bullish” on elected officials making “fundamental changes” to the tax code next year.</p>
<p>The progressive think tank sent a letter Wednesday to House and Senate leadership and top tax writers urging them “to use the expiration of these provisions as an opportunity to address long-standing problems with our tax code, not just to tinker around the edges.”</p>
<p>The letter was signed by 100 organizations from across the U.S., ranging from the AFL-CIO and the United Auto Workers to the National Women’s Law Center and United Church of Christ.</p>
<p>Stephen Moore, who helped write the Trump-era tax law and is now the conservative Heritage Foundation’s senior visiting fellow in economics, said the 2017 law was a “huge success” and that “we’re gonna definitely make those tax cuts permanent.”</p>
<p>Moore is an economic adviser for former President Donald Trump’s reelection effort, but said he was not speaking on behalf of the presidential campaign.</p>
<p>He said he does not agree with Trump on everything, including a promise to enact 10% tariffs on imported goods, reaching as high as 60% on Chinese imports.</p>
<p>“A tariff is just a consumption tax,” he said. “And so you know, I think that it is not a great policy, in my opinion. But if you’re gonna have a tariff, I would rather have a tariff that is uniform than trying to have, like, a protectionist tariff to, you know, protect this industry or that industry.”</p>
<p>When pressed on data that shows funding the Internal Revenue Service increases revenue, Moore said that President Joe Biden’s increase in funding for the agency is “diabolical.”</p>

<p>The criticism also arrives at a time when women’s college sports, particularly basketball, have recently <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/08/womens-sports-could-bring-in-over-1-billion-in-2024-whats-driving-growth.html#:~:text=Deloitte%20forecasts%20that%20in%202024,in%20popularity%20of%20women's%20sports." target="_blank">gained more popularity</a> and viewership.

The <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/ocr-higher-ed-athletic-resource-202302.pdf" target="_blank">federal law</a> also mandates “schools to provide equal opportunity based on sex.” The department’s <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/tix_dis.html" target="_blank">OCR</a> is tasked with enforcing compliance of Title IX.</p>
<p>Virginia Democratic Rep. Bobby Scott, ranking member of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, released the GAO report with U.S. Rep. Suzanne Bonamici, ranking member of the House Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education.</p>
<p>“Every student who wants to play a sport in college should have a fair and equal opportunity to do so,” said Scott.</p>
<p>“Regrettably, today’s GAO report confirms that while female college enrollment numbers outpace male enrollment, opportunities for female athletes significantly lag behind their male counterparts,” he said.</p>
<p>Bonamici, a Democrat from Oregon, said the federal law “sets a standard of equal opportunity that too many schools have failed to meet.” She added that the GAO report “shows that women enroll in college at a higher rate than men but consistently participate in college athletics at a lower rate than men.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Gap in women’s and men’s sports participation </h4>

	
<p>The report highlighted the persistent gap in college sports participation between women and men. Approximately 93% of colleges saw lower athletic participation rates for women relative to their enrollment rate during the 2021-2022 academic year.</p>
<p>Title IX also requires schools receiving federal funding to have participation numbers of men and women in college sports to be “substantially proportionate to their overall enrollment,” according to the <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/interath.html" target="_blank">Department of Education</a>.</p>
<p>Yet, women’s overall athletic participation rate fell 14 percentage points behind their enrollment rate in the 2021-2022 academic year, the GAO found.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Communication delays</h4>

	
<p>The GAO noted that the OCR made “limited use of available data for oversight purposes” and did not “always communicate with colleges in a timely way during monitoring.”</p>
<p>On average, it took half a year for the OCR to respond to colleges after “they submitted their Title IX athletics monitoring reports,” per the GAO.</p>
<p>The congressional watchdog found “years-long delays in communication between OCR and some colleges.” In 10 of 26 cases, it took at least a year or longer for the OCR to communicate with a college. In one case, it took nearly seven years for the OCR to approve the college’s proposed methodology for assessing whether it complied with Title IX athletics requirements, the GAO said.</p>
<p>In response to the report, Catherine Lhamon, assistant secretary for civil rights at the department, said the department is “fully committed to work with GAO to ensure the recommendations are implemented, to the extent possible.”</p>
<p>The attention paid to women’s sports is on the rise, thanks in part to Clark’s popularity on the court. Clark now plays for the WNBA’s Indiana Fever.</p>
<p>In April, the women’s basketball championship garnered more viewers compared to the men’s championship game for the first time in NCAA history, according to <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/news-center/2024/womens-college-basketball-championship-draws-record-breaking-18-9-million-viewers/" target="_blank">Nielsen</a>, which measures media audiences.</p>
