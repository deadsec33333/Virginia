Dozens of media outlets republished our stories, too, which helped us reach new readers inside and outside the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, our readers were especially hungry to learn more about blue catfish and the invasive species&#8217; culinary potential, the state&#8217;s most stately trees and why preserving them is vital, a local school board that made history as the first in the nation to re-name schools after Confederate figures and another that sued a special needs student&#8217;s parent for $600,000. Here&#8217;s a recap of those stories and our other most-read reports and commentary of 2024.</span></p>

<p><strong>From the story: </strong>Proud and satisfied, or sad and embarrassed. However citizens of the commonwealth view Shenandoah County School Board’s recent decision, Virginia appears to be the first in the nation to restore Confederate school names, after years of vigorous community engagement, a controversial renaming process, and a change in board priorities related to race, diversity and inclusion. <strong><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/20/virginia-school-board-restores-confederate-names/">Read more.</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>From the story:</strong> Of the roughly 2 million Virginians who’d been enrolled in Medicaid before the COVID-19 pandemic, over 480,000 of them have been disenrolled as of this August. Typically eligibility determinations are made annually, but they’d been on pause nationwide amid the pandemic due to federal policy. That’s changed over the past year in what’s colloquially referred to as “Medicaid Unwinding” as provisions of federal law have expired. <em><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/nearly-500000-virginians-in-medicaid-have-been-disenrolled/"><strong>Read more.</strong></a></em></p>

Last Monday, Youngkin awarded a $250,000 grant to Sea Farms, a family-owned and -operated aquaculture and seafood processing business with operations in Gloucester and Mathews counties, that among other uses will pay for a blast freezer that will increase the amount of blue catfish the company can buy and sell. </span><em><strong><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/05/blue-catfish-are-invasive-in-virginia-the-state-is-paying-to-get-more-of-them-on-peoples-tables/">Read more.</a></strong></em></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>From the column:</strong> Data centers are making the transition (to zero-carbon energy sources) harder, but so is local resistance to building solar. General Assembly members mostly understand the connection, leading to a lively debate in last year’s legislative session over whether to override some local permit denials for solar projects – and if so, how to ensure the localities still have some say. Though none of the legislative proposals moved forward last year, the topic has become a central one for the recently revamped Commission on Electric Utility Regulation (CEUR). </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/03/data-centers-approved-solar-farms-rejected-what-is-going-on-in-rural-virginia/"><b>Read more.</b></a></p>

(Courtesy of Luther Cifers campaign). </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luther Cifers, a businessman from Prince Edward County, emerged victorious in the Republican nomination contest for Virginia’s 10th Senate District during a mass meeting at the Goochland Rec Center.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The meeting, which drew hundreds of Republican voters, began Friday evening and stretched into the early hours of Saturday as participants navigated a lengthy multi-ballot process to select a nominee from a crowded field of seven candidates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cifers secured the majority needed to clinch the nomination, defeating a mix of seasoned politicians and newcomers in three rounds of voting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cifers will now face Democrat Jack Trammel in the Jan. 7 special election to fill the vacancy left by Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland, who resigned after his recent election to Congress. The winner of the special election will serve the remainder of McGuire’s term, which runs until 2027.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other contenders included runner-up Duane Adams, the chairman of the Louisa County Board of Supervisors who previously ran for the Republican nomination in the district in 2023 but was defeated by McGuire​, and Amanda Chase, a former state senator from Chesterfield County who served in the Virginia Senate for eight years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were four other bids for the seat by Shayne Snavely, a veteran and former Chase aide, Jean Gannon, a Powhatan County real estate appraiser, Alex Cheatham, a recent college graduate, and Bryan Hamlet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Luther emerged from a field of seven outstanding candidates who sought the nomination. The Republican Party of Virginia and I look forward to marching in lockstep with Luther and his team over the next three weeks in ensuring that he is victorious on January 7th and takes the oath of office on January 8th,” said Rich Anderson, the chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the district’s strong Republican lean — with 62.8% of voters supporting former President Donald Trump and 67.8% backing Gov. Glenn Youngkin — Cifers is seen as the favorite in the upcoming election.</span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans in Virginia’s 10th state Senate District will convene for a mass meeting on Friday to select their nominee in an upcoming special election. The vacancy was prompted by the resignation of Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland, who is set to leave his post after being elected to Congress​. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The meeting will take place at the Goochland Rec Center, with registration running from 4:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m., and proceedings beginning at 6:30 p.m. A total of seven candidates are vying to succeed McGuire. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organized by local party committees, mass meetings require party members to gather at a designated time and place to publicly select a candidate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike secret ballots, voting is often conducted through a show of hands, voice vote, or other public method. Participants must remain present for multiple rounds of voting until one candidate secures a majority — typically more than 50% of the votes — to be declared the winner. This process can be lengthy, especially in races with a crowded field of candidates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the GOP nominee is selected, they will face Democrat Jack Trammel in a special election on Jan. 7 set by Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, the Senate president pro tempore. The winner will serve out the remainder of McGuire’s term in the Senate, which ends in 2027.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the first Republicans to declare their candidacy for McGuire’s seat was Amanda Chase, a former state senator from Chesterfield County who served in the Virginia Senate for eight years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chase previously ran for re-election in 2023 but lost the GOP primary for her Chesterfield-based seat to Sen. Glen Sturtevant. To qualify for the 10th District race, Chase moved to Appomattox County, as Virginia law requires state legislators to live in the district they represent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joining the race is Shayne Snavely, an Amelia-based entrepreneur, veteran who was a former aide to Chase and worked on her failed 2021 gubernatorial campaign. Jean Gannon, a Powhatan County real estate appraiser and long-time Republican activist, has also thrown her hat into the ring. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Duane Adams, the chairman of the Louisa County Board of Supervisors, is making a bid for the seat as well. Adams previously ran for the Republican nomination in the district in 2023 but was defeated by McGuire​.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other contenders include Alex Cheatham, a recent college graduate aiming to make his political debut, and two late entrants: Luther Cifers, a businessman from Prince Edward County, and Bryan Hamlet, chairman of the Cumberland County Board of Supervisors​.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have a pretty good selection among the group there. I don’t know everybody, but I think that they will all be competitive candidates in that district,” Rich Anderson, chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia, said in a phone interview. “Obviously as a conservative Republican leading the conservative party, I want to get a conservative Republican nominated.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson said that the mass meeting could last late into the evening.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The process will probably require multiple ballots with that many people on the docket, so we’ll just see how it all turns out. I can’t predict who will walk away with all the marbles, but one of them will.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg, said that of the Republicans who have thrown their names in the ring for the special election to replace McGuire, “Chase is perhaps the best known or most notorious.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Richards doubts that Chase will get her party’s nod. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The mass meeting nomination process caters to party members, and Chase has little credibility with the local party after being expelled by the Chesterfield GOP and being noticeably absent from the one candidates forum already held. And she has little credibility with local Republicans, which will hurt her chances.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the remaining six candidates, Adams has been very active beginning with his unsuccessful bid for the nomination in 2023, which McGuire won, Richards said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The key to these mass meetings is name recognition in a positive way. Aside from the candidate forum held in late November, there has not been much opportunity or time for candidates to get their message out. Their pre-existing connections will tip the scale, which is why I expect Adams to win the nomination.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adams will still “get a run for his money” from Snavely, who also has a lot of party experience working for Chase earlier in his career, Richards added. “The other candidates have very low profiles, but Jean Gannon has been active in local GOP politics, which might help her.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire, who in June defeated incumbent U.S. Rep. Bob Good, R-Farmville, in one of the most viciously fought and expensive GOP primary battles nationwide this year, had kept Republicans </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/25/mcguire-still-hasnt-resigned-his-state-senate-seat-weeks-after-congressional-win/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on edge for weeks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after winning his election against Democrat Gloria Witt on Nov. 5. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically, elected officials who win a new position resign from their current office within days to allow for a special election to be called promptly, ensuring the seat isn’t left vacant when the next legislative session begins in early January. However, McGuire delayed his departure, formally stepping down on Wednesday​.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his official resignation letter, McGuire called his brief stint in the state Senate “the privilege of a lifetime” and said he hoped voters would choose “a strong candidate who loves We The People,” works well with others and who has “never wavered on our core Republican values.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, McGuire stopped short from publicly backing one of the seven candidates vying to succeed him. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was not too surprised that McGuire has not endorsed anyone, especially Adams,” said Richards. “When McGuire announced he was primarying Bob Good, Adams was very vocal about McGuire’s decision, calling him a liar, so there does not seem to be much love lost there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 10th Senate District, which spans 11 localities from Lynchburg in the west to the suburbs of Richmond in the east, leans heavily Republican. The district backed President-elect Donald Trump with 62.8% of the vote last month and gave Republican Glenn Youngkin an even stronger 67.8% support during his successful 2021 gubernatorial campaign.</span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The State Board of Elections officially certified this year’s election on Monday, affirming the results of local, congressional and national contests in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The bottom line is that we had safe and fair elections in Virginia this year,” said John O’Bannon, the chair of the board who was appointed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monday’s certification solidified Vice President Kamala Harris’ win of Virginia’s 13 electoral college votes, despite her ultimate loss to Donald Trump, whose second term in the White House begins next month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other certified elections included local contests around the state along with congressional elections and one of Virginia’s U.S. Senate seats. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Department of Elections Commissioner Susan Beals also reported that two risk-limiting audits after the elections confirmed the wins of both Democratic U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine and U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Westmoreland. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Risk-limiting audits are when random samples of hand-counted ballots are analyzed. Virginia conducts the audits after elections are complete but before they are certified each year. For anyone curious about more details of the audits, Beals said that a full report will be provided at the board’s January 2025 meeting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She added that two of Virginia’s upcoming special elections will occur on Jan. 7 of next year — Senate District 32 and House District 26. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is because Democratic Sen. Suhas Subramanyam was elected to Congress so he will vacate that seat. And, since Del. Kannan Srinivasan won a Democratic primary in hopes to replace Subramanyam in the state senate, he will vacate his House seat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, a special election has yet to be officially set for Senate District 10, as Sen. John McGuire was elected to Congress but </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/25/mcguire-still-hasnt-resigned-his-state-senate-seat-weeks-after-congressional-win/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hasn’t formally resigned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from his state seat. State</span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title24.2/chapter2/section24.2-216/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> outlines that a special election date must be set within 30 days of a vacancy or notification of it — whichever happens first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a 21-19 edge in favor of Democrats, a Republican failing to fill McGuire’s seat would give Democrats a bit more lead in the next legislative session. But Senate Minority Leader Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover, told The Mercury last week that he expects a special election will occur on Jan. 7. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s 2025 legislative session will begin on Jan. 8. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Virginia’s electoral board has often drawn public comment, no one offered feedback in Monday’s scarcely-attended meeting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Citizens in Virginia and elsewhere who denied President Joe Biden’s win over Trump in 2020 have questioned electoral boards nationwide. Meanwhile, recent drama among local electoral boards around the state has</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/08/17/special-prosecutor-trying-to-sort-out-elections-drama-in-nottoway-county/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sometimes spilled </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">into state electoral board meetings. Multiple Capitol Police officers have been present, as they were on Monday’s calm and procedural meeting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Party of Virginia chairman Rich Anderson and Democratic Party of Virginia chairwoman Susan Swecker had </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/state-party-leaders-show-support-for-virginias-elections/article_e68409be-92e0-11ee-a7cb-17550b97fe80.html#tncms-source=login" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">both attended</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the certification meeting of 2023’s elections to present as a unified front and shore up  trust in elections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were not present at this year’s certification, but other members of DPVA were. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jake Rubenstein, who served as Virginia’s director for Harris’ campaign, said election deniers are “just worried about winning elections for themselves — whether that means complaining if they don&#8217;t get the results they want, or saying ‘everything is fine’ when the result is what they wanted.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that DPVA is “incredibly proud” of election officials around the state for carrying out their work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a text message, Anderson said the results validated “what we knew all along: that Virginian voters can have confidence that our electoral processes are safe, secure and transparent.” </span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was an interesting revelation in a recent</span><a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/richmond-osher-forum-nov-22-2024" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">panel discussion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the University of Richmond about the 2024 election where all of us outsiders learned – to varying levels of astonishment – that Donald Trump’s campaign had no interest in persuading undecideds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mike Young, captain of Trump’s campaign in Virginia and North Carolina, came right out and said it: Trump’s campaign deliberately decided not to broaden his base but, rather, to reach every single one of Trump’s voters and make sure each voted for him. It worked in North Carolina, with its 16 electoral votes, but fell short in Virginia, with 13.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That would explain Trump’s actions throughout the campaign which left self-appointed observers like me scratching their heads when he made bizarre and unfounded claims such as Haitian immigrants eating pets in Ohio.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many at the time — including me — believed he had strategically blundered by doubling down on such clownish tropes that would energize his frothing loyalists but alienate persuadable independents. He was ceding the vital middle ground to Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris who already had an army of soccer moms angry over the reproductive rights issue and the support of minorities indignant at Trump’s ceaseless villainizing of immigrants lacking permanent legal status.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That leaves him with only his base, and that wouldn’t be nearly enough to win the 270 electoral votes required to become president. Right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wrong, at least on a national scale. Trump’s All-About-That-Base approach (apologies to</span><a href="https://youtu.be/7PCkvCPvDXk?si=l_2HPg2q2cP-29PF" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Meghan Trainor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) prevailed beyond what the aggregated conventional preelection polls and the national media that harped on them breathlessly would have us believe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump significantly improved his Virginia showing over the 10-percentage point beatdown he took four years ago at the hands of President Joe Biden but came up about five percentage points short against </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/05/harris-triumphs-over-trump-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia – perhaps more synced to official Washington than any other state – has spurned Trump and his proxies every time they appeared on a statewide ballot </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">during his candidacy in 2016 and his presidency through 2020</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This time, his base turned out but couldn’t match even an</span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/visuals/visual/change-in-votes/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">unenthused</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Democratic coalition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He won 31 states and a combined 312 electoral votes – 42 more than he needed – en route to a popular vote majority that had eluded him in his two previous elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nationally, he overwhelmingly gained vote share in localities and states he had lost to Biden, most notably seven swing states and the so-called “blue wall” of Midwestern states that were vital to Democrats’ hopes of staying in power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of that happened in Virginia, too, but not to the extent necessary to flip the commonwealth red for the first time in a presidential race since 2004.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-preservation may explain some of that. Northern Virginia’s population base has a lot to say about which candidates win statewide elections, and those voters include federal government employees or employees of federal contractors or businesses reliant on trade with federal employees or contractors. When Washington catches a cold, everything north of the Rappahannock sneezes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump has made no secret of his desire to slash the federal workforce. He tried it during his previous White House tenancy but was a novice at dealing with wily agency leaders and the institutional inertia of bureaucracies. This time, he’s returning to office surrounded by a platoon of proven, dutiful minions and has put Elon Musk,  arguably the planet’s wealthiest plutocrat,</span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-elon-musk-vivek-ramaswamy-will-lead-department-government-efficiency-2024-11-13/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in charge of the demolition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If he succeeds, it could devastate not just the economy of the Washington suburbs and exurbs but state government revenue by stalling its economic engine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even so, Trump gained vote share in all but nine of Virginia’s 133 localities, including some Democratic-aligned D.C. suburbs like Fairfax County, the state’s largest, where he enjoyed a nearly nine percentage point rightward shift, according to the</span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/visuals/visual/2024-partisan-shift-by-locality/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Public Access Project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Broken down demographically, Trump made gains among Black men, Hispanic/Latino voters, voters younger than 30 and white voters in key states, according to</span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/22/nx-s1-5199119/2024-election-exit-polls-demographics-black-latino-voters" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">analyses of election poll data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by NPR. Unlike ever-changing issues such as the economy, inflation, immigration and the job-approval ratings of those in power, these are trends with staying power that should send shivers up the spines of Democrats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s not to say that Virginia will become Trump country if only, for no other reason, because he’s about to serve out the second and final term that presidents are allowed under the 22nd Amendment. It’s because this state is fully capable of putting other Republicans in charge of things, notwithstanding national media pundits who consider Virginia reliably Democratic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin is living proof of that. In 2021, Virginia voters assumed Trump was forever exiled to his luxury oceanfront compound in Palm Beach, Florida, and perhaps a prison cell, and pent-up frustration over the COVID-19 pandemic and wall-to-wall Democratic rule in Virginia manifested itself in a statewide GOP sweep.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin, a wealthy former hedge fund executive running his first bid for electoral office, defeated a favored Democratic former governor, Terry McAuliffe. On his coattails, fellow Republican Winsome Earle-Sears became the first woman of color to win statewide election with her victory as lieutenant governor and Jason Miyares’ triumph as attorney general made him the first Hispanic American to be elected to a statewide office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fresh off this wrenching, worse-than-ugly presidential campaign, we’re about to kick off another gubernatorial campaign in earnest, one that seems destined to at last give Virginia its </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/25/spanberger-and-earle-sears-tied-in-first-2025-gubernatorial-poll/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first woman governor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Earle-Sears and outgoing Democratic U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger have both announced their candidacies and are prohibitive favorites to win their respective nominations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Trump back in the White House and vowing to slash the federal workforce, it will be much harder for Earle-Sears to avoid his stain than it was for Youngkin. Democrats won’t have to labor under a deeply unpopular president, and Youngkin has maintained a</span><a href="https://washingtonpost.com/documents/7767776f-8100-4a81-a636-d323e9736f94.pdf?itid=lk_inline_manual_4" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">respectable job-approval rating</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger and the Democrats, however, know – or by now </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">should</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> know – the kind of turnout a motivated GOP can produce in the countryside and eat into the margins in the urban and suburban redoubts. They’ve got to find a way to reconnect with their base on the left while reassuring working people facing a frightening world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That opportunity is about to present itself. Whether the Democrats or Republicans make the best use of it in an election that will serve as the first barometer of the second Trump White House is the question immediately before us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And a dozen months from now, we’ll know the answer.</span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three weeks after being elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, Virginia state Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland, has yet to resign his seat in the Virginia Senate, an unusual delay that has raised questions about the transition of power and the scheduling of a special election to fill his vacancy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire, who defeated Democrat Gloria Witt in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District earlier this month after unseating U.S. Rep. Bob Good, R-Farmville, in one of the most expensive GOP primaries nationwide this year, is slated to be sworn into Congress in January. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, his continued hold on his Senate seat, representing the 10th District, is drawing attention because most state lawmakers resign soon after winning federal office to allow for a smooth succession process. The State Board of Elections is set to certify the results of the Nov. 5 election on Dec. 2.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title24.2/chapter2/section24.2-216/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a special election date must be set within 30 days of a vacancy or notification of it, whichever occurs first. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Senate President Pro Tempore Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, is expected to set a date for a special election to fill McGuire’s seat once his resignation is official. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re still waiting for a formal resignation letter so we can go ahead and call for a special election,” JoNathan Collins, a spokesman for Lucas, told The Mercury Monday.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire did not respond to several phone calls and text messages seeking comment. Senate Minority Leader Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover, said Monday that he expects a special election to be set for Jan. 7, the day before the General Assembly convenes for its 20205 session. He did not elaborate further. </span></p>
<p>Democrats hold a slim 21-19 majority in the Senate. If McGuire’s vacant seat remains unfilled by the start of the legislative session in January, Republicans will face an additional loss in their numbers.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg, said that he doesn’t see a strategic reason for why McGuire would delay resigning his seat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m chalking this up to ‘paperwork delays’ or something like that,” Richards said. “I’m not going to pretend to know what McGuire is thinking, but this does seem to fall in line with the fairly loose way he ran his campaign, both in the primary and in the general election.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire, Richards said, often seemed to be using “a different playbook than the normal one, whether because he has his own ideas or simply is unfamiliar with what he needs to do, it wasn’t clear. My hope is that he gets up to speed once he gets to D.C. in 2025 and will figure out how to be an effective voice in Congress for the 5th District.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 10th Senate District, which spans 11 localities, stretching from Lynchburg in the west to the Richmond suburbs in the east, leans Republican. McGuire’s departure has set the stage for a hotly contested race, particularly among Republican hopefuls eager to retain the seat in the GOP column. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, District Republicans </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/elections/virginia-mcguire-senate-seat-mass-meeting-amanda-chase/article_fb3c01c6-a758-11ef-b8c4-dfc06f5ac715.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced the process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for selecting their nominee in the upcoming special election. The local GOP committee scheduled a mass meeting for Dec. 12 at 5:30 p.m. to choose the party’s candidate. Unlike a firehouse primary, the mass meeting format allows registered Republicans in attendance to vote directly. The location for the meeting has yet to be finalized.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the first of the six Republicans to announce their bids for McGuire’s seat was former state senator Amanda Chase, who had served in the body for eight years and lost her 2023 GOP primary for her Chesterfield-based seat to Sen. Glen Sturtevant. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the law requires state legislators reside in the district they represent, Chase has moved from her former home in Chesterfield County to Appomattox County. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shayne Snavely, Chase’s former aide who worked on her bid for the Republican nomination for governor three years ago, has also declared his intention to run. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so have Jean Gannon, a Powhatan County real estate appraiser and longtime Republican activist, and Duane Adams, the chairman of the Louisa County Board of Supervisors, who ran for the Republican nomination in the district in 2023 but lost to McGuire. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In more recent weeks, Luther Cifers, a businessman from Prince Edward County, and Bryan Hamlet, the chairman of the Cumberland County Board of Supervisors, have also launched their campaigns in District 10.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lone Democrat who has filed to run in the Republican-leaning district is Jack Trammel, a college professor from Louisa County who in 2014 unsuccessfully ran against Republican Dave Brat in Virginia’s 7th Congressional District. </span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Close races within margin of recount</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Over 180 miles from Richmond, the winner of a Southwestern mayoral race in Roanoke was clear only the day before election results were officially certified.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Democratic Vice Mayor Joe Cobb clinched a 59-vote victory in a three-way race. The city’s former mayor, Republican David A. Bowers was ahead initially, and even <a href="https://www.wsls.com/news/local/2024/11/08/vice-mayor-joe-cobb-leading-race-for-roanoke-mayor-as-of-friday-night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.wsls.com/news/local/2024/11/08/vice-mayor-joe-cobb-leading-race-for-roanoke-mayor-as-of-friday-night/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1731786298014000&amp;usg=AOvVaw13g0FdoT0wAk9L-hU_igYH">declared</a> victory. However, absentee ballots later placed Cobb ahead.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The state deadline for mailed absentee ballots was noon on Friday, Nov. 8. There were also 1,223 provisional ballots to be tallied, according to Nicholas Ocampo, Roanoke’s director of elections and general registrar.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is the first mayoral race in Roanoke with same-day <a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/registration/same-day-voter-registration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.elections.virginia.gov/registration/same-day-voter-registration/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1731786298014000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0TYmRRhmjZir5I_5RL0J2p">registration</a>, Ocampo stated.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This process requires extra steps to verify each voter’s eligibility to vote in the polling location in which their ballot was cast. Our office will continue to carefully and meticulously follow election laws and state guidelines to review each same day registration application in preparation for [certification on Nov. 15],” he stated.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ocampo’s greatest takeaway of the 2024 election is “every vote counts.”</p>

The candidate must request it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Cobb’s campaign priorities were listed as transportation, education, community safety, housing and jobs. He will also be the first LGBTQ+ mayor to lead Roanoke.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Another 200 miles to the east in Hampton Roads, Suffolk’s tight three-way race is also within the margin of a recount.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Incumbent Mayor Michael Duman maintained his lead over former Democratic Del. Clinton Jenkins with 164 votes, after all ballots were <a href="https://enr.elections.virginia.gov/results/public/suffolk-city/elections/2024NovemberGeneral" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://enr.elections.virginia.gov/results/public/suffolk-city/elections/2024NovemberGeneral&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1731786298014000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0dx09TxO2N1bmy0_iMCUME">counted</a>.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The commission’s creation came after the publication of a series of essays in The New York Times dubbed the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">1619 Project, whose namesake reflects the first year enslaved Africans were brought to the shores of what would become the United States. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, national debate was brewing about how history concerning </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">slavery and Black Americans’ contributions to the country was taught, a discussion that </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/11/17/missing-context-political-bias-some-of-critics-objections-to-virginias-new-history-standards/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">manifested</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Virginia after Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration authorized a rewrite of Virginia history and social science education standards that critics said lacked important context but included bias. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The 1776 Commission’s background</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump has not mentioned plans for the commission since his re-election over Democrat Vice President Kamala Harris on Nov. 5, despite his party’s affirmation of their intent to reinstate it. The former president </span><a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-establishing-presidents-advisory-1776-commission/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">created</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the commission during his previous term via an executive order issued on Nov. 2, 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It came after the Trump administration and some conservatives accused the 1619 Project and  critical race theory college courses of teaching students to “hate their own country.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This radicalized view of American history lacks perspective, obscures virtues, twists motives, ignores or distorts facts, and magnifies flaws, resulting in the truth being concealed and history disfigured,” the order reads. “Failing to identify, challenge, and correct this distorted perspective could fray and ultimately erase the bonds that knit our country and culture together.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, the 1776 Commission published a 41-page </span><a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/The-Presidents-Advisory-1776-Commission-Final-Report.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that received criticism from historians and educators largely because it was developed by experts from Hillsdale College, a Christian school in Michigan, politicians and conservatives. Detractors said the report attempted to downplay how the institution of slavery shaped U.S. history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://www.historians.org/news/aha-statement-condemning-report-of-advisory-1776-commission/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the American Historical Association, joined by 47 organizations, said the report attempted to “elevate ignorance about the past to a civic virtue.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The AHA said the report included “an homage to the Founding Fathers” that was “a simplistic interpretation that relies on falsehoods, inaccuracies, omissions and misleading statements.” It also said the report featured “a screed against a half-century of historical scholarship, presented largely as a series of caricatures, using single examples (most notably the ‘1619 Project’) to represent broader historiographical trends.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beau Dickenson, executive board member and former president of the Virginia Social Studies Leaders Consortium, said the 1776 Commission&#8217;s report tried to rewrite history and insulted social studies teachers by suggesting they don&#8217;t want to be patriotic, which he said was contrary to their motives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want those dispositions in our students, but we want them to have a balanced view of our past,” Dickenson said. “And even within the topics that these folks would prefer us to overlook, I see a very compelling story of agency and resilience and people overcoming despite these odds and making this country stronger as a result. It&#8217;s a testament to our people that we can be a flawed country and make it a better one, but the 1776 Commission seeks just to overlook that history or rewrite it entirely.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were also some educators, like Carol Swain, defending the commission. Swain, former commission vice chair and retired political science and law professor at Vanderbilt and Princeton Universities said “No parts of history were taken out in the report, and the people from the left attacked it because it was the Trump administration that put it together.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon after the commission published the </span><a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/The-Presidents-Advisory-1776-Commission-Final-Report.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1776 Report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in January 2021, the group was </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-advancing-racial-equity-and-support-for-underserved-communities-through-the-federal-government/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">disbanded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by President Joe Biden through an executive order focused on advancing racial equity and supporting underserved communities on Jan. 20, 2021. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virginia parallels</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his first year as Virginia’s governor in 2022, Youngkin began addressing and reforming public education, and, in his first </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/74---eo/74---eo/EO-1---ENDING-THE-USE-OF-INHERENTLY-DIVISIVE-CONCEPTS,-INCLUDING-CRITICAL-RACE-THEORY,-AND-RESTORING-EXCELLEN.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executive order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, prohibited “inherently divisive concepts,” including critical race theory (CRT), in K-12 education. CRT is a graduate-level framework focusing on racial inequity that has not been found in Virginia&#8217;s curricula. Youngkin also signed off on revamping the state’s history and social science education standards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The administration faced criticisms after state historians, lawmakers and education groups learned that Hillsdale College was involved in the rewrite of Virginia’s standards, which outline the commonwealth&#8217;s expectations for student learning and are assessed through the Standards of Learning tests. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia lawmakers, educators and community organizers </span><a href="https://www.sikhcoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Hamkae-Center-and-Sikh-Coalition-Letter-VA-History-and-Social-Standards-SOLs.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Nov. 5, 2022 that they were “alarmed” to hear of Hillsdale’s involvement with the draft history standards following accusations that the college, in its work with other states, did not provide feedback on public education systems’ social studies standards, but instead created a curriculum for them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group also pointed out that experts found the 1776 curriculm’s pedagogical framework had “content inaccuracies” and was “lacking” in inquiry, critical thinking and analysis of primary sources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are highly concerned that Hillsdale College, a private liberal arts college in Michigan, has the potential to dictate and influence what Virginia educators teach and what Virginia students learn,” the group wrote.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to the outcry, Youngkin’s administration pulled the department’s draft standards from further review. It replaced it months later with a draft missing influential figures and events, a flaw historians said was similar to missing information in the 1776 report. Educators, lawmakers, and community organizers also voiced concern about the process&#8217;s lack of transparency regarding who authored the changes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swain, a native of Southwest Virginia, disagreed with the claim that no professional historians were involved in creating the 1776 report. She did say she’s pleased that the governor’s administration may have included elements from the report in the draft standards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the things that we argued and were pushing was for history to be taught using original documents, to get the young people to read the Declaration of Independence, to read the Constitution … (and also) the constitutions of their states for themselves,” Swain said. “And so that was one of the things that I know we were united on, and I believe that the best schools, the private academies, that&#8217;s what they do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, historians and educators continued challenging the Youngkin administration and the Virginia Board of Education on the draft standards over several months. By April 2023, the Board of Education </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/04/20/after-months-of-debate-virginia-board-of-education-adopts-history-standards/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">adopted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the updated standards, which had been changed to include more of the historic context and content lawmakers, educators and advocates had sought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dickenson said there are similarities between how the 1776 Commission&#8217;s report and the Youngkin administration’s proposed education standards were created. </span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="MCJZ1gXLCD"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/11/17/missing-context-political-bias-some-of-critics-objections-to-virginias-new-history-standards/">Missing context, political bias: Some of critics&#8217; objections to Virginia&#8217;s new history standards</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Missing context, political bias: Some of critics&#8217; objections to Virginia&#8217;s new history standards&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/11/17/missing-context-political-bias-some-of-critics-objections-to-virginias-new-history-standards/embed/#?secret=O6fU8arOZq#?secret=MCJZ1gXLCD" data-secret="MCJZ1gXLCD" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like the 1776 report, Dickenson said professional historians were “sidelined” in favor of conservative groups such as Hillsdale College in the early development of Virginia’s standards. The efforts also shifted from inquiry-based learning to a rote, fact-focused approach emphasizing memorization over critical thinking and analysis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This directly contradicts Youngkin’s claim that students should ‘learn how to think, not what to think,’ and it limits opportunities for students to explore, question, and engage deeply with historical content,” Dickenson said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report and draft standards both aimed to frame the removal of critical race theory as a way to change or remove parts of history that discuss racial issues, colonialism and the struggles of marginalized groups, Dickenson said. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What’s next?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plans for reorganizing the 1776 Commission are uncertain, since it was housed under the U.S. Department of Education, an agency that Trump has vowed to disband.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the 2024 national Republican </span><a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/2024-republican-party-platform" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">platform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “Republicans will reinstate the 1776 Commission, promote fair and patriotic civics education, and veto efforts to nationalize civics education. We will support schools that teach America&#8217;s founding principles and Western civilization.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leaders in Albemarle County and the cities of Fairfax and Newport News are considering ranked choice voting, which allows voters to rank candidates in order of preference, for city council and county board elections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simultaneously, Virginia Beach was considering amending its charter to allow the city to use the 10-1 voting system that splits the voting age population into 10 equal districts to vote for the mayor and the representative for their district. But on Tuesday evening, the city council voted not to approve the change. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sally Hudson, executive director for Ranked Choice Virginia and a former state delegate, said because of the public’s wavering faith in democracy at the federal level, it&#8217;s leading more people to question the fairness of election systems in Virginia and other states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think that the current crisis of faith in democracy at the federal level is getting a lot of people to look more carefully about how all these decisions that we make all the way down to the local level are reflective of some norms and assumptions that may no longer serve us well,” said Hudson. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, Virginia passed </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+HB1103" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Hudson carried as a delegate, allowing localities to use ranked choice voting for city and county governing body elections. But lawmakers will have to consider renewing the legislation before it sunsets on July 1, 2031.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advocates say the goal of ranked choice voting is to reflect the actual majority of the vote. Opponents argue that may not be true under single transferable voting, a system similar to ranked choice voting, which could allow candidates with minimal support to be elected to office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think we need to take a look at ranked choice voting throughout the commonwealth,” said Newport News Mayor Phillip Jones. “There are a lot of elections [including for] local constitutional officers and other elections in which the winner wins 30% of the vote. I think it&#8217;s important to take a look at it holistically.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of Newport News’ charter review, the mayor has tasked the review committee to examine ranked choice voting and return with recommendations in the summer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to  state law, ranked choice votes will be counted in each step to determine who wins or who has the least number of votes, compared to the single choice voting method. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the single choice voting method, where voters pick one candidate, Newport News’ central district council seat had five candidates in the Nov. 5 General Election —and the candidate with the highest percentage of votes led with 31%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jones said that shows more people getting engaged in the electoral process. He said more people are also considering running for office: school board, city council, mayor, constitutional offices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are multiple ways to take a look at this issue and I think one of the solutions on the table is ranked choice voting,” he said. “I think that is going to allow people to really make their voice heard, and you&#8217;re able to get to that 50% threshold instead of 28% or 30% or 40%.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Northern Virginia, the Fairfax City Council is scheduled to convene a work session on ranked choice voting on Dec. 3.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fairfax City Mayor Catherine Read said she requested the work session for her and her colleagues on the concept of the voting method as the city discusses its election process. The city council has elections every two years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ranked choice voting needs to be better understood,” Read said in a statement. “I&#8217;m open to new ideas and concepts if we can see it produces an outcome that people want. This work session is a very preliminary first step in that exploration.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Piedmont Region, the Albemarle County Board of Supervisors is also weighing its options with ranked choice voting. After the elections office and the three-member </span><a href="https://www.albemarle.org/government/elections/electoral-board" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">electoral board</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> made presentations about the voting method on Aug. 21, the board has yet to make any further plans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lauren Eddy, general registrar and director of elections in Albemarle County, said in the first presentation if the county adopts RCV, supervisors should expect to cover the costs for software upgrades, equipment, and voter education, which could cost at least $70,000. Eddy said the county could leverage the costs with county communication resources and educational materials developed by other jurisdictions that have adopted RCV.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in the second presentation, Clara Belle Wheeler, vice chair of the county electoral board and former Virginia State Board of Elections member, said having a ranked choice voting system is expensive, confusing and there’s no need for it. The electoral board is represented by the political party of the current Virginia governor and one member of the party receiving the second-highest number of votes for that office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have numerous elderly voters and they may know a lot about one the candidate they like, but they will have trouble voting a ranked choice ballot,” Wheeler said. “The less well-informed and the less well-educated will have the same problem, and they could conceivably be disenfranchised … if you can’t figure out how to mark the ballot, your ballot is not gonna even count.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some supervisors </span><a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/government-politics/elections/albemarle-officials-bash-nakedly-partisan-screed-against-ranked-choice-voting/article_c92af83e-8b53-11ef-ab73-3f20b8a400bb.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criticized</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the presentation by Wheeler, describing it as “poor” and “skewed,” and some took offense to her remarks. Wheeler is a senior fellow at the Virginia Institute for Public Policy, a conservative think tank that has promoted myths about voter fraud.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virginia Beach change</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following a scheduled public hearing on Tuesday, the Virginia Beach City Council </span><a href="https://www.wavy.com/news/local-news/vb-council-votes-down-putting-10-1-voting-system-into-charter/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">failed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to garner enough votes to amend the city charter to use the 10-1 voting system. The council needed a three-fourths majority, or nine members, to support the measure and send it the request to the General Assembly for approval.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a </span><a href="https://www.coopercenter.org/research/virginia-beach-local-election-system" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Weldon Cooper Center at the University of Virginia, 78% of city residents surveyed said their interests are “well-represented” under the 10-1 system. The survey included more than 2,100 residents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This system has proven to be a vital step towards ensuring equitable representation and addressing the historical disparities faced by minority communities in our city,” </span><a href="https://naacpva.org/virginia-naacp-urges-virginia-beach-city-council-to-approve-modifying-the-city-charter-to-incorporate-the-fair-10-1-voting-system/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Virginia chapter of the NAACP in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to city records, in November 2022, the city first conducted its election using the 10-1 voting method after a lengthy legal battle in the Federal District Court. Then in Aug. 15, 2023, the city adopted in its decennial redistricting ordinance that included the 10-1 system and newly formed district boundaries ordered by the federal district court.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the city charter, Virginia Beach voters used the 7-3-1 system, dividing the city into seven districts and three-at-large seats, allowing voters on 11 council seats, according to the city.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In January 2024, former council member Linwood Branch filed a lawsuit alleging the 10-1 system was illegally implemented and goes against the city charter, according to </span><a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/local/mycity/virginia-beach/virginia-beach-10-1-voting-system-lawsuit-going-to-trial/291-2bb2318c-4990-47b1-873b-e49e1c564ab7" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">13 News Now</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last session, Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB416" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to amend Virginia Beach’s charter because of “pending litigation concerning the validity of the adopted district system in Virginia Beach,” and said he expected “that this legislation will be re-introduced once the court’s adjudication has been finalized.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the city and General Assembly backed the change to the charter, Virginia Beach’s members representing Districts 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10 will be elected during the November 2026 general election. At the November 2028 general election, voters will select candidates for Districts 1, 3, 5 and 7 and for the mayoral seat. Each member is elected for terms of four years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Editor’s note:</em> This story was updated Wednesday morning to reflect the 7-4 vote from Tuesday’s Virginia Beach City Council meeting not to amend the locality&#8217;s charter to include 10-1 voting. The council needed three-fourths majority, or nine members, to make the change.</span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A majority of Virginians supported a referendum expanding the state Constitution to provide real estate tax relief to surviving spouses of service members who died in the line of duty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Constitution only applied to 100% disabled veterans and surviving spouses of soldiers killed in action as determined by the U.S. Department of Defense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s unofficial election results show that 93% of Virginians supported the amendment through a referendum that was on the ballot last week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s humbling to see the overwhelming support and to be able to help just over a hundred or so families,” said Sen. Jeremy McPike, D-Prince William, who carried the </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB4" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">amendment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Senate. “I think people, once they read it and understood it, they got why it was so important.”</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As part of the </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/constitution/article12/section1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">requirement</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> to make any changes to the Constitution of Virginia, McPike’s amendment had to pass successfully by a majority in both chambers in two separate sessions, intervening with a general election. McPike was able to garner the votes in 2023 and 2024.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said the expansion of the law will now also cover the spouses of service members, who, for example, may have died in a training accident.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under current law, the property tax exemption applies only to the spouses of service members who are either 100% disabled or who were “killed in action”— a specific Department of Defense term indicating that the death occurred due to enemy action.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitch Rubenstein, state commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars of Virginia, said in a statement that the organization appreciated the votes in  support of the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are grateful to the voters for expanding the property tax exemption offered to surviving spouses of service members killed in action to spouses of any service member killed while honorably serving this nation,” Rubenstein said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022, lawmakers passed </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB957" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> carried by Del. Kathy Tran, D-Fairfax, that gave localities the authority to provide property tax relief to certain surviving spouses of service members who died in the line of duty (LODD).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the passage of the amendment, Friends of the Virginia Military Survivors &amp; Dependents Education Program (VMSDEP), an advocacy group for ensuring the state’s tuition beneficiary program is sustainable, said it hopes that localities will continue to offer the tax relief benefit in addition to the statewide tax exemption.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our hope is that, for the purposes of enactment, the amendment enabling language will include the ability for local authorities to continue or choose to provide additive relief, by establishing or continuing a special tax classification for LODD Survivors, to include Survivors of LODD Suicide,” Friends of VMSDEP said in a statement. “Enabling language should include property tax relief when the property is held in a revocable trust.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group also said it is seeking enabling language to allow survivors who lost their spouses in service prior to 9/11 — when Line of Duty Determination Investigations were first conducted in order to render Line of Duty Death Determination Letters — to provide alternative qualifying documentation. In addition, the organization said it is  asking for language to recognize and include partial ownership for the purposes of proportional tax relief.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Going forward, Friends of VMSDEP will advocate for and support legislation that provides statewide parity between tax relief for Survivors of LODD and survivors of the 100% disabled,” the group said.</span></p>

Virginia is one of several states that had property tax measures on the ballot this year. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)</p><p>Voters in half a dozen states approved ballot issues aimed at lowering property taxes, but a measure in North Dakota that would have completely repealed the property tax proved to be a bridge too far.</p>
<p>Ballot measures to cut taxes for some or all property owners passed in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, New Mexico, Virginia and Wyoming.</p>
<p>But in North Dakota, a coalition made up of police, firefighters, teachers, real estate brokers and many other groups who rely on funding from local governments successfully persuaded voters that scrapping property taxes would cripple local services. The <a href="https://northdakotamonitor.com/2024/11/05/north-dakota-voters-reject-property-tax-ballot-measure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">measure failed</a>.</p>
<p>“North Dakotans are frustrated about property taxes, but Measure 4 was not the way to accomplish reform,” Chad Oban, chair of the Keep It Local coalition, said in a statement. “The coalition’s 113 members were successful in informing North Dakota voters about the dangers of Measure 4. Local officials will continue to work with their constituents to make thoughtful decisions regarding funding and what is best for their communities.”</p>
<p>He suggested the state legislature should take up property tax reform in January.</p>
<p>The proposed constitutional amendment would have prohibited state and local governments from taxing property’s assessed value and required the state legislature to replace the roughly $1.3 billion per year in lost revenue. If it had passed, North Dakota would have become the only state without property taxes, according to the conservative Tax Foundation.</p>
<p>Supporters of the measure had argued that it would restrain government spending and that the legislature had other pots of money to replace the lost revenue.</p>
<p>Former Republican state Rep. Rick Becker, a leader of the referendum drive, told Stateline earlier this year that many residents in his state hate property taxes.</p>

<h4 class="editorialSubhed">Property taxes</h4>
<p>States that approved reducing some property taxes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arizona</li>
<li>Florida</li>
<li>Georgia</li>

<li>Wyoming</li>

<p>“Do you really own your property if the government can take it away?” he said, referring to cases in which people who don’t pay their taxes might face foreclosure on their homes.</p>
<p>Property tax increases across the country have been driven by the increase in home and commercial real estate values, due to inflation and shrinking stock. And experts say because those taxes often arrive in a large lump a couple or so times a year — as opposed to income taxes or sales taxes, which come in dribbles — they tend to leave a bigger impression on taxpayers.</p>
<p>Two proposed property tax initiatives in Colorado — to cut property taxes and to cap the annual growth of the revenue they generate for the state — were withdrawn from the ballot after the legislature, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis and the groups behind the initiatives agreed on compromise legislation. That law reduces property taxes in the next two years by a smaller amount.</p>
<p>In Arizona, the issue was intertwined with homelessness and vagrancy problems. Voters <a href="https://azmirror.com/briefs/ballot-prop-roundup-what-passed-what-failed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approved</a> a measure to allow property owners to apply for a property tax refund if their municipality does not enforce laws against illegal camping, loitering, panhandling, public urination, public consumption of alcohol and possession of illegal substances.</p>
<p>Republican supporters argue the measure will force local governments to enforce those bans. But cities objected to the measure, saying it will put them in a difficult legal and fiscal position as they deal with homelessness.</p>
<p>Florida voters backed a measure to give homeowners a bigger tax break as the cost of living increases. It will institute an annual inflation adjustment to the amount of a home’s assessed value eligible for a homestead exemption from the property tax.</p>
<p>Similarly, Georgia voters approved a ballot measure that aims to limit property tax increases when home values rise. It will allow for a statewide homestead exemption that will cap increases in the assessed value of homes, though it allows localities to opt out of the exemption.</p>
<p>New Mexico and Virginia voters overwhelmingly approved ballot measures to extend more property tax breaks to veterans and their surviving spouses.</p>
<p>Wyoming voters passed a measure to set up a new class of property for taxation, allowing the legislature to put owner-occupied primary residences in a separate category from rental property.</p>

<p>Technologists and election academics <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/ai-will-play-role-election-misinformation-experts-are-trying-fight-back" target="_blank">warned a few months ago</a> that mis- and disinformation would play an even larger role in 2024 than it did in 2020 and 2016. What exactly that disinformation would look like became more clear in the two weeks leading up to the election, said Tim Harper, senior policy analyst for democracy and elections at the Center for Democracy and Technology.</p>
<p>“I think a lot of folks kind of maybe prematurely claimed that generative AI’s impact was overblown,” Harper said. “And then, you know, in short order, in the last week, we saw several kinds of disinformation campaigns emerge.”</p>
<p>Harper specifically mentioned the false claims that vice presidential nominee Tim Walz was alleged to have perpetrated <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/23/tim-walz-russia-disinformation" target="_blank">an act of sexual misconduct</a>, and a deep fake <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/viral-video-ripped-pennsylvania-ballots-fake-russian-made-intelligence-rcna177404" target="_blank">video of election officials ripping up ballots</a>, both of which have been shown to be Russian misinformation campaigns.</p>
<p>AI also played a role in attempted voter suppression, Harper said, not just by foreign governments, but by domestic parties as well. EagleAI, a database that scrapes public voter data, was being used by a 2,000-person North Carolina group which <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/eagleai-network-suspicious-voter-lists-north-carolina/" target="_blank">aimed to challenge the ballots</a> of “suspicious voters.”</p>
<p>Emails<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/eagleai-network-suspicious-voter-lists-north-carolina/" target="_blank"> obtained by Wired last month </a>show that voters the group aimed to challenge include “same-day registrants, US service members overseas, or people with homestead exemptions, a home tax exemption for vulnerable individuals, such as elderly or disabled people, in cases where there are anomalies with their registration or address.”</p>
<p>The group also aimed to target people who voted from a college dorm, people who registered using a PO Box address and people with “inactive” voter status.</p>
<p>Another shift Harper noted from the 2020 election was a rollback of enforcement of misinformation policies on social media platforms. Many platforms feared being seen as “influencing the election” if they flagged or challenged misinformation content.</p>
<p>Last year, Facebook and Instagram’s parent company Meta, as well as X <a href="https://www.cnn.com/business/tech/meta-political-ads-2020-election-lies/index.html" target="_blank">began allowing political advertisements</a> that perpetuated election denial of the 2020 election.</p>
<p>Youtube <a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/us-election-misinformation-update-2023/" target="_blank">also changed its policy to allow election misinformation</a>, saying “In the current environment, we find that while removing this content does curb some misinformation, it could also have the unintended effect of curtailing political speech without meaningfully reducing the risk of violence or other real-world harm.”</p>
<p>But there are real-world risks for rampant misinformation, Harper said. Federal investigative agencies have made clear that misinformation narratives that delegitimize past elections <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10106894/" target="_blank">directly contribute</a> to higher risk of political violence.</p>
<p>Platforms with less-well-established trust and safety teams, such Discord and Twitch also play a role. They experienced their “first rodeo” of mass disinformation this election cycle, Harper said.</p>
<p>“They were tested, and I think we’re still evaluating how they did at preventing this content,” he said.</p>
<p>Podcasters and social influencers also increasingly shaped political opinions of their followers this year, often under murky ethical guidelines. Influencers do not follow ethical guidelines and rules for sharing information like journalists do, but Americans <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/fact-sheet/social-media-and-news-fact-sheet/" target="_blank">have increasingly relied on social media</a> for their news.</p>
<p>There’s also a lack of transparency <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91218544/like-seriously-go-vote-influencers-are-getting-paid-to-court-your-vote" target="_blank">between influencers and the political campaigns and candidates </a>they’re speaking about — some have reportedly taken under-the-table payments by campaigns, or have made sponsored content for their followers without disclosing the agreement to viewers.</p>
<p>The Federal Election Commission decided late last year that while campaigns have to disclose spending to an influencer, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/Reg-2013-01-TechMod-Final-Statement-ELW-and-SMB.pdf" target="_blank">influencers do not have to disclose such payments to their audience</a>.</p>
<p>“In terms of kind of the balkanization of the internet, of the information environment, … I think this election cycle may end up being seen kind of as ‘the influencer election,’” Harper said.</p>

(Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Donald Trump, the once-and-future president, holds special animus for people who dare question his statements and actions. At a rally just before Election Day, he placed journalists in the cross-hairs, at least figuratively.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-says-he-wouldnt-mind-if-someone-shot-journalists/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump told rallygoers in Pennsylvania</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it wouldn’t bother him if someone shot the reporters there covering the event. He had mentioned an opening between the panels of bulletproof glass; Trump had faced an assassination attempt during a July rally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don’t mind that so much,” Trump told the crowd. Folks there laughed and shouted howls of approval. Nothing like bloodshed, I suppose, to satisfy the masses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an eight-week period before the election, Trump verbally attacked the media more than 100 times,</span><a href="https://rsf.org/en/usa-trump-verbally-attacked-media-more-100-times-run-election" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Reporters Without Borders noted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That total didn’t even include social media posts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’s recently called journalists</span><a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/11/trump-attack-media-news-lawsuit-fox-news-journalists-first-amendment/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“monsters” and “horrible, horrible, dishonest people.”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (That’s rich coming from the guy who</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-fact-checker-tracked-trump-claims/2021/01/23/ad04b69a-5c1d-11eb-a976-bad6431e03e2_story.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">lied or otherwise uttered misleading statements more than 30,000 times</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in his first term.) He sued CBS News some $10 billion for its editing of a “60 Minutes” interview with Democratic Party nominee Kamala Harris, though such editing is commonplace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disabuse yourself of the notion these are merely routine comments by Trump,</span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/06/politics/what-happens-to-trump-criminal-cases/index.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the nation’s only convicted felon to be voted commander in chief</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Doesn’t he do this all the time? Sure. Have such statements ever </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led to harm? Well …</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Circumstances are different now, since he’ll have sycophants and</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/11/06/whats-next-trump-presidency-policy-changes/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">supreme loyalists staffing his second administration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That’s not like the first term, when he often faced pushback from top advisors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And we all witnessed – in real time and shocking video footage – </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/08/politics/fact-check-trump-january-6/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">how he incited</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a failed insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump’s oft-unhinged rantings matter. His fervent followers could take a directive to attack reporters as a call to (fire)arms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which is exactly the point. He wants journalists looking over their shoulders and focusing on would-be attackers, rather than writing forcefully about Trump’s leadership – including its deficiencies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If we’ve learned one thing about Trump and contemporary authoritarians, we have to take them at their word,” Bruce Shapiro, executive director of the Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma at Columbia University, told me in an interview. “Making the press the enemy of the people is central to the MAGA project.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The president-elect’s words “give permission to people in his movement” to assault others, Shapiro added. “It’s not mere bombast when a ‘joke’ is part of a movement that valorizes violence, that declares people ‘the enemies from within.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This may sound far-fetched to you. But as a member of the profession constantly under siege by a politician who wouldn’t accept his 2020 defeat, and who sees </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">any</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> criticism as a reason to erupt, I don’t take these attacks lightly. Nor do my colleagues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It takes a toll on the journalists” who cover the president, Shapiro said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Committee to Protect Journalists, a nonprofit group based in New York City, reported recently that Trump has mulled strengthening libel laws, weakening First Amendment protections and prosecuting reporters for critical coverage. For a man willing to excoriate anyone, and who wields such a huge megaphone, he has notoriously thin skin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Journalists face this onslaught at a time of shrinking newsroom budgets, fewer local reporters and the</span><a href="https://localnewsinitiative.northwestern.edu/projects/state-of-local-news/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">closing of many publications</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> around the country, CPJ noted. Its interviews with journalists, lawyers, and press freedom advocates “found that media workers are confronting challenges that include an increased risk of </span><a href="https://cpj.org/2023/05/man-fires-shot-at-memphis-television-station/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">violence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://pressfreedomtracker.us/blog/members-of-the-press-charged-with-committing-acts-of-journalism-in-2023/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">arrest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, on- and offline </span><a href="https://cpj.org/2023/08/this-kind-of-behavior-cannot-be-tolerated-police-raid-on-kansas-newspaper-alarms-media-press-freedom-groups/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">harassment,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> legal battles, and </span><a href="https://cpj.org/2023/10/alabama-publisher-reporter-arrested-charged-with-disclosing-leaked-information/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criminalization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joel Simon, director of the Journalism Protection Initiative at the Graduate School of Journalism at City University of New York, noted Trump’s bombast is often used to draw attention to himself, rather than issues that have greater importance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The language can be “incredibly menacing and threatening,” Simon told me, but it also “can be used to manipulate coverage.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s incredibly destructive,” Simon said. “But I don’t think it’s causing journalists to cover him in a different way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relatively few journalists in this country over the past 50 years have been slain because of the stories they were covering, but it does happen. Victims include my onetime associate</span><a href="https://chaunceybaileyproject.org/2011/06/10/chauncey-bailey-murder-justice-has-finally-been-done/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Chauncey Bailey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who worked at the competing daily newspaper in Detroit when we both were reporters there. We chatted about the craft, and we often played basketball together.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://chaunceybaileyproject.org/2011/06/09/commentary-chauncey-bailey-verdict-brings-long-awaited-justice/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bailey was gunned down in 2007 in downtown Oakland</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> while walking to work. He had been reporting on a story about financial problems at a business called Your Black Muslim Bakery. A coalition of local media formed the Chauncey Bailey Project to investigate the death and the police handling of the killing. Eventually, three men were sentenced to prison in the case.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/16/nx-s1-5155054/las-vegas-reporter-murder-official-sentenced" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeff German</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an investigative reporter at the Las Vegas Review-Journal, was stabbed to death in September 2022. He had reported on a hostile workplace environment in the office of Robert Telles, a then-elected official. Telles was sentenced last month to at least 28 years in prison.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump doesn’t need to know reporters personally, but he can still place their lives at risk. His own statements could “nudge” any one of his followers nationwide to commit violence against journalists. He’d also enjoy some plausible deniability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump, one of the most reckless presidents in U.S. history, is rushing headlong into fascism. He enjoys a pliant, spineless Republican Party. After the House of Representatives impeached Trump over Jan. 6, GOP senators whom he placed in jeopardy that day refused to convict him. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He benefits from an overtly partisan Supreme Court majority.</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-trump-capitol-riot-immunity-2dc0d1c2368d404adc0054151490f542" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">It blessed his attempts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this summer to gain broad immunity from prosecution related to his plot to overturn the 2020 election. It was a shocking ruling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My colleagues in the Fourth Estate are one of the few lines of defense left. We’re willing to say when Trump is wrong, lying or violating the Constitution. It’s why the Narcissist-in-Chief has placed a target on our backs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s no accident.</span></p>

Powell said the Fed has decided to cut the benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percent. (Photo by Kent Nishimura/Getty Images)</p><p>The Federal Reserve cut its key rate on Thursday — one of many factors that will decide what kind of economy Americans remember from President Joe Biden’s final days in office and what  President-elect Donald Trump is left with at the start of his second term.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve cut the rate by a quarter of a percentage point, which was in line with economist expectations. The Federal Open Market Committee’s vote was unanimous in favor of the cut. At its <a href="https://marylandmatters.org/2024/09/19/fed-says-long-awaited-rate-cut-is-apolitical-even-close-to-the-presidential-election/" target="_blank">previous meeting</a> in September, the Fed cut the rate by half a percentage point for the first time in four years as inflation continued to show signs of cooling and moved further toward its target rate of 2%.</p>
<p>Chair Jerome Powell said that the job market remains solid, that economic activity has continued to expand, and that consumer spending is resilient. He said inflation is close to the Fed’s 2% goal, at 2.1% in September, and core inflation, which excludes food and energy, is still elevated, at 2.7%.</p>
<p>“We continue to be confident that with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, strength in the economy and labor market can be maintained with inflation moving sustainably down to 2%,” Powell said.</p>
<p>The Fed’s new benchmark rate is 4.5% to 4.75%. It’s the Fed’s second cut since it paused rates last year following an aggressive rate-hiking campaign to tame inflation. The Fed raised rates 11 times between March 2022 and July 2023.</p>
<p>Dante DeAntonio, labor economist at Moody’s Analytics, said the general public probably won’t feel a significant change from an individual rate cut, but he expects that in the medium-term, the cuts will affect housing and consumer spending.</p>
<p>“I think generally speaking we should expect to see rates across the spectrum come down from credit card rates to auto loans to mortgages but that’s not going to happen in a quick way – day-to-day or month-to-month, and it’s not going to make a huge impact,” he said.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics released a less-than-stellar jobs report Friday, showing the labor market added only <a href="https://michiganadvance.com/2024/11/04/final-report-before-presidential-election-shows-just-12000-jobs-added-after-hurricanes-strikes/" target="_blank">12,000 jobs</a>. But Powell said on Thursday that this was mostly reflective of strikes and major hurricanes, and that job growth would have been higher if not for these factors.</p>
<p>Trump’s election on Tuesday could mean substantial changes for the economy and has implications for the Fed’s own policy choices.</p>
<p>If Trump is able to fully enact ideas he floated while campaigning – such as heavy tariffs on imports from China and mass deportation of immigrants, <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/rhetoric-versus-reality-addressing-common-175649927.html" target="_blank">could reduce</a> households’ purchasing power and harm labor supply, some policy experts, researchers and economists say.</p>
<p>Indivar Dutta-Gupta, who focuses on policy research and seminars at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy, said Trump’s immigration policies could result in a large reduction of labor supply.</p>
<p>“The economy has benefited and native-born workers have benefited in recent years from the growth in workers coming in from abroad. One would expect that to slow and potentially net in the other direction,” Dutta-Gupta said.</p>
<p>Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, said that based on what we know now about Trump’s proposals, the Fed will have to contend with an inflationary environment.</p>
<p>“The policies President Trump espoused on the campaign trail, which include higher broad-based tariffs, mass deportation of unauthorized immigrants already in the country, tax cuts that are largely deficit-financed, and the view that the president should have input into the decision making process of the Federal Reserve around interest rates – all of that is inflationary,” he said.</p>
<p>This could mean that in the future, it’s less likely the Fed would continue to cut rates and would potentially raise rates.</p>
<p>“It all depends on whether President Trump follows through on those things he said during the campaign and to what degree and over what period of time. But all of those things are directionally towards higher inflation, which means higher interest rates than otherwise would be the case,” he added.</p>
<p>Trump has talked about the possibility of the president having greater “say” over the Fed’s decisions on the campaign trail. During his first term in office, he was very <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/31/trump-rails-against-powell-day-after-fed-cuts-rates-for-a-third-time-this-year.html" target="_blank">vocal</a> in his displeasure with some of the Fed’s decisions on interest rates.</p>
<p>In October <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-president-should-weigh-not-order-fed-rate-decisions-2024-10-15/" target="_blank">he said</a> that although he should not be able to order the Fed to make the decisions he favors, “I think I have the right to put in comments as to whether or not the interest rates should go up or down.”</p>
<p>Powell responded to questions about a second Trump administration’s effect on the independence of the Fed on Thursday. When asked if the president can demote him or other leadership at the Fed, he said: “Not permitted under the law.”</p>
<p>The Fed is <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/fed-says-its-long-awaited-rate-cut-apolitical-even-close-presidential-election" target="_blank">designed to operate on data</a>, not politics.</p>
<p>Powell said that the election will have no effects on the Fed’s policy decisions in the near term. He added that the Fed doesn’t yet know the timing or policy substance of the incoming administration.</p>
<p>“We don’t guess, we don’t speculate and we don’t assume,” he said.</p>

(Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While many Virginians focused on this year’s congressional and presidential elections, Arlington County became the first locality in Virginia to use ranked-choice voting for city and county governing bodies in the general election Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But three years after a law went into effect giving localities the option to adopt ranked-choice voting, only Arlington County and the city of Charlottesville have adopted the method common in college campus elections by students, and primary elections and conventions by Republicans in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chief concern has been around the lack of education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The biggest obstacles that we face in more localities adopting ranked-choice voting is that it&#8217;s always new, that it&#8217;s a change and I think especially changing the way we vote … in that space is hard,” said Liz White, executive director for UpVote Virginia, which has advocated for ranked-choice voting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arlington County became the first locality to adopt ranked-choice voting for its Democratic primary in June 2023 and again in June 2024. The process allows voters to rank candidates in order of preference, with elections officials reallocating those votes through several rounds of counting ballots.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40746" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:780px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40746" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-06-at-9.36.52 AM.png" alt="" width="780" height="661" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-06-at-9.36.52 AM.png 780w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-06-at-9.36.52 AM-300x254.png 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-06-at-9.36.52 AM-768x651.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A sample ballot in Arlington County shows the candidate options for the first ranked-choice election for a county board seat in a November General Election. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, it was used for an open seat on the Board of Supervisors, which favored veteran JD Spain Sr., a Democrat who won with 58% of the first-choice votes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters&#8217; initial reactions were mixed. Some said they wished they had researched more about the candidates, but one admitted that they only ranked one of the four candidates out of preference. Other voters said they were also pleased to receive guidance about the process from volunteers at their precinct.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I liked it actually because it’s tough when it&#8217;s a binary choice, like one or the other,” said Parker Wood, an Arlington resident. “I think it&#8217;s pretty good. It gives a more accurate distribution of data in terms of (what) people think.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An </span><a href="https://fairvote.org/press/arlington-rcv-poll-24/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">exit survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conducted after the June primary by FairVote, a nonpartisan organization focused on voting reforms, found that 88% of Arlington voters said ranked- choice voting was “easy” and 67% said “they’d like to use it for future elections.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under former Democrat Gov. Ralph Northam, Virginia passed </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+HB1103" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2020 allowing localities to use the election method for city and county governing body elections. But lawmakers will have to consider renewing the legislation before it sunsets on July 1, 2031.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the state law, votes will be counted in each step to determine who wins or who has the least number of votes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advocates say the goal is to reflect the actual majority of the vote. However, some argue that may not be true under single transferable voting, which could allow candidates with minimal support to be elected to office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">White said ranked-choice voting could have been an idea instead of single choice voting in two Democratic primaries this past spring, where more than a dozen candidates vied for seats in the 7th and 10th Congressional Districts held by Abigail Spanberger and Jennifer Wexon, respectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eugene Vindman, an Army veteran, won the 7th District primary with 49% out of seven candidates. However, in the 10th District primary, state Sen. Suhas Subramanyam won with 30.4% of the vote out of 12 candidates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think having more cases in which ranked-choice voting could make a difference is going to help propel a lot of these local conversations forward,” White said, adding that having a ranked choice voting could have helped determine who the majority of voters believe should represent them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In September, the Charlottesville City Council voted to adopt the method starting next year with the City Council primary in June.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sally Hudson, former state delegate and author of the ranked-choice legislation, said at the Sept. 3 meeting that the creation of the state law involved top election law experts and organizations in drafting the legislation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of people have done a lot of careful work over the last four years to get us where we are today,” Hudson told the council. “To use the popular parlance of our time: this ordinance did not just fall out of a coconut tree. We exist in the context of all that came before us, and in Charlottesville, that context goes back centuries.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that meeting, council members agreed to appropriate $26,460 for an educational and outreach program and to purchase equipment for ranked-choice voting tabulation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a second vote to adopt the election method, Council Member Lloyd Snook voted in opposition, citing concerns that a voter’s second selection could be devalued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, Snook recommended a sequential instant runoff system, claiming it could be a better alternative. Under the single transferable voting method, he disagreed that candidates who won would reflect the true majority of the vote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Although I completely agree with the notion of ranked choice voting, and would be really quite pleased to do it under a sequential, instant runoff voting system, I think most folks that I&#8217;ve talked to don&#8217;t understand how single transferable voting will actually work in terms of what that allocation looks like,” Snook said at the Sept. 3 meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, White said that’s not the case because “voting for multiple candidates is a means to an end to achieve proportional representation.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think without understanding the why of proportional representation, it just feels like we took away one of your votes,&#8221; White said. &#8220;I understand that&#8217;s an adjustment, but the idea is to ensure that every voter is represented.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers have sought to </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=SB1380" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expand</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the law to presidential primaries, but it failed in 2023.</span></p>

(Ian Stewart/For The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday afternoon, standing next to outgoing Mayor Levar Stoney in front of City Hall, Dr. Danny Avula laid out his vision for Richmond and his administration, after emerging as the leading candidate in the city’s mayoral race. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avula racked up </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">44,832 votes, or </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">46%, the most of any candidate, and won in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 7th districts, according to unofficial results from the Department of Elections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avula, the former director of the Richmond and Henrico Health Districts, said he plans to assemble his transition team and, once in office, start a search to hire a new chief administrative officer. He added that he is looking forward to working with current elected officials as well as Richmond’s newly-elected city council and school board members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Almost everybody I&#8217;ve talked to in the last 24 hours have expressed such an amazing willingness to work together, to do whatever they absolutely can to protect the rights and freedoms of Richmonders,” he said. “I&#8217;m very, very excited to work with those bodies moving forward for the good of our city.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He referenced Tuesday’s presidential election, which resulted in Republican Donald Trump winning a second term in the White House, and how it may impact Richmond. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think many of us are concerned justifiably about what that means for our city moving forward,” Avula said. “Members of our LGBTQ plus community, our Black and Brown and immigrant families, for working families, there&#8217;s a lot of concerns about what the shifts at the national level mean for us.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concerning his planned national search for someone to replace current Chief Administrative Officer Lincoln Saunders, Avula said he’s looking for a person who understands complex administrations and can navigate possible issues with federal funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think the reality of what&#8217;s happening at the federal level will mean changes in the funding that may be coming to us,” he said. “It will mean us needing to work more closely than ever with the state and with our federal partners to make sure that we&#8217;re drawing resources into the city.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avula faced off against four other candidates. Michelle Mosby, who finished the race as his closest contender with 25.4% of votes, conceded and congratulated Avula Wednesday morning. Harrison Roday, who earned 13.03%, also conceded Wednesday morning. Candidates Adreas Addison and Maurice Neblett garnered 11.92% and 2.94%, respectively. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Elections has not finished certifying Tuesday’s election, and is still in the process of counting provisional ballots, according to their </span><a href="https://enr.elections.virginia.gov/results/public/richmond-city/elections/2024NovemberGeneral" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

<p>Vindman and Anderson earned about 51% and 49% of the vote, respectively. The race had remained<a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/06/virginias-7th-congressional-district-race-remains-too-close-to-call/"> too close to call Tuesday</a> after polls closed at 7 p.m. and for a majority of Wednesday.</p>
<p>“In my 25 years of military service, and when we were jumping out of airplanes, it didn’t matter to me the color creed, background, race, or party affiliation of the person next to me,” said Vindman in a statement declaring victory Tuesday night, before the official call. “What mattered was getting the mission done. That’s the type of service I am going to take to Washington as the next Congressman from Virginia’s 7th Congressional District.”</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Anderson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the AP’s declaration. On Thursday, Anderson acknowledged the race&#8217;s outcome in a <a href="https://x.com/DerrickforVA/status/1854630437630488990" target="_blank">post</a> on X: &#8220;<span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">Earlier today I called (Vindman) </span>to concede the race. I expect him to do everything in his power in Congress to make life better for the people of this district.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 7th District seat went up for grabs after incumbent Abigail Spanberger, a Democrat, announced she would run for governor. In 2021, the year before voters in the 7th elected Spanberger, more of the district voted for Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin than his Democratic opponent, former Gov. Terry McAuliffe.</p>
<p>Spanberger, in a statement Tuesday, congratulated Vindman on a “well-earned victory,” adding he will, “bring the values, work ethic, and commitment to public service that the Seventh District deserves.”</p>
<p>Though the men hold similar backgrounds through their military service, the race between Vindman and Anderson largely focused on their policy differences.</p>

<p>Vindman voiced strong support for protecting reproductive health rights, easing Virginians’ economic pain by continuing to lower medication costs, and strengthening the nation’s borders.</p>
<p>Anderson supported reducing taxes and immigration reform in his campaign, and said abortion rights are best left up to states. He mirrored several of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s policy stances.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican officials in Virginia celebrated the former president’s national victory, hailing it as a mandate for their party’s agenda. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The American people have spoken overwhelmingly to return common sense, strength, and leadership back to the White House. Through the Trump presidency, we will pave the way for an economic revival, a secure border, and a stronger America on the world stage,” Gov. Glenn Youngkin said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin did not comment on </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/05/harris-triumphs-over-trump-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris’s victory in Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Democrat defeated Trump by a 5-point margin, winning 51.8% to Trump’s 46.5%, a spread of nearly 225,000 votes from a total of about 4.3 million cast, according to unofficial data from the Virginia Department of Elections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump claimed victory nationwide by securing 292 electoral votes to Harris’s 224, also winning the popular vote by a 4.8 million margin — the first Republican nominee to do so since President George W. Bush won reelection in 2004.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Democrats, on the other hand, remained largely silent in the immediate aftermath of Tuesday’s election.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the few party leaders to address Virginians directly within hours after the Associated Press </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/06/dc/ap-former-president-donald-trump-wins-second-term/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">called the race</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for Trump was Virginia House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, who despite the Democrats’ defeat in the race for the White House and the U.S. Senate expressed optimism about his state and how Democrats and Republicans can work together at the state level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All politics are local, and I think we&#8217;ve begun to see that here in Virginia,” Scott told reporters outside the state capital in Richmond on Wednesday afternoon. “I think Virginians expect us to do everything that we can to protect their freedoms, and then to work where we can, with the governor and with the federal government.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in reference to some voter demographics and polarizing factors about Trump as a candidate, he said “I think we learned some lessons about what’s acceptable and unacceptable for whole lot of American people.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats and activists have continually stressed concern over Trump’s rhetoric that often disparages people of color, immigrants and women. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think the country made a bet on Donald Trump that some of the things that he has said he didn’t mean, and they’re going to trust him,” Scott said. “I hope they’re right, because we want him to be successful, because it’s good for the entire country.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The economy was “a huge issue” during the 2024 election cycle, Scott added as a reason some Virginia voters turned to Trump. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think inflation is real. There are people who still feel some pain around inflation. Even though inflation is down, prices are down, we’re back moving in the right direction… I think that that message didn’t resonate with voters, and I think that ended up hurting us at some point,” he said. </span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., whose seat was not up for reelection this year, said that he was committed to “working with President-elect Trump to get things done for Virginians, just as I did during his first term.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Americans made their choice on Tuesday, and while it wasn’t my favored candidate, I respect the democratic process and the outcome of this election,” Warner said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Democratic leaders had anticipated a strong showing for Harris in the state, but her smaller-than-expected margin of victory reflects a shift in Virginia’s political landscape, particularly in rural areas that saw increased GOP turnout, political analysts say. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Virginia and nationally, red areas became more red and blue areas became less blue nearly everywhere,” said Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump’s obvious liabilities — his felony convictions, his chaotic administration and rhetoric driven by his white-hot anger — didn’t seem to matter to voters who were in a mood to reject the status quo, Farnsworth said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the commonwealth, where abortion was protected by existing state law, the abortion issue was less relevant. In a number of states where abortion was on the ballot, abortion measures were far more popular than the Democratic candidates who supported them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And voters were clearly unhappy with the Biden administration&#8217;s record, particularly as it related to economic anxiety, the border and racial and cultural politics, Farnsworth added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The national dimensions of this frustration were seen in all areas — nearly everywhere we saw that Harris won by less or lost by more than Biden did four years ago.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Republicans hailed Trump’s victory as a win for the commonwealth while remaining silent on the former president’s defeat in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Minority Leader Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, said in a statement that Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, will return to Washington with “a clear mandate” from the American people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Across Virginia, and indeed the entire nation, voters shifted to the right in record numbers. Working class Americans stood up and said they&#8217;re tired of being told the economy is fine, and that they should just buy off brand peanut butter to deal with inflation,” Gilbert said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Groups long “taken for granted by the left” rejected claims that their schools are fine and their children are safe in their communities, he added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Tens of millions of Americans decided they’d had enough of being called Nazis for simply having a different political opinion. Americans will no longer ignore what they can see right in front of them, no matter how much Democrats insist that reality is wrong.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rich Anderson, the chairman of the Republican Party, said that he was pleased with the results both nationally and in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re obviously pleased with the national race, the American people have spoken and President Trump has been reelected to a second term,” Anderson said in a phone interview Wednesday. “Here in Virginia, he did not carry it, but we worked very hard and took the 10.1% lead that Biden had in 2020 and shaved it down to just under 6% this year. I feel very good about that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">None of the “swings of the party pendulums” happen in a revolutionary way, Anderson added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s usually evolutionary, and we’re now in the process of trying to take that pendulum and swing it as far and as fast as possible back toward the right.” </span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most Republicans, however, limited their post-election commentary to social media, offering a mix of reflection and Monday-morning quarterbacking with a hint of ridicule. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It looks like over 300 electoral votes, the popular vote, taking the Senate and keeping the House, and gosh, who could have predicted that calling over half of the country a bunch of bigoted misogynists if they didn’t vote for your candidate wasn’t a good campaign strategy? Who could have predicted that?” Del. Nick Freitas, R-Culpeper, a social media influencer, told his 1.3 million Instagram followers <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DCCJJQ7uY4z/?igsh=MWN3MnV3MjQyZWFkbw==" target="_blank">in a video</a> he posted Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, state Sen. Glen Sturtevant, R-Chesterfield, asked for suggestions for “some of the action items for Virginia as we move forward” from the 2024 election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Identify the 200k Virginia Biden voters who didn’t show up for Harris. Figure out what’s going on with some of the pollsters that appear to have been completely divorced from reality,” Sturtevant listed among his own action items. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Susan Swecker, the chairwoman of the Democratic Party of Virginia, declined to comment Wednesday, stating that she was waiting for Harris to address the American people later on Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But DPVA spokeswoman Kelsey Carolan said that Virginia Democrats fared well in the presidential election compared to other eastern states — despite Republican gains across the board. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carolan cited election data from Connecticut, where Trump gained 8.9% of voters compared to 2020, New York (10.6%), New Jersey (10.9%) and Maryland (10.3%).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Virginia, Trump currently has a gain of 4.8%” Carolan said. “That is the most apples-to-apples analysis, because all of these states are states where neither campaign spent money on TV ads. This was a wave election and we’ve held our own.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few Democratic lawmakers  took their post-election sorrows to social media. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a </span><a href="https://x.com/jackie4norfolk/status/1854158831162454269" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lengthy thread</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on X, Del. Jackie Glass, D-Norfolk, said that Tuesday evening reminded her of the night when Trump was first elected eight years ago. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">She recalled how her then 10-year-old son asked her if his Latino and Hispanic classmates in school might be &#8220;taken away.&#8221; She added that she had once again woken up with a &#8220;familiar sense of dread.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Glass still left her fellow Democrats with a message of hope and optimism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Grab your pen, your pocketbook, your protest sign, your petition, and above all, your purpose. Remember, we are Lovers — no matter who we love, where we’ve been, or how we’ve lived. And if there’s one thing I know as a woman and a mother, it’s this: Lovers make the best fighters. Let’s fight for Virginia. Let’s go.”</span></p>

<p dir="ltr">Trump led with 267 Electoral College votes overall nationally, eclipsing Democratic nominee Vice President Harris’ 224, just before 3 a.m. Eastern, according to the AP. A total of 270 votes are needed to win.</p>

<h4 dir="ltr">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump promises to ‘heal’</h4>

	</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Trump amassed electoral votes shortly after polls closed in states forecast in his favor, and picked up critical wins in key battlegrounds when the AP projected victories for him in <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://ncnewsline.com/2024/11/05/ap-trump-wins-north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">North Carolina</a> just before midnight, <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2024/11/06/after-bitter-defeat-in-2020-trump-comes-back-to-win-georgia-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">Georgia</a> at about 1 a.m., and <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://penncapital-star.com/election-2024/donald-trump-projected-to-win-pennsylvanias-19-electoral-votes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">Pennsylvania</a> just before 2:30 a.m. Trump won the key states in his successful 2016 campaign but lost them in his failed reelection bid in 2020.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Speaking to his supporters in West Palm Beach, Florida, Trump thanked “thousands of friends in this incredible movement like nobody’s ever seen before.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Frankly, this was, I believe, the greatest political movement of all time. There&#8217;s never been anything like this in this country,” Trump said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump promised to “heal” the country and that his second presidency “will truly be the golden age of America.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We overcame obstacles that nobody thought possible,” Trump said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">During his roughly 25-minute speech, Trump thanked his family and campaign staff, and invited his running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, and Dana White, CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship, to speak on stage.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Vance, poised to become Trump’s vice president, said a new administration would usher in an economic “comeback” for the U.S.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I think we just witnessed the greatest political comeback in the history of the United States of America,” Vance said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">White thanked popular podcast host Joe Rogan for his election eve endorsement of Trump.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This is what happens when the machine comes after you,” White said. “This is karma, ladies and gentlemen.”</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Harris to speak Wednesday</h4>

	</h4>
<p dir="ltr">As election night turned into early Wednesday, the previously energetic crowd at Howard <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/harris-watch-party-dc-hope-gives-way-anxiety" target="_blank">started to dwindle</a>. Once campaign co-chair Cedric Richmond announced Harris would not be speaking at the party, the last stragglers left in waves, the mood quickly souring.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Richmond said that Harris would address supporters and the nation later Wednesday, and tried to give a small pep talk.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We still have votes to count,” he said. “We still have states that have not been called yet.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">In reference to reports that Harris’ watch party had begun to wind down, Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt commented on X “sounds like joy has left the building…” The word “joy” was a rallying cry among the Harris camp and supporters during her whirlwind campaign.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Billionaire Elon Musk, a major funder and surrogate for the Trump campaign, posted on his platform X a photo of a launching rocket ship along with the words, “The future is gonna be fantastic.” Shortly before that he posted a photoshopped image of himself hauling a sink into the Oval Office with the message, “Let that sink in.”</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘I don’t feel as hopeful’</h4>

	</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Harris had planned to spend election night at her alma mater, Howard University in Washington, D.C., where her supporters gathered, but she never left from the vice president’s residence at the Naval Observatory, according to press pool reports.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Early in the evening, Lalika Gerald, a Howard graduate from 2005, remembers studying TV production in the library that is now overlooking an election night rally for potentially the first Black woman to lead the country.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It’s a very exciting time just to be here and to know that a Bison like myself is about to be our president,” she said, referring to the university’s mascot.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The 41-year-old from Prince George’s County, Maryland, said she has felt a roller coaster of emotions throughout the day.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“As excited and as hopeful as I am, you know you never know what might happen,” she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a moment for us to be really seen.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">By the time the event ended around 1 a.m., Harris supporters’ said the hope they felt at the start of the evening had left.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I don’t know what’s happening, but it’s very stressful right now,” Liane Crosey said as she left the watch party. “Seeing the numbers coming in, I don’t feel as hopeful.”</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A convicted felon in the Oval Office</h4>

	</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Trump is positioned to make history as the first-ever <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2024/05/30/breaking-trump-found-guilty-on-34-felony-counts-in-ny-hush-money-trial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">convicted</a> felon elected to the presidency. His long presidential campaign tangled with a busy legal calendar that included two federal cases, still <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://missouriindependent.com/2024/10/03/special-counsel-jack-smith-reveals-new-evidence-against-trump-in-2020-election-case/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">ongoing</a>, and cases in Georgia and New York. The former president was convicted in New York in May on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to hush money paid to a porn star ahead of the 2016 election. His sentencing is scheduled for Nov. 26.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump ascended on the campaign trail despite facing federal felony charges for scheming to overturn the 2020 presidential election.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Four years ago, Trump refused to concede to Biden in 2020 and lost dozens of court cases challenging the results.</p>
<p dir="ltr">His repetition of the lie that the 2020 was “stolen” from him became a main feature of his campaign rallies in 2024.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The major policy area he focused on during the campaign was curtailing immigration, and he promised to conduct mass deportations of immigrants in the country illegally. Trump and Vance also targeted legal immigrants, including by amplifying the debunked rumor that Haitians with Temporary Protected Status in Springfield, Ohio, were eating pets.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump also pledged to ramp up tariffs, taxes on goods produced overseas, in an effort to boost U.S. manufacturing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump and campaign officials tried to distance the candidate from a comprehensive conservative policy blueprint written by the Heritage Foundation, a Washington think tank. The plan calls for restructuring the federal government to empower the president, further restricting abortion access and limiting immigration, among other proposals.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump would likely enjoy friendly lawmakers in Washington over the next two years, as Republicans were <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/republicans-take-majority-control-us-senate-after-ohio-west-virginia-victories" target="_blank">projected to win</a> control of the U.S. Senate. Control of the House remained unknown early Wednesday,</p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite several U.S. House races remaining too close to call, Republican Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana issued a written statement declaring “There is hope and morning in America again!”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Donald Trump is now our President-elect, chosen by the American people for such a time as this. The citizens of our great country used their voices to decisively reject four more years of Harris’ open borders, high crime, increased cost of living, weaponized government, dangerous radical woke ideology, and weakness on the world stage &#8211; demanding instead, a return to common sense, peace, and prosperity,” Johnson said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump is not officially president-elect until election results are certified.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">In the states</h4>

	</h4>
<p dir="ltr">States Newsroom journalists fanned out across the country Tuesday, talking to voters outside churches, community centers, schools and courthouses, where the presidential race not only weighed on their minds, but congressional contests and ballot initiatives as well.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Voter Stephanie Capps in Raleigh, <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://ncnewsline.com/briefs/election-day-in-battleground-nc-voters-reflect-on-history-and-the-future-theyd-like-to-see/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">North Carolina</a>, said she brought her 9-year-old daughter to the polls to show her democracy in action.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Because a little over 100 years ago, women couldn’t vote,” Capps told NC Newsline. “And so, we talked about how it’s really important for her to learn to vote.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The presidential campaigns continued to hit swing states, speak to the press and issue statements reminding voters of their rights.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Harris stayed in Washington, D.C, where she called in to several radio shows in battleground states. According to her campaign, she was a guest on Power 99 in Philadelphia with Cappuchino and KDKA NewsRadio in Pittsburgh with Larry Richert, the Big Tigger Morning Show in Atlanta, Georgia and Foxy 107.2 with Karen Clark in Raleigh, North Carolina.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I’m proud to have a lot of support out of Pittsburgh, it’s a historic city,” Harris <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://x.com/KDKARadio/status/1853814481379266648" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">told</a> Richert, who asked about her 10 campaign visits to the western Pennsylvania city.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, stopped in Harrisburg, <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://penncapital-star.com/election-2024/election-day-2024-live/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">Pennsylvania</a>, Tuesday where he spoke to supporters and volunteers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Walz told reporters after the event “I think the choice couldn’t be starker.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/113432133120615756" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">posted</a> video messages on his platform Truth Social throughout Tuesday reminding voters to remain in line if they arrive before polls close.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Republicans, we’re doing very well. Stay on line, don’t get off line, and vote. Make sure you get through and vote. We’re gonna have a big victory tonight,” Trump said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Biden, who was the presumed Democratic nominee until he dropped his reelection bid and endorsed Harris just over 100 days ago, did not make any public appearances Tuesday.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">City of Richmond residents appear to have selected Dr. Danny Avula as their new mayor, according to unofficial results from the </span><a href="https://enr.elections.virginia.gov/results/public/richmond-city/elections/2024NovemberGeneral" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Department of Elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All the precincts were fully reported just after midnight by VDOE, where Avula came in with 44,832 votes, which was 46% of the votes overall. His closest rival was Michelle Mosby, who had 24,798 or just over 25% of the votes. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When current Mayor Levar Stoney was elected in 2020, he carried enough of the majority in the districts to win outright, having 37.7% or 41,145 votes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to results from </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/electionresults/20201103/local-election-1409/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VPAP</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avula, the former director for the </span><a href="https://dannyformayor.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond and Henrico Health Districts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is now poised to be the city’s first-ever mayor of Indian descent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per Virginia law, Avula had to win five out of the nine city districts. By 12:45 a.m. Wednesday, he had won the 1st, 2nd and 4th districts; and won the majority in the 3rd and 5th districts – which is not a full five district win. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday just before 11 a.m., Avula posted his thanks to Richmond voters and his family on X, formerly Twitter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “I am incredibly humbled and honored by your confidence in me, and I hope you’ll continue to share your ideas and experience with me going forward. My door and inbox is always open,&#8221; he wrote. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s going to take all of us, but together we will build a Richmond where everyone’s rights are protected, where everyone has the opportunity to thrive, and where no gets left behind. Thank you, and let’s get to work.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of Avula’s biggest priorities for his term include expanding the number of affordable housing for low-income residents, with a target goal of helping those who earn $50,000 or less a year. He pledged on his website to demand transparent decision making from the leaders of City Hall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Candidate Michelle Mosby came in a close second, winning both the 8th and 9th Districts, while sliding in just behind Avula in many of the other districts.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other goals Avula wants to achieve include installing more tree coverage to help combat heat islands, which are areas where heat indexes are higher due to a lack of trees; build more sidewalks in majority Black and Hispanic neighborhoods and collaborate with the school board and school superintendent to help support students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this year’s Richmond mayoral election, the five candidates knocked on doors, held fundraisers and gave their views during a </span><a href="https://www.12onyourside.com/2024/09/09/richmond-mayoral-candidate-forum-schedule-announced/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fistful of debates and forums</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — including one at </span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/local-news/richmond/armstrong-high-school-students-to-moderate-first-of-its-kind-richmond-mayoral-debate/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Armstrong High School</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in which Armstrong students moderated the event. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All the candidates expressed strong views on </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/16/richmond-mayor-candidates-ideas-on-housing-and-how-the-state-can-help-the-city/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">housing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, after the city council passed a resolution in 2023 declaring a housing crisis in the region, but approached the topic of how to secure more affordable housing differently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addison rallied for the city to put the state’s 2020 land tax law to use, which allows property to be taxed by the land and not the structure built on it. Mosby </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/16/richmond-mayor-candidates-ideas-on-housing-and-how-the-state-can-help-the-city/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">called for</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the creation of an Affordable Housing Strike Team composed of department leaders who sign off on housing developments who would report directly to the mayor’s office in an effort to “cut through the red tape and get affordable housing projects completed as quickly as possible,” Mosby said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roday had also signaled a desire to expedite the building permit process, while he and Avula pitched creating boards to advise the city on housing policy. Avula also suggested strengthening the Office of Community Wealth Building with an aim to help low-income Richmonders be empowered to secure higher incomes. Most of the candidates outlined plans to support public housing residents, and many supported the idea of continuing the locality’s existing partnerships with housing-focused nonprofits that help Virginians achieve homeownership and find affordable places to live. </span></p>

(Photos courtesy of candidates' campaigns)</p><p><em>Updated Nov. 6 at 11:20 a.m.</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The voters of the 7th Congressional district proved just how tight the contest is, by keeping the race between Eugene Vindman and Derrick Anderson too close to call.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 99% of votes had been counted, with Vindman and Anderson earning about 51% and 49% of the vote, respectively, but by 10 a.m. Wednesday,  the Associated Press had still not confirmed a winner. </span></p>
<p>“In my 25 years of military service, and when we were jumping out of airplanes, it didn’t matter to me the color creed, background, race, or party affiliation of the person next to me,&#8221; said Vindman in a statement declaring victory, despite the uncertainty of the outcome. &#8220;What mattered was getting the mission done. That’s the type of service I am going to take to Washington as the next Congressman from Virginia’s 7th Congressional District.”</p>
<p>“We knew this was going to be a tight race, folks,” Anderson said in a video <a href="https://x.com/DerrickforVA/status/1854006484184551766" target="_blank">posted</a> on his X account at 10:42 p.m., before later <a href="https://x.com/DerrickforVA/status/1854016079905124787" target="_blank">posting</a> the race was &#8220;too close to call.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to keep looking, we&#8217;re going to keep watching,&#8221; Anderson said. &#8220;I just ask y&#8217;all give us a little more time and we&#8217;re going to get through this thing.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seat went up for grabs after incumbent Abigail Spanberger, a Democrat, announced she would run for governor. In 2021, the year before voters in the 7th elected Spanberger, more of the district voted for Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin than his Democratic opponent former Gov. Terry McAuliffe.</span></p>
<p>Spanberger, in a statement Tuesday, congratulated Vindman on a &#8220;well-earned victory,&#8221; adding he will, &#8220;bring the values, work ethic, and commitment to public service that the Seventh District deserves.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the men hold similar backgrounds through their military service, the race between Vindman and Anderson largely focused on their policy differences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman voiced strong support for protecting reproductive health rights, easing Virginians’ economic pain by continuing to lower medication costs, and strengthening the nation’s borders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson supported reducing taxes and immigration reform in his campaign, and said abortion rights are best left up to states. He mirrored several of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s policy stances.</span></p>
<p>We will update this story with the race outcome as soon as it is confirmed.</p>

<p><em>Updated Nov. 6, 6:15 p.m.</em></p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, staved off Democratic challenger Missy Cotter Smasal to win a second term representing Virginia&#8217;s 2nd Congressional District.</p>
<p>With a 4-point sustained lead by nearly 6 p.m on Wednesday, the Associated Press called the race for Kiggans almost 24 hours after polls closed on Election Day.</p>
<p>In a post to X earlier in the day before the race had officially been called in her favor, Kiggans posted that she was grateful her district has &#8220;once again chosen commonsense conservatism.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Together we will get our country back on the right track and secure America’s success,&#8221; she added.</p>
<div>
<p>The Virginia Beach-anchored district has oscillated between political parties in congressional representation in recent years, with former Democratic  Rep. Elaine Luria ousting Republican Rep. Scott Taylor in 2018, followed by Kiggans ousting Luria in 2022. Smasal had hoped to flip the red district back to blue this year.</p>
<p>In addition to Virginia Beach, the district includes Chesapeake, Suffolk, Isle of Wight and Virginia’s Eastern Shore. Though a primary role of congressional representatives includes securing federal funding for local and state government to use, candidates’ plans to address national issues also featured prominently in the election this year, <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/02/kiggans-and-smasal-face-off-in-highly-competitive-2nd-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/02/kiggans-and-smasal-face-off-in-highly-competitive-2nd-district/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1730958278931000&amp;usg=AOvVaw17jleutQiIn5Gup30WVwfH">such as reducing inflation and reproductive rights.</a></p>
<p>A swingy district, the seat was seen as crucial for determining partisan control of the U.S. House of Delegates. Smasal had the <a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/virginia-congress-smasal-kiggans-hakeem-jeffries/article_955a0eac-d5bc-11ee-99ea-4f07936040ca.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsement of House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-New York</a> — likely the next House Speaker should Democrats flip the chamber. Meanwhile, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana came to Virginia to boost Kiggans and she had appeared at a <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/28/trump-rallies-in-chesapeake-backed-by-virginia-governor-gop-leaders/">rally for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump</a> over the summer.</p>
<p>In a statement Wednesday night, Smasal conceded the race and thanked supporters.</p>
<p>&#8220;To our voters, I’m sorry that we did not win the day, but I’m so thankful for your hard work and support.  I carry your stories and experiences with me every day, and I am grateful for your trust and teamwork throughout this journey,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The countless doors we knocked on, the phone calls we made, and our unwavering commitment to truth and justice in the face of extremism are evidence of our resolve and patriotism.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With 98% of votes counted, the Associated Press <a href="https://apnews.com/projects/election-results-2024/virginia/?r=0" target="_blank">called</a> the presidential contest in Virginia for Vice President Kamala Harris, giving her the state&#8217;s 13 Electoral College votes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris’ win continues a blue streak that began with Barack Obama’s win here in 2008. She garnered 51.9% of Virginia’s votes and won handily in the state’s large metro areas, carrying 56.6% in Northern Virginia&#8217;s Loudoun County, 82.1% in Richmond and 70% in Norfolk down in Hampton Roads, according to the AP. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has chosen Democratic candidates in the last four presidential elections: Obama earned 52.3% of Virginia’s votes in 2008; in 2012, 51.5% of Virginia voters helped re-elect Obama; Hilary Clinton won by 49.7% in the state in 2016; and Joe Biden swept the state with 54.1% of votes in 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris prioritized reproductive health care access, gun reform, addressing inflation and expanding voting access during her months on the campaign trail. Her campaign launched a national reproductive health care bus tour in the final weeks before the election, which made </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/harris-walz-fighting-for-reproductive-freedom-bus-tour-coming-to-virginia-this-week/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">several stops in Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in Richmond, Virginia Beach and Northern Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican former President Donald Trump focused on immigration, the economy, foreign policy issues including the Israel-Hamas war and Ukraine-Russia conflict, and election security during his reelection campaign, while facing mounting civil and criminal lawsuits. The </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/10/21/central-park-five-lawsuit-trump/75778337007/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most recent suit </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">was lodged against Trump on Oct. 21 by the Central Park Five, five men who were exonerated in the rape and assault of a New York woman in the 1980s, for Trump’s false claims during the ABC News presidential debate in September that the group pled guilty to the crime and that someone was killed in connection to it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A former prosecutor, California attorney general and U.S. senator, Harris is the daughter of immigrant parents and the first woman to serve as America’s vice president, and the first Black and Asian person to be vice president.</span></p>

Tim Kaine, D-Va., defeated Republican Hung Cao on Nov. 5, winning a third term. (Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., on Tuesday secured a decisive victory over his Republican challenger Hung Cao that earned him a third term on Capitol Hill. Kaine defeated Cao, a retired U.S. Navy captain, with 53-47% of the votes, according to unofficial numbers from the Virginia Department of Elections. The Associated Press called the race at roughly 11:20 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his re-election campaign, Kaine consistently championed the policies of President Joe Biden, aligning himself with key legislative achievements that he argued were vital for Virginia’s growth and prosperity, including the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, a $1.2 trillion package that has been heralded as a major win for modernizing America’s transportation and infrastructure systems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine also is an avid supporter of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which he has repeatedly hailed as a crucial step toward addressing economic and environmental concerns. The act aims to reduce the deficit, tackle rising inflation and lower healthcare costs, while also making historic investments in clean energy and climate change mitigation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the year, Kaine emphasized how these measures would benefit Virginians, from creating jobs in infrastructure to supporting the state’s transition to renewable energy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think ‘make, build, grow’ is the right message. We make it here, we build it here, we grow it here,” Kaine told The Mercury in a recent interview. “That takes advantage of the bills that we passed, but it also is a reflection of the fact that manufacturing jobs are up, we are doing infrastructure in a major way, so why not lean into what is actually happening on the ground?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pre-election polls had consistently shown Kaine, a Harvard-educated lawyer, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/harris-kaine-ahead-in-virginia-by-comfortable-margins-new-poll-says/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">leading</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by double-digit points, reflecting his enduring popularity in the commonwealth, where he previously served as governor, lieutenant governor and Richmond’s mayor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cao, who won his party’s nomination during a five-way primary election on June 18, ran a spirited campaign that focused on conservative values like curbing government spending and bolstering national defense. Cao also supported former President Donald Trump’s sweeping proposal to deport all undocumented immigrants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While his background as a Vietnamese immigrant and military veteran brought a unique perspective to the race, despite Trump’s endorsement Cao struggled to overcome Kaine’s strong name recognition and deep ties to Virginia’s electorate — and, at times, his own rhetorical fumbles on the stump. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cao’s campaign marked the Republican’s second attempt at running for public office. In 2022, he unsuccessfully challenged U.S. Rep. Jennifer Wexton, D-Loudoun County, in Virginia’s 10th Congressional District, losing by 53-47%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even before seizing the Republican nomination for one of Virginia’s two seats in the U.S. Senate, Cao often found himself stumbling over his own remarks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a conservative podcast in May, Cao pushed back against allegations in a story published by the Staunton News Leader that the political action committee he had launched to support Republican candidates in 2023 mostly benefited his own Senate bid, </span><a href="https://www.newsleader.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/05/22/cao-says-he-didnt-promise-super-pac-money-to-virginia-2023-candidates/73792102007/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">calling the allegations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “a hit job” and referring to the News Leader as a “podunk local newspaper.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cao also suggested that it was “ridonkulous” to drive from his home in Purcellville to Abingdon for a campaign forum, and also appeared to grapple with Virginia geography </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/07/19/senate-candidate-cao-says-that-anything-south-of-loudon-and-fairfax-is-southern-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">when he told</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Brian Kilmeade of Fox News in July that “anything south of Loudoun and Fairfax is Southern Virginia.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And at their sole </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/07/kaine-faces-off-against-gop-challenger-cao-in-high-stakes-u-s-senate-race/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">candidates debate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Norfolk State University, Cao’s attempts at articulating his policy platform were overshadowed by his remarks suggesting that the Navy uses drag queens as recruitment tools and his stereotyping of Asians as being good with math. </span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland, on Tuesday prevailed in his bid to become the next congressman to represent Virginia’s 5th Congressional District after defeating Democrat Gloria Witt in a contentious race marked by internal Republican turmoil. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the infighting that erupted after McGuire unseated incumbent Rep. Bob Good, R-Farmville, in the June 18 primary election, McGuire managed to unite enough of the party’s base to win Tuesday’s general election with 56-43.5% of the votes, according to unofficial numbers by the Virginia Department of elections</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Associated Press called the race at 10:58 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire, a former U.S. Navy SEAL who announced his bid for the Republican nomination in the 5th District just one week after winning his seat in the 10th state Senate District — a move that angered many of his fellow Republicans in the district — overcame months of tension between his supporters and loyalists of Good, who had held the seat since 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A staunch conservative with deep backing from religious and hardline right-wing groups, Good lost the GOP nomination to McGuire in a heated primary that was one of the most expensive and most watched nomination contests nationwide this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The loss led to a fractured Republican base, with some of Good’s supporters initially refusing to back McGuire and vowing to write in the incumbent, who became nationally known for his role in ousting former Speaker Kevin McCarthy and as the chairman of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, McGuire’s strong conservative platform on issues like gun rights, economic growth and national security — and his endorsement by former President Donald Trump, who disavowed Good after the congressman openly backed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ presidential bid — resonated with voters in the 5th District, Virginia’s largest. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But McGuire’s victory over Witt was by a much smaller margin than Good’s 56-42% win against Democrat Josh Throneburg two years ago — a fact that the ousted incumbent will likely seize on if he decides to seek the Republican nomination again in 2026. </span></p>

Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, has defeated Republican nominee Mike Clancy in Virginia’s 10th Congressional District race, according to The Associated Press. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subramanyam, a former tech policy adviser to former President Barack Obama, had said if elected, he will advocate for federal funding for Virginia infrastructure projects, which the district’s current representative, Democrat Jennifer Wexton, also pursued. Subramanyam has also vowed to help keep the federal government open to avoid shutdowns that impact federal government employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wexton, who endorsed Subramanyam, is </span><a href="https://wexton.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=854" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">retiring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the end of the year after being diagnosed with a severe neurological disorder.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I am honored and humbled that the people of Virginia’s 10th District put their trust in me to take on the toughest fights and deliver results in Congress,&#8221; said Subramanyam in a statement. &#8220;This district is my home. I got married here, my wife Miranda and I are raising our daughters here, and the issues our community faces are personal to our family. It is an honor to continue serving this district in Washington.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past three congressional elections, Democrats have maintained control of the district, even after it was redrawn to include the counties of Loudoun, Fauquier and Rappahannock, the cities of Manassas and Manassas Park, and parts of Prince William and Fairfax counties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the campaign, Clancy faced criticism for his alleged ties to  Project 2025, a conservative playbook for running the country that proposed eliminating the jobs of federal government workers and contractors. Although Clancy admitted to previously donating to the Heritage Foundation, which authored Project 2025, he denied that he supported the plan, and ran on issues with the economy, parental rights, and public safety.</span></p>

Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, on Tuesday easily won reelection in Virginia’s 9th Congressional District, which he has represented since 2011. The Republican incumbent fended off a challenge by Democratic Karen Baker in a race that centered on health care access and representation in the largely rural, mountainous region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Associated Press called the race at 9:17 p.m. as Griffith led Baker with 73.5%-26.5% of the votes, ensuring his eighth term in Congress. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griffith’s victory solidifies his stronghold in the conservative-leaning district, which stretches across Southwest Virginia, an area known for its rural communities and economic challenges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout her campaign, Baker, a healthcare advocate and former administrative law judge for the Social Security Administration, focused on expanding access to health care services in the district, particularly in its remote areas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also criticized Griffith for not doing enough to address the health care needs of his constituents, arguing that the region’s residents have been underserved. Baker also claimed that Griffith had failed to show up for the people of the 9th District, asserting that his focus had drifted away from the issues impacting local communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People sometimes go, who’s that? And generally, I would say 80 to 90% of the time, people say, ‘he doesn’t do anything for us,&#8217;” Baker </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/27/in-the-fightin-ninth-baker-seeks-to-end-griffiths-13-year-tenure/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said of her opponent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in an interview with The Mercury in September. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griffith, however, defended his record, emphasizing his efforts to bring jobs and federal resources to the district. He also highlighted his work on energy and coal industry issues, which remain central to the district’s economy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m a big supporter of the telehealth concepts, of our federally qualified health centers, and of trying to make sure that we continue to pay our health care providers enough that they can make it,” Griffith told The Mercury in an interview. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The race underscored the ongoing divide in Southwest Virginia between conservative and progressive approaches to policy, particularly on issues like health care, jobs, and government spending. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Griffith’s win signals continued Republican dominance in the 9th District, Baker ran a more efficient campaign than Democrat Taysha DeVaughan, who two years ago lost her bid to oust the Republican incumbent by 26.5-73%.  </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RICHMOND, Va. — On Tuesday morning, outside the Virginia Commonwealth University polling location on the second floor of the Student Commons, several students shared their same-day voter registration experiences and the top policy issues driving their choice between presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Reproductive rights, housing and economic policy were among the young voters’ chief concerns.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Many students use same-day voter registration and provisional ballots</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TriVonda Mines, the chief officer of elections at the VCU Student Commons polling location, the largest precinct in the area, saw a steady flow of voters since the 6 a.m. start, but noted it had not been as busy as previous presidential elections. She expects around 1,800 to 2,100 votes Tuesday, she said, and anticipates at least 300 of those to be provisional ballots. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A problem with provisional ballots on college campuses is that students often mix up their residency and home address. Students in residence halls must put their residence address, not their home address, in order to have their vote count in the district, according to Mines. The Commons polling location included a separate area designated for provisional ballots, a ballot used when a voter cannot confirm proper identification or forgot to register in advance.</span></p>

(Katie Farthing/Capital News Service)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jyson Willow, a senior interdisciplinary studies student at VCU, voted using a provisional ballot because he forgot about the registration deadline. Willow moved to the Richmond area over a year ago and still doesn’t have a Virginia license, so he was unable to register online beforehand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think it was stressful, just because of the amount of people that were having to do it today,” Willow said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Willow said he was glad voting via provisional ballot was easy because choosing a presidential candidate is stressful. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s almost like picking the lesser of two evils, because I don’t necessarily align perfectly with one party,” Willow said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caitlin Przywara, a senior information systems student at VCU, also voted using a provisional ballot because she did not originally plan to vote and thought she had missed her chance to do so. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It actually went by pretty fast,” Przywara said. “We didn’t know if we could register, we thought it was too late.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After casting their provisional ballot, voters have until Friday, Nov. 8 at 10 a.m. to provide valid identification, after which the local electoral board decides which provisional ballots will be counted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Truesdale, the chief election officer at the George Washington Carver Elementary School, anticipated a majority of provisional ballots. The elementary school is a polling location for two upperclassmen residence halls at VCU. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Institute of Contemporary Art is a polling location for one VCU residence hall and Chief Officer of Elections Brooks Braun noted a steady flow of voters and anticipated around 60 provisional ballots by the time polls close. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Student voters focused on reproductive health care, housing, economic policy</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the college students interviewed shared that they voted for Harris, because her policy positions most closely resemble their own.s</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with being an advocate for women’s rights, Yurida Martinez, a freshman, said the Harris housing policy plan to provide a $25,000 downpayment for first-time homebuyers appealed to her. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vanessa Lemus, a graduate student, agreed and added, “I really like the credit for first-time homebuyers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m already 26 years old, so (homeownership) is something I want to do in the future, in a couple of years,” Lemus said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lemus, who identifies as queer, said Trump’s proposed policy that would expand corporate tax cuts would only help “if you’re making six figures or more.” That, and Trump’s rhetoric disparaging immigrants and others, dissuaded her from voting for him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Throughout his presidency, the last time he was president, and throughout the campaign, he really just kind of used harmful rhetoric toward different marginalized groups,” Lemus said. “Not only that, but (Trump) has allowed for people that are voting for him to feel like it’s ok to do as well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Przywara did not vote in the 2020 election, but chose to this year because of her dislike for Trump. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve already seen what Trump has done,” Przywara said. “It’s gonna be different, if she (Harris) does become President.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sparse support for Trump Tuesday, Lemus said, is on trend for a liberal campus in an urban center of the state that reliably votes Democratic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a very liberal campus, a very eccentric, collective campus where you have a lot of different types of students coming from different backgrounds, different places,” Lemus said.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Advocates say same-day voting tears down barriers for student voters</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Same-day registration across Virginia’s college campuses “has been huge,” said Will Winters, state director for NextGen America, a non-partisan advocacy group focused on youth voting. The Virginia legislature passing its same-day registration law in 2020, which took effect in </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/07/13/same-day-voter-registration-is-coming-to-virginia-heres-how-itll-work/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2022</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has “torn down a lot of barriers to voting,” for students, he said. That expanded access leads candidates to engage with young voters more, Winters said, and makes it easier for all citizens to participate in the democratic process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s a lot of people that don’t think about elections ‘til the last second. We see all these ads and we look at polls, but there’s a lot of people in this country that are paying attention to other things,” Winters said in a phone interview from the campus of University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg. “If somebody’s moved to a different apartment, maybe they’ve changed cities for a job, same-day registration helps just make that really easy and available for those people to still have a say in our democracy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Winters declined to share how many people NextGen America has registered, but said Millenial and Gen Z voters are going to have a </span><a href="https://www.whro.org/elections/2024-11-03/what-virginias-college-voters-care-most-about-in-presidential-election" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“huge voice”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this year. This year’s turnout, he said, is stemming from the high-profile national election, and comes after the group’s work with young voters in 2023 ahead of Virginia’s pivotal General Assembly election where all 140 seats were on the ballot. The group did outreach in Blacksburg, home to Virginia Tech, and the Hampton Roads area, which hosts several universities including Norfolk State and Christopher Newport universities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It just seems, generally, students are engaged,” Winters said.</span></p>

    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Pulled fire alarm at Arlington, Va. precinct didn’t disrupt voting, Beals says</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following issues with some ballots in Richmond and Chesterfield earlier in the day, in a 9 p.m. update Tuesday evening Virginia’s top election officials reported just one other hiccup: a pulled fire alarm that prompted the evacuation of an Arlington County polling location, but didn’t prevent anyone from voting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 6 p.m. hour, the alarm was pulled at  Arlington Precinct 150, the Crystal Plaza polling place,  Virginia Elections Commissioner Susan Beals told reporters in the third and final press briefing of the day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They evacuated the building and they continued voting outside,” Beals said. “Their voters continued voting through 7 o’clock, and then they closed the polls.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some colleges and universities, Beals said, faced longer lines, but “we have checked with all of those registrars, and they have indicated to us that all of those students have been served. There currently are no lines, (or) anyone else waiting to be served in those areas.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia did not receive any bomb threats, Beals said, following a news </span><a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/fbi-statement-on-bomb-threats-to-polling-locations" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">release</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Federal Bureau of Investigation stating several states had received them. The origins of those threats were traced back to Russian email domains, the release said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As results continued to trickle in Tuesday evening, Beals also laid out the next steps in the counting process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wednesday morning, officials will double check the results from machines and begin reviewing provisional ballots from </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/05/va-college-voting-bloc-utilizes-same-day-registration-shares-top-policy-issues/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">same day registrations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which were counted at 15,000 to 17,000, as of Tuesday morning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After provisional ballots are cast, identification of the voters must be validated by 10 a.m. on Friday. Local electoral boards will be meeting next week to finalize whether all their provisional ballots will be counted or not, Beals said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Localities have until Friday, Nov. 15 to report their results to the state Board of Election, which will then determine on Monday, Nov. 18 which congressional race will receive an audit, a procedure to make sure votes were counted accurately. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re going to have two post election auditions during the week of Nov. 18,” said Beals. “One, the U.S. Senate race will receive a risk-limiting audit that every locality across the state is going to participate in. And then two, one congressional district is going to be chosen at random to also have a risk-limiting audit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dec. 17 is when Virginia will convene its electoral college, when electors will meet and vote for the president and vice president, Beals continued. Their certificates will be sent to Congress and  counted on Jan. 6, and the president will be inaugurated on Jan. 20, Beals said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals also expressed gratitude to poll workers statewide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would like to reiterate my thanks to the hundreds of poll workers across Virginia who helped their fellow Virginians vote today,” Beals said. “We could not have done it without you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the backdrop of a contentious presidential election, voting appeared to go smoothly in Virginia on Tuesday as people cast their ballots in federal and local elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though early voting </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/early-voting-in-virginia-dips-below-2020-levels-as-parties-push-for-final-turnout-surge/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dropped</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this year from the last presidential cycle — which also happened at a height of the COVID-19 pandemic where people were avoiding large crowds — some jurisdictions have shared that they’ve experienced </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/05/live-updates-election-day-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">long lines and high turnout </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">or substantial use of </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/05/va-college-voting-bloc-utilizes-same-day-registration-shares-top-policy-issues/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">same-day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> voter registration this year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A couple of snags were detected in Richmond and Chesterfield early in the day, though both were resolved quickly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Richmond, 11 people at an East End precinct had been given ballots that only included federal elections rather than both federal and local contests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unfortunately,” Richmond registrar Keith Balmer said, those voters won’t be able to weigh in on local contests. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Balmer said the city’s electoral board held an emergency meeting to vote to remove the precinct chief. A member of his staff oversaw voting for the rest of the day and no other issues have been reported. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal-only ballots were intended for military and overseas voters who can vote in federal elections, but can’t vote in local jurisdictions because they don’t live there and aren’t part of the local tax base, Balmer explained. These ballots are typically used for absentee voting, but Balmer said that a small number are still on hand at local polling places because that voter demographic does sometimes show up to vote in person. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was those ballots that were mistakenly handed to people when Precinct 310 opened at 6 a.m. Balmer said that because those people have already voted, there’s nothing that can be done to change that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Once we put their ballot in the machine — even though it’s clear as day that they were given the wrong ballot — there’s no do-overs unfortunately,” Balmer said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Chesterfield County briefly experienced jammed ballot scanners at “a handful of precincts,” registrar Missy Vera said in a release. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scanners are used to accept printed ballots and she attributed the issue to “ink levels </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">of a specific batch of ballots that were printed by a state-affiliated vendor.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To resolve the matter, poll workers were instructed to not use the specific batch of blank ballots that had been identified as the source of the issue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She added that the jamming issues “are not slowing the voting process” and that the unused ballots that had been the source of the jamming issue wouldn’t  be used going forward.</span></p>
<p><b>5:25 p.m.:</b></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Richmond precinct chief dismissed after handing out the wrong ballots</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A precinct chief in Richmond’s Precinct 310 was dismissed and replaced on Tuesday after an error resulted in 11 voters receiving the wrong ballots, according to Virginia Elections Commissioner Susan Beals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals informed reporters during a second Election Day briefing Tuesday afternoon that Richmond’s City Electoral Board met and chose to replace the precinct chief responsible. The error meant that the affected voters were unable to cast ballots for local races, as they were given special ballots meant exclusively for federal races.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My understanding is that they cast only federal ballots which included only the office of President of the United States,” Beals explained, adding that these specific ballots are usually reserved for voters who are about to move. “Those ballots, to my understanding, did not include the local races,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The error highlights the challenges election officials face in ensuring each voter receives the correct ballot, especially during high-turnout elections. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Number of provisional ballots cast unclear, but same-day registrations are up</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals also said at the briefing Tuesday that the number of provisional ballots cast throughout Election Day remained unclear by 4 p.m. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right now we don’t have anything statewide other than what we knew of this morning, which is we had between 15,000 and 17,000 statewide,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals added that several localities with universities and colleges reported an </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/05/va-college-voting-bloc-utilizes-same-day-registration-shares-top-policy-issues/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">uptick in same-day voter registrations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have heard that there are long lines in some localities that have universities and colleges, as a lot of those students have been encouraged to same-day register today,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Department of Elections officials have remained in touch with these localities and, when needed, deployed more officers of elections and supplies to those universities and the precincts on their campuses, Beals said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we encourage everyone to do is to please make sure you stay in line, even if the 7 p.m. hour passes. They will process you and they do want you to vote, so please do not get out of line.”</span></p>
<p><strong>5:10 p.m.:</strong></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">At the polls, Northern Virginia voters weigh views on abortion, cost of living</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, campaign signs were spread across Northern Virginia at intersections, street corners, and even posted on a bridge over Interstate 66, urging Virginians to support local, state and presidential candidates in this year’s general election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In areas such as Arlington, Falls Church, and Fairfax City, some voters have already cast their ballots early, leaving little foot traffic at precincts on Election Day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to David Bjerke, general registrar for the City of Falls Church, the city recorded a voter turnout of 80.1% by 5 p.m. In Fairfax County, one of the larger jurisdictions in the commonwealth, election officials said total turnout was at 67.9% as of 3:30 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While 2,305,439 Virginians had already cast their ballots through early voting as of Tuesday morning, the number of early voting ballots cast has dipped by about 525,000 compared to the last 2020 presidential election, according to data collected by the Virginia Public Access Project (VPAP).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some Election Day voters in close proximity to the federal government offices in Washington D.C., said they preferred to keep their names and who they voted for private due to their jobs, others were not shy to share their views.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think we need a change in this country,” said Elizabeth Green, a city of Fairfax voter who is concerned about the cost of living and voted early for former President Donald Trump. Green said she thinks Trump is the best presidential candidate to tackle the rising costs of food and housing she’s seen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other residents in Northern Virginia said they voted in person for convenience and to experience the voting atmosphere firsthand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mealod Khashei, in the city of Falls Church, said he voted on Election Day because doing so gives him more confidence his vote will be counted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s our civic duty, right,” Khashei said. “We [have] a few responsibilities that we’ve got to do, and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing.”</span></p>
<p><strong>4:07 p.m.:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re getting slammed with provisional ballots,” city of Richmond registrar Keith Balmer said in a phone call around 3:30 p.m. It’s mostly same-day voter registration.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris Davis, an election poll worker at Main Street Station polling place, estimated Tuesday afternoon that about 10% of ballots cast by early afternoon were provisional ballots — in part, he surmised,</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/05/va-college-voting-bloc-utilizes-same-day-registration-shares-top-policy-issues/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">from populations of college students</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that live and study in the area. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Same-day registration and provisional ballots are used in instances where someone forgot to bring their ID card or another form of identification when they vote. They can register at the polling place, vote, and then follow up with their local election officials to provide identification. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also an</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/think-you-might-have-been-mistakenly-purged-from-virginias-voter-rolls-heres-what-to-do/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">option</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the roughly 1,600 people who were</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/30/u-s-supreme-court-grants-stay-in-challenge-to-youngkins-voter-purge-order-allowing-removal-of-thousands-from-rolls/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">purged from voter rolls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this year over questions of citizenship status on Department of Motor Vehicles paperwork. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike regular ballots, provisional ballots undergo more scrutiny before they are counted, Balmer said. Officials research voters to determine factors like their identity, citizenship status, or residency in the district they voted in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My staff is going to have to research the eligibility of all of these voters and make a determination if their ballot should count or if it should not,” he explained. “Then the electoral board will ultimately make the final decision.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Basically, all of next week, we&#8217;re going to be adjudicating hundreds, if not thousands, of provisional ballots,” Balmer said. </span></p>
<p><strong>3:48 p.m.:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside the Virginia Commonwealth University polling location on the second floor of the Student Commons, several students shared their same-day voter registration experiences and the top policy issues driving their choice between presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Reproductive rights, housing and economic policy were among the young voters’ chief concerns. <strong><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/05/va-college-voting-bloc-utilizes-same-day-registration-shares-top-policy-issues/">Read more.</a></strong></span></p>
<p><strong>2:15 p.m.: </strong></p>
<p>Chris Davis, a poll worker at Main Street Station, said that about 10% of votes cast had been through same-day registration. He suspects that’s due to the amount of Virginia Commonwealth University and other university and college students that live in the area.</p>

    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virginia early voter turnout data and mail-in voting</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Elections Commissioner Susan Beals said at a media briefing on Election Day morning that as of Nov. 1, a record 6,374,437 Virginians had registered to vote. As of Tuesday morning, 2,305,439 Virginians had already cast their ballots through early voting, of which 1,861,938 were cast in person and 443,501 were returned by mail. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the mail ballots that are still outstanding, a total of 126,266 mail ballots have yet to be returned. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Those who are voting absentee by mail must have those ballots postmarked on or before today Nov. 5, and they must be received in the mail by noon Friday, Nov. 8, in order to be counted,” Beals said.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While same-day registrations data was not yet available for Tuesday around 10 a.m., Beals said that the state had filed a total of 16,557 same-day registrations leading up to Election day, “but we are obviously expecting more today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In September, Beals had </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/05/virginias-top-elections-official-warns-of-possible-delays-in-mail-in-voting-this-year/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expressed concerns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about potential delays with the U.S. Postal Service affecting timely processing of mail-in ballots ahead of the election. However, on Tuesday she reported that these issues have not materialized so far, and ballots are being processed on schedule.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think a lot of folks have chosen to do a drop off at a dropbox at their registrar’s office, we have seen an increase in that method of return,” Beals told reporters. ” We have not heard specific examples of people having delays in getting their mail back.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals added most voters are being very diligent about ensuring that their ballot has been received, which they can check online and see that it’s been received by their local registrar’s staff once they mail it back. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have seen an overall decrease in the number of people who have requested absentee by mail-in ballot this year as compared to 2020, but you can&#8217;t necessarily attribute that to just this issue, because 2020 was a very different time and a lot of people requested mail-in ballots because they just didn’t know what to expect on Election Day that year with the pandemic. So it’s hard to even make a case there.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Election integrity and and security concerns addressed early</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals reiterated that elections in Virginia are secure and reliable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Virginia, we have some of the most experienced election officials in the country. They have already conducted two statewide elections this year and have provided 138 days of early election day voting for Virginia voters as of today,” she said. Because Virginia has elections each year, Beals said, “our election officials have a great depth of experience in handling issues that come up for voters at the polls.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals added that election officials in the commonwealth have worked throughout the year to ensure that the elections are safe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In terms of security concerns, we have been meeting for many months with our state and federal law enforcement partners to plan for today,” she said. “We’ve had several meetings where we’ve run through various scenarios to make plans.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals couldn’t speak to the specifics of those plans but asserted again  “we’re very confident that we’re going to have a safe and secure election in Virginia day.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Department of Justice officials are </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/u-s-justice-department-to-monitor-polling-places-in-27-states-including-six-virginia-localities/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">monitoring six localities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Virginia Tuesday to ensure compliance with federal voting laws, but Beals said that her department would have no information to share on that. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Election Day snags</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals reported that the Department of Elections had been made aware of an incident at Precinct 310 in Richmond Tuesday morning, where election workers handed out federal-only ballots to at least 11 voters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That issue has still since been resolved. My understanding is that the officers of election gave out the incorrect ballot to the voters that had only a presidential race on the ballot,” she said. </span></p>

(Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Elections Commissioner Susan Beals confirmed Tuesday that no voters have been removed from the state’s voter rolls under Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/eo/EO-35-Comprehensive-Election-Security-Ensuring-Legal-Voters-and-Accurate-Counting---vF---8.7.24.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executive order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> since Oct. 15 — the deadline for Virginians to register to vote online or apply for absentee ballots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think the figure that has been out there is the figure that stands, there has not been any additional work done on that,” Beals said at an Election Day news conference at Richmond’s Capitol Square, referring to 1,600 individuals purged under Youngkin’s directive since August. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The last time that records were sent to registrars was October 14th, which is the close of books, and … that’s normally when we close out our maintenance practices,” Beals said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pause in removals comes amid a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/14/voter-purge-lawsuits-add-to-disenfranchisement-allegations-against-youngkin-administration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">high-profile legal battle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the state’s efforts to manage its voter rolls. The U.S. Supreme Court </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/30/u-s-supreme-court-grants-stay-in-challenge-to-youngkins-voter-purge-order-allowing-removal-of-thousands-from-rolls/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">granted a stay</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last week on a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/22/youngkin-blasts-doj-lawsuit-that-trust-virginias-voter-roll-removals-into-national-spotlight/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lower court’s ruling </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that would have required the commonwealth to restore the voting rights of the 1,600 removed Virginians. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares had already acknowledged the end of a voter purge in a court filing from Oct. 22,  without providing a date for the cut-off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The defendants have already ceased their allegedly unlawful removal process, as they always planned to do, which means there is no ongoing alleged violation,” the filing said.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the Youngkin administration has not said publicly that they were no longer removing individuals from the rolls — even after last week’s Supreme Court ruling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s order had instructed the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to send records of people thought to be non-citizens to local election registrars for potential removal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the order’s timeline became a point of contention, with critics arguing it led to eligible voters being mistakenly removed too close to Election Day, a  violation of the so-called 90-day quiet period before an election, which is mandated by the </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/national-voter-registration-act-1993-nvra" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Voter Registration Act of 1993</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals on Tuesday pushed back against allegations that Youngkin’s order prevented some citizens from exercising their right to vote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“First, in Virginia, we want every eligible voter to vote in this election,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals underscored that the removal process has been in place since 2006, when the law was signed by then-Gov. Tim Kaine, a Democrat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It has been managed and processed the exact same way by every administration since 2006 when the law was enacted. Nothing has changed in the way that that process is managed by the department,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Beals, the DMV sends information to the Department of Elections, where it is checked against the department’s list of registered voters. For any voters who marked on their DMV paperwork that they are not U.S. citizens, their information is forwarded to local registrars, who then send notifications by mail to these individuals, informing them they may be at risk of removal from the voter rolls, unless they provide proof of citizenship within 14 days. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If they return the form, nothing happens to the voter, (but) if they fail to return the form after 14 days, they are sent an additional notice where they are advised that they are being canceled because of non-citizenships status,” Beals said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Anyone who is canceled for non-citizenship status and feels as though it is in error can go to their polling location today on election day and same-day-register to vote and cast a ballot in this election.” </span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lynchburg resident Nadra Wilson was trying to be proactive this summer by renewing her driver’s license months ahead of its December expiration. As a longtime voter and Virginia resident of almost a decade, she never suspected she would be removed from the state’s voter rolls due to a paperwork error and caught up in a voter purge program that has booted 1,600 from voter lists and drawn two lawsuits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When people fail to indicate citizenship status on Department of Motor Vehicles paperwork, or initial a box indicating they&#8217;re not a citizen, that information used to be sent monthly to the Department of Elections to send to local registrars, who sort it out with people. Now, under Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s Executive Order 35, that information is sent daily. Registrars send notice to impacted voters, who receive it by mail and are supposed to respond within 14 days of its postmark. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was surprising for Wilson to receive a letter informing her that she had to prove her U.S. citizenship or have her voter registration canceled. It was also frustrating, since  the September-dated notification letter didn’t make it to her until October because it had previously been sent to an older address. By then, she had been purged from voter rolls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is all very concerning,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, she was able to go to her local registrar’s office to resolve matters and cast her vote early, but worries that others in her shoes may not have been able to do the same, in light of the ongoing lawsuits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s order to ramp up voter data reports from the DMV to the State Department of Elections from monthly to daily fell within a 90-day “quiet period” in the federal National Voter Registration Act law. Two lawsuits challenged this in court.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plaintiffs in the lawsuits and civil rights groups stressed that the purges affect both longtime citizens who’d made paperwork errors as well as those who’d become naturalized citizens since their last DMV visit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a federal court granted a preliminary injunction — ordering Youngkin’s administration to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/judge-orders-people-removed-from-voter-rolls-to-be-reinstated-gov-youngkin-to-seek-appeal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reinstate purged 1,600 voters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and halt continued purges — the United States Supreme Court’s conservative majority </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/30/u-s-supreme-court-grants-stay-in-challenge-to-youngkins-voter-purge-order-allowing-removal-of-thousands-from-rolls/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">granted </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Attorney General Jason Miayres’ request to block the lower court’s order. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chesterfield County resident Rina Shaw, who’d also been briefly removed from rolls over paperwork errors like Wilson, said the situation has been “worrying for me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When obtaining her learner’s permit, she’d forgotten to indicate her citizenship status. After calling her local registrar her registration has been restored because “they said they had made a mistake” and she was able to vote last week, she explained. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also disagrees with the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in the purge case. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s like they basically threw out rules,” she said of the National Voter Registration Act’s quiet period. “They were just like, you know, ‘to hell with that.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People who were caught up in the voter roll purge </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/think-you-might-have-been-mistakenly-purged-from-virginias-voter-rolls-heres-what-to-do/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">may utilize</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> same-day registration and a provisional ballot to vote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s what longtime Richmond resident Eric Terrell is going to do, although it won’t be as easy as the mail-in ballot he’d planned for due to his disabilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though a lifelong Richmonder, he’d moved earlier this year into the senior living facility where he lives now. He’d also updated his address through the DMV and his mistake of not checking the citizenship box is what kicked him off the rolls. When his mail-in ballot never came, he’d reached out to local officials to learn what went wrong. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terrell said that he was “highly pissed” when he found out, but he’s come to accept the situation. He plans to take an Uber to his polling location on Election Day and said that he’s grateful same-day registration exists to resolve the matter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Wilson didn’t end up needing to take the same-day registration and provisional ballot route, she said that she’s glad others have that option. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provisional ballots, another option for same-day registrants, are most often used in instances where someone forgot to bring their ID card or other form of identification, as well as when people utilize same-day voter registration. Virginia Public Access Project also has a tool to </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/local-politics/elections/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lookup</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a polling place based on someone’s address even if they aren’t technically registered yet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Henrico County’s registrar Mark Coakley said that in most cases where provisional ballots are used, as long as people are able to show identification they don’t need to follow up with their registrar. Should someone decline the day of or not have identification on them at the time they vote, they can come back to their registrar’s office before noon on Friday.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin's political action committee. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One day before the presidential election, early voting turnout in Virginia is falling short of the historic highs seen in 2020, the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of Sunday, more than 2.29 million Virginians have already cast their ballots — a 525,000 decrease from the unprecedented 2.82 million early votes cast by Nov. 3, 2020, during the last presidential election, </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/elections/early-voting/2024-november-general-election/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Virginia Public Access Project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In-person was the most popular option for early voters this year. On Saturday alone — the last day for early in-person voting during this election cycle — 139,376 cast their ballot. In total, 1.856 million  early voters did so in person, with just 437,173 voting by mail.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite an initial wave of early voting in the southern and western parts of the state, the pattern of early ballot casting is about the same as some elections in more recent years, said David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads seem to have had higher percentage rates of early voting, but there were some interesting things as urban areas, cities, and towns seemed to often, but not always, have higher turnout rates,” Richards said. That could reflect that it’s easier to mobilize people if you have a denser population base to organize, he added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Overall rates are down compared to 2020, but that was the pandemic election, so the early voting rate is actually pretty decent. Most precincts have rates above 10%, many in the mid-40s, and at least a couple hit 50%, which is pretty impressive.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Democrats celebrate early voting turnout, Republicans see state in play amid mixed messaging from Trump</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As early voting numbers in Virginia show strong turnout from both Democrats and Republicans, both parties remain optimistic heading into Election Day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the state’s nonpartisan voter registration system keeps early vote totals from revealing party affiliation — adding an element of suspense for both sides as they each express confidence in their momentum — Republicans have remained vocal in their belief that the state remains in play, despite </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/01/harris-expands-her-lead-over-trump-to-10-points-in-virginia-new-roanoke-college-poll-says/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">consistent polling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showing Vice President Kamala Harris with a comfortable lead over former President Donald Trump.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richards, the political scientist, noted how early voting in Virginia’s 9th Congressional District in far Southwest Virginia, a GOP stronghold where Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, faces Democratic challenger Karen Baker, was particularly noteworthy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That district came out blazing hot but has settled down. They are closest to the 2020 turnout compared to other house districts, but in the previous election, they had the lowest turnout for early voting, so perhaps the bar was set low,” Richards said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, this development might also reflect the GOP’s effort to turn out the vote in an area of the state where Gov. Glenn Youngkin stressed the need for Republicans to vote early, Richards said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It seems like they responded. I think the Democrats may have taken a more leisurely approach, which is why we see Northern Virginia surging later in the early voting period.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because voters in Virginia don’t register by party affiliation, early-voting data offers little certainty about which way the election will go, but also looking at numbers in more partisan localities might offer hints. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Susan Swecker, the chair of the Democratic Party of Virginia, said in a statement that with over 2.3 million early votes cast — led by Democratic strongholds — Virginians have already made their voices heard that they choose the Harris ticket over Trump’s. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Late-deciding voters are breaking toward Vice President Harris by double digits, especially among independent women and seniors who are done with Trump. Kamala Harris and Tim Walz will resoundingly win Virginia’s 13 electoral votes,” Swecker said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Republican voters, previously hesitant to vote early, have shown increased participation in recent weeks, possibly due to GOP-led efforts highlighting the convenience and security of early voting — and despite or maybe because of Trump’s mixed messaging on the benefits of early voting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/23/trump-youngkin-urge-early-voting-during-tele-rally/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">telephone rally</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hosted by Youngkin in September, the Republican nominee urged his supporters to use “every appropriate tool to beat the radical left Democrats” and to not wait until Election Day to cast their ballots. “You’ve heard a lot about voting by mail, but that’s what we have right now.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But only hours later, at a rally in Indiana, Penn., Trump </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/23/trump-tells-supporters-to-vote-early-even-as-he-still-criticizes-the-practice-00180650" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reversed course</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, calling early voting “stupid.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia GOP Chairman Rich Anderson still pushed back against the assumption that Republicans are still weary of early voting — despite the former president’s flip-flopping on this issue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve worked really hard to increase turnout and to encourage people to show up and vote early. Obviously, the Democrats started that much earlier than we did, they are further along, but I&#8217;m very pleased, and I know that the governor is, too, that we’ve been able to make progress on that and change our culture,” Anderson said in a phone interview Monday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So the early voting looks very good, and I’m glad to hear there are banked votes, but we’re also working very hard to turn out voters tomorrow to make a winning difference and we&#8217;ll see how it comes out tomorrow night.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a larger early turnout might seem advantageous for Democratic candidates, Republican strategists argue that their base traditionally turns out in higher numbers on Election Day itself, meaning they still anticipate strong performance as the final ballots are cast. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results may ultimately depend on whether early voting enthusiasm from Democrats translates to similar turnout on Election Day, said Richards, the political scientist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Just under 4.5 million people voted in 2020, again during the pandemic. I would expect to see higher vote totals this year despite somewhat lower early voting rates, as more people will feel comfortable voting in person on Tuesday,” he said.</span></p>

(Samantha Willis/The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Department of Justice plans to </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-monitor-polls-27-states-compliance-federal-voting-rights-laws" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">monitor </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">compliance with federal voting laws in 27 states and 86 jurisdictions nationwide during Tuesday’s general elections. Six of those are in Virginia: Hanover, Henrico, Loudoun, and Prince William counties as well as the cities of Manassas and Manassas Park.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means that personnel from the department’s Civil Rights Division “will be available all day to receive questions and complaints … related to possible violations of federal voting rights laws,” according to a Nov. 1 DOJ news release. The agency will also “maintain contact with state and local election officials” throughout Election Day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Henrico’s registrar Mark Coakley said that representatives from the DOJ had reached out late last week to inform his office that officials “would be coming by.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They didn’t say (which specific polling places) they were going, just Henrico in general,” he said in a call on Monday. “I expect the DOJ will spend more time at the malls or eating at local restaurants than actually finding anything wrong or out of the ordinary at our polling places.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The department is monitoring complaints for possible violations of several laws including the Voting Rights Act, Help America Vote Act, Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, Civil Rights Acts, the Americans with Disabilities Act and the National Voter Registration Act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latter was central to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/14/voter-purge-lawsuits-add-to-disenfranchisement-allegations-against-youngkin-administration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two lawsuits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last month aimed at Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration for a voter purge program that has removed at least </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/over-1600-people-removed-from-voter-rolls-under-youngkin-order-groups-seek-court-injunction/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1,600 people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Virginia voter rolls. A DOJ suit and one from Virginia’s League of Women Voters and Virginia Coalition for Immigrants Rights allege roll purges were happening too close to election day in violation of a 90-day quiet period in the National Voter Registration Act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When people fail to indicate citizenship status on Department of Motor Vehicles paperwork, that information is sent monthly to the Department of Elections to send to local registrars, who sort it out with people. But an Aug. 5 executive order from Youngkin — at the start of the 90-day quiet period —  ramped up the reporting from monthly to daily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plaintiffs in the case and civil rights groups stressed that the purges affect both longtime citizens who’d made paperwork errors as well as people who’d become naturalized citizens since their last DMV visit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a federal court granted a preliminary injunction — ordering Youngkin’s administration to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/judge-orders-people-removed-from-voter-rolls-to-be-reinstated-gov-youngkin-to-seek-appeal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reinstate purged 1,600 voters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and halt continued purges — the United States Supreme Court’s conservative majority </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/30/u-s-supreme-court-grants-stay-in-challenge-to-youngkins-voter-purge-order-allowing-removal-of-thousands-from-rolls/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">granted </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Attorney General Jason Miayres’ request to block the lower court’s order. </span></p>
<p><b>Additional guidance from the DOJ: </b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For reports of potential violation of federal voting rights laws, reports may be made through the department’s website </span><a href="http://www.civilrights.justice.gov/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.civilrights.justice.gov</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or by calling toll-free at 800-253-3931.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Complaints related to disruptions should be reported to local election officials.

(Jeenah Moon/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — On the final frantic Sunday of the presidential race, while Vice President Kamala Harris spoke at a Black church service in Michigan, former President Donald Trump told supporters at a Pennsylvania rally that he “shouldn’t have left” the White House after he lost the 2020 presidential election.</p>
<p>At a campaign rally at an airplane tarmac in Lititz, Pennsylvania, Trump again perpetuated the falsehood that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him and claimed that this year’s election would also be stolen because election results could take a while to be counted.</p>
<p>“These elections have to be decided by 9 o’clock, 10 o’clock, 11 o’clock on Tuesday night,” he said. “Bunch of crooked people.”</p>
<p>Election officials have warned that<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/final-results-may-lag-deadlocked-presidential-contest-anxious-election-officials-warn" target="_blank"> results could take days to finalize.</a></p>
<p>The comments came as new polls showed good news for Harris. A highly regarded pollster in Iowa showed a shocking lead for Harris there and New York Times-Siena College polls of the seven major battleground states showed slight leads for Harris in some Sun Belt swing states, while Trump made gains in the Rust Belt.</p>
<p>As the campaign dwindles to its final hours, here are seven key developments from this weekend:</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump says he ‘shouldn’t have left’ White House</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Trump spent much of his Lititz rally complaining about the election process and media coverage, seeming to repeat his false claim that he was the rightful winner of the 2020 election.</p>
<p>“I shouldn’t have left, I mean, honestly,” Trump said. “We did so well, we had such a great — so now, every polling booth has hundreds of lawyers standing there.”</p>
<p>He also <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/election-2024/pennsylvania-lititz-lancaster-trump-rants-about-polls-says-i-dont-mind-if-someone-shoots-through-the-fake-news-at-pa-rally/" target="_blank">joked about shooters targeting reporters</a> covering his event, the Pennsylvania Capital-Star reported.</p>
<p>He pointed to protective glass covering him on two sides and noted a press section was on another side of him.</p>
<p>“To get me, someone would have to shoot through the fake news,” Trump said. “And I don’t mind that so much.”</p>
<p>In a statement that seemed to contradict the plain meaning of Trump’s remark, campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung denied Trump was encouraging violence against reporters.</p>
<p>“The President’s statement about protective glass placement has nothing to do with the Media being harmed, or anything else,” Cheung wrote. “It was about threats against him that were spurred on by dangerous rhetoric from Democrats. In fact, President Trump was stating that the Media was in danger, in that they were protecting him and, therefore, were in great danger themselves, and should have had a glass protective shield, also. There can be no other interpretation of what was said. He was actually looking out for their welfare, far more than his own!”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Harris heads to the Big Apple</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Harris made an unscheduled trip to New York City Saturday, where she made a surprise appearance during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Funs6yyEw" target="_blank">cold open of NBC’s “Saturday Night Live”</a> alongside actress Maya Rudolph, who portrays the veep in the live sketch comedy show.</p>
<p>In the three-minute opener, Rudolph approaches a vanity dresser and wishes she could talk to “someone who was in my shoes” as a “Black, South Asian woman running for president, preferably from the Bay Area.”</p>
<p>Rudolph turns toward the faux mirror, and Harris, on the other side, responds, “You and me both, sister.”</p>
<p>They wore identical suits and Harris turned to Rudolph and said that she is “here to remind you, you got this.”</p>
<p>“Because you can do something your opponent cannot do. You can open doors,” Harris said, joking about a recent campaign event where Trump tried to open the door to a garbage truck.</p>
<p>Rudolph cackled, doing an impersonation of Harris’ laugh, before the two women began a pep talk with puns of Harris’ first name.</p>
<p>“Now, Kamala, take my palmala,” Rudolph said. “The American people want to stop the chaos.”</p>
<p>“And end the dramala,” Harris said.</p>
<p>Harris and Rudolph then stood side-by-side and said they were going to vote for “us.”</p>
<p>Harris joked and asked Rudolph if she was registered to vote in the battleground state of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Harris headed from New York to Michigan, where she spoke Sunday at the historically Black Greater Emmanuel Institutional Church of God in Christ in Detroit.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Polling bombshell in a non-swing state</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Polling in the latest <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/iowa-poll/2024/11/02/iowa-poll-kamala-harris-leads-donald-trump-2024-presidential-race/75354033007/" target="_blank">Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll</a>, reported a shocking lead for Harris in a state that Trump easily won in 2016 and 2020, with women and independent voters breaking for the Democratic presidential nominee.</p>
<p>The poll shows Harris leading with 47% of likely voters compared to 44% with Trump, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/harris-takes-slim-lead-over-trump-final-iowa-poll-2024-election" target="_blank">according to the Register.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://cdn.nucleusfiles.com/a4/a4f946f9-4e27-4bae-8e32-e77638040f06/11.2-djt-iowa-poll.pdf?_nlid=S2fMS533ZU&amp;_nhids=g2dmirPedj" target="_blank">The Trump campaign </a>quickly called the Iowa poll “a clear outlier,” and instead cited a <a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/november-2024-iowa-poll-trump-53-harris-43/" target="_blank">poll by Emerson College </a>as accurate, which showed the former president having 53% support compared to 43% for Harris.</p>
<p>Trump also took his grievances to his social media site, Truth Social.</p>
<p>“All polls, except for one heavily skewed toward the Democrats by a Trump hater who called it totally wrong the last time, have me up, BY A LOT,” he wrote. “I LOVE THE FARMERS, AND THEY LOVE ME.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/03/us/politics/harris-trump-times-siena-poll.html" target="_blank">The New York Times/Siena College Sunday polls</a> found that Harris is improving in North Carolina and Georgia while Trump has gained in Pennsylvania and maintains a strong advantage in Arizona. Harris is still ahead in Nevada and Wisconsin, according to the poll, but Michigan and Pennsylvania remain tied. The poll of Georgia showed Harris with a 1-point edge.</p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Harris expands her lead over Trump to 10 points in Virginia, new Roanoke College poll says&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/01/harris-expands-her-lead-over-trump-to-10-points-in-virginia-new-roanoke-college-poll-says/embed/#?secret=yeSCzbu3BC#?secret=0xReBV1PDY" data-secret="0xReBV1PDY" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>Both candidates were within the polls’ margins of error, meaning that the seven swing states could tip to either candidate.</p>
<p>While both Democratic and Republican politicians have expressed confidence in winning the election, polling experts said during a <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?539658-1/political-analysts-discuss-2024-elections&amp;live" target="_blank">panel</a> hosted by the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute in late October there’s no way to know for sure who will control the White House until all the votes are counted.</p>
<p>Kristen Soltis Anderson, founding partner at Echelon Insights, said there’s about a 60% chance that this year’s nationwide polling has been mostly correct, though she emphasized that the people who focus their careers on political polling are dedicated to providing a realistic understanding of where campaigns are headed.</p>
<p>“We are trying our very hardest to get it right,” Anderson said. “Even if you don’t believe in our altruism or even if you don’t believe in our academic and intellectual integrity, believe in nothing else than our financial incentives. You want to be the pollster who was right. It is very good business to be the pollster who is right.”</p>
<p>Jeff Horwitt, partner at Hart Research, said during the panel his firm has wrapped up its polling for this election year and expressed skepticism about the polls that emerge close to Election Day.</p>
<p>“Because our job, for our political clients, is to tell them the contours of the election,” Horwitt said. “How do we convince voters to vote for our candidate? What are the most effective messages? What do we have to think about? So the public polls are seeing now, they’re super interesting, and they’re important, but they’re not actionable.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump welcomes sexist insult</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>As Trump spent his weekend in a campaign blitz across North Carolina, he welcomed a sexist remark from a rallygoer in Greensboro who suggested that Harris worked as a prostitute.</p>
<p>During the Saturday night rally, Trump questioned whether Harris’ previously worked at a McDonald’s. Her campaign has stated that she worked the summer job in 1983. In a campaign photo opportunity, <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/election-2024/trump-weekend-pennsylvania-arnold-palmer-latrobe-mcdonalds-steelers-elon-musk/" target="_blank">Trump visited a closed McDonald’s </a>in Pennsylvania where he handed fries to pre-screened people at the drive through.</p>
<p>“It’s so simple,” Trump said. “She’s a significant liar, and when you lie about something so simple, so she never worked there –”</p>
<p>“She worked on a corner,” a man from the crowd shouted.</p>
<p>Trump laughed at the crude comment.</p>
<p>“This place is amazing,” Trump said. “Just remember, it’s other people saying it, it’s not me.”</p>
<p>Harris has significantly gained support with women, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/10/10/the-harris-trump-matchup/" target="_blank">according to the Pew Research Center. </a>Trump has often dismissed criticism that he has lagged among women.</p>
<p>During a rally last week in Wisconsin, and in an attempt to win over women voters, Trump said that he would protect women and “I’m going to do it whether the women like it or not.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump repeats ‘father of fertilization’ claim</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>At a Greensboro, North Carolina, rally Saturday, Trump again called himself “the father of fertilization,” a title <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-claims-title-father-ivf-fox-news-town-hall-women-voters" target="_blank">he first gave himself</a> during a Fox News town hall with women voters last month.</p>
<p>“I consider myself to be the father of fertilization,” he said Saturday.</p>
<p>The Iowa poll — and other late surveys — showed a stark gender gap, with women voters increasingly preferring Harris.</p>
<p>Nearly twice as many Iowa independent women voters, 57% to 29%, favored Harris. That represents a major gain for Harris since a September survey by the same pollster showed the vice president’s edge with independent women was only 5 percentage points.</p>
<p>Democrats have sought to exploit their advantage with women voters by emphasizing Trump’s record on abortion access. The former president appointed three of the U.S. Supreme Court justices who voted in 2022 to overturn the federal right to an abortion.</p>
<p>A flurry of state-level policymaking on reproductive rights has followed, including restrictions on in vitro fertilization, a common fertility treatment.</p>
<p>Trump has said he opposed an Alabama Supreme Court ruling that outlawed the treatment in the state, but had not previously taken a position on the issue.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Early voters up to 76 million</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>More than 76 million voters had already cast ballots through early and mail voting by midday Sunday, according to <a href="https://election.lab.ufl.edu/early-vote/2024-early-voting/" target="_blank">the University of Florida’s Election Lab</a>.</p>
<p>Roughly half of those have come in states that track voters’ partisanship. About 700,000 — roughly 2% of the total — more Democrats have voted in those states than Republicans, but the numbers include California, where Democrat Joe Biden won more than 5 million more votes than Trump in the 2020 election.</p>
<p>Among the six states — Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Colorado, Idaho and Virginia — that track voters’ gender, women accounted for 54% of the vote, compared to 43.6% for men.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed"> ‘Election eve’ blitz</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The candidates for president and vice president plan to sprint across the key swing states in the campaign’s final days, with particular focus on Pennsylvania, the largest of the contested states where polling has shown a deadlocked race.</p>
<p>The Harris campaign announced Sunday the vice president would be in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia on Monday, the night before Election Day, for rallies and musical performances. Scheduled entertainers and speakers included Oprah Winfrey, The Roots, Lady Gaga and Katy Perry.</p>
<p>Harris is also set to hold an event in Allentown, Pennsylvania, a majority-Latino city, on Monday. Part of Harris’ closing message has highlighted racist comments Trump and his supporters have made about Latinos.</p>
<p>After spending much of the weekend in North Carolina, Trump will also hold a rally in Pittsburgh on Monday evening.</p>
<p>Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Harris’ running mate, will be in Milwaukee on Monday.</p>
<p>Trump running mate Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance will hold events in Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania on Monday.</p>
<p>Harris will hold an election night watch party at her alma mater, Howard University, in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Trump’s watch party will be at his Mar-a-Lago club in West Palm Beach, Florida.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Virginia immigrants generate $104 billion of economic output in the state, according to the study. Immigration to the state creates more job opportunities for more consumers, workers and business owners, which benefits U.S.-born workers.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“If you came here illegally, you are basically screwing up the whole system,” Cao said at the debate. “There are people that are waiting in line like my family for seven years for their naturalization papers. So you cannot jump the line.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The way immigration data is tracked has changed, which makes it harder to directly compare illegal immigration during President Joe Biden’s administration to other administrations, according to the fact-checking website <a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2024/jan/03/key-facts-about-immigration-data-what-it-can-and-c/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.politifact.com/article/2024/jan/03/key-facts-about-immigration-data-what-it-can-and-c/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1730738906446000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0poVRCAaNe-3NIr6i039WE">Politifact</a>.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virginia immigrants want reform and opportunity</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Several people who immigrated to Virginia told VCU Capital News Service they want reform and opportunity, something they hear about more from the Democratic Party.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Valesca Bonilla immigrated to Virginia from Honduras and is a member of CASA in Action, an organization which advocates for legislative change at the statehouse. The Democratic Party is receptive to the community and immigration reform, she said.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> “The more numbers we are, the better we are together,” Bonilla said. “If we don't try to educate ourselves and educate others and come together, we’re not gonna make it.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bonilla said immigration reform begins with small steps, such as a smoother process for worker permits and more temporary protected status, or TPS, allowances for migrants whose native countries are considered unsafe. This program grants the ability to live and work in the U.S. for a fixed period of time, and is something Kaine has <a href="https://timkaine.com/issues/fighting-for-immigrant-communities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://timkaine.com/issues/fighting-for-immigrant-communities/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1730738906446000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3bnS0FPWHt5yaXfcOJ7_5O">defended</a> in the Senate.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Hector Joya, a Salvadoran immigrant, said programs like DACA and TPS are essential to immigrants in the country. There needs to be more programs that can help expand visa accessibility. He is an organizer with CASA in Action.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Joya cannot vote. But, he said immigrants can lean toward the Democratic Party because it is more receptive to immigrant needs and presence. Other voting groups should consider immigration policy because of the strong economic contributions from immigrants, he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Naturalized citizens not unified voting bloc</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Gabriela León-Pérez, an assistant professor of sociology at Virginia Commonwealth University, immigrated to the U.S. from Mexico. The U.S. has always been dependent on immigrant labor and not only in lower-skilled jobs, but also highly skilled jobs in fields like STEM.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“That is how Mexican immigration even started in the late 1800s, because of active recruitment of cheap labor,” León-Pérez said. “Not only are immigrants contributing to society in economic and labor terms, but also culturally, in the arts. There are many areas that immigrants play an integral role in society.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Her current research project asks immigrants what they would like the public to know about them and many set the record straight, she said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“They want people to know that they're not here to take jobs and that they're here to work and to contribute to society,” León-Pérez said. “Immigrants actually complement the U.S.-born population because the types of jobs that immigrants hold are different from the ones that the U.S.-born population holds, so, rather than taking away, they're complementing each other in the labor market.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, León-Pérez said it can be difficult to generalize policies that all immigrants hope for because it varies based on country of origin, class, legal status and how they arrived. León-Pérez believes naturalized citizens can’t be perceived as a voting bloc because of how varied the group is, she said. There is a wide range of political beliefs, although people think they’re more Democratic leaning.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“There’s a growing population of Latinos who support the Republican Party, so can’t really say that immigrants as a whole or even different racial, ethnic groups, support a specific political party,” León-Pérez said.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Former delegate and immigrant says: ‘Vote’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Elizabeth Guzman, a former Democratic delegate who represented Prince William and Fauquier counties, is a naturalized citizen. On Election Day, a candidate’s stances on immigration guide her vote, she said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump previously made comments that immigrants poison the country and accused them of taking American jobs, according to <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2024/10/21/fact-check-12000-trump-statements-immigrants" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.themarshallproject.org/2024/10/21/fact-check-12000-trump-statements-immigrants&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1730738906446000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1PJcgk0oAryYBjb_U45R2Q">The Marshall Project</a>. Guzman said this perception is unfair and disappointing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We are just tired, being used for his campaign slogan but never acknowledge the contributions we have made,” Guzman said. “We are in a historic moment where we have immigrants leading government agencies … if they were given the job it’s because they were qualified to do that job and ready for that challenge.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Guzman, who is originally from Peru and a native Spanish speaker, said immigrants have to work twice as hard as their American counterparts to reach higher positions like elected office. Immigrants shouldn’t feel less American because of the color of their skin or their last name, Guzman said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We’re here to work, and we’re here to succeed and pave way for future generations,” Guzman said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Higher education should be accessible as long as immigrants pay taxes and respect the law, according to Guzman. Reform like that can increase their contributions to Virginia.</p>
<p dir="ltr">New voting generations must think about the future they want to grow up in, where everyone is treated with respect and dignity, Guzman said. Second-generation immigrants don’t want to live in a country where their tax-paying parents are disrespected and not valued.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia has made it easier to participate in the election with early voting and people must decide whether they want to be a part of the solution or the problem, she said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Participate. Vote,” Guzman said. “Your vote is your voice and if you don’t participate, then don’t complain.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Election Day is Tuesday, Nov. 5. The polls will be open from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. Same-day voter registration is allowed.</p>

(Jonathan Ernst/Scott Olson/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the presidential race, Vice President Kamala Harris holds a 10-point lead over former President Donald Trump (51-41%) in Virginia, according to </span><a href="https://www.roanoke.edu/news/rc_poll_politics_election_2024" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a new poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> released Friday by the Institute for Policy and Opinion Research at Roanoke College. Independent Cornel West and Libertarian Chase Oliver both poll at 2%, and Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate, takes 1% of the vote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the U.S. Senate race, Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine leads his Republican challenger Hung Cao, a retired U.S. Navy captain, with 51-40%, the poll found.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friday’s survey marks a significant expansion of Harris’ advantage compared to a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/20/harris-holds-slim-lead-over-trump-in-virginia-roanoke-college-poll-says/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">previous Roanoke College poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Aug. 20, when the Democratic nominee edged her Republican opponent by just three points (47-44%) in a head-to-head matchup in Virginia. Kaine’s 11-point lead over Cao lead remains unchanged. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new poll isn’t good news for the Trump campaign, which is set to hold a high-stakes rally </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saturday at the Civic Center in Salem, where the Republican nominee plans to make his case to Virginians for the last time before Tuesday’s election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent weeks, some leading Republicans have claimed that because of a fired up base and a tightening of the poll numbers, Virginia </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/01/trump-plans-rally-in-salem-saturday-despite-polls-showing-harris-on-top-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">could be in play for Trump</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who lost in the commonwealth in both 2016 and 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But according to Friday’s survey, only 2% of likely voters say they are still undecided four days before the election, and another 2% say they will vote for someone other than the five candidates on the ballot. Just less than half (47%) say they are almost certain to vote, while 40% report they have already voted. Almost one-fourth (24%) still plan to vote prior to Election Day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kamala Harris has increased the slim lead she held in the August Roanoke College Poll,” said Harry Wilson, senior political analyst for IPOR and Professor Emeritus of Political Science at Roanoke College. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She is claiming 95% of Democrats and leads 49%-36% among independents. Trump is supported by 90% of Republicans, but that might not be enough for him to win in Virginia.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With so few undecided voters, it’s a “tough uphill climb for Trump,” Wilson said. “Democrats continue to take advantage of early voting. Republicans are catching up, but they need massive turnout on Election Day.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The poll also found that a large majority (85%) of those who have not yet voted are very certain of their vote choice, and another 9% are somewhat certain. Two-thirds (66%) said they are very enthusiastic about voting, and another 17% are somewhat enthusiastic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The economy was named as the most important issue by 43% of respondents. Abortion (20%) and immigration (12%) were cited as most important more frequently than foreign affairs (8%) and crime (3%). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey further says that likely voters trust Harris to do a better job on abortion (57%, compared to 36% for Trump), but the candidates are viewed about equally on other issues (tied at 48% on immigration; Harris favored 49-45% on both crime and foreign policy; and Trump seen as doing a better job on the economy 49%-46%).    </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked if the candidate understands and cares about people like them, only 37% think that Trump understands and cares compared to 46% for Harris. Respondents are closely divided regarding the impact of the federal government, with 44% thinking the government makes their life worse and 40% thinking it makes their life better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results of the Roanoke College poll are consistent with an </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/harris-kaine-ahead-in-virginia-by-comfortable-margins-new-poll-says/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oct. 7 poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Wason Center for Civic Leadership at Christopher Newport University that had Harris leading Trump by 11 points (52-41%) among Virginia likely voters. The survey found that 4% of voters remained undecided four weeks before the election, while 3% said they will vote for someone else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For its survey, the Institute for Policy and Opinion Research interviewed 851 likely registered </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">voters in Virginia between Oct. 25 and Oct. 29, 2024.The survey has a margin of error of 4.6%. </span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former President Donald Trump’s decision to hold a last-minute rally in Salem, Virginia, on Saturday, just days before the Nov. 5 election, has raised eyebrows, as most polls show Vice President Kamala Harris — who has not campaigned in the commonwealth since becoming the Democratic nominee last summer — with a comfortable lead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The event will mark a nostalgic moment for Rich Anderson, chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia, who attended a gathering with President Richard Nixon at the same venue over half a century ago. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A little tidbit for you,” Anderson shared in a phone interview Thursday, “when I was a little kid, and I remember it like yesterday, I went to the rally in 1969 where President Nixon came to the same Civic Center and campaigned for (former Virginia Gov.) Linwood Holton, who was elected governor that year.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nixon’s visit 55 years ago, Anderson said, reverberated through the Roanoke Valley at the time, and he — and other high profile Republicans — hope that Trump’s event will have a similar effect. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Polls vs. perception</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/10/26/harris-trump-virginia-voters-poll/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington Post-Shar survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> released Saturday — one of the most recent presidential polls available for Virginia — Harris holds a six-point edge over Trump, similar to her eight-point advantage in a previous poll from September.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.roanoke.edu/news/rc_poll_politics_election_2024" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> released Friday by the Institute for Policy and Opinion Research at Roanoke College shows Harris with a 10-point lead over former President Donald Trump (51%-41%). Independent Cornel West and Libertarian Chase Oliver both poll at 2%, and Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate, takes 1% of the vote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And an </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/harris-kaine-ahead-in-virginia-by-comfortable-margins-new-poll-says/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">earlier poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Oct. 7 by the Wason Center for Civic Leadership at Christopher Newport University had the Vice President up by 11 points (52-41%) among likely Virginia voters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Republicans insist that a victory remains within reach in the commonwealth, where no GOP candidate has won a presidential race since George W. Bush in 2004 and where Trump lost in both 2016 and 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia, I believe, is in play,” said Anderson. “While the polling generally has Harris up, a lot of it is within the margin of error.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What I’ve told people is, don’t get fixated on these polls, regardless (of) where they are. If it shows Trump in a comfortable position, then the danger is that people start relaxing on our side. And if it&#8217;s not good news for us, then people get demoralized,” Anderson said. “Just work like we’re 10 points down and that’s the surest path to victory.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeff Ryer, a spokesman for the Trump campaign in Virginia, cited a Republican-leaning poll from Monday, which has Harris at 48% and Trump at 46% and is within the margin of error. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whether you’re looking at polling showing a margin-of-error race or Republicans’ strong showing in early voting, it’s clear that Virginia is a battleground,” Ryer said. “President Trump is holding a rally in Virginia because Virginia is in play.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Democrats have pushed back against the notion that the presidential race in Virginia has become more competitive in recent weeks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Donald Trump has been soundly defeated every time he’s run in Virginia, and while he’s welcome to waste his time campaigning here, Virginians are going to once again reject his extreme plans to roll back our rights and freedoms, wreck our economy, and raise taxes by nearly $4,000 for hardworking families,” said Aaron Fritschner, a spokesman for the Harris campaign. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Susan Swecker, the chair of the Democratic Party of Virginia, in a text message suggested that Trump’s choice to visit the commonwealth this close before the election might reflect his campaign’s dwindling options for large rallies, especially in competitive states where his standing is uncertain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The planned Salem rally, Swecker said, was “another tired Trump gimmick to counter that his show has grown stale in the core battlegrounds, as his crowd sizes have plummeted and exhausted people walk out of his rallies.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump is looking for “fresh crowds” in New Mexico and Virginia to “rant and rave about conspiracies like Youngkin’s false conspiracy theories about voting,” Swecker added. “Trump has done the same last-minute stunts in places like New Mexico in 2016 and Minnesota in 2020, only to get crushed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Trump has never shied away from campaigning in Democratic-leaning areas — as his recent visits to Monterey, California, and New York City have demonstrated — political analysts are also skeptical, noting that Trump lost Virginia in two previous elections and that the state has become more solidly Democratic in recent years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some suggest Trump’s visit could be an attempt to create the appearance of momentum in the commonwealth, while others speculate it might serve as a rallying cry for his base in case he contests the results after a potential defeat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As recently as last week Trump said on the Joe Rogan Show that he </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/us/politics/trump-joe-rogan-podcast.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">doesn’t trust the polls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but I cannot imagine his campaign thinks that Virginia is in play, especially since the most recent polls I have seen show Harris with a small, but outside-the-margin lead in the commonwealth,” said John Aughenbaugh, an associate political science professor at Virginia Commonwealth University. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have to wonder if there are other reasons why he would spend valuable campaign time in Salem, when he could be visiting the truly competitive battleground states Pennsylvania, Wisconsin or Michigan.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Aughenbaugh said, in 2016 most experts stated that Trump did not have a chance in either Pennsylvania or Wisconsin, yet he ended up winning there in part because his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton stopped campaigning in those states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aughenbaugh added that the Trump campaign also may be seizing on the heightened tensions over Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s recent executive order, which led to the removal of thousands of Virginians from the voter rolls and sparked legal challenges and national scrutiny. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The controversy culminated Wednesday, when the U.S. Supreme Court </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/103024zr_f2ah.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">granted a temporary stay</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the ongoing legal dispute over the governor’s order — a ruling in the Republicans’ favor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Political forecaster Larry Sabato, the director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, said that with Trump’s rally in Salem — a Republican stronghold — the former president might not have a rational purpose and that he was simply playing to his base by projecting strength through crowd size. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Trump is in part a creation of TV and ‘The Apprentice,’” Sabato said, referring to NBC’s reality television series which Trump hosted for 14 seasons. “He knows that actual reality can be shaped by the projection of his preferred version of reality. His version right now is, ‘We’re going to win in a landslide and that includes Virginia.’ His MAGA troops will certainly buy it, and it will whip them up even more than they already are.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while Salem is a four-hour drive from Washington, D.C., it is close enough to the networks so that coverage will be extensive on the final weekend, Sabato said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Rural areas are Trump’s greatest strength, far more than urban-suburban territory. But Virginia is not competitive. If it was, we’d be flooded with TV ads and boasts from the campaigns.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Anderson, the RPV chair, said he suspected that the Trump campaign may be trying to win Virginia by replicating Youngkin’s strategy during the 2021 gubernatorial election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“President Trump has not been to Southwest Virginia, which is obviously a major Republican enclave that must be turned out in order to offset the blue areas of the state, principally the urban crescent that runs from Fairfax all the way down to Richmond and then turns east toward Norfolk,” Anderson said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, Youngkin successfully aimed at losing Northern Virginia by fewer voters than some Republicans before him while focusing on increasing GOP turnout in Southwest Virginia, Southside and other Republican areas, Anderson said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Youngkin — who during his gubernatorial bid managed to flip the commonwealth red by skillfully balancing his stance on a former president who remained highly unpopular with a significant portion of Virginia voters — has now become one of Trump’s biggest cheerleaders, willing to reiterate the campaign’s message that the state is in play.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia is far more competitive than any of the pundits would believe,” Youngkin told Fox News’s Bret Baier on Wednesday, vowing to attend the Salem rally. </span></p>

The postcard was paid for by Article IV, an issue-advocacy nonprofit in Arlington, Virginia. (Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)</p><p><em>This story was originally published in <a href="https://southdakotasearchlight.com/2024/10/29/south-dakota-election-open-primaries-article-iv-nonprofit-outspends-groups-campaign/" target="_blank">South Dakota Searchlight</a>, a sister publication of The Virginia Mercury and an affiliate of States Newsroom.</em></p>
<p>An out-of-state nonprofit that hasn’t disclosed its donors is outspending in-state opponents and supporters of an open primaries ballot question ahead of South Dakota’s Nov. 5 election.</p>
<p>Article IV is an issue-advocacy nonprofit in Arlington, Virginia. It has spent $889,145 on large postcards and online advertisements for Amendment H, <a href="https://sdcfr.sdsos.gov/Search/FiledCommunicationExpenditures.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to reports filed with the South Dakota Secretary of State’s Office</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the postcards feature images of soldiers with tape over their mouths, along with a claim that Amendment H would “protect veteran voters” who “aren’t able to participate fully in our political process.”</p>
<p>That claim is related to South Dakota’s current primary election system, in which Republicans only allow Republicans to vote, while Democrats allow Democrats and independents.</p>
<p><a href="https://southdakotasearchlight.com/ballot-measures/amendment-h-open-primaries/" target="_blank">Amendment H</a>, one of seven statewide questions on South Dakotans’ Nov. 5 ballot, proposes opening up future primary elections and placing all candidates, regardless of party, on a single ballot open to all voters. The top two vote-getters would advance to the general election. In races with two winners, such as state House districts, the top four would advance to the general election.</p>
<p>Some veterans have <a href="https://www.dakotanewsnow.com/2024/10/18/south-dakota-veterans-upset-with-yes-amendment-h-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spoken out against</a> the Article IV postcards, saying they use veterans as props for a political agenda, and also saying veterans are currently able to register for a political party and participate in the party’s primary election. Some of Article IV’s other postcards are more generally supportive of Amendment H and do not mention veterans.</p>
<h4 class="editorialSubhed">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">More about Article IV</h4>

	</h4>
<p>Article IV is a 501(c)(4), a type of nonprofit sometimes described as a “<a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/dark-money/basics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dark money</a>” group because it’s allowed to engage in political campaigns and doesn’t have to publicly disclose its donors.</p>
<p>Nobody from Article IV returned messages from South Dakota Searchlight, and the <a href="https://www.articlefour.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">group’s website</a> reveals few details beyond a mission to “improve the health of American democracy by instituting reforms that align citizens’ interests with politicians’ incentives.” The website also describes a form of open primaries as a solution: “Top-4 and Top-5 nonpartisan primaries where everyone, regardless of party, can participate are better than the alternative.”</p>
<p>Some information about the group is available in public IRS documents that nonprofits are required to file. Article IV’s <a href="https://apps.irs.gov/pub/epostcard/cor/862820532_202212_990O_2023112922017017.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2022 filing</a> — the most recent one located by Searchlight — said the group had $11 million in revenue and made contributions to primary reform efforts across the country, such as a $12,600 donation to Open Primaries Inc., $342,000 to Oregon Ranked Choice Voting and $400,000 to Utah Ranked Choice Voting.</p>
<h4 class="editorialSubhed">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">In-state campaign finance data</h4>

	</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, in-state supporters and opponents of open primaries have formed ballot question committees, which are required to disclose donors and additional details about fundraising and spending.</p>
<p>A pro-Open Primaries ballot question committee spent $439,211 on advertising between May and Oct. 15, according to its latest campaign finance report, while opponents spent $18,481.</p>
<p><a href="https://sdcfr.sdsos.gov/Search/SearchResults.aspx?cid=1382&amp;rid=3321" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South Dakota Open Primaries</a> Chair Joe Kirby said his ballot question committee does not have direct contact with Article IV, nor does the committee have control of what the organization advertises.</p>
<p>That’s “the way the system works,” Kirby added.</p>
<p>“That happens to politicians, too: Outsiders spending money for or against them,” Kirby said, adding that there is a national interest in election reform. “There’s not much you can do about that. Outside interests have a big say in all elections, including the governor and congressional delegation. It’s not unique to our ballot issue.”</p>
<p>In another example of outside “dark money” influencing a South Dakota ballot question this year, supporters of an amendment that would restore abortion rights in South Dakota <a href="https://southdakotasearchlight.com/2024/10/24/anti-abortion-groups-campaign-finance-fundraise-spending-amendment-g-ahead-of-election/" target="_blank">received $540,000 in donations</a> from Think Big America, an issue-advocacy nonprofit in Illinois.</p>
<p>Article IV spent its own money directly on advertising rather than donating to the Open Primaries ballot question committee. The Open Primaries committee has raised over $750,000 since May, mainly from a group of business leaders in Sioux Falls, while opponents hadn’t broken $100,000 in fundraising a week before the election.</p>
<p>Three-fourths of the Open Primaries ballot question committee’s $777,225 in fundraising came from eight households in southeastern South Dakota.</p>
<p>Those eight are:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">$250,000 in total contributions from chair of the committee Joe Kirby and his wife, Jennifer, of Sioux Falls.</li>
<li aria-level="1">$110,000 from Dave Knudson, a Sioux Falls lawyer and former South Dakota lawmaker, and his wife Deanna, who serves as treasurer of the committee.</li>
<li aria-level="1">$103,400 from gas station and convenience store chain Heinz Inc. owner Tom Heinz and wife, Jane Heinz, of Dakota Dunes.</li>
<li aria-level="1">$50,000 from Matt Paulson, of Sioux Falls, owner and founder of MarketBeat.</li>
<li aria-level="1">$25,000 from Dana Dykhouse, of Sioux Falls, CEO of First PREMIER Bank.</li>
<li aria-level="1">$25,000 from Dan Kirby, of Kirby Financial in Sioux Falls and Joe Kirby’s brother.</li>
<li aria-level="1">$25,000 from Nathan Peterson, of Sioux Falls.</li>
<li aria-level="1">$10,000 from Kevin Schieffer, of Sioux Falls, former president of the South Dakota Board of Regents.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other major contributions include $100,000 from Marc Merill, co-founder and former CEO of Riot Games, in Santa Monica, California, and $25,000 apiece from Avera Health and First PREMIER Bank, both based in Sioux Falls.</p>
<p>Opponents to Amendment H formed the <a href="https://sdcfr.sdsos.gov/Search/SearchResults.aspx?cid=1580&amp;rid=3394" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vote No on H ballot question committee</a> and raised $90,276. The ballot question committee’s largest contribution was $35,000 from James Koehler, an Aberdeen businessman and namesake of the Northern State University Koehler Hall of Fame Field.</p>

<p>Nearly eight  in 10 U.S. voters say that the economy is one of the most important issues to them in this upcoming presidential election, <a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/the-economy-tops-voters-minds-as-they-consider-their-vote-in-the-upcoming-election/" target="_blank">according to</a> an AP-NORC poll conducted in September. Although 66% of voters say the economy is very or somewhat poor, six in 10 also  say their personal finances are good.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/millions-americans-flock-early-voting-person-and-mail" target="_blank">Millions have already cast their ballots</a> through early or mail voting. But those who are still deciding between the two main candidates – Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump – have until Nov. 5 to wade through various myths and exaggerations to understand the state of the economy and each candidate’s record on related issues.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What is the state of inflation in the U.S.? </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The most recent cycle of inflation reached its peak in June 2022 at 9.1%. Inflation has fallen considerably since then and to a more manageable 2.4% in September’s Consumer Price Index, a measure of inflation. Wage growth, meanwhile, has beaten inflation for more than a year. The Federal Reserve <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/fed-says-its-long-awaited-rate-cut-apolitical-even-close-presidential-election" target="_blank">cut its key interest  rate</a> by half of a percentage point for the first time in four years in September after inflation <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20240918a.htm" target="_blank">neared </a> toward its goal of 2%.</p>
<p>But those macro figures don’t hit home with everyone, because of the prices of groceries and other essentials.</p>
<p>The literal prices that people see on goods make them think that they’re not doing as well because they feel that they are higher than they think they should be,” said Elise Gould, senior economist at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. But, those prices are actually lower as a share of their wages than they were four years ago.”</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that many voters’ experiences of struggling to afford basic items aren’t real. The cost of housing is very high and puts a strain on people’s budgets. The Fed’s interest rate policy affected <a href="https://washingtonstatestandard.com/2024/08/26/us-credit-card-debt-continues-to-rise-as-housing-and-other-costs-remain-high-for-the-lowest-earners/" target="_blank">credit card rates</a>, and thus, people’s ability to make purchases.</p>
<p>Gould said that despite the positive news of slowing inflation, the lack of long-term wage growth before this recent increase has been hard on many Americans.</p>
<p>“Even though things are good, we know that for the vast majority of people over the last several decades, they’ve been faced with relatively slow wage growth and so it can be hard to feel like you’re going to get ahead,” she said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Was unemployment higher under Biden or Trump? </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The unemployment rate under Donald Trump was fairly low, at 4.7%, when he took office in 2017 , and it mostly trended lower until the beginning of the pandemic. It then shot up to 14.8% in April 2020 and fell sharply for the rest of Trump’s term, which ended in January 2021. The unemployment rate was 6.7% during Trump’s last full month in office.</p>
<p>The labor market has been fairly hot under President Joe Biden. The unemployment rate was 6.4% during the month he and Harris were sworn into office. But since then, it largely fell, and from February 2022 to April 2024, the unemployment rate was below 4%. In September, the unemployment rate was 4.1% but the economy continues to show strong job growth.</p>
<p>Looking at the Biden-Harris administration’s record and Trump’s record outside of the immediate economic impact of the recession and supply shocks during their presidencies, unemployment remained fairly low. Overall, unemployment <a href="https://www.epi.org/blog/seven-reasons-why-todays-economy-is-historically-strong/" target="_blank">averaged</a> 3.8% since 2022 and averaged 4% between 2017 and 2019, before the pandemic hit the economy in 2020.</p>
<p>Labor force participation rates and the employment-to-population ratio, measures of the number of people in the labor force and workers employed versus the working age population, were high in the <a href="https://missouriindependent.com/briefs/unemployment-ticks-down-labor-market-remains-strong-latest-numbers-show/" target="_blank">last jobs report</a> and show signs of a healthy labor market.</p>
<p>Skanda Amarnath, executive director of Employ America, a left-leaning group focusing on economic policies, said that it’s also important to understand the percentage of the population adjusting for age, the prime age employment rate. It is marginally higher now, by about 0.3%, than it was right before Covid struck, during the Trump administration, he said.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen generally slower paces of employment gains more recently and that might be just because a lot of people are now back in the labor force itself. It’s probably a little harder to grow employment quickly when you’re coming from a high level as opposed to a low level,” Amarnath said. “Nevertheless, we’re at an employment rate where there’s been a reasonably strong labor demand, a little bit combined with the fact that people are also moving out into their retirement years.”</p>
<p>The American Rescue Plan Act, CHIPS and Science Act, Inflation Reduction Act, and bipartisan infrastructure deal, enacted during Biden’s presidency, helped fuel the recovery, Amarnath said. The CARES Act, which was signed into law byTrump, likely helped the U.S. avoid a protracted recession, he added.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What would Trump’s proposed  tariffs do to the U.S. economy</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In an interview with John Micklethwait, editor-in-chief of Bloomberg News at the Economic Club of Chicago on Oct. 15, former president Trump <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-live-trump-joins-interview-forum-at-the-economic-club-of-chicago" target="_blank">said</a> tariffs would be good for economic growth.</p>
<p>“We’re going to bring companies back to our country … We’re going to protect those companies with strong tariffs because I’m a believer in tariffs,” he said.</p>
<p>The Trump campaign has also proposed a 60% tariff on goods from China, one of the U.S.’s largest trading partners, and 10-to-20% on other imports. The Tax Foundation, a business-friendly research think tank, <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/trump-tariffs-biden-tariffs/" target="_blank">estimated</a> that if Trump’s proposed tariffs were to be implemented, it would reduce GDP by at least 0.8% and eliminate 684,000 jobs.</p>
<p>Tariffs would likely result in lower trade and retaliatory tariffs from other countries, raising prices, and costing each household between $1,900 to $7,600 in 2023 in dollars, <a href="https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/fiscal-macroeconomic-and-price-estimates-tariffs-under-both-non-retaliation-and-retaliation" target="_blank">according to</a> the Budget Lab at Yale, a nonpartisan policy research center.</p>
<p>“If the tariff wars back in President Trump’s first term are any indication, they’re going to respond with their own tariffs and other trade actions,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “Broadly, tariffs are going to raise prices for imported goods, weaken consumer purchasing power and slow growth.”</p>
<p>Zandi added that although the retail sector would be particularly hard hit by these tariffs, he doesn’t think any industry would come away unscathed by the policy.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How do Harris and Trump’s economic plans compare? </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Harris has said her plans, which include building more affordable housing supply, restoring and expanding the child tax credit, and supporting legislation to expand labor rights, have been approved by respected economists and sources of financial research.</p>
<p>“Please do check out the Wall Street Journal or Goldman Sachs or the 16 Nobel laureates or Moody’s, who have all analyzed the plans and said mine will strengthen the economy, his will make it weaker,” Harris <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/10/14/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-at-a-campaign-event-erie-pa/" target="_blank">said</a>.</p>
<p>The reality is a little more complicated. Some of the reports Harris referred to do not say the economy would weaken under Trump but would grow less than the economy under Harris in certain scenarios, depending on the political breakdown in Congress.</p>
<p>Others show the GDP falling more as a result of Harris’ proposals. The Penn Wharton Budget Model looking at Trump and Harris proposals shows the GDP <a href="https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2024/8/26/trump-campaign-policy-proposals-2024" target="_blank">falling</a> 0.4% under Trump by 2034 and declining <a href="https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2024/8/26/harris-campaign-policy-proposals-2024" target="_blank">1.3%</a> under Harris over the same period, but notably, it does not factor in proposals not to tax tips, mentioned by both candidates, or Trump’s tariff policies.</p>
<p>Before Biden withdrew his candidacy, 16 Nobel-prize winning economists said Biden’s investments in the economy through signing legislation to improve infrastructure and manufacturing would boost economic growth. They spoke out against Trump’s tariff plans. Although Harris is part of the Biden administration, they did not address her specific plans as a candidate. On Wednesday, 23 Nobel-prize winning economists, including the economist who led the last letter, Joseph Stiglitz, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/23/nobel-prize-winning-economists-donald-trump-agenda-endorse-harris.html" target="_blank">endorsed</a> Harris’ specific policies.</p>

Glenn Youngkin’s executive order that resulted in the removal of over 6,000 Virginians from the state’s voter rolls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stay pauses a lower court’s ruling that would have required the state to restore 1,600 voters to the rolls, allowing Youngkin’s directive to remain in effect and voter removals to continue as the case proceeds. The high court’s decision drew praise from Youngkin and laments from the voter rights groups suing him and the state.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court’s six conservative justices supported the stay, with the three liberals dissenting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin in a statement hailed the court’s decision as “a victory for commonsense and election fairness.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am grateful for the work of Attorney General Jason Miyares on this critical fight to protect the fundamental rights of U.S. citizens. Clean voter rolls are one important part of a comprehensive approach we are taking to ensure the fairness of our elections,” Youngkin said, adding that the ruling would ensure a secure election on Nov. 5.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginians can cast their ballots on Election Day knowing that Virginia’s elections are fair, secure, and free from politically-motivated interference,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The order comes after the Virginia Republican Party filed </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/29/virginia-gop-calls-on-u-s-supreme-court-to-reinstate-youngkins-voter-purge-order/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an amicus brief</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tuesday supporting Youngkin’s efforts, arguing that removing noncitizens from the voter rolls should not be delayed due to the federally mandated “quiet period” — a buffer period around elections meant to avoid disruptions to voter records. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Republican brief argues that the governor’s order was based on data from the Department of Motor Vehicles and focused on noncitizens, and thus does not constitute a “systematic” voter purge restricted by the quiet period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opposition to the order has come from various groups, including former GOP lawmakers such as Barbara Comstock, Denver Riggleman, and Adam Kinzinger, who filed </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A407/330589/20241029151116178_333985%20Amicus%20on%20Application.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a separate brief </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">urging the Supreme Court to deny the stay. They argue that hastily removing voters could lead to eligible citizens losing their rights, citing concerns over the potential exclusion of legitimate voters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares and Youngkin’s administration maintain that the executive order is a necessary step for election security. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement released Wednesday, Miyares called the Supreme Court ruling a win for election integrity and the rule of law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While I am gratified the court moved so quickly, I remain deeply concerned and alarmed that the Biden-Harris administration chose to execute this maneuver just 25 days before an election,” he said of </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/14/voter-purge-lawsuits-add-to-disenfranchisement-allegations-against-youngkin-administration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filed earlier this month by the Justice Department that challenges Youngkin’s executive order. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Critics, however — including the Virginia Center for Immigrant Rights and the League of Women Voters’s Virginia chapter, who are suing Youngkin and the state — argue that the purge risks disenfranchising Virginians and disproportionately impacts minority voters, calling the move part of a larger trend of restrictive voting policies. Representatives of the groups and their lawyers said they were “disappointed” with the Supreme Court’s decision in a virtual press conference held Wednesday afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryan Snow, counsel with the Lawyers Committee For Civil Rights Under Law, called the decision by the nation’s highest court an “abuse of power.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bert Bayou with African Communities Together said that the state’s and high court’s actions </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are &#8220;sending a disturbing message that (immigrant’s) voices are not valued, not wanted, and not American.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are living in a political climate that is fanning the flames of xenophobia,” he added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orion Danjuma, counsel with Protect Democracy, noted how a similar situation was also recently settled in Alabama. A federal judge </span><a href="https://alabamareflector.com/2024/10/16/federal-judge-blocks-alabama-secretary-of-states-voter-removal-plan/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blocked </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alabama’s voter roll purge program after the Department of Justice had filed a similar suit last month as it did to Virginia. When Virginia requested its stay to the U.S. Supreme Court, Alabama’s Attorney General </span><a href="https://www.alabamaag.gov/alabama-joins-25-state-coalition-urging-u-s-supreme-court-to-grant-emergency-motion-so-virginia-is-not-forced-to-add-noncitizens-to-its-voter-rolls/#:~:text=(Montgomery%2C%20Ala)%20%E2%80%93%20Alabama,rolls%20for%20the%20upcoming%20election." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">signed onto an amicus brief</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in support of the request. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Danjuma stressed that the programs “disenfranchise eligible voters” and that organizations like his will continue to challenge them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While this is a serious setback to voters for this election, we want to make clear that we will be continuing to expose problems with the state&#8217;s program so that they can be corrected in the future,” he said. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">State lawmakers react</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s statehouse leaders shared a variety of responses to the news on Wednesday, reflecting both support for SCOTUS’ decision and dismay due to it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, who has been outspoken in his opposition to Youngkin’s executive order, posted to X that the stay SCOTUS granted “does not equal a win.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unfortunately, The Governor&#8217;s scheme to block legal eligible (Virginia) voters has temporarily worked. It&#8217;s a sad day for the Commonwealth and the country,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, state Sen. John McGuire, a member of the body’s Privileges and Elections subcommittee and a candidate for Virginia’s 5th Congressional District seat, commended the Youngkin administration for &#8220;leading the charge to keep our elections secure.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “This is simple: noncitizens shouldn’t be able to vote, and I’m glad the Supreme Court agrees,&#8221; McGuire stated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As chair of the Senate Privileges and Elections Committee, Sen. Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach had written a letter to Commissioner of Elections Susan Beals on Sep. 27, seeking more information on how the removals were handled under Youngkin’s Aug. 7 executive order and whether non-citizens were facing prosecution for attempting to register.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his letter Rouse referenced a Fox News </span><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6360067628112" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Youngkin did the day of his executive order where he claimed that his order would lead to “immediate” removal of people and subsequent prosecution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rouse asked Beals if registrars were referring people to commonwealth&#8217;s attorneys. In her Oct. 8 response to Rouse, Beals did not answer whether registrars had referred non-citizens to local prosecutors.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="DoFiHerc2c"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/over-1600-people-removed-from-voter-rolls-under-youngkin-order-groups-seek-court-injunction/">Over 1,600 people removed from voter rolls under Youngkin order; groups seek court injunction</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Over 1,600 people removed from voter rolls under Youngkin order; groups seek court injunction&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/over-1600-people-removed-from-voter-rolls-under-youngkin-order-groups-seek-court-injunction/embed/#?secret=eOvHIIJRpF#?secret=DoFiHerc2c" data-secret="DoFiHerc2c" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plaintiffs in the case against the state argue there has been no evidence of people being prosecuted for attempting to vote illegally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have tried to get straight answers from this Administration,” Rouse said Wednesday. “It took the U.S. Department of Justice filing suit and a federal judge forcing the Youngkin administration to disclose the names of those removed and confirm what we feared: that in fact eligible Virginia voters have been stripped from the rolls.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that he and members of his committee will “work to ensure that these disenfranchised voters are educated as to the procedures for casting a valid provisional ballot.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What the situation could mean for Virginia voters, on Election Day and beyond</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the stay in place, the case is likely to continue drawing national attention as the election nears, spotlighting debates over voting rights, citizenship and electoral integrity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It could also lead to confusion at the polls next Tuesday, because it remains unclear what information voters who have been purged would need to show for same-day registration, said Henry Chambers, a professor for constitutional law at the University of Richmond School of Law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The administration is claiming that there is sufficient evidence to knock someone off the rolls. If that’s true, and if a registrar has said this person shouldn’t be on the roll, I’m not sure what kind of information would convince the registrar that the person should be on the rolls and should have their provisional ballot counted. And that’s a tricky issue.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chambers added that it also remains unclear what the Supreme Court ruling means for the federal </span><a href="https://www.lwv.org/newsroom/press-releases/lawsuit-challenges-recent-voter-roll-purges-virginia-preventing-eligible-us" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">suit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filed by the Virginia Coalition for Immigrant Rights and the League of Women Voters of Virginia earlier this month which alleges that the process used to purge the rolls violates the 90-day quiet period and therefore disenfranchises eligible voters while raising concerns over transparency and accuracy in the state’s voter registration system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In theory, the case goes back to the drawing board and you need to run it as a sort of a regular merits case as opposed to just an injunction case. But the problem with that is that the point of the case is that the 90-day quiet period is going to be over once election day is done,” Chambers said. “Then the question becomes, is the purge program in and of itself unlawful in general?’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some state lawmakers have signaled they are ready to tackle that question, and </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/30/should-legislators-tweak-virginias-2006-voter-roll-law-for-more-clarity/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that undergirds it.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="3YaBAvmhuV"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/30/should-legislators-tweak-virginias-2006-voter-roll-law-for-more-clarity/">Should legislators tweak Virginia’s 2006 voter roll law for more clarity?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Should legislators tweak Virginia’s 2006 voter roll law for more clarity?&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/30/should-legislators-tweak-virginias-2006-voter-roll-law-for-more-clarity/embed/#?secret=nWMLNMqXI6#?secret=3YaBAvmhuV" data-secret="3YaBAvmhuV" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Sen. Travis Hackworth, R-Tazewell County, said in a phone interview Wednesday that in the 2025 legislative session, he would “be open to looking at anything” in the 2006 law that would limit potential confusion at the polls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The bottom line is, if you are a U.S. citizen, we want you to vote, it’s your right and duty to vote,” said Hackworth, a member of the Senate Privileges &amp; Election who was “very disheartened” when the lower court ruled to halt Youngkin’s order.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If any among the affected 1,600 Virginians believe they have been removed from the voter rolls in error, Hackworth urged them to still cast a provisional ballot bringing documentation proving their citizenship status and let the local electoral board “figure that out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think that maybe we are kind of overcomplicating this process, because anybody still has the right on the day of to say, ‘I have been purged from the voter rolls, I am a citizen of the United States, and I want to vote.’ If you have that much conviction to go to the polls and vote provisional, you will bring something that’s going to back up your claim that you are a citizen.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The situation has raised questions on whether state lawmakers should consider amending that law for additional clarity and to avoid future legal disputes over how Virginia confirms voter registration shortly before elections. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The 2006 law</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin has said repeatedly that his executive order was built on a 2006 state law for voter roll cleanups, which directs the Department of Motor Vehicles to send data to the State Board of Elections of people who failed to indicate U.S. citizenship in paperwork. There’s a process of notification and then purging of voters who fail to prove their citizenship, and in previous years, the process was done on a monthly basis. Youngkin’s order directed DMV and Elections Department officials to perform it daily.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuits the state and Youngkin face say Youngkin’s order ran afoul of the National Voter Registration Act, which institutes a “quiet period” on such actions 90 days before an election. Several state lawmakers have signaled they agree with that allegation, including House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, who </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/14/voter-purge-lawsuits-add-to-disenfranchisement-allegations-against-youngkin-administration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">previously told</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Mercury “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason that we have this 90-day rule is that we don’t want citizens to be accidentally removed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Privileges and Elections Committee chair Sen. Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach, called Youngkin’s order “reckless” and alleged that it’s being used to “fire up the (Republican) base.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you actually look at the issue of the matter, it’s the 90-day quiet period,” Rouse said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The courts will decide the matter concerning the legal challenges, John Aughenbaugh, a political science professor at Virginia Commonwealth University, said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But he added that the Youngkin administration “brought this on themselves” by issuing the order so close to the 90-day federal threshold.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Aughenbaugh said, “I can understand why <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/22/youngkin-blasts-doj-lawsuit-that-trust-virginias-voter-roll-removals-into-national-spotlight/">Youngkin told Fox News</a> ‘we didn’t think we were doing anything wrong,’” in citing the 2006 law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That measure was carried by former republican state Sen. Ken Cucinelli and signed by former Democratic Gov. Tim Kaine. At that time, Republican President George Bush’s Department of Justice had issued a memo that it didn’t object to the law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the time since, no one has challenged it, until the two suits against Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An argument in Attorney General Jason </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A407/330363/20241027231346621_Application%20for%20Stay%20SCOTUS%20vpf.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares’ Supreme Court filing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> notes confusion on when the federal 90-day law should overpower the 2006 state law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The current confusion surrounding the NVRA makes the rules anything but clear,” Miyares’ petition reads. “States are unaware of when, or whether, they can remove noncitizens from the voter rolls. They need to know with certainty whether they can remove noncitizens at any point, only outside of the Quiet Period, or never.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, the Republican National Committee and Republican Party of Virginia also </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/29/virginia-gop-calls-on-u-s-supreme-court-to-reinstate-youngkins-voter-purge-order/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filed a brief</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in support of the state’s SCOTUS request.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="PT197hFPSU"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/29/virginia-gop-calls-on-u-s-supreme-court-to-reinstate-youngkins-voter-purge-order/">Virginia GOP calls on U.S. Supreme Court to reinstate Youngkin’s voter purge order</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia GOP calls on U.S. Supreme Court to reinstate Youngkin’s voter purge order&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/29/virginia-gop-calls-on-u-s-supreme-court-to-reinstate-youngkins-voter-purge-order/embed/#?secret=Qu8rSVbz84#?secret=PT197hFPSU" data-secret="PT197hFPSU" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rouse said there hasn’t yet been talk between himself and other members of the Privileges and Elections Committee about tweaking the 2006 law to spell out the 90-day threshold of the NVRA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We haven&#8217;t had those conversations,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As to resolving any confusion, Sen. Bill Stanley, R-Franklin County, said that the state legislature broadly is always looking at ways past laws might need to be amended. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This might be one of those times,” he said. “The question then becomes ‘is there a bipartisan solution?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It might also come down to the question of how to prevent governors from overstepping or skirting federal law, as well as how to prevent presidential administrations from wading into state law, Aughenbaugh suspects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The debacle playing out on the national stage might prompt Virginia legislators to ask, “Did the Youngkin administration too broadly interpret the law? Do we want to rein-in gubernatorial administrations in the future?” Aughenbaugh posited. “Meanwhile, how do you revise the law so that future presidential administrations don’t single out a state for lawsuits two weeks before Election Day?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rouse said there’s valid reasons for those types of deliberations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s more of a bigger picture with Governor Youngkin in terms of inciting fear and undermining our elections,” Rouse said of conversations he’s having with his fellow lawmakers. “We understand that this administration has been known to make mistakes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rouse pointed to how the administration pulled out of ERIC, a multi-state data-sharing coalition meant to maintain voter roll accuracy — and how he </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/11/youngkin-blocks-democratic-bills-dealing-with-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> legislation prompting Virginia’s return to it this year, along with other voting-related bills. The administration also mistakenly canceled over </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/01/voting-rights-advocates-blast-youngkin-admin-over-error-affecting-3400/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3,000 people’s registrations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year, Rouse said. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Can same-day voter registration and provisional ballots fix it?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless of whether eligible voters were caught up in the recent purge or run into other election-access issues, registrars have said that use of same-day registration and provisional ballots </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/think-you-might-have-been-mistakenly-purged-from-virginias-voter-rolls-heres-what-to-do/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are an option</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would allow them to vote on Election Day. Provisional ballots require follow-up after voting to verify a person’s address, citizenship status or other factors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s an argument Republican national and state leadership is making as a reason Youngkin’s order and the subsequent voter purges should stand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even if a person entitled to vote were erroneously removed from the voter rolls and unable to respond to the Commonwealth’s outreach, they may still take advantage of same-day registration and cast a ballot,” the state’s request to the Supreme Court stated.  “No legal voters could or would be disenfranchised.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aughenbaugh doubts the nation’s highest court will grant Virginia’s request so close to the elections and  suspects people who have been purged may not have to resort to provisional ballots this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t think there are enough (Supreme Court) justices that have the appetite to wade into that dispute less than a week before elections,” he said. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A407/330552/20241029131746854_24A407%20Beals_SCOTUS_Amicus_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">its filing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the state GOP argues that the removal of illegally registered non-citizens from Virginia’s voter rolls should not be restricted by the “quiet period,” a federally mandated time frame close to an election during which systematic changes to the voter rolls are limited. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in a </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A407/330589/20241029151116178_333985%20Amicus%20on%20Application.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">separate amicus brief</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also filed on Tuesday, a group of prominent Republicans who formerly served in Congress and are outspoken critics of the GOP’s presidential nominee Donald Trump – including Denver Riggleman, Barbara Comstock and Adam Kinzinger — are urging the Supreme Court to deny Virginia’s request for an emergency stay and uphold the lower court’s ruling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In their filing, the former lawmakers argue that while the </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/national-voter-registration-act-1993-nvra" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> authorizes “truly individualized removals” of voters from the rolls at any time, the law specifically seeks to prevent sweeping purges that could disenfranchise eligible voters rather than targeted removals of ineligible individuals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To protect the right to vote from the inherent errors, vagaries, and bureaucratic swamp of last-minute systematic removals, Congress imposed the quiet period provision to protect voters in the immediate run-up to elections — at which point it might be impossible or impractical to correct a wrongfully terminated registration status,” the brief said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “daily systematic removal program” recently undertaken by Virginia is precisely what the NVRA’s quiet period provision forbids, the filing continues.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is not a close case; it is instead a paradigmatic violation of Congress’s design. The fact that this last-minute systematic program has in fact disenfranchised eligible Virginia voters only confirms the wisdom of the NVRA’s plan and the illegality of this scheme. To hold otherwise would thwart the bipartisan congressional consensus underlying the NVRA.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Republicans argue in their own filing from Tuesday that even if the NVRA applies to efforts to remove illegally registered noncitizens from the voter rolls, Virginia’s process is “sufficiently individualized” and that it does not constitute the kind of “systematic” effort to remove individuals from the voter rolls prohibited during the “quiet period.”</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Over 1,600 people removed from voter rolls under Youngkin order; groups seek court injunction&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/over-1600-people-removed-from-voter-rolls-under-youngkin-order-groups-seek-court-injunction/embed/#?secret=5TifZ8PSwI#?secret=PaMid6TgIU" data-secret="PaMid6TgIU" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GOP filing claims that the Virginia Department of Elections’ practice of comparing voter rolls with data from the Department of Motor Vehicles to identify non-citizens is selective enough to sidestep the restrictions imposed by the quiet period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Courts have correctly interpreted ‘systematically remove’ to mean programs that make decisions about voters’ eligibility based on mass information collected by third parties rather than individualized information or investigation,” the brief said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, the Republicans contend that allowing the lower court’s ruling to stand would cause “irreparable harm” as the Nov. 5 election nears. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The consequence of that order is that non-citizens — who all agree cannot legally vote — will be added back on the voter rolls at the last minute, diluting legitimate votes and exposing those non-citizens to a substantial risk of criminal prosecution should they misunderstand the lower courts’ order as a greenlight for them to vote unlawfully,” the filing said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GOP also asserts that there is no risk of harm to eligible voters if the executive order remains in effect. Virginia law allows same-day registration, providing an alternative for those erroneously removed to cast a ballot on Election Day. According to the amicus brief, “no legal voters could or would be disenfranchised” if the executive order is upheld.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares filed the commonwealth’s appeal to Chief Justice John G. Roberts, seeking a stay on federal Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles’ Oct. 25 order requiring the reinstatement of individuals removed from Virginia’s voter rolls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giles had ruled that Youngkin’s order, issued in August, may have inadvertently included eligible voters. The order directed the Department of Motor Vehicles to send daily lists of individuals identified as noncitizens to the State Board of Elections for immediate removal from voter rolls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the 2006 state law on which Youngkin’s directive is based calls for this process to occur on a monthly basis.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares addressed the stay to Chief Justice John G. Roberts, after federal Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles on Oct. 25 ordered people stripped from Virginia’s voter rolls to be reinstated because eligible voters may have been included in the state’s voter roll purges. Youngkin’s executive order directed the state DMV to send lists of people who identified as noncitizens to the state Board of Elections for daily removal from voter lists. The </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+sum+SB313" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2006 state law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Youngkin’s order is based on called for this process to occur monthly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The League of Women Voters, the Virginia Coalition for Immigrants Rights and the DOJ have </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/over-1600-people-removed-from-voter-rolls-under-youngkin-order-groups-seek-court-injunction/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filed separate lawsuits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against the state for the ramped up removals, citing instances where eligible voters who had made errors on their DMV paperwork had been removed, as well as people who became naturalized citizens after they filed their DMV paperwork. The groups also said the removals are systematic and happened within 90 days of Election Day, a violation of federal law. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/22/youngkin-blasts-doj-lawsuit-that-trust-virginias-voter-roll-removals-into-national-spotlight/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Miyares, both Republicans, have argued that the executive order merely reinforces the 2006 law implemented under a Democratic governor, and that the removals were individualized. They, and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, have characterized the legal challenges to the removals as politically-motivated actions that hinder the state’s ability to bar noncitizens from voting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a federal crime for noncitizens to vote, and there is no evidence that it’s a widespread problem in America. A Brennan Center for Justice survey held after the 2016 presidential election found</span><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/noncitizen-voting-missing-millions" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> just 30 instances of noncitizens voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> out of  23.5 million votes cast. </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/12/nx-s1-5147789/voting-election-2024-noncitizen-fact-check-trump" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent voter data audits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in states like Georgia and Arizona have revealed negligible cases of noncitizens voting.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giles’ order would “irreparably injure Virginia’s sovereignty, confuse her voters, overload her election machinery and administrators, and likely lead noncitizens to think they are permitted to vote, a criminal (offense) that will cancel the franchise of eligible voters,” Miyares wrote in the stay, requesting the high court issue it by Tuesday. Giles mandated that the state comply with her order to reinstate purged voters by Wednesday.</span></p>

(Photo by Melissa Sue Gerrits/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — As an exceedingly bitter, tight and dark campaign for the presidency moves into its last moments, apprehensive election officials and experts warn Election Day is only the first step.</p>
<p>The closing of the polls and end of mail-in voting kick off a nearly three-month process before the next president of the United States is sworn in on Inauguration Day in January. New guardrails were enacted by Congress in 2022 to more fully protect the presidential transition, following the Jan. 6, 2021 mob attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters and a failed scheme to install fake electors.</p>
<p>But even before that shift to a new chief executive begins, a presidential victor is unlikely to be announced election night or even the following day.</p>
<p>It’s a result that will possibly take days to determine, given tight margins expected in seven swing states. Officials needed four days to count all the votes to determine President Joe Biden the victor of the 2020 presidential election.</p>
<p>In states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, the law does not allow that process to begin for millions of mail-in ballots until Election Day. Other states allow pre-processing of ballots.</p>
<p>Trey Grayson, Kentucky’s former Republican secretary of state, said ballot authentication could be on different timelines across the country after voting ends on Election Day.</p>
<p>“We have 50 states, plus D.C., that pretty much all do it differently,” Grayson, who served as president of the National Association of Secretaries of State, told reporters Friday on a call of bipartisan former state election officials who are working to explain the process to the public.</p>
<p>It could mean “in a very close election that we don’t know on election night who the president is or who controls the House or the Senate, but we should feel confident over the next couple of days, as we work through that, that we’re going to get there,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Lawsuits and potential recounts </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Those delays, which former President Donald Trump seized on to spread the baseless lie that the election was stolen from him, are expected again in November, especially as all eyes will be on the battleground states — Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Additionally, there already are hundreds of pre-election lawsuits, mainly filed by Republicans, ranging from election integrity challenges to accusations of noncitizens allowed to vote in federal elections — something that rarely happens and is already illegal. The legal challenges could further spark delays.</p>
<p>“We will not have a winner on election night most likely and so we need to be able to prepare the public for this,” said Virginia Kase Solomón, the president and CEO of the democracy watchdog group Common Cause, during a Tuesday briefing.</p>
<p>She added that her organization will focus on combating misinformation and disinformation on election night and beyond.</p>
<p>“There is the potential that somebody could claim the win before … all of the votes have been counted,” she said.</p>
<p>In the early morning hours after Election Day in 2020, before results from key states were determined, Trump falsely claimed he won in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duE8tnrSmNc&amp;t=3s" target="_blank">an address at the White House.  </a></p>
<p>On top of that, experts say this year could see election denial erupting in countless courtrooms and meeting rooms in localities and the states, as well as across social media, if doubts are sown about the results.</p>
<p>Recounts could also delay an official election result, and the laws vary from state to state.</p>
<p>For example, in Pennsylvania, if a candidate demands a recount, three voters from each of the over 9,000 precincts have to petition for a recount.</p>
<p>“We’ve never seen that happen actually in Pennsylvania,” Kathy Boockvar, the commonwealth’s former Democratic secretary of state, said on Friday’s call with reporters.</p>
<p>An automatic statewide recount is triggered in Pennsylvania if there’s a difference of a half percent of all votes cast for the winner and loser. The final recount results, by law, are due to the secretary of state by Nov. 26, and results would be announced on Nov. 27, Boockvar said.</p>
<p>The margin in Pennsylvania’s 2020 results for the presidential election was between 1.1% and 1.2%, not enough to trigger the automatic recount, Boockvar said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Taking out the shrubs</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>State election officials have been preparing for the past year to train poll workers to not only run the voting booths but for possible violence — a precaution put in place after the 2020 election — and have beefed up security around polling locations.</p>
<p>On Friday, Trump posted on X that the election “will be under the closest professional scrutiny and, WHEN I WIN, those people that CHEATED will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law, which will include long term prison sentences so that this Depravity of Justice does not happen again.”</p>
<p>A reporter asked Grayson about the possibility of aggression from poll watchers. The Republican National Committee <a href="https://gop.com/press-release/trump-campaign-and-rnc-unveil-historic-100000-person-strong-election-integrity-program/" target="_blank">announced</a> in April a “historic move to safeguard the integrity of the electoral process,” establishing party-led trainings for poll watchers.</p>
<p>Poll watchers are not a new concept, and Grayson said clear “safeguards” are in place.</p>
<p>“If you’re intimidating, you’re gone. There’s clear laws in every state on that,” he said.</p>

<p>Celestine Jeffreys, the city clerk in Green Bay, Wisconsin, said during a Wednesday roundtable with election workers that the city has an Election Day protocol in place that includes everything from blocking off streets to City Hall to getting rid of shrubbery.</p>
<p>“We have actually removed bushes in front of City Hall” to ensure no one can be concealed behind them, she said. In the second assassination attempt on Trump earlier this year, a gunman hid in bushes outside Trump’s private golf course.</p>
<p>New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver said during a Tuesday briefing she is focused on the physical safety of election officials.</p>
<p>During the event with the National Association of Secretaries of State, she said such safety is not only a priority during voting but when officials move to certify the state’s election results in December.</p>
<p>“We have all been spending a lot more time on physical security and making sure that our election officials at all levels are more physically secure this year,” Toulouse Oliver said. “And of course, you know when our electors meet in our states, you know, ensuring for the physical security of that process and those individuals as well.”</p>
<p>On Dec. 17, each state’s electors will meet to vote for the president and vice president. Congress will vote to certify the results on Jan. 6.</p>
<p>“We are thinking a lot more about this in 2024 than we did in 2020, but I think that each one of us… have a playbook in mind for how to handle any unanticipated eventualities in the certification process,” she said.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/law-enforcement-officials-prepare-possible-post-election-violence-dc" target="_blank">It’s a security precaution</a> that the U.S. Secret Service is also taking.</p>
<p>For the first time, Congress’ certification of the Electoral College on Jan. 6 has been designated a National Special Security Event, something that is usually reserved for Inauguration Day on Jan. 20.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The 2020 experience</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In 2020, The Associated Press did not call the presidential election for Biden <a href="https://blog.ap.org/behind-the-news/calling-the-2020-presidential-race-state-by-state" target="_blank">until</a> 11:26 a.m. Saturday, Nov. 7 — roughly three-and-a-half days after polls closed. The AP, as well as other media organizations, project election winners after local officials make initial tabulations public.</p>
<p>Those tallies are then <a href="https://www.eac.gov/election-officials/election-results-canvass-and-certification" target="_blank">canvassed, audited and certified</a>, according to each state’s legal timeline. Recounts may also extend the timeline before final certification.</p>
<p>The vote totals reported in Pennsylvania — a state that carried 20 Electoral College votes in 2020 — put Biden over the top for the 270 needed to win the presidency.</p>
<p>Trump refused to concede the race, and instead promised to take his fight to court.</p>
<p>For the next two months, Trump and his surrogates filed <a href="https://electioncases.osu.edu/case-tracker/?sortby=filing_date_desc&amp;keywords=&amp;status=all&amp;state=all&amp;topic=25" target="_blank">just over 60 lawsuits</a> challenging the results in numerous states. Ultimately none of the judges found evidence of widespread voter fraud.</p>
<p>The next step was for Congress to <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2014-title3/html/USCODE-2014-title3-chap1-sec15.htm" target="_blank">count</a> each state’s certified slate of electors, which by law, it must do on the Jan. 6 following a presidential election.</p>
<p>However, in the weeks leading up to Jan. 6, Trump and his private lawyers worked to replace legitimate slates of electors with fake ones, according to <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/collection/january-6th-committee-final-report?path=/GPO/January%206th%20Committee%20Final%20Report%20and%20Supporting%20Materials%20Collection" target="_blank">hundreds</a> of <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/67656604/266/2/united-states-v-trump/" target="_blank">pages</a> of records compiled by a special congressional investigation, and by the U.S. Department of Justice.</p>
<p>Trump pressured then-Vice President Mike Pence to block ratification of the Electoral College’s vote at the Jan. 6 joint session of Congress, because the vice president’s role in the certification of electoral votes was not exactly clear in the Electoral Count Act of 1887.</p>
<p>Pence ultimately refused.</p>
<p>Thousands of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 following a “Stop the Steal” rally at The Ellipse park, south of the White House, where Trump told the crowd “We will never concede.”</p>
<p>The mob assaulted police officers, broke windows to climb inside and hurled violent threats aimed at elected officials, including the desire to “hang” Pence. More than 1,500 defendants <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/44-months-jan-6-attack-us-capitol" target="_blank">have been charged</a> by the Department of Justice.</p>
<p>Congress stopped its process of reviewing the state electors in the 2 p.m. Eastern hour as police ushered the lawmakers to safety. The joint session resumed at roughly 11:30 p.m., and Pence called the majority of electoral votes for Biden at nearly 4 a.m. on Jan. 7.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">New law on presidential transition</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>To deter another Jan. 6 insurrection, Congress <a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2022/09/28/key-u-s-senate-panel-advances-bill-aimed-at-preventing-another-jan-6/" target="_blank">passed</a> the <a href="https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/JRQ121922.PDF" target="_blank">Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transitional Improvement Act of 2022</a> as part of a massive appropriations bill.</p>
<p>The Electoral Count Reform Act codifies into law that the vice president, who also serves as the president of the U.S. Senate, only ceremoniously reads aloud a roll call of the votes.</p>
<p>Most notably, the provision raises the threshold for lawmakers to make an objection to electors. Previously, only one U.S. House representative and one U.S. senator would need to make an objection to an elector or slate of electors.</p>
<p>But under the new law, it would take one-fifth of members to lodge an objection and under very specific standards — 87 House members and 20 senators.</p>
<p>The Electoral Count Reform Act also identifies that each state’s governor is the official responsible for submitting the state’s official document that identifies the state’s appointed electors, and says that Congress cannot accept that document from any official besides the governor, unless otherwise specified by the state’s law.</p>
<p>Trump and his allies tried to replace legitimate slates of electors in several states with fake electors who would cast ballots for Trump.</p>
<p>The Presidential Transitional Improvement Act provides candidates with funding and resources for transitional planning, even if a candidate has not conceded after the election.</p>
<p>There are already issues with the transition of power. The top Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin, <a href="https://oversightdemocrats.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/democrats-oversight.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2024-10-23.JBR%20to%20Trump%20and%20Vance%20re%20transition%20MOUs.pdf" target="_blank">sent a Wednesday letter</a> to Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, urging them to sign documents to ensure a peaceful transition of power.</p>
<p>“With fewer than three weeks left until an election in which the American people will select a new President of the United States, I urge you to put the public’s interest in maintaining a properly functioning government above any personal financial or political interests you may perceive in boycotting the official transition law and process,” Raskin wrote.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Denial expected at all levels of government</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Experts warn the effort to delay certification of the vote is largely being fought at the local and state levels, and that several groups are gearing up to sow doubt in the election outcome.</p>
<p>Devin Burghart, president of the Institute for Research and Education on Human Rights, said on a press call Wednesday that since 2020, “election denial has shifted away from the capital to county election commission meetings, courtrooms, cyber symposiums and countless conspiracies in preparation for a repeat this November.”</p>
<p>“This time, the baseless claim that undocumented immigrants are somehow swamping the polls has fueled the ‘big lie’ machine,” Burghart said.</p>
<p>Boockvar said the noncitizen topic is not new.</p>
<p>“I’d like to level set and remind everyone that it’s been illegal at the federal level since 1996 and you know, when you think back on 2002 the <a href="https://www.eac.gov/about/help_america_vote_act.aspx" target="_blank">Help America Vote Act</a> basically required voters to provide ID when they register, which is usually a driver’s license or a Social Security number, and states are checking that data against the DMV database. And these protections are enormously successful,” Boockvar said.</p>
<p>In two high-profile cases, the U.S. Department of Justice sued Republican-led efforts in <a href="https://alabamareflector.com/2024/10/16/federal-judge-blocks-alabama-secretary-of-states-voter-removal-plan/" target="_blank">Alabama</a> and <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/judge-orders-people-removed-from-voter-rolls-to-be-reinstated-gov-youngkin-to-seek-appeal/">Virginia</a> to purge voter rolls after alleging thousands of noncitizens were registered to vote. Both states were ordered to stop the programs and reinstate voters – though Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin promised Friday to appeal and even escalate to the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2024/10/22/georgia-supreme-court-delays-ruling-on-controversial-election-board-rules-until-after-nov-5/" target="_blank">Georgia</a>, the state’s Supreme Court delayed new rules until after this election that would have required three poll workers at every precinct to count ballots by hand once the polls closed — essentially delaying unofficial election results.</p>
<p>More than 165 electoral process lawsuits across 37 states have been filed by both parties since 2023 leading up to the 2024 presidential election, according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-election-court-lawsuits-influence-voting/" target="_blank">survey</a> by Bloomberg of pre-election cases. The journalists found that more than half the cases have been filed in swing states, and challenge almost every facet of the voting process, from absentee voting, to voter roll management, voter eligibility and vote certification.</p>
<p>Republican and conservative groups have filed roughly 55% of the lawsuits, mostly aimed at narrowing who can vote, and overall most of the cases were filed in August and September, according to the analysis.</p>
<p>Courts threw out dozens of lawsuits claiming voter fraud in 2020.</p>
<p>Mai Ratakonda, senior counsel at States United Democracy Center, said anti-democracy groups have used litigation “to legitimize their efforts to sow doubt in our election system.”</p>
<p>“We’ve unfortunately continued to see this trend of filing lawsuits to bolster and legitimize narratives that our elections are insecure and laying the groundwork to contest results later,” Ratakonda told reporters on a press call Wednesday hosted by the organization, whose stated mission is to protect nonpartisan election administration.</p>

Glenn Youngkin’s PAC to boost congressional candidates in Virginia and excite the state’s GOP base. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/u-s-house-minority-leader-jeffries-rnc-co-chair-lara-trump-stump-for-va-congressional-candidates/">Lara Trump</a>, co-chair of the Republican National Committee and Trump’s daughter-in-law, was one of several speakers at the event, including Youngkin, Virginia <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/25/spanberger-and-earle-sears-tied-in-first-2025-gubernatorial-poll/">Lt. Gov. Winsome Sears</a>, U.S. Senate hopeful <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/07/kaine-faces-off-against-gop-challenger-cao-in-high-stakes-u-s-senate-race/">Hung Cao</a> and 1st Congressional District incumbent U.S. Rep. <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/21/leslie-mehta-hopes-to-flip-virginias-republican-leaning-1st-congressional-district/">Rob Wittman</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“November 5 is going to be the biggest, most important day in the history of our country,” Trump said on his phone call to Youngkin and rally-goers. “We win Virginia, it&#8217;s over.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While he and his opponent <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/26/strategists-analysts-see-excitement-and-pathways-for-kamala-harris-in-virginia/">Vice President Kamala Harris</a> have spent a lot of time campaigning in battleground states seen as key to winning the presidency like Pennsylvania, Arizona and North Carolina, Trump said he thinks “Virginia is still in play.”</span></p>
<p>Democratic Party of Virginia chairwoman Susan Swecker disagreed, saying in a statement &#8220;Donald Trump knows he can&#8217;t win Virginia, so he is trying to exploit Glenn Youngkin&#8217;s illegal voter purge to satisfy his own sick obsessions.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump announced in his call that his campaign has a rally planned for </span><a href="https://event.donaldjtrump.com/events/president-donald-j-trump-to-hold-a-rally-in-salem-virginia?_gl=1*1h0mb8v*_gcl_au*MjA5NDc3OTMwLjE3Mjk2NDEyOTY.&amp;_ga=2.215556695.1387519888.1729889779-1039229875.1721857634" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nov. 2 in Salem, Virginia.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> He</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also stressed his goals to build a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border and enhance funding for border security measures in his phoned-in comments, sentiments echoed by the day’s other speakers. He repeated false allegations that other countries are releasing people from prisons and mental institutions to illegally enter the U.S., highlighting</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/08/convention-delegates-virginia-voters-reflect-on-immigration-policy-ahead-of-presidential-election/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> immigration reform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a priority issue of his campaign. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin encouraged early voting and played defense during his speech at the rally, vowing again to challenge a federal judge’s Oct. 25 </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/judge-orders-people-removed-from-voter-rolls-to-be-reinstated-gov-youngkin-to-seek-appeal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the state to pause its voter removal process and reinstate about 1,600 people who had been removed from voting rolls as authorized by Youngkin’s Executive Order 35.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re going to take this all the way to the Supreme Court,” he said and was met with cheers from the crowd. Youngkin and the state face two lawsuits over the voter roll removals, one from the Department of Justice, which have placed Virginia at the center of national dialogue about </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/22/youngkin-blasts-doj-lawsuit-that-trust-virginias-voter-roll-removals-into-national-spotlight/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voter access and election security ahead of the Nov. 5 election</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The lawsuits<a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/over-1600-people-removed-from-voter-rolls-under-youngkin-order-groups-seek-court-injunction/"> allege</a> that the voter removals impacted eligible voters who may have made errors on their DMV paperwork that triggered the state Department of Elections to boot them from rolls, or people who became citizens after indicating otherwise on DMV forms. Republicans have framed the lawsuits as politically-motivated actions that hinder the state&#8217;s ability to block non-citizens from voting, which is already illegal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lara Trump reflected on the political violence that unfolded July 13 during her speech, as she recalled the assassination attempt on Trump’s life that day. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not even a bullet was enough to stop this man, and that is why we are backing him all across this country,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She stressed the importance of supporting candidates from the top to bottom of tickets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Make sure you remember that Donald Trump needs a (Republican-controlled) Congress to work alongside (of him),” Lara Trump said. “Vote the whole ticket down!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the governor and both Trumps’ comments were focal points of the rally, Wittman and Cao got some stage time as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his speech, Wittman noted the Republican priorities of working to address inflation as well as support for law enforcement. He, and nearly every speaker, quoted former Republican President Ronald Reagan —  “peace through strength” — regarding goals to tighten border security and support the U.S. Military. </span></p>

Rob Wittman, R-Westmoreland, speaks at an early vote rally in Chesterfield on Oct. 26, 2024. (Charlotte Rene Woods\Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wittman, who has typically won re-election by or over 20% margins since 2007, has seen occasional narrowing in recent years, winning his 2018 contest against Democrat Lavangelene Aereka Williams by 10.5%. This year’s democratic challenger, Leslie Mehta, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/21/leslie-mehta-hopes-to-flip-virginias-republican-leaning-1st-congressional-district/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hopes to flip the seat.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cao said he is running “against the other Tim,” in reference to both Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz and Cao’s opponent, U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine. Kaine ran for vice president in 2016 alongside presidential hopeful Hilary Clinton, who lost to Trump. Cao said that voters this year have a chance to make both Tims “failed vice presidential candidates.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The  rally in Chesterfield was part of a series Youngkin’s political action committee Spirit of Virginia is hosting to boost GOP candidates statewide and encourage early voting. Despite Republican opposition to early voting in the past, Youngkin’s PAC has pressed for people to utilize it since last year’s General Assembly elections and, when </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/28/trump-rallies-in-chesapeake-backed-by-virginia-governor-gop-leaders/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump visited Chesapeake</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this past summer, the governor stressed its use then, as well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later in the day Youngkin was scheduled to appear in Farmville with U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, to support  state Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland in his bid to represent the 5th Congressional District </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/17/witt-and-mcguire-square-off-in-sole-5th-district-debate/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">against</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Democrat Gloria Witt. Jordan also visited Virginia Beach Friday night to support U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, who’s </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/02/kiggans-and-smasal-face-off-in-highly-competitive-2nd-district/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">facing off</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against Democrat Missy Cotter Smasal. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Department of Justice</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/14/voter-purge-lawsuits-add-to-disenfranchisement-allegations-against-youngkin-administration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sued </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">the state and Youngkin administration for allegedly removing voters too close to the 90-day “quiet period” before Election Day. Voter rights and immigrant advocacy groups filed a similar suit, alleging that people affected by the purges are those whose Department of Motor Vehicles paperwork doesn’t indicate they are U.S. citizens because some of them may have become citizens in the time since renewing or receiving their license, while others may have made a blunder on their paperwork. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That case, brought forth by Virginia’s League of Women Voters and the Virginia Coalition For Immigrants Rights, was the basis of Friday’s ruling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles also ordered the state to work with local registrars to send letters to affected people within five days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Let’s be clear about what just happened: only eleven days before a Presidential election, a federal judge ordered Virginia to reinstate over 1,500 individuals — who self-identified themselves as noncitizens — back onto the voter rolls,” Youngkin said in a statement Friday.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="F5YtZYadf1"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/14/voter-purge-lawsuits-add-to-disenfranchisement-allegations-against-youngkin-administration/">Voter purge lawsuits add to disenfranchisement allegations against Youngkin administration</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State law directs the DMV to send monthly lists of people who failed to identify as citizens to the state Board of Elections, which are further forwarded to local registrars. It was carried by former Republican state Sen. Ken Cucinelli before it was signed by then-gov Tim Kaine, a Democrat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In defense of the process, Youngkin has stressed that a Democratic governor signed the law and he is simply employing it. </span></p>
<p>“Today&#8217;s injunction on Executive Order 35 is an essential step to have fair and just elections that will permit naturalized citizens to cast their vote in our federal elections without the unfair burden of being forced to re-register,” Jorge Figueredo at Edu-Futuro, an executive board member of the Virginia Coalition for Immigrant Rights, one of the groups suing the state, said in a statement.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorney General Jason Miyares alleged Giles was “urged” by the DOJ to reinstate the removed registrations and called the lawsuits a “shameful, politically motivated stunt.” </span></p>
<p>Reverberating beyond Virginia, the DOJ has also sued Alabama for the same issue. Republican National Committee chairman Michael Whatley weighed in with a statement doubling down on support for Youngkin and Miayares.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Youngkin and Miyares said that the state will petition the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals and be prepared to take their case to the United States Supreme Court, if needed. </span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce for the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 1,600 voters have been removed from the rolls since an Aug. 7 executive order by Gov. Glenn Youngkin, plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the governor said Wednesday on a press call. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seventy-five voter registrations were denied in the same time period, said Ryan Snow, counsel with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against Virginia for </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/14/voter-purge-lawsuits-add-to-disenfranchisement-allegations-against-youngkin-administration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">removing voters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from rolls within 90 days of this year’s elections. Virginia’s League of Women Voters and the Virginia Coalition for Immigrants Rights had previously filed a similar suit. Earlier this week a federal judge ordered the Youngkin administration to </span><a href="https://www.wvtf.org/news/2024-10-21/federal-judge-orders-release-of-names-impacted-by-voter-rolls-purge" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">release</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the names of affected voters as part of discovery in the League of Women Voters case and officials had to comply by Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snow confirmed to The Mercury that the numbers came from a list provided to the plaintiffs. The Mercury also has a pending Freedom of Information Act request seeking numbers of people flagged for removal and how many may have been reinstated or not removed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The case will have a hearing in Alexandria Thursday morning where plaintiffs hope for an injunction of Youngkin’s order.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ahead of the hearing, immigration advocates and other groups joined a press call Wednesday to lay out their case to the public.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The DOJ suit argues that voter removals may have disproportionately affected minority communities and could have wrongfully removed eligible voters without adequate notice or due process less than 90 days before the presidential election. Both cases allege this violates the federal National Voter Registration Act. That act imposes a 90-day quiet period on systematic voter roll purges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People in immigrant communities are hard workers — many of them working seven days a week,” said Beatriz Amberman, chair of the Virginia Coalition of Latino Organizations.  “There was not enough time assigned to inform the community and to have them get time off from work to go to the registrar&#8217;s office.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amberman said the administration could have partnered with Virginia’s Latino and Asian advisory boards “to help get the word out” for people to check their statuses as soon as possible in order for there to be time to cure any paperwork mistakes. She also said the administration could have utilized its communications staff to host press conferences with public service announcements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If voter records need to be reviewed or updated, the review should be done well in advance. This would ensure that voters have enough time to correct any issues on their voter registrations,” she said. “Our government has more resources to do this right than the average citizen.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In defending his executive order, Youngkin has stressed to national media that it is based on precedent of a 2006 </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+sum+SB313" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">  — carried by a Republican who went on to work for former president Donald Trump, and signed by democratic then-Gov. Tim Kaine — and that the process is “individualized.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It starts with a basic premise that when someone walks into one of our DMV&#8217;s and self-identifies as a noncitizen, and then they end up on the voter rolls, either purposely or by accident, that we go through a process individualized, not systematic, an individualized process based on that person’s self-identification as a noncitizen, to give them 14 days to affirm they are a citizen and if they don’t, they come off the voter rolls,” Youngkin told Fox News’ Shannon Bream.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2006 law directs DMV to send monthly lists of people who failed to identify as citizens to the state Board of Elections to be further forwarded to local registrars. Youngkin’s Aug. 7 </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/eo/EO-35-Comprehensive-Election-Security-Ensuring-Legal-Voters-and-Accurate-Counting---vF---8.7.24.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executive order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> called for daily purges based on DMV data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares has filed opposition to the plaintiffs’ motion that </span><a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.561386/gov.uscourts.vaed.561386.92.0.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">supports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Youngkin’s individualized argument. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The filing focuses on the individual nature of self-reporting as a non-citizen, which suggests that factor evades the “systematic” qualifier in the National Voter Registration Act’s 90-day quiet period. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snow argues that daily purges reduce the opportunity to catch mistakes before initiating a purge and could point to a systematic rather than individualized handling of the process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We know there are voters who registered decades ago and have updated their driver’s license many times, and if they check a box incorrectly, now they’re subject for removal,” Snow said. “We believe that under normal circumstances (with) information submitted from DMV data, there may be some system in place, at least, that would catch this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The daily removals “are a big part” of the case, he added because it “allows zero opportunity for anyone at any step in the process to verify that the basis for removal is accurate.”</span></p>

It’s why prominent political officials are visiting the state this week to support federal candidates in their parties.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-NY, will visit Virginia Beach Thursday evening to support Democratic candidate Missy Cotter Smasal in her challenge against U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach in </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/02/kiggans-and-smasal-face-off-in-highly-competitive-2nd-district/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s 2nd District</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, before giving a boost to retired Lt. Col. Eugene Vindman as he faces Republican Derrick Anderson, a former Green Beret, in Northern </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/10/tight-race-in-virginias-7th-congressional-district-as-derrick-anderson-eugene-vindman-face-off/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s 7th District.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Jeffries could become the next Speaker of the House if Democrats regain majority in that chamber. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jefferies </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/virginia-congress-smasal-kiggans-hakeem-jeffries/article_955a0eac-d5bc-11ee-99ea-4f07936040ca.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">endorsed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Smasal earlier this year, bringing national attention to the district that often oscillates between partisan control. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman and Anderson both emerged victorious from primary elections in their parties this summer. Their race has been considered a toss-up by multiple political forecasters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite trailing in polling last month, a new Wason Center </span><a href="https://cnu.edu/wasoncenter/surveys/archive/2024-10-23.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">poll </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">from Christopher Newport University shows Kiggans having a one-point lead over Smasal closer to Election Day, Nov. 5. Over 103,000 people have </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/elections/early-voting/2024-november-general-election/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voted early in that district so far</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to the Virginia Public Access Project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman will have Jeffries’ support when he visits Virginia again this Sunday ahead of a canvass launch with Democratic U.S. Sen. Mark Warner and U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Prince WIlliam. Spanberger currently represents the district and is vacating the seat to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/25/spanberger-and-earle-sears-tied-in-first-2025-gubernatorial-poll/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">run for Virginia governor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> next year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though his 1st Congressional District race is not considered a toss-up by pundits and analysts, U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Westmoreland, will get a boost from Republican National Committee co-chair Lara Trump in Chesterfield County Saturday morning at Keystone Acres. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wittman, who has typically won re-election by or over 20% margins since 2007, has seen occasional narrowing in recent years, winning his 2018 contest against Democrat Lavangelene Aereka Williams by 10.5% . This year’s democratic challenger, Leslie Mehta, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/21/leslie-mehta-hopes-to-flip-virginias-republican-leaning-1st-congressional-district/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hopes to flip the seat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts believe she could at least reduce Wittman’s victory margins and signal how the Republican-leaning district is gaining Democratic grounds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump, who is the daughter-in-law of the Republican presidential candidate, former President Donald Trump, will also support U.S. Senate candidate Hung Cao. The Republican Navy veteran is </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/07/kaine-faces-off-against-gop-challenger-cao-in-high-stakes-u-s-senate-race/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">challenging</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Democratic incumbent U.S. Sen.

(Parker Michels-Boyce/For the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Five Waynesboro voters have filed a lawsuit to prevent the majority of the Waynesboro Board of Elections from following through on their controversial pledge to refuse certification of the November 2024 election results, a move they argue would violate Virginia state law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plaintiffs — Jennifer Lewis, Ann Criser-Shedd, Greg Fife, Chris Graham and Andrea Jackson — are seeking a court order to compel the election officials to certify the city’s votes.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://advancementproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024.10.21-Waynesboro-Complaint-File-Stamped.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, filed in Waynesboro Circuit Court on Oct. 21, comes after two GOP officials from Waynesboro  filed </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/15/waynesboro-gop-officials-sue-over-va-s-voting-system-threaten-to-block-election-certification/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">their own lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> challenging Virginia’s voting system ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election while threatening to not certify the results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In their complaint, Curtis Lilly, the chairman of the Waynesboro Electoral Board, and Scott Mares, the board’s vice chair, expressed their concerns over the reliability of electronic voting systems, which they argue are prone to inaccuracies. Instead, they demanded that all ballots be counted by hand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, state law does not currently require a mandatory hand-count unless irregularities are proven, and all paper ballots are required to be counted by optical scanning machines, which help speed up the counting process and reduce the risk of human error. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before each election, the scanners undergo rigorous testing using a predetermined sample of votes to ensure accurate tallying before any real votes are counted. Additionally, it is illegal to connect ballot scanning machines to the Internet at any point, further safeguarding the integrity of the voting process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of the scanners used in Virginia’s elections are certified to meet both state and federal standards and are handled under a strict chain of custody to ensure security and accuracy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In their counter-suit, the five Waynesboro voters ask the court to require the election officials to certify the election results unless they prevail in their own suit. The plaintiffs further argue that the election officials’ stance violates the Virginia Constitution, which mandates that election results be certified in accordance with established procedures, including the use of legally authorized voting equipment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The chairman and vice chairman should do their job; instead they are purposely misinterpreting what they are charged to do. I cast my vote and have every right to expect that it will be counted on Election Day,” said Lewis, one of the plaintiffs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackson, another plaintiff, said that voting in the 2024 election was “very important” to her. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am frustrated that the election officials are not doing what they take an oath to do, which is to make sure the election runs smoothly and every vote counts. Instead they are distracting us from our local elections by filing nonsensical court cases,” Jackson said. </span></p>

Glenn Youngkin speaks to reporters outside the Capitol near the end of the 2024 General Assembly session. (Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s executive order to remove more than 6,000 Virginians from the voter rolls has come under intense national scrutiny after the Department of Justice (DOJ) </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/14/voter-purge-lawsuits-add-to-disenfranchisement-allegations-against-youngkin-administration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filed a lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> challenging its legality. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With just weeks until the Nov. 5 election, the suit has amplified concerns over voter disenfranchisement and the integrity of the state’s election process mirrored in other states leading up to the presidential contest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Fox News Sunday, Youngkin defended his move, arguing that it was based on a law signed in 2006 by then-Gov. Tim Kaine, a Democrat.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To be clear, this is not a purge,” he told host Shannon Bream. “To describe this as something that’s a purge is completely inaccurate, it’s wholly consistent with the U.S. Constitution, the Virginia Constitution and Virginia law.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, a federal judge in Alexandria </span><a href="https://www.wvtf.org/news/2024-10-21/federal-judge-orders-release-of-names-impacted-by-voter-rolls-purge" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ordered</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Virginia Department of Elections to disclose the names of individuals removed from the state’s voter rolls by the Youngkin administration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ruling came in response to </span><a href="https://www.lwv.org/newsroom/press-releases/lawsuit-challenges-recent-voter-roll-purges-virginia-preventing-eligible-us" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an earlier lawsuit </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">from the League of Women Voters and the Virginia Coalition of Immigrant Rights, which challenged Youngkin’s </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/eo/EO-35-Comprehensive-Election-Security-Ensuring-Legal-Voters-and-Accurate-Counting---vF---8.7.24.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Executive Order 35</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> signed in August, authorizing “daily” updates to Virginia’s voter rolls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These updates involved comparing the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles’ list of individuals identified as non-citizens to the list of registered voters. Local registrars were then required to notify voters whose citizenship status was challenged, informing them that their registration would be canceled unless they confirmed their citizenship within 14 days. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The governor’s response to the DOJ lawsuit</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The DOJ’s lawsuit argues that the voter removals disproportionately affected minority communities and may have wrongfully removed eligible voters without adequate notice or due process less than 90 days before a presidential election — placing Youngkin’s executive order at the center of a growing national debate about voting rights and election security. On Sunday, Youngkin sought to clarify how his administration handled the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It starts with a basic premise that when someone walks into one of our DMV’s and self-identifies as a noncitizen, and then they end up on the voter rolls, either purposely or by accident, that we go through a process individualized, not systematic, an individualized process based on that person&#8217;s self-identification as a noncitizen, to give them 14 days to affirm they are a citizen and if they don&#8217;t, they come off the voter rolls,” Youngkin told Fox News’ Shannon Bream.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, Youngkin also talked with CNN anchor Jake Tapper, who </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/14/politics/video/the-lead-immigration-misinformation-border-voter-registration-2024-jake-tapper" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pointed out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the issue with the executive order wasn’t the program itself but approving it within 90 days of the election — the so-called quiet period — which the DOJ suit argues is prohibited under federal law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why is it that anyone could argue that a process that removes non-citizens off of our voter rolls is anything other than common sense and constitutional?” Youngkin asked, adding that he was “frustrated” with the department’s decision to sue 25 days before the presidential election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They could have started it a long time ago, we would have sorted this out, because I firmly believe they are wrong. But this seems far more political than otherwise, simply because of the fact that this has been going on since 2006, according to law, and they chose 25 days before an election in Virginia in order to assert something which really is inconsistent with the process that we are doing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tapper’s interview with Youngkin further caused a stir because of their heated exchange over  </span><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4931778-donald-trump-national-guard-military-enemy-from-within/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent comments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that former President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, made about the U.S. military.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a Fox News appearance, Trump suggested deploying the National Guard or military on Election Day to prevent potential unrest, citing the threat of “the enemy from within,” which he described as “radical-left lunatics.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tapper asked Youngkin, “Is that something you support?” In response, the governor </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/15/politics/video/glenn-youngkin-jake-tapper-interview-trump-digvid" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shifted the focus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to border issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What former President Trump is referring to are the individuals crossing the border who are committing crimes, bringing drugs, trafficking humans, and turning every state into a border state.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin emphasized that, although Virginia is not a border state, it still feels the effects of “10 million people illegally crossing the border every single day.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tapper countered that while the problems at the border are real, that’s not what Trump was referring to. “He was talking about sick people, radical-left lunatics who should be handled by the National Guard or the military.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later on in that same speech, Trump said that one of “the lunatics” he addressed was U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Ca., Tapper added. “That’s who he was talking about using the National Guard and military against, radical-left lunatics, the enemy from within, people like Adam Schiff.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, Youngkin said he “can’t speak” for Trump. Instead, he said he believed the CNN anchor misinterpreted the former president’s rhetoric and was “misrepresenting his thoughts.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington, said that the legal fallout over Youngkin’s executive order and the subsequent debate in the national media  will likely benefit the governor’s desire to remain in the public discourse. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think Governor Youngkin is available to the national media because he wants to keep Republicans thinking about Glenn Youngkin. With the one consecutive term limit, Youngkin’s political fortunes may be improved with greater national media visibility.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the courts will ultimately rule on the governor’s actions, Youngkin’s continued participation in the national discourse is a win-win, according to Farnsworth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If he wins, it boosts his popularity with Republicans, and if he loses, he can still gain favor with the GOP base. The worst thing for a Virginia governor with national ambitions is to be ignored,” Farnsworth noted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a divided legislature likely to cause gridlock in the coming year and a gubernatorial election to pick Youngkin’s successor, Farnsworth added that, regardless of the presidential election outcome, there is “little downside in being combative” with the legislature.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Voter removal challenges elsewhere</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the fallout from the DOJ and League of Women Voters lawsuits continues, other states are also addressing concerns about voters being removed from rolls within the “quiet period.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A federal court order temporarily halted the Alabama Secretary of State’s “plan to ‘inactivate’ people the office suspected of not being U.S. citizens,” the Alabama Reflector </span><a href="https://alabamareflector.com/briefs/alabama-secretary-of-states-office-posts-news-release-required-by-court-order/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Oct. 21. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another legal battle may be on the horizon in Ohio. Several voting rights groups, led by the American Civil Liberties Union, on Oct. 3 </span><a href="https://www.acluohio.org/sites/default/files/oh_nvra_notice_letter_2024.10.03.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sent a letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, raising concerns about mass voter removals in several counties. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The groups argue that the removals did not comply with the requirements of the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) and have warned they are prepared to take legal action if corrective measures are not implemented within 20 days.</span></p>

(Brent Stirton/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The threat of political violence will likely hang over the nation’s capital in the weeks following Election Day, security experts say, despite intensive preparations by law enforcement officials determined to avoid another Jan. 6 insurrection.</p>
<p>The 2,000-plus officers who make up the U.S. Capitol Police, as well as other federal law enforcement agencies like the Secret Service, have responded to a surge in threats against elected officials during the last few years, including two assassination attempts against Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump just this year.</p>
<p>But the threats, attacks and shooting have led to questions about whether the two agencies are truly prepared for the presidential transition, especially after a <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2024-10/24_1017_opa-Independent-Review-Panel-Final-Report-and-Accompanying-Materials.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> released this week said the Secret Service “requires fundamental reform to carry out its mission.”</p>
<p>The agency is tasked with planning and coordinating security for Congress’ certification of the Electoral College on Jan. 6 —the first time it’s been designated a National Special Security Event — and Inauguration Day on Jan. 20.</p>
<p>Experts interviewed by States Newsroom said there is a very real chance of political violence in the weeks and months ahead, though they said law enforcement agencies have learned from recent events. The unrest could build after what is expected to be a very close presidential election, with results possibly delayed for days or longer or even litigated in the courts.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, you can never have 100% security,” said Javed Ali, associate professor of practice at the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan.</p>
<p>“It’s nice to think that would exist. But, if you’re trying to consider all the different kinds of variables that you have to plan for, there’s always going to be a gap or vulnerability — now what you try to do is kind of minimize the big one and hope that the small ones don’t get exploited.”</p>
<p>Darrell M. West, the Douglas Dillon Chair in Governmental Studies at the Brookings Institution, said the risk of political violence could increase following Election Day if one or more political leaders object to the outcome.</p>
<p>“For months, we’ve been hearing extreme and sometimes violent rhetoric,” West said. “And rhetoric has consequences — it can encourage some people to take action.”</p>
<p>Trump has refused to accept the 2020 election results, and his running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/election-2024/vance-replies-to-question-about-2020-election-with-answer-about-hunter-bidens-laptop/" target="_blank">declined to say </a>Trump lost the election. Vance on Oct. 12<a href="https://penncapital-star.com/election-2024/vance-in-pennsylvania-says-there-was-a-peaceful-transfer-of-power-in-january-2021/" target="_blank"> said</a> there was a “peaceful transfer of power” in January 2021.</p>
<p>Trump has repeatedly recycled false claims he made following his loss that the system is rigged — a talking point he’s likely to use to rile up supporters should he lose this year’s election. Trump has been <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2024/10/02/special-counsel-jack-smith-reveals-new-evidence-against-trump-in-2020-election-case/" target="_blank">charged</a> by special counsel Jack Smith with four felony counts in connection with 2020 election interference, in a complex case that will continue after the election.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Threats against lawmakers</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Members of Congress are more vulnerable than presidential candidates, in part because most lawmakers live in normal houses and don’t have security details anywhere close to the kind the Secret Service provides for high-ranking officials.</p>
<p>And unlike the presidency, which has a long line of succession to avoid gaps in authority following a death or a crisis, Congress has been <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/23/congress-plan-mass-casualty-emergency-00178190" target="_blank">criticized for not having better plans in place </a>to address continuity of government following a mass casualty or similar event.</p>
<p>U.S. Capitol Police Chief J. Thomas Manger <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-capitol-police-chief-describes-preparations-possible-post-election-turmoil" target="_blank">testified in April </a>the agency was looking for ways to bolster protection for lawmakers in the line of presidential succession, like the speaker of the House and Senate president pro tempore.</p>
<p>Manger told the panel that security for those two officials was substandard to that provided for the Secretary of State, who sits below them in the line of succession.</p>
<p>“We can’t just go back to the days when we said, ‘Well, we’ll just follow them around and we’ll make sure they’re well protected wherever they are,’ because their homes, their families are at risk,” he testified.</p>
<p>Members of Congress who haven’t risen to the ranks of leadership don’t get security details unless there are specific threats to their safety. And those aren’t permanent.</p>
<p>That could present challenges for lawmakers who have higher profiles or who regularly receive threats, especially if people respond violently to the election results and encourage their supporters to take matters into their own hands.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump assassination attempts</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Making the situation more complicated, this year has shown that substantial levels of security aren’t a guarantee of safety.</p>
<p>Trump has some of the highest levels of protection in the country, if not the world, but that did not stop a man from<a href="https://penncapital-star.com/campaigns-elections/trump-campaigns-in-western-pennsylvania-with-rally-in-butler-county/" target="_blank"> shooting at the former president</a> during a rally in Pennsylvania this summer. A separate would-be gunman<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/ryan-routh-charged-attempted-assassination-trump-golf-course-case" target="_blank"> was spotted </a>and apprehended just off Trump’s Florida golf course with a semi-automatic weapon in September.</p>
<p>Both instances raised questions about the Secret Service’s ability to protect Trump as well as others, though agency leaders maintain they’re up to the task.</p>
<p>Trump’s experiences, as the subject of political violence, haven’t deterred him from spreading disinformation about Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris as well as other lawmakers who disagree with him on policy issues.</p>
<p>Trump’s comments about immigrants have also led to threats against everyday people, including Haitian immigrants in Ohio, who are in the country legally.</p>
<p>During an interview with Maria Bartiromo on “Sunday Morning Futures” on Fox News earlier this month, Trump said he may use the National Guard or the military against his political opponents should he win reelection, calling them “the enemy from within.”</p>
<p>“We have some very bad people,” Trump said. “We have some sick people. Radical left lunatics. And it should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by National Guard, or if really necessary by the military, because they can’t let that happen.”</p>
<p>The military and National Guard have significantly different training programs and missions than local, state, or federal law enforcement, making Trump’s comments somewhat darker than previous claims he’d try to put his political opponents in prison if reelected.</p>
<p>Trump hasn’t committed to respecting the results of the election or supporting a peaceful transition in power should he lose his bid for the White House.</p>
<p>Trump’s comments could indicate that violence is likely following the election, if he loses, or after he regains the powers of the presidency, if he wins.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Delayed election results predicted</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>West from the Brookings Institution said violence isn’t likely to take place in the days immediately following the end of voting on Nov. 5, since it’s unlikely anyone learns the results of the presidential election for a few days.</p>
<p>The Associated Press <a href="https://blog.ap.org/behind-the-news/calling-the-2020-presidential-race-state-by-state" target="_blank">didn’t call the race for President Joe Biden until the Saturday</a> after the election in 2020, following days of speculation and ballot counting.</p>
<p>Mail-in ballots, which Democrats tend to submit in larger numbers than Republicans, could lead to confusion in swing states, especially if people don’t understand they tend to boost numbers for Democratic candidates over GOP politicians as they’re counted, he said.</p>
<p>“We could end up in a situation where on election night, Trump is ahead, because we know Republicans tend to vote in person on Election Day, and Democrats often vote via mail ballots,” West said. “And then as the mail ballots get counted on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, the numbers may shift from Trump to Harris.</p>
<p>“And I think that’s a very bad combination, because it will look to some individuals like voter fraud, even though there’s a perfectly logical explanation for the change. But that’s a scenario that could lead to violence, because it’ll look like the election is being stolen from Trump.”</p>
<p>While the presidential candidates will play a significant role in stirring up or calming down their supporters, members of Congress, many of whom sought to legitimize misinformation and disinformation four years ago, have responsibilities as well.</p>
<p>“We need leaders who act responsibly, but unfortunately, in the last few months, we have not seen that,” West said. “We’ve seen members of Congress who have promoted misinformation. There’s been a lot of it surrounding the hurricane, and so the fear is that there will be blatant lies that then will incite people to take action.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Learning from 2020</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Ali, from the University of Michigan, said he expects federal law enforcement will be better prepared for post-election violence than they were four years ago, though there are still chances for violent people to slip through the cracks.</p>
<p>The most likely scenario, Ali said, is a single actor or “lone wolf” attack and not a mob marching to the Capitol, the way Trump supporters did on Jan. 6.</p>
<p>“I still think it’s relatively low,” Ali said of the likelihood of violence. “But as we’ve seen, all it takes is one person to really shake up the perception of security. And if they’re aiming at President Trump or Vice President Harris, well then, you know the stakes are even higher.”</p>
<p>Ali said he’s confident that the Secret Service, U.S. Capitol Police and other law enforcement agencies in the Washington, D.C., area are preparing for various scenarios, though he’s less sure about what would happen if there’s violence at state capitals.</p>
<p>“There might be a little more vulnerability there,” Ali said. “But I still think, at least when we’re getting to the Electoral College (certification) day, that January 6th-type insurrection will be almost impossible to pull off.”</p>
<p>When it comes to spreading disinformation, Ali said, he expects there will be a combination of foreign adversaries, including Iran and Russia, as well as domestic actors.</p>
<p>“You’ll probably see a lot of disinformation, especially if Vice President Harris wins, sort of casting doubt on the integrity of the voting, the credibility of the process, maybe going after specific individuals and key swing states, or even counties,” Ali said.</p>
<p>“All those things that were happening in 2020. But there were also costs to doing that, as we’ve seen too, with the civil charges and some of the potential criminal ones as well,” he added. “So I think that’s also an area domestically, where people will have to tread very cautiously. That doesn’t mean that you won’t see it, but again, there might be a line that gets crossed where people will be held accountable for that.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘More prepared than ever before’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>U.S. Capitol Police Inspector General David T. Harper said USCP leadership has implemented the 100-plus recommendations put forward by his predecessor following the Jan. 6 attack, closing gaps that existed that day.</p>
<p>“I think they’ve made a lot of improvements, and I think that they’re more prepared than ever before,” Harper said, though he later added he couldn’t “say for certain that they are prepared to handle anything that can come up” due to the unpredictable nature of domestic terrorism and political violence.</p>
<p>The OIG is also “prepared to be all hands on deck” in the event of another attack on the Capitol or lawmakers takes place, to analyze what went wrong and make recommendations for USCP to implement, he said.</p>
<p>Harper, whose tenure as inspector general <a href="https://rollcall.com/2024/01/23/new-capitol-police-inspector-general-selected/" target="_blank">began earlier this year</a>, noted during the interview that much of what he can publicly discuss is restricted by national security concerns.</p>
<p>The U.S. Capitol Police declined an interview request from States Newsroom, but provided written information about changes that it’s implemented during the last few years.</p>
<p>Among those is a law approved by Congress that allows the USCP chief to request the National Guard without the approval of the three-member Capitol Police board.</p>
<p>USCP has also overhauled its intelligence-gathering activities and established partnerships with other law enforcement agencies to bolster its ranks ahead of major events.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Secret Service planning for Jan. 6</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The Secret Service is one of those partners and it will take the lead this year planning security for major events during the presidential transition, even those undertaken by Congress inside the Capitol.</p>
<p>While Inauguration Day has traditionally been categorized as a National Special Security Event, the Department of Homeland Security <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/additional-security-will-be-place-jan-6-2025-certification-presidential-vote" target="_blank">has extended that classification</a> for the first time for Congress certifying the winner of the presidential race on Jan. 6.</p>
<p>Nate Herring, spokesperson for the United States Secret Service, said part of the process includes planning with other law enforcement agencies for “various scenarios” that could take place, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Metropolitan Police Department.</p>
<p>“We work very closely with our partners throughout the whole planning process,” Herring said. “And D.C. is especially unique because National Special Security Events occur fairly frequently.”</p>
<p>But the Secret Service’s leadership and structure have come under scrutiny during the last few months.</p>
<p>The four-member panel tasked with investigating the Pennsylvania assassination attempt against Trump wrote in the<a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2024-10/24_1017_opa-Independent-Review-Panel-Final-Report-and-Accompanying-Materials.pdf" target="_blank"> 52-page report</a> released in mid-October that the Secret Service “has become bureaucratic, complacent, and static even though risks have multiplied and technology has evolved.”</p>
<p>“This is a zero-fail mission, for any failure endangers not only the life of the protectee, but also the fundamentals of our government itself,” they wrote.</p>
<p>Without substantial changes to the Secret Service, the independent review panel wrote, it believes the type of deadly attack that took place in Butler, Pennsylvania, “can and will happen again.”</p>
<p>Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas released a written statement after the report’s release, saying the department had begun “taking the actions needed to advance the Secret Service’s protection mission,” including addressing the “systemic and foundational issues” described by the review panel.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">D.C. planning</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>District of Columbia Assistant City Administrator Chris Rodriguez said that city officials will be watching for any indications people intent on violence begin traveling or gathering inside the city following Election Day.</p>
<p>“We are obviously attuned to what happened last time. I mean, I don’t think we can ignore that, and we’re not,” Rodriguez said, referring to the Jan. 6 attack. “But we also are in a place where we have great relationships among our agencies within the region, with the federal government in terms of coordination, and we will be prepared to adapt our operational posture in any way that we need to.”</p>
<p>D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser originally requested the NSSE designation for Jan. 6, which Rodriguez said has increased planning and coordination, in hopes of avoiding any violence.</p>
<p>Rodriguez also stressed D.C. officials and the city’s police department are used to planning for the large crowds and protests that tend to take place whenever there’s a presidential transition.</p>
<p>“We are a city that prides itself, as the nation’s capital, to ensuring that there is a peaceful transition of power,” he said. “And we will do our part to ensure that.”</p>

(Aristide Economopoulos / NJ Monitor)</p><p><em>This is one in a series of States Newsroom reports on the major policy issues in the presidential race.</em></p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A mass shooting at a Georgia high school in September thrust the issue of gun violence to the forefront of the presidential race.</p>
<p>Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump agree that gun violence is a major problem, but they offer strikingly different views on how to address it.</p>
<p>Two 14-year-old students and two math teachers were killed at Apalachee High School.</p>
<p>While at a campaign rally in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, shortly after the Apalachee shooting, Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, <a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2024/09/04/georgia-national-democratic-leaders-call-for-gun-safety-legislation-after-apalachee-high-shooting/" target="_blank">renewed calls</a> for an assault weapons ban, universal background checks and red flag laws.</p>
<p>Students should not have to be frightened of school shootings, she said. “They are sitting in a classroom where they should be fulfilling their God-given potential, yet some part of their big, beautiful minds is worried about a shooter breaking through the door,” she said. “It doesn’t have to be this way.”</p>
<p>Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, expressed his condolences.</p>
<p>“Our hearts are with the victims and loved ones of those affected by the tragic event in Winder, GA,” Trump wrote on his social media site Truth Social. “These cherished children were taken from us far too soon by a sick and deranged monster.”</p>
<p>Trump has survived two assassination attempts, one where he was injured in the ear, but has not changed his stance on guns.</p>
<p>After the first assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, Trump campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita said at <a href="https://tennesseelookout.com/2024/07/16/gun-rights-advocates-at-convention-spell-out-plans-if-gop-gains-control-in-november/" target="_blank">the Republican National Convention</a> that the party won’t back away from its support of Second Amendment rights.</p>
<p>During a Univision town hall with undecided Latino voters that aired Wednesday night, an audience member asked Trump how he would explain his gun policy to “parents of the victims of school shootings.”</p>
<p>“We have a Second Amendment and a right to bear arms,” Trump said. “I’m very strongly an advocate of that. I think that if you ever tried to get rid of it, you wouldn’t be able to do it. You wouldn’t be able to take away the guns, because people need that for security, they need it for entertainment and for sport, and other things. But they also, in many cases, need it for protection.”</p>
<p>A majority of Americans view gun violence as a problem — about 60% — and they expect it to only get worse over the next five years, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2023/06/28/gun-violence-widely-viewed-as-a-major-and-growing-national-problem/" target="_blank">according to a Pew Research Center study.</a></p>
<p>This year there have been 421 mass shootings, according to the <a href="https://www.gunviolencearchive.org" target="_blank">Gun Violence Archive</a>, which tracks gun violence in the U.S.</p>
<p>For a third year in a row, in 2022 — the most recent year of finalized data — firearms were <a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2024/guns-remain-leading-cause-of-death-for-children-and-teens" target="_blank">the leading cause of death </a>for children and teens ages 1 to 17, <a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/sites/default/files/2024-09/2022-cgvs-gun-violence-in-the-united-states.pdf" target="_blank">according to a report from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions.</a></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Harris’ record</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In the aftermath of two mass shootings in 2022, Congress passed the most comprehensive bipartisan gun safety legislation in decades.</p>
<p>In Uvalde, Texas, 19 children and two teachers were murdered, making it the second-deadliest mass shooting since the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in 2012. In Buffalo, a white supremacist targeted a Black neighborhood and killed 10 Black people in a grocery store.</p>
<p>The package that Congress passed and President Joe Biden signed into law provided $11 billion in mental health funds and $750 million for states to enact red flag laws. It also closed loopholes and established a White House Office for Gun Violence Prevention, among other provisions.</p>
<p>Red flag laws allow courts to temporarily remove a firearm from an individual who is a threat to themselves or others, among other provisions.</p>
<p><a href="https://washingtonstatestandard.com/briefs/biden-administration-to-create-new-gun-violence-prevention-office/" target="_blank">Biden tasked Harris with leading</a> the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, which helps local communities implement that 2022 bipartisan gun legislation and aids communities impacted by gun violence.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump’s record</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>During Trump’s first presidency, he had a mixed record on gun policy.</p>
<p>After a mass shooting in Las Vegas, Nevada, the Trump administration moved to ban bump stocks, which allow a semi-automatic rifle to quickly fire bullets.</p>
<p>However, the U.S. Supreme Court, to which Trump appointed three conservative justices, <a href="https://missouriindependent.com/briefs/u-s-supreme-court-overturns-ban-on-bump-stocks-used-in-las-vegas-mass-shooting/" target="_blank">struck down the ban on bump stocks. </a></p>
<p>Trump also threatened to veto legislation from <a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/saphr8hr1112hr_20190225.pdf" target="_blank">Congress that would have enhanced background checks on guns.</a></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Promise: a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines</h4>

	
<p>Democrats have long called for a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, which are typically used in mass shootings.</p>
<p>The U.S. used to have a ban on assault weapons, but it expired in 2004 and Congress failed to renew the ban.</p>
<p>“I am in favor of the Second Amendment, and I believe we need to reinstate the assault weapons ban,” Harris <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbGlPpQUmMA" target="_blank">said at the White House</a> in late September.</p>
<p>Fulfilling this promise would come down to the makeup in Congress and overcoming the Senate’s 60-vote threshold to advance legislation.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Promise: a rollback of Biden regulations</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>During a forum with the National Rifle Association in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, in February, Trump promised to roll back all gun-related regulations that the Biden administration has implemented.</p>
<p>“Every single Biden attack on gun owners and manufacturers will be terminated on my very first week back in office, perhaps my first day,” Trump said.</p>
<p>Trump specifically said he would cancel the Biden administration’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/23/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-comprehensive-strategy-to-prevent-and-respond-to-gun-crime-and-ensure-public-safety/" target="_blank">“zero-tolerance” policy,</a> which revokes federal licenses from gun dealers who violate firearm laws.</p>
<p>Brian Hughes, a Trump campaign senior adviser, said in a statement to States Newsroom that if Trump wins a second term, “he will terminate every single one of the Harris-Biden’s attacks on law-abiding gun owners his first week in office and stand up for our constitutionally enshrined right to bear arms.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Promise: tax credits, no gun-free zones</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>During an NRA event in April 2023, Trump said that he was supportive of a tax credit for teachers who wanted to carry a firearm in schools.</p>
<p>Trump has also previously voiced his disapproval of schools being gun-free zones. Days after the Uvalde school shooting, Trump attended another NRA event in Houston, Texas, where he argued that a gun-free zone does not allow people to protect themselves.</p>
<p>“As the age-old saying goes, the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,” Trump said. “The existence of evil is one of the very best reasons to arm law-abiding citizens.”</p>
<p>He argued that schools should have metal detectors, fencing and an armed police officer.</p>

(Courtesy of the Mehta and Wittman campaigns)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Longtime incumbent U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Westmoreland, has served the 1st Congressional District since 2007. But this year’s Democratic challenger, Leslie Mehta, might make him work harder to win. She thinks she can flip the seat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The thing with Rob Wittman is that he’s never had a real challenge,” said Chaz Nuttycombe, founder of the State Navigate and CNalysis political forecasting organizations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Wittman has had challengers each time he’s run to hold onto his seat representing Virginia’s 1st Congressional District, he’s typically </span><a href="https://historical.elections.virginia.gov/candidates/view/Robert-Joseph-Wittman" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">won re-election with large margins</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between himself and his usually-democratic challengers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a redrawing of the congressional maps in 2021 incorporated some Richmond-area suburbs into the district — which tend to lean Democrat — previous challenger Herb Jones lost by 13%. Wittman’s margins have typically ranged between 20 and nearly 50%. In 2018 — fresh off 2017&#8217;s &#8220;Blue Wave&#8221; in the state legislature — Democrat Lavangelene Aereka Williams lost by 10.5%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Whitman now faces Mehta, a lawyer and healthcare advocate, Nuttycombe suspects that margin could be further reduced to single-digits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can see Wittman having a single-digit reelection, which would be the first time that’s ever happened, because the district is getting bluer,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The district, which is anchored by Virginia’s peninsula and some coastal areas, also wraps around Richmond in Chesterfield and Henrico counties before sprawling south towards Petersburg. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And though CNalysis and the Virginia Public Access Project both rate it as leaning Republican, Mehta’s campaign might be making Wittman and Republicans work a little harder this year to keep him in Congress. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mehta — who received the endorsement of Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Prince William, early on in the election cycle and over Jones, who’d run again but lost to Metha in their primary — believes she might be able to win. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger is one of the </span><a href="https://www.thelugarcenter.org/ourwork-Bipartisan-Index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most bipartisan members</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Congress, and Mehta plans to legislate in that fashion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger, who is vying for the Democratic nomination for governor next year, backed Mehta after they had connected over a congressional effort to secure more medical research funding in an appropriations bill. The fight was personal for Mehta, whose oldest daughter suffered a rare genetic disorder before her death. Mehta has since gone on to be appointed by Republican Gov. Glenn Younkgin to serve on Virginia’s Rare Disease Council. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mehta’s goal of bipartisanship and her passion for healthcare policy is why she believes she can appeal to voters. Healthcare affordability and access are issues she said she hears from canvassing and campaign events around the district. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In some of the rural parts of the district it can take 45 minutes to get to a maternal ward, or the fact that some doctors and other health care providers are just not providing or don’t have enough availability for Medicaid and Medicare patients because the reimbursements are so low,” she said. “People have to find other care providers, or it might take a long time to get into their preferred health care provider — that’s not really access.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mehta has been supportive of Democratic legislation to help with healthcare affordability and access like the Affordable Care Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, but she said there is still “more work to do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In contrast, Wittman has supported repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, also dubbed &#8220;Obamacare.&#8221; Though he has </span><a href="https://wittman.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1188" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">not always supported his party’s proposals that could do so</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2022420" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">he has voted against</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Inflation Reduction Act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps another boon for her candidacy, Mehta suspects, is her promise to help codify abortion and other reproductive health protections into federal law. This contrasts with Wittman having voted to restrict federal funding for Planned Parenthood and having </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1011/cosponsors" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">co-sponsored a Life At Conception Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Congress. Mehta pointed to how the legislation had no mention of exceptions for abortions in instances where someone was a victim of rape or incest, their life was threatened by the pregnancy, or severe fetal anomalies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We know that (abortion access) is not just a concern for Democrats,” she said. “But there are lots of Republicans in the district who are very concerned about his extreme stance.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wittman’s campaign did not respond to interview requests. His congressional </span><a href="https://wittman.house.gov/issues/issue/?IssueID=128025" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mentions him being “pro-life,” and having a “role to protect the lives of the unborn,” without alluding to  the word “abortion.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a bipartisan fashion, some Republican-leaning states have protected access to the procedure in the years since federal protections were overturned. Democratic congressional candidates promise to restore federal protections, while many Republicans have backed off pushing for federal bans or limits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On other healthcare matters, Wittman’s </span><a href="https://robwittman.com/issues/#healthcare" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">campaign website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> underscores his past experience working in the Virginia Department of Health before going into politics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a hallmark of the Inflation Reduction Act has involved ongoing efforts to reduce prescription drug costs — a goal of Wittman’s — he defended opposing that particular legislation overall. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We cannot tax and spend our way out of inflation, which remains the top problem our nation is facing,” he wrote in a statement from 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite some </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/offices/us-representative-1/district/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">metrics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showing support for Wittman’s re-election, other factors point to efforts to shore up his support, just in case. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His fundraising from this year is double that of Mehta’s, and the Young Republican Federation of Virginia has included Wittman in a </span><a href="https://linktr.ee/yrfvdeployments2024" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">series of canvassing events</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this month that include Derrick Anderson, the Republican nominee in the 7th District, and Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, the incumbent in the 2nd District </span></p>
<p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/02/kiggans-and-smasal-face-off-in-highly-competitive-2nd-district/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiggans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/10/tight-race-in-virginias-7th-congressional-district-as-derrick-anderson-eugene-vindman-face-off/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are each running in more competitive congressional districts that could help determine which party will control the U.S. House of Representatives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfws7HDF-u1kQUZKKlAJ5hvexhz42xxQR9s_DpH78SNgRYHaA/viewform" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">canvas event for Wittman </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">will take place in Henrico County. Wrapping  around Richmond’s west, east and north sides, the locality has been trending bluer in recent years, </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/localities/henrico-county-va/election-results-map/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">backing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Democrat Terry McAuliffe for governor in 2021, and </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/henrico-chesterfield-boards-politics-republican-democratic-glenn-youngkin-blue-red-purple/article_d2abe3e6-84e2-11ee-9b7b-bbd3e10bce60.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats have gained majorities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the local government last year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nuttycombe, of CNalysis, also suspects a strong base will turn out for Vice President Kamala Harris in York County and will likely to also vote for Mehta. Still, a large portion of the district includes Virginia’s peninsula — an area with Democratic pockets but that is overall broadly Republican-leaning. </span></p>

John McGuire, R-Goochland, and Democrat Gloria Witt at the 5th Congressional District candidates debate at Hampden-Sydney College in Farmville on Oct. 17, 2024. (Courtesy of ABC13/WSET) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Gloria Witt and her Republican opponent, state Sen. John McGuire, faced off in a respectful but spirited debate Thursday for the first and only time, offering sharply contrasting visions for Virginia’s 5th Congressional District as the race enters its final stretch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 45-minute discussion, hosted by WSET Lynchburg at Hampden-Sydney College in Farmville, provided a stark contrast between both candidates as they sparred over topics like immigration, education, foreign policy, political polarization and their faith in the electoral system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With just 18 days until the Nov. 5 election, McGuire defended his presence at the Stop the Steal rally at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, as his constitutional right. On that day, a group of rioters stormed the Capitol in an attempt to halt the certification of the election that Republican Donald Trump lost to Democrat Joe Biden. At least </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/donald-trump-says-absolutely-pardon-jan-6-rioters-rcna164565" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">140 police officers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were injured in the violent event and over 1,400 people have been criminally charged in connection to it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s nothing wrong with that,” McGuire said of his right to protest. “The Democrats have weaponized that for political purposes, and it&#8217;s just a terrible thing about the division in our country.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire also did not provide a clear response to the question by moderator Richard Pantele if he would accept the outcome of the presidential contest between Vice President Kamala Harris and Trump.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let’s see what the elections are, and if it’s fair, it’s fair, and I’ll totally support that,” McGuire said, after defending Trump’s attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election, which  Biden won by more than seven million votes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Over the years, even people remember Hillary Clinton challenged her election,” he said of the former Democratic presidential nominee, who conceded to Trump one day after losing the 2016 election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is nothing wrong with challenging irregularities until you are satisfied. And you think about this, we had this pandemic, some people called it the ‘Plandemic,’” McGuire said — referring to a trilogy of conspiracy theory films that promoted misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic — earning him groans from the audience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Under the guise of the ‘Plandemic’ or the pandemic, they came up with election season in Virginia, not Election Day, but 45 days,” McGuire said, an apparent reference to the state’s early voting period. “In one state, California, they said, if you want to have a voter ID, you should be arrested for that. So they changed the rules and if they were only for the pandemic, then after the pandemic, they should change it back, and they didn’t.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire, a former U.S. Navy SEAL and state delegate from Goochland County who announced his congressional bid just one week after being elected to represent the 10th state Senate District last year, faced his own election challenge after the June 18 GOP primary, in which he defeated U.S. Rep. Bob Good, R-Farmville, by a razor-thin 0.6% margin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the election, Good asked for a recount, which eventually confirmed that McGuire had won the nomination contest by 366 votes out of more than 62,000 cast. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But internal divisions remained after some of the district’s conservative hardliners refused to accept McGuire as their nominee, vowing to instead write in Good on Nov. 5. The divide has led to fractures among local Republicans, with concerns that internal disagreements could weaken party unity ahead of the general election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Witt, who for the first time </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/16/democrat-gloria-witt-surpasses-5th-district-gop-rival-john-mcguire-in-latest-fundraising/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has outraised</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> her opponent during the third quarter according to the latest fundraising data, has seized on the district GOP’s intra-party feud. At Thursday’s debate, she made the Nov. 5 election a referendum on the preservation of democracy and individual liberties. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most of the GOP still cannot accept the fact that Donald Trump lost the election,” Witt said. “We’re at a serious point, so when you go to vote, it&#8217;s not about Republicans and Democrats and independents. It’s a test of your belief in the Constitution.  We are fighting for the Constitution of America.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Witt secured the Democratic nomination in the June 18 primary after defeating two opponents: Gary Terry, a Kentucky native and West Point graduate, and Paul Riley, a U.S. Army veteran and intelligence analyst.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since announcing her candidacy in the spring, she has been crisscrossing the district that spans 11,000-square-miles and encompasses the majority of Southside, including Danville, and the cities of Charlottesville and Lynchburg. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve used this campaign to let folks know I’m a country girl,” Witt said. “I grew up without running water, we processed all our meats, we grew all our vegetables, we preserved them, pretty much lived off the land. You all would think of it as being organic right now, but we call it living. My values are faith, family, justice and community.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the debate, Witt positioned herself as a voice for change, accusing McGuire of being out of touch with the needs of everyday people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you care about having affordable healthcare, social security, affordable childcare, you want to think about voting for me,” Witt said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I want to be your voice in Congress because I am District 5, because I understand corporate and business, and I understand rural America. So I want you to leave here thinking because this is the pivotal election, this is not about Democrats and Republicans. We’re testing our belief in the Constitution and our rights and freedoms.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The candidates shared contrasting views on immigration and foreign policy. McGuire promoted Trump’s plan to deport all undocumented immigrants while building a wall at the southern border instead of funding Ukraine’s defense against Russia’s invasion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m not sure what the best solution is, but I do know that four years ago we didn’t have the problems in Ethiopia, Ukraine and Israel,” McGuire said. “These things were not going on, and statistics just came out that </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/investigations/13000-immigrants-convicted-homicide-living-freely-us-ice-data-rcna173125" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">13 to 15,000 murderers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had been released into our country with this open border. It’s crazy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Witt countered that Republicans have used immigration as a “political pawn” by rejecting the bipartisan Secure the Border Act of 2023, which would have allocated more resources for border protection and the construction of a wall. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For me, it&#8217;s about fixing the problem with resources, with technology; you evaluate, you assess, and you get (the immigrants) working so that they can be tax-paying people for those who qualify when it comes to the asylum question,” Witt said. “Let’s get them in and process them quickly and get them out if they don’t qualify.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most contentious moments of the debate came when Pantele, the moderator, asked both candidates about their views on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), which is a policy framework for promoting fairness and full participation for all people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I support equity as a goal,” Witt said. “You know, we got to where we are as a people, African American people of color, because of civil rights and the efforts to create equality after starting from a handicap of enslavement. Without diversity, equity and inclusion you end up with our power broker in charge.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire said that while he believed in equal opportunity for all Americans, he does not agree with an equal outcome. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m against that, it should be meritocracy,” McGuire said, calling DEI a “marxist idea.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If a plane goes down in the jungle and there’s one direction you go to save your whole team, do you want someone who’s never been in the jungle or do you want a Navy SEAL who is an expert on survival to keep the team alive? It should be based on merit and I don’t care if you’re pink or blue.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But both candidates found some common ground when they vowed to work with their colleagues from across the aisle, if elected. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would want to work bipartisan to move the country forward, it’s one of the reasons I decided to run for this role,” Witt said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire touted his record of passing bipartisan legislation in both the Virginia House of Delegates and the state Senate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If we treat each other with respect and work as a team, we can turn a no into a yes, we can turn the impossible to a possible,” he said. </span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><strong><em>Editor&#8217;s note:</em></strong> <em>On Wednesday, Oct. 30, the United States Supreme Court granted a stay blocking a lower court&#8217;s order for Virginia to pause its voter removal program, allowing additional purges through Election Day. Find more details on the decision <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/30/u-s-supreme-court-grants-stay-in-challenge-to-youngkins-voter-purge-order-allowing-removal-of-thousands-from-rolls/">here</a>, and read below to find out how you can still vote if you were wrongly removed from Virginia voter rolls.</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though state law allows people who didn’t indicate citizenship status when filling out forms at the Department of Motor Vehicles to be removed from voter rolls, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/14/voter-purge-lawsuits-add-to-disenfranchisement-allegations-against-youngkin-administration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two lawsuits have alleged that Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration is violating federal law </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">by continuing removals within 90 days of Election Day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For anyone who became a citizen since their last DMV visit, or who suspects they made an error filing out their paperwork that would have booted them from voter lists, there are still ways to cast a ballot in next month’s elections. </span></p>
<p>Registrars and election workers won&#8217;t turn eligible voters away from polls if they wish to utilize same-day registration or a provisional ballot, according to Henrico County Registrar Mark Coakley.</p>
<p>“So if they were canceled or not registered, provisional ballots are a fail-safe method.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provisional ballots, most often used in same-day voter registration, are also used when people run into paperwork or registration issues that might need to be resolved. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a provisional ballot, voters will still need to follow up with their local registrar office to provide additional documents that can help verify their identity or other facts, like if they are residents of Virginia and the city or county they voted in, and whether they are U.S. citizens or have had their voting rights restored after a previous felony conviction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can research to make sure they are citizens or became citizens or had their rights restored,” Coakley explained. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coakley said that when using a provisional ballot, voters are also given instructions to help with the follow-up procedures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They&#8217;ll get a letter attached to their provisional ballot, giving them all the information of ‘This is the reason why (you may have this ballot)’ and ‘Here&#8217;s the ways to get hold of us to present evidence if you choose to do so,’” he said.  </span></p>
<p>Chesterfield County Registrar Missy Vera stressed that same-day registration can happen at any early voting location as well as on Election Day, which is Nov. 5.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coakley also suggested that anyone who might be concerned they could have been mistakenly caught up in the recent voter roll purges check Virginia Department of Elections’ </span><a href="https://vote.elections.virginia.gov/VoterInformation" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online citizen portal </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to see their voter status. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrea Gaines, a communications manager at the Department of Elections, also said that people “can always reach out to their local registrar if they have questions about their registration status.”</span></p>
<p>Vera, from Chesterfield County, concurred.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyone may call our office to inquire about their registration or inquire as to their options,&#8221; Vera said. &#8220;We are happy to help.&#8221;</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — The presidential debate in early September included just one mention of Social Security and three references to Medicare, making the safety net programs a minuscule part of the policy discussion, despite their importance to tens of millions of Americans.</p>
<p>Democratic nominee Kamala Harris and Republican candidate Donald Trump have both mentioned the programs numerous times during appearances, though neither campaign has sought to elevate the financial stability of the two programs as a core issue.</p>
<p>More often than not, Harris and Trump rebuke their opponent, while committing to “save” Social Security and Medicare — skipping over the details or the role Congress must play in the discussion.</p>
<p>How to address projected shortfalls for both the Social Security and Medicare trust funds will become an increasingly important topic for the president and Congress during the next decade.</p>
<p>The latest Social Security <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/trsum/" target="_blank">trustees report </a>expects the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and the Disability Insurance trust funds will be able to pay full benefits until 2035, after which, without action by lawmakers, benefits would drop to about 83%.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cms.gov/oact/tr/2024" target="_blank">trustee report </a>for Medicare shows the funding stream for the hospital insurance trust fund can cover all of its bills through 2036 before it would only be able to cover 89% of costs.</p>
<p>There are currently 67.5 million people <a href="https://data.cms.gov/summary-statistics-on-beneficiary-enrollment/medicare-and-medicaid-reports/medicare-monthly-enrollment" target="_blank">enrolled in Medicare</a>, which provides health insurance and prescription drug coverage for people over the age of 65 as well as younger people who have certain severe illnesses or disabilities.</p>
<p>Nearly 68 million people receive some level of benefit from Social Security each month, accounting for about $1.5 trillion in spending by the federal government annually, according to a <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/news/press/factsheets/basicfact-alt.pdf" target="_blank">fact sheet</a>.</p>
<p>While the issue is somewhat less pressing for Trump, who would be term limited to another four years, Harris could theoretically spend the next eight years in the Oval Office, making the solvency of the trust funds an issue she would likely need to address with Congress.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Protecting seniors</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>During the September debate, Harris brought up Social Security and Medicare following a question about how her policy beliefs on fracking, assault weapons and border security have changed over time.</p>
<p>“My work that is about protecting Social Security and Medicare is based on long-standing work that I have done. Protecting seniors from scams,” Harris said as part of a longer answer. “My values have not changed. And what is important is that there is a president who actually brings values and a perspective that is about lifting people up and not beating people down and name-calling.”</p>
<p>Harris later brought up Medicare again, noting that legislation Congress approved during Biden’s term in office allowed program administrators to negotiate certain prescription drug prices for the first time. That law, known as the Inflation Reduction Act, also capped the cost of insulin for Medicare enrollees at $35 per month.</p>
<p>Trump didn’t broach the subject of Social Security or Medicare during the September debate with Harris, but he did speak about the two programs during an earlier summer debate with President Joe Biden, before he stepped aside as the Democratic nominee.</p>
<p>During that debate, Trump claimed the Biden administration was going to “destroy” the two programs by allowing noncitizens to draw down benefits.</p>
<p>FactCheck <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2024/04/posts-misrepresent-immigrants-eligibility-for-social-security-numbers-benefits/" target="_blank">notes on its website</a> that comments and viral posts about noncitizens receiving Social Security benefits don’t always represent reality and sometimes confuse different programs.</p>
<p>“Immigrants who are lawfully living or authorized to work in the U.S. are eligible for a Social Security number and, in some cases, Social Security benefits. But viral posts make the false claim that ‘illegal immigrants’ can receive Social Security numbers and retirement benefits, and they confuse two programs managed by the Social Security Administration.”</p>
<p>KFF <a href="https://www.kff.org/faqs/medicare-open-enrollment-faqs/can-immigrants-enroll-in-medicare/" target="_blank">writes on its website</a> that whether legal immigrants are eligible for Medicare depends on several factors, including how long they’ve paid into the system.</p>
<p>“New immigrants are not eligible for Medicare regardless of their age. Once immigrants meet the residency requirements, eligibility and enrollment work the same as they do for others.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump on entitlement programs</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Trump’s comments on entitlement programs haven’t always been consistent or entirely clear, but his campaign and he both maintain they will “save” the program.</p>
<p>During an <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/03/11/former-president-donald-trump-on-entitlements-theres-tremendous-numbers-of-things-you-can-do.html" target="_blank">interview with CNBC</a> in March, Trump said that there are numerous things lawmakers could do to address solvency.</p>
<p>“There is a lot you can do in terms of entitlements, in terms of cutting and in terms of also the theft and the bad management of entitlements,” Trump said, declining to list any of those policy proposals.</p>
<p>Trump’s campaign website <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/agenda47/we-must-protect-medicare-and-social-security" target="_blank">posted a video</a> of him back in January 2023, saying Republicans “should not cut a penny” from Medicare or Social Security to pay for other legislation.</p>
<p>The problems facing Social Security and Medicare aren’t related to Congress reducing the amount of tax dollars flowing into the programs. Rather it is the structure for the programs lawmakers set up previously.</p>
<p>Without action by Congress, the trust funds won’t be able to account for benefit payments in the long term.</p>
<p>So the challenge for the next president won’t be preventing lawmakers from taking action related to Social Security and Medicare, but helping find a bipartisan path forward on legislation to change revenue, spending, or both.</p>
<p>Trump does want to end taxes on Social Security benefits, <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/112881452914352595" target="_blank">writing on social media</a> in July that “SENIORS SHOULD NOT PAY TAX ON SOCIAL SECURITY!”</p>
<p>Henry Aaron, the Bruce and Virginia MacLaury Chair and senior fellow in the Economic Studies Program at the Brookings Institution, wrote in a <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/a-voters-guide-to-social-security/" target="_blank">detailed </a>analysis of the platform that Trump’s proposal to end income tax on Social Security benefits “would accelerate trust fund depletion by about two years and deepen the long-run funding gap by more than 7%.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Harris policies</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Harris’ <a href="https://kamalaharris.com/issues/" target="_blank">campaign website</a> says she would “protect Social Security and Medicare against relentless attacks from Donald Trump and his extreme allies.”</p>
<p>“She will strengthen Social Security and Medicare for the long haul by making millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share in taxes,” the policy page states. “She will always fight to ensure that Americans can count on getting the benefits they earned.”</p>
<p>Harris <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/harris-rolls-out-broad-medicare-plan-provide-long-term-care-home" target="_blank">announced in early October </a>during an appearance on “The View” that if elected she would work toward including long-term home care for seniors enrolled in Medicare.</p>
<p>“There are so many people in our country who are right in the middle: They’re taking care of their kids and they’re taking care of their aging parents, and it’s just almost impossible to do it all, especially if they work,” Harris said during the live interview. “We’re finding that so many are then having to leave their job, which means losing a source of income, not to mention the emotional stress.”</p>
<p>The proposals would likely need partial, if not complete, buy-in from Congress to move forward and could come with a $40 billion annual price tag, though the campaign noted in <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25196234-harrismedicareathomeplan" target="_blank">a fact sheet </a>that there are pay-fors.</p>
<p>“These new benefits will be fully paid for and extend the life of the Medicare Trust Fund by expanding Medicare drug price negotiations, increasing the discounts drug manufacturers cover for certain brand-name drugs in Medicare and addressing Medicare fraud,” it states.</p>
<p>A Harris administration would also “crack down on pharmaceutical benefit managers (PBMs) to increase transparency, disclose more information on cost, and regulate other practices that raise prices” and “implement international tax reform” to pay for the changes.</p>

John McGuire. (Photos courtesy of respective congressional campaigns) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a significant fundraising boost, Democrat Gloria Witt for the first time has outpaced her Republican opponent, state Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland, in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District, with only weeks until the Nov. 5 election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Witt’s campaign reported having pulled in $218,627 in the third quarter ending Sept. 30, as opposed to McGuire, who raised $198,577 during the same time, according to the latest finance disclosure data released by the Federal Elections Commission Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In total, Witt has raised $276,755 since launching her campaign in March. McGuire, who was engulfed in a vicious primary battle with U.S. Rep. Bob Good, R-Farmville, for much of the year, has raised $1.15 million during this election cycle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But after McGuire’s expensive recount following the June 18 primary, where he narrowly defeated Good by just 366 votes out of 62,792 cast, his campaign funds have dwindled to $121,562. For the first time, Witt has surpassed him, reporting $163,905 in cash on hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic Party of Virginia Chairwoman Susan Swecker said in a statement Wednesday that while “Republicans are in disarray” in the 5th District, Witt is “laser-focused on running a winning” campaign. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Her impressive surge in fundraising is proof that Virginians in the 5th District know that she will stand up for them. There’s a reason John McGuire isn’t raising money — he still doesn’t have the support of his own party.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokesman for McGuire’s campaign did not respond to a text message seeking comment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fifth District Republicans have been grappling with </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/30/four-top-5th-district-gop-officials-ousted-for-not-supporting-mcguire/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">internal divisions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as infighting intensifies ahead of the upcoming election. The close primary race, followed by the recount in August, has deepened rifts within the party, with factions backing either McGuire or Good’s hardline conservative platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These internal struggles have raised concerns about the GOP&#8217;s ability to present a united front against Witt, leading to anxiety among some party insiders that the lingering tensions could weaken McGuire’s campaign and give Democrats an opening in a district which Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, won with 53% of the votes in 2016 and 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg, said that Democrats have been raising “a lot of cash” statewide during the 2024 election cycle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Witt seems to have benefitted from this, possibly also the fact that her odds, although long, seem better in the 5th than Karen Baker’s do in the 9th District,” Richards said, referring to the Democratic nominee who is </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/27/in-the-fightin-ninth-baker-seeks-to-end-griffiths-13-year-tenure/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seeking to unseat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, who has represented the district since 2011.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lack of national money being directed at McGuire “is not surprising,” since the 5th District is seen as a safe GOP seat, Richards added. “But if the GOP is fractured enough in the 5th, Witt may squeak in. I’m still not betting rent money she does win, but her odds are better than before.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite running a strong ground game in the neighboring 9th District, Baker has been struggling to catch up to the Republican incumbent in the money race. According to the latest FEC filings, she  raised $93,503 in the third quarter, and a total of $174,419 during this election cycle, with just $78,727 cash on hand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griffith, however, raised $164,299 between July and September, bringing in a total of $907,204, mostly from corporate donors. His campaign currently has $559,895 cash on hand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats, however, have kept their cash advantage in other competitive House districts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/10/tight-race-in-virginias-7th-congressional-district-as-derrick-anderson-eugene-vindman-face-off/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">7th District</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Democrat Eugene Vindman has significantly out-raised Republican Derrick Anderson during the third quarter, bringing in $6.4 million compared to Anderson&#8217;s $781,321. Overall, Vindman has raised $13.8 million for his campaign and holds nearly $3 million in cash on hand, while Anderson has raised a total of $1.9 million, with just over $1 million in cash reserves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And in the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/30/northern-virginias-10th-congressional-district-race-pits-clancy-against-subramanyam/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">10th District</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, state Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, out-raised Republican nominee Mike Clancy between July and September, bringing in $1.1 million compared to Clancy&#8217;s $205,219. Subramanyam has raised a total of $2.4 million for his congressional campaign, with $674,396 in cash on hand. Clancy, meanwhile, has raised $793,748 this election cycle and holds $563,699 in cash reserves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/07/kaine-faces-off-against-gop-challenger-cao-in-high-stakes-u-s-senate-race/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia&#8217;s U.S. Senate election</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Republican nominee Hung Cao out-raised incumbent democratic U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine in the third quarter with $3.3 million compared to Kaine’s $3 million, despite trailing the senator </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/harris-kaine-ahead-in-virginia-by-comfortable-margins-new-poll-says/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">by double digits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the polls. However, Kaine still leads in overall fundraising, with a total of $13.1 million raised this election cycle and more than $7 million cash on hand. In contrast, Cao has raised $6.2 million in total, with $2.2 million available.</span></p>

(Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)</p><p>Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump defended his plans for steep tariffs on Tuesday, arguing economists who say that those higher costs would get passed onto consumers are incorrect and that his proposals would benefit American manufacturing.</p>
<p>During an argumentative hour-long interview with Bloomberg Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait hosted by the Economic Club of Chicago, Trump vehemently denied tariffs on certain imported goods would lead to further spikes in inflation and sour America’s relationship with allies, including those in Europe.</p>
<p>“The higher the tariff, the more likely it is that the company will come into the United States, and build a factory in the United States so it doesn’t have to pay the tariff,” Trump said.</p>
<p>Micklethwait questioned Trump about what would happen to consumer prices during the months or even years it would take companies to build factories in the United States and hire workers.</p>
<p>Trump responded that he could make tariffs “so high, so horrible, so obnoxious that they’ll come right away.” Earlier during the interview, Trump mentioned placing tariffs on foreign-made products as high as 100% or 200%.</p>
<p>Harris-Walz 2024 spokesperson Joseph Costello wrote in a statement released following the interview that “Trump showed exactly why Americans can’t afford a second Trump presidency.”</p>
<p>“An angry, rambling Donald Trump couldn’t focus, had to be repeatedly reminded of the topic at hand, and whenever he did stake out a position, it was so extreme that no Americans would want it,” Costello wrote. “This was yet another reminder that a second Trump term is a risk Americans simply cannot take.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Smoot-Hawley memories</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Micklethwait noted during the interview that 40 million jobs and 27% of gross domestic product within the United States rely on trade, questioning how tariffs on those products would help the economy.</p>
<p>He also asked Trump if his plans for tariffs could lead the country down a similar path to the one that followed the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R9FOGmt7x0" target="_blank">Smoot-Hawley tariff law</a> becoming law in June 1930. Signed by President Herbert Hoover, some historians and economists have linked the law to the beginning of the Great Depression.</p>
<p>Trump disagreed with Micklethwait, though he didn’t detail why his proposals to increase tariffs on goods from adversarial nations as well as U.S. allies wouldn’t begin a trade war.</p>
<p>The U.S. Senate’s <a href="https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Senate_Passes_Smoot_Hawley_Tariff.htm" target="_blank">official explainer </a>on the Smoot-Hawley tariffs describes the law as being “among the most catastrophic acts in congressional history.” And the Congressional Research Services notes in a <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11030" target="_blank">report</a> on U.S. tariff policy that it was the last time lawmakers set tariff rates.</p>
<p>Desmond Lachman, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank, <a href="https://www.aei.org/economics/the-economic-consequences-of-a-second-trump-presidency/" target="_blank">wrote last month</a> that Trump’s proposal to implement tariffs of at least 60% on goods imported from China as well as 10 to 20% on all other imports could have severe economic consequences.</p>
<p>“It is difficult to see how such a unilateral trade policy in flagrant violation of World Trade Organization rules would not lead to retaliation by our trade partners with import tariff increases of their own,” Lachman wrote. “As in the 1930s, that could lead us down the destructive path of beggar-my-neighbor trade policies that could cause major disruption to the international trade system. Such an occurrence would be particularly harmful to our export industries and would heighten the chances of both a US and worldwide economic recession.”</p>
<p>CRS notes in its reports that while the Constitution grants Congress the authority to establish tariffs, lawmakers have given the president some authority over it as well.</p>
<p>The United States’ membership in the World Trade Organization and various other trade agreements also have “tariff-related commitments,” according to CRS.</p>
<p>“For more than 80 years, Congress has delegated extensive tariff-setting authority to the President,” the CRS report states. “This delegation insulated Congress from domestic pressures and led to an overall decline in global tariff rates. However, it has meant that the U.S. pursuit of a low-tariff, rules-based global trading system has been the product of executive discretion. While Congress has set negotiating goals, it has relied on Presidential leadership to achieve those goals.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The presidency and the Fed</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Trump said during the interview that he believes the president should have more input into whether the Federal Reserve raises or lowers interest rates, though he didn’t answer a question about keeping Jerome Powell as the chairman through the end of his term.</p>
<p>“I think I have the right to say I think he should go up or down a little bit,” Trump said. “I don’t think I should be allowed to order it. But I think I have the right to put in comments as to whether or not interest rates should go up or down.”</p>
<p>Trump declined to answer a question about whether he’s spoken with Russian leader Vladimir Putin since leaving office.</p>
<p>“I don’t comment on that,” Trump said. “But I will tell you that if I did, it’s a smart thing. If I’m friendly with people, if I have a relationship with people, that’s a good thing, not a bad thing.”</p>
<p>Journalist Bob Woodward wrote in his new book “War” that Trump and Putin<a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-biden-putin-war-ukraine-russia-zelenskyy-ce9c59f689d3f438264a64b2bfa0aa39" target="_blank"> have spoken at least seven times</a> and that Trump secretly sent Putin COVID-19 tests during the pandemic, which the Kremlin later confirmed, according to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/11/europe/kremlin-confirms-trump-covid-tests-intl/index.html" target="_blank">several</a> <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/kremlin-confirms-donald-trump-covid-test-vladimir-putin-president-russia-us-abbott-point/" target="_blank">news</a> <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/now/video/russia-says-trump-sent-covid-tests-to-putin-during-the-pandemic-221571653668" target="_blank">reports</a>.</p>
<p>Trump said the presidential race will likely come down to Pennsylvania, Michigan and possibly Arizona.</p>
<p>The Economic Club of Chicago has also invited Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris for a sit-down interview.</p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce for the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two GOP officials from Waynesboro have filed a lawsuit challenging Virginia&#8217;s voting system ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election while threatening to not certify the results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In their complaint, Curtis Lilly, the chairman of the Waynesboro Electoral Board, and Scott Mares, the board’s vice chair, are raising concerns about the validity of future results while echoing unmerited claims that the 2020 election, in which Democrat Joe Biden defeated then-President Donald Trump with more than 7 million votes, was stolen.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Filed on Oct. 4 at the Waynesboro Circuit Court against Virginia Department of Elections Commissioner Susan Beals and State Board of Elections Chairman John O’Bannon, the suit alleges that the voting machines used in the state are unverifiable and could potentially be manipulated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plaintiffs further claim the machines may be connected to the internet, allowing for external tampering, though this is illegal under state law and no evidence has been provided to support this allegation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When reached by phone Tuesday, Lilly declined to be interviewed for this story. Mares did not respond to several calls seeking comment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lilly and Mares argue that under the current legal regime, local electoral board members are unable to personally review and verify that the voting machine program being used to count the ballots “is keeping and recording a true and accurate count,” and that the device’s record tape accurately represents the ballots cast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Consequently, the plaintiffs believe that the voting machine is counting the votes in secret, because neither the program counting the votes recorded on the ballots nor the ballots themselves can be examined,” the complaint says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lilly further stated in an affidavit attached to the complaint that he “cannot ensure that the machines do not connect to the internet, allowing for vote counting algorithm manipulation, nor can I ensure with any certainty that the electronic ballot scanners are presenting results which are consistent with the contents of the ballot box.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Henry Chambers, a professor for constitutional law at the University of Richmond School of Law, said in a phone interview Tuesday that the lawsuit appears to be based on long debunked conspiracy theories circulating after the 2020 presidential election that claimed vote counting machines had been programmed to get votes wrong and to flip votes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s not really a serious thing, but some people have bought into it and it sounds like these folks have bought into it, too,” Chambers said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Their notion is that vote counting that is done by a machine is done in secret, and therefore you have to hand-count the votes, presumably in public, in order to have a real tally of the actual vote count,” Chamber continued. “That would suggest that voting that is not done by hand and in public qualifies as counting in secret, which in theory would violate the state Constitution.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, voters cast paper ballots, which are then counted by optical scanning machines — as required </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title24.2/chapter6/section24.2-626/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">by state law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — to expedite the process and avoid human error. Ballot scanning machines are certified to meet both state and federal standards and are maintained under a controlled chain of custody.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before every election, the scanners are tested using a predetermined sample of votes to ensure they are tallied accurately before any actual votes are cast, and it is against the law to connect a ballot scanning machine to the Internet at any point. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals, who was appointed as Virginia’s top elections official in March 2022, did not respond to text messages seeking comment Tuesday, and a spokeswoman for the Department of the Elections said in an email that the department does not comment on pending litigation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/08/08/virginias-top-elections-official-says-shes-confident-about-the-accuracy-of-results/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in July, Beals said that hacking the scanning machines was impossible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Period. They cannot be,” she said, adding that after the testing of the devices ahead of the election and on Election Day, officials also conduct risk-eliminating audits, which she called the back-end check.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So we have three different checks throughout the system just to make sure that the machines are reporting accurately.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chambers, the UR professor, called the plaintiffs’ argument that the machine counting of ballots happened in secrecy “an odd thing,” because the machine itself is doing the counting in a public space, supervised by election officials. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The problem with counting being done in public is that one can’t necessarily explicitly see what’s going on. But the fact is, we have lots of things that count things and we just agree that it’s being counted correctly, like ATM machines,” Chambers said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No one would say that the ATM machine is spitting out money in secret, but it’s spitting out money in response to a request. Here, a voting machine is counting votes in response to a ballot being fed through a machine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By asking for ballots to be hand-counted instead of being tabulated by machines, the plaintiffs could really be asking for a slow-down of the count, Chambers added, which “can introduce additional problems with a valid count — and that is the whole point of feeding the ballots through during the day and having a continuous count is so that you can have results in a reasonable and fair time. Hand counting is used only when necessary when you&#8217;re talking about things like absentee ballots or ballots that can’t be read by the machine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also remains unclear why the GOP election officials who filed the suit would threaten to not certify the presidential election, in a county that leans Republican and where Trump won with 51-46% in 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rich Anderson, the chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia, underscored that the lawsuit was a lone effort by a small group of GOP officials from one locality. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As far as I know it’s only happening in this one jurisdiction out of 133, but it’s all going to get settled in the courts anyway,” Anderson said in a phone interview. “What they’re asking is the court to render its opinion, which it will do, and the opinion will likely be on the side of Virginia law, which says that ballots are counted through the optical scanners, not by hand.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The counting of ballots by optical scanning machines has been proven as safe and reliable, Anderson said. </span></p>

Glenn Youngkin speaking with reporters outside the Capitol Building on March 7, 2024. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long before becoming a lawyer, state lawmaker and Virginia’s first Black House Speaker, Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, was, for years, unable to vote. After a previous felony conviction, it wasn’t until former Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell restored his rights that Scott could participate in democracy again — eventually paving the way for his own run for office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Justice Department on Friday filed a lawsuit against Virginia, alleging that a state program aimed at removing people from the voter rolls, which Gov. Glenn Youngkin touted in an </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/eo/EO-35-Comprehensive-Election-Security-Ensuring-Legal-Voters-and-Accurate-Counting---vF---8.7.24.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executive order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in August, was implemented too close to the Nov. 5 elections and wrongfully included eligible voters. Scott said it’s another example of Youngkin’s administration restricting voting access. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would not be where I am today if I had to depend on somebody like Glenn Youngkin to help me get my rights restored,” Scott said in an interview Monday. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_37471" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/img_4042/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-37471" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_4042-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_4042-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_4042-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_4042-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_4042-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_4042-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth (left), with former Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell, who restored his voting rights after a felony conviction, at the state Capitol in January. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a memo in response to the suit obtained by The Mercury over the weekend, Richard Cullen, a counselor to Youngkin, wrote that Virginia’s process for removing noncitizens from the voting rolls has taken place under both Democratic and Republican governors. It also outlines how Youngkin believes he is not violating a federal policy to have purged rolls by a set time that would allow a buffer to resolve any errors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Federal law does not prohibit the removal of noncitizens from the voting rolls,” the memo said, adding that the 90-day “quiet period” under the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) is “not relevant to this process since Virginia conducts an individualized — not systematic — review per Virginia law in order to correct registration records.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin on Friday called the lawsuit “unprecedented,” underscoring that his executive order simply was “appropriately enforcing a 2006 law” signed by then-Gov. Tim Kaine, a Democrat, which requires Virginia to remove noncitizens from the voter rolls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With the support of our attorney general, we will defend these common sense steps that we are legally required to take, with every resource available to us,” Youngkin said in a statement. “Virginia’s election will be secure and fair, and I will not stand idly by as this politically motivated action tries to interfere in our elections, period.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Scott commended the Justice Department for taking action (it also recently filed a similar </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/09/27/justice-department-alabama-lawsuit-voting/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">suit against Alabama)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The reason that we have this 90-day rule is that we don’t want citizens to be accidentally removed,” Scott said. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Related lawsuit stresses potential effect on naturalized citizens</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The DOJ suit also isn’t the only litigation that Youngkin faces over his Executive Order 35. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A federal </span><a href="https://www.lwv.org/newsroom/press-releases/lawsuit-challenges-recent-voter-roll-purges-virginia-preventing-eligible-us" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">suit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filed by the Virginia Coalition for Immigrant Rights and the League of Women Voters of Virginia earlier this month alleges that the process used to purge the rolls violates the </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/national-voter-registration-act-1993-nvra" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Voter Registration Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, disenfranchising eligible voters while raising concerns over transparency and accuracy in the state’s voter registration system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legal action by the two nonprofits came after reports surfaced that Virginians were being removed from the voter rolls due to alleged inaccuracies and outdated information. Many of these removals, the suit argues, were done without proper notification or investigation, leaving eligible voters unaware that they could no longer cast their ballots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit also claims that the purges disproportionately affect minority communities, low-income voters, and those who may not have easy access to the internet to check their voter status. It further asserts that the Youngkin administration has failed to adequately confirm whether a voter is ineligible, potentially silencing their voice in the democratic process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Naturalized citizens serve in our armed forces, pay taxes, and show their patriotism daily with their acts and contributions to our society,” Monica Sarmiento, executive director of the Virginia Coalition for Immigrant Rights, said in a statement earlier this month.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Forcing new American communities to carry undue burden that no other community is required to comply with is discrimination, and does not represent the values that our commonwealth stands for,” Sarmiento said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Youngkin’s executive order, the Virginia Department of Elections is now required to send just one notice to individuals at risk of being removed from the voter rolls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This notice is based on information from the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), but there is no requirement for the accuracy of that information to be verified by either the Department of Elections or local election officials before action is taken. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Sen. Bill Stanley, R-Franklin County, said Monday that the law referenced in Youngkin’s executive order relates to persons who self-identify as “non-citizens” on DMV forms that are turned over to the State Board of Elections, which then checks the information against the voter rolls and notifies those persons of pending removal from the state’s voter registration list, giving them 14 days notice of removal and the right to challenge.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And there are failsafe measures to this,” Stanley said. “Even if they are subsequently removed from the rolls, let’s say, in error, those persons can still register to vote on Election Day under our ‘same day’ registration law. So I fail to see why the federal government is doing this but for no other reason but to try to upset our otherwise sound voter registration process here in Virginia for political purposes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Rich Anderson, the chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia, said in a phone interview Monday afternoon that Youngkin’s executive order “brought together a lot of operating practices and standards that may have been scattered over a number of other places, put it together in one document and demonstrated to the commonwealth that the governor took this seriously and was exercising his responsibilities as the chief executive.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the responsibilities of the executive branch, working with the legislative branch, is to “ensure confidence in our electoral processes and systems, and that was the whole intent of this, I think,” Anderson said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Elections Commissioner Susan Beals, whom Youngkin appointed as Virginia’s top elections official just weeks after assuming office in early 2021, said </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/08/08/virginias-top-elections-official-says-shes-confident-about-the-accuracy-of-results/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in an interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> one week before the governor issued his executive order that a process to prohibit non-citizens from voting was already in place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Anybody who comes to the DMV and shows documents that indicate they are a non-citizen — whether it is a visa or residency — their name is sent to the Department of Elections on a monthly basis so we can double check to make sure that they did not make their way on our voter rolls. If we find them on the rolls, we cancel them,” Beals said in the interview. </span></p>

In October 2023, more than 3,000 people had been mistakenly </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/01/voting-rights-advocates-blast-youngkin-admin-over-error-affecting-3400/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">removed from voter rolls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Earlier that year, the administration also quietly adjusted its </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/surovell-spruill-ask-if-youngkin-has-changed-rights-restoration-process/article_dd1232ba-c4fb-11ed-8b57-3723c72fb438.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">restoration of voting rights process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s Constitution permanently disenfranchises people with felony convictions unless a governor pardons them or restores their rights. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McDonnell, the Republican governor who restored Scott’s rights, along with democratic Govs. Terry McAuliffe and Ralph Northam, had streamlined the process and eventually made it automatic. Now a petition-based process, Youngkin’s </span><a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/local/virginia/virginians-whose-rights-have-been-restored-drops-in-second-year-of-youngkin-administration-reports-show/291-fbe59fc9-c488-4449-be3e-ad4c0ba1c374" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">restoration numbers have dropped</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> compared to his predecessors’ and little criteria has been made available to explain conditions for a restoration petition to be granted.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia chapter of the NAACP took Youngkin to court last year to get answers but a </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/judge-finds-for-youngkin-administration-in-naacps-foia-case/article_210d11ec-9936-11ee-a87e-138606562546.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">judge ruled that most details are exempt from being shared</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through a provision in the Freedom of Information Act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Youngkin’s changes to the process aren’t going against the law, Democratic lawmakers feel it’s being used as a way to limit who can vote. The latest executive order falls amid </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/12/nx-s1-5147789/voting-election-2024-noncitizen-fact-check-trump" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">continued allegations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump that illegal immigrants are trying to vote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a recent </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/23/trump-youngkin-urge-early-voting-during-tele-rally/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">telephone rally</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with Trump, Youngkin touted the purge of over 6,000 people as noncitizens. But a Washington Post review of records and interviews with election officials </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/10/09/youngkin-noncitizen-voters-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">found that most of the purge stemmed from paperwork errors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, like people forgetting to check a citizenship box. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also noted that of Virginia’s three illegal voting prosecutions to occur since 2022, none involved a question of citizenship.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The race is dominated by four men and one woman. According to </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/local/richmond/2024/03/27/richmond-mayor-candidates-whos-running-2024" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Axios</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Richmond hasn&#8217;t had a non-Black mayor since now-U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine held the office more than 20 years ago. And the city has also never had a Black woman mayor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re unsure what precinct or district you’re in, the city offers </span><a href="https://www.rva.gov/elections/precincts" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">downloadable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> precinct, voter and election district voting maps. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you haven’t voted since the last major election back in 2020, there aren’t many changes in the process of voting, said Keith Balmer, General Registrar for the City of Richmond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In regards to this election, the thing is that there wasn&#8217;t really a whole lot of movement as far as new legislation with the General Assembly, so there&#8217;s no new laws that really impact it,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters who haven’t voted in the last few years should also check what district they’re in, said Balmer, who added that his department has already sent out mailers to voters who were moved into a new city council district because of redistricting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Balmer is being </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/13/after-hr-probe-richmond-officials-suggest-restructuring-of-election-office/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">investigated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/registrar-balmer-city-credit-card-investigation-elections-office/article_6be2d0e8-146b-11ef-971d-1f0b4090e555.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Richmond Inspector General’s Office</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for allegations of nepotism and improper spending in the city’s elections office, which Balmer has led since 2021.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Mayoral Priorities </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are common threads that nearly every potential mayor is pulling on to tie their campaign together with how they’d run the city. Although many have the same priorities, they have different approaches and some offer more context than others about their plans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All five candidates — Andreas Addison, Danny Avula, Michelle Mosby, Maurice Neblett and Harrison Roday — list reforming City Hall</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">as a priority issue on their campaign websites. Some, like </span><a href="https://dannyformayor.com/priorities/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avula</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, have detailed lists about how they want to do that, while others, such as Neblett, have only one sentence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the past several months, Richmond’s City Hall has experienced major issues concerning </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2024-04-19/meals-tax-auditor-review-richmond-restaurants" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">meals taxes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://newsvirginian.com/news/state-regional/purchasing-cards-credit-policy-richmond-spending/article_61f0df4a-cab0-561f-b0e6-ab78df18919d.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">overdue balances </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">on credit card spending, and a lack of </span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/local-news/richmond/facing-transparency-criticism-stoney-defends-his-administration-and-city-credit-card-program/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">transparency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, so it’s not surprising that the mayoral candidates have set their sights on fixing the issues there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing is the next common thread in each candidate’s campaign, and they all lay out their plans to improve how the city can better serve renters and homeowners on their websites – except for Neblett, who doesn’t mention any housing goals on his site. The rest mention expanding the city’s land trust portfolios, such as the </span><a href="https://www.richmondlandbank.com/about-mwclt" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maggie Walker Community Land Trust,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help stave off evictions and people experiencing homelessness. Each of these candidates have other ideas as well, such as</span><a href="https://rodayforrichmond.com/housing/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Roday’s plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">  to invest $100 million in housing in the next four years. The money would go toward preventing evictions and into building more affordable housing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The candidates’ other priorities include:</span></p>
<p><b>Safe Neighborhoods:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> All the candidates say they want to create safer neighborhoods. Generally, they highlight fixing crumbling sidewalks, building better biking and walking infrastructure, and expanding public transportation. Mosby plans to tackle crime by trying to recruit more police officers and get funding for community based response teams to address mental health emergencies. </span><a href="https://www.mauriceneblett.com/issues/#jump3" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neblett</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s website mentions creating trust between residents and police as a route to safer communities. </span></p>
<p><b>Education</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Roday, Avula, Mosby, and Neblett all plan to work closer with Richmond Public Schools to improve school buildings and want more funding for schools. Addison is </span><a href="https://www.andreasaddison.com/education" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to build a workforce development center in Southside for students and adults to learn trade skills. </span></p>
<p><b>Reproductive Rights:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Addison, Avula and Roday have listed access to reproductive services, such as those provided by Planned Parenthood, as a priority.</span></p>
<p><b>LGBTQ+ Issues</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Addison and Avula list supporting the LGBTQ+ community as a priority. </span><a href="https://dannyformayor.com/priorities/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avula</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> says he’ll push back against any state or federal attempts to reduce protections and rights, while </span><a href="https://www.andreasaddison.com/inclusion-and-belonging" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addison</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wants to create an Office of LGBTQ Affairs that will help connect the community to services and support small businesses, among other goals. </span></p>
<p><b>Climate Issues</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Avula is the only candidate that mentions climate change on his campaign website, stating that he wants to fully fund the city’s Office of Sustainability to realize the goals defined in the </span><a href="https://www.rvagreen2050.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RVAgreen 2050 plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which lays out a plan to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 in the city in part by creating climate-neutral buildings and by increasing tree coverage.</span></p>
<p><strong>Housing:</strong> Last month, we asked the candidates about their plans to ease affordable housing challenges in the city; <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/16/richmond-mayor-candidates-ideas-on-housing-and-how-the-state-can-help-the-city/">here&#8217;s what they told us</a>.</p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Richmond mayoral candidate profiles</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Mercury gleaned information about each candidates’ policy views from our own reporting, and by reviewing their campaign websites, their comments in other media and at mayoral forums being held around the city. We also asked each candidate one question:</span><strong><i> The city’s  demographics have changed since the last election; how will you be mayor for the entire city?</i></strong></p>
<p><b>Andreas Addison</b></p>

(Photo courtesy Andreas Addison for Mayor)</p></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.andreasaddison.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addison</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has represented Richmond&#8217;s 1st District since 2017. He is the owner of Pure Fitness RVA in Scott’s Addition, as well as working as an adjunct professor at the University of Virginia&#8217;s School of Public Policy. Prior to his time on city council, he worked in City Hall. Addison’s campaign had raised $128,497 as of Aug. 31, according to the Virginia Public Access Project, a nonprofit, nonpartisan website that tracks campaign spending and donations, releases data on elections and displays election results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On how he will govern the whole city, Addison said though the city’s form of governing was based upon creating a racially diverse opportunity for residents to have representation on the city council and in who they elect as mayor, it has not been done in an equitable way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The only way to make sure that you actually have a good sense of what the voice for the people is, and the job you have as a public servant, is to make sure that you have a diverse voice, a voice of all people from all over the city and all backgrounds and all racial diversities and social income levels,” Addison said.</span></p>
<p><b>Dr. Danny Avula</b></p>
<figure id="attachment_40380" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:150px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=40380" rel="attachment wp-att-40380"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-40380" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Danny-Avula_courtesy-campaign-150x150.webp" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Dr. Danny Avula, former director of the Richmond and Henrico Health Districts and 2024 mayoral candidate. (Photo courtesy Dr. Danny Avula for Richmond Mayor)</p></figure>
<p><a href="https://dannyformayor.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Avula</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s background includes working for the Richmond and Henrico Health Districts for 12 years, with half of that time as director. Former Gov. Ralph Northam appointed him to head up the state’s COVID-19 vaccination program. It’s his first time running for office. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of campaign fundraising, in the past few weeks, Avula money levels have surged and  currently stands at $827,698. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avula did not respond to the Virginia Mercury’s request for comment. But in a response to a question posed by </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/elections/2024-09-24/richmond-black-reparations-addison-avula-mosby-neblett-roday" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next City and VPM News</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> asking how would a candidate for mayor support Black reparations, Avula said he has a long record of addressing racial inequity through his work in public health.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Throughout my career, both in and out of public service, I have made it a point to work across racial and economic lines. Since I began this campaign, engaging diverse communities has been a core principle,” she wrote. “I will prioritize equitable policies that address systemic </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">inequalities and promote economic opportunities for all.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Where are you allocating the money in the budget? Where are you prioritizing physically economic development opportunities? Are you putting in structures in economic development transactions that the city is involved in that reflect not only the needs of workers who are focused on those projects, but reflect the needs of residents?” he asked.</span></p>

(Photos courtesy of candidates' campaigns)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The election in Virginia’s 7th Congressional District is shaping up to be a tight contest, with two political newcomers vying for the support of swayable voters in one of the state’s most competitive districts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Eugene Vindman is taking on Republican Derrick Anderson in a race to succeed U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Prince William, who announced last year that she is not seeking reelection in favor of a 2025 gubernatorial bid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The district, anchored in Prince William County and stretching west to Madison County and south to Caroline County, has a history of narrow victories in past elections. With this being Vindman’s inaugural run for office and Anderson’s second foray into the 7th District race, both are working hard to connect with undecided voters who may swing the election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to their shared ambition to represent the district in the U.S. Congress, both candidates bring a strong record of military service to the table — a key theme in their respective campaigns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel and attorney, has emphasized his commitment to defending democracy and advocating for national security. Anderson, also a veteran, served as a Green Beret in the Army Special Forces and has focused his campaign on conservative values, including strengthening national defense and supporting law enforcement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was a troop leader paratrooper in the 82nd, and when we jumped out of airplanes, it didn&#8217;t matter who was to the left or right of us, who was Democrat, Republican or independent, or whether you’re Black, Hispanic, what part of the country you came from,” Vindman told The Mercury in a recent interview. “We’re focused on the mission, and that’s my mindset in everything that I do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson did not respond to repeated interview requests for this article. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Republican has aligned himself with former President Donald Trump’s Make America Great Again agenda and has expressed his support for at least some proposals in the conservative policy roadmap known as Project 2025, which outlines plans to reshape government and policy under a future Republican administration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Energy policy has also emerged as a significant point of debate between the two candidates, with each offering contrasting visions for the future of Virginia’s energy sector.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, both have taken clear stances on abortion and immigration. Vindman has emphasized the need to protect reproductive rights and seek comprehensive immigration reform, while Anderson has focused on more restrictive immigration policies and has voiced support for overturning federal protections for abortion.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Candidates’ backgrounds </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman’s family immigrated to the United States from Ukraine in 1979 when he was 3. He joined the Army’s 82nd Airborne division as a paratrooper before rising to lieutenant colonel and Judge Advocate General,,the highest-ranking uniformed lawyer in the military. He later joined the White House’s National Security Team. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman’s twin brother, Alex Vindman, became nationally known as a whistleblower who leaked details about a phone conversation betweenTrump and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine during his presidency, which led to Trump’s impeachment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman was </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/07/politics/alex-vindman-donald-trump-impeachment/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fired</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">by Trump in 2020. He was investigating war crimes in Ukraine when Spanberger announced her gubernatorial bid last year. Vindman dominated the Democratic nomination contest, garnering more than 50% of the vote in a seven-way </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/18/subramanyam-vindman-win-democratic-primaries-to-succeed-wexton-spanberger/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">primary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I thought to myself, I really care about which direction this country is going in,” Vindman explained as his primary reason for running.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson, who traces his beginnings to working at his mother’s restaurant, served in the Middle East in Afghanistan, Bahrain, Jordan, Israel, and Lebanon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He went on to work at the White House’s Office of National Drug Control Policy during the Trump administration and became a lawyer, before witnessing the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, which he said was “botched.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was upset with the lack of accountability for this administration,” Anderson said during an Oct. 2 candidates </span><a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?538743-1/virginia-7th-congressional-district-debate" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">debate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with Vindman at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">District profile</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger has represented the 7th District since 2019, after ousting U.S. Rep. Dave Brat, D-Henrico, by 50.3%-48.4%</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent Cook Report </span><a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/analysis/house/house-overview/house-rating-changes-close-races-nj-07-and-va-07-shift-toward" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has moved the district from “lean Democrat” to “toss up.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By June, Vindman had raised $7.4 million — over five times as much as Anderson, who raised $1.4 million. The Democratic National Committee recently backed Vindman’s effort with another $50,000. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The national support for candidates in the 7th District underscores the race’s significance in the broader political landscape. With Republicans holding a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives — 220 to 211 over Democrats — the outcome of this race could have far-reaching implications. Control of Congress will be pivotal in advancing or obstructing the agenda of the next president, whether it’s Trump or Harris.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The economy</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A September Pew Research </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/09/09/issues-and-the-2024-election/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> revealed that the economy is the top issue on voters&#8217; minds this election season, and both candidates offer contrasting approaches to addressing economic concerns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman has expressed worries about Trump’s policies and the potential impact of Project 2025 on the district’s workforce, which includes nearly </span><a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47716" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">60,000 federal employees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In contrast, Anderson has focused his campaign on energy policy, emphasizing the need for a strong energy sector to bolster the economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump’s own policy plan, Agenda 47, would remove about 100,000 of those jobs. George Mason University professor Terry Clower </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/30/trump-government-cuts-could-cost-house-republicans-majority-.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">estimated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the eliminated positions would equal a $27-28 billion loss from Virginia’s economy annually.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson, like Trump, publicly denies supporting Project 2025, which calls for major overhauls of the federal government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Folks, I did not know what Project 2025 was until this individual kept talking about it over and over again. But I can tell you that it’s not my plan,” Anderson </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtWw7ZqEkTI" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at a recent candidate’s forum at a Manassas middle school, referring to his opponent   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman has said he opposes Project 2025 because he doesn’t want to see it replace about 50,0000 “Schedule F” non-partisan federal employees with loyalists to whichever political party is in power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eliminating those jobs would literally devastate the economy in this area. It’s profoundly unfair, and it’s also damaging to national security,” Vindman said. “These are people that have spent decades in government, understanding threats, understanding Russia, China, or law enforcement, and (Project 2025 calls for) replacing them with partisan political hacks.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help people’s pocketbooks, Vindman suggested building off the work of Democratic President Joe Biden to cap medication prices, including insulin, by placing limits on a broader range of medications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Anderson, who said he understands that “there is climate change,” underscored that businesses have named electricity bills as their top expense, and that the economy could get back on track by prioritizing domestic production of energy. Anderson falsely claimed about 35 minutes into the UMW </span><a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?538743-1/virginia-7th-congressional-district-debate" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">debate</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that the country is a “net importer rather than a net exporter of oil.” According to the Energy Information Agency, a federal government tracker of energy trends, the U.S. in 2023 imported about 8.51 million barrels per day of oil from 86 countries, </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=727&amp;t=6" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">compared</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to exporting about 10.15 million barrels per day of oil.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Abortion</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abortion rights are another major issue for voters nationwide, and the candidates in the 7th District reflect opposing views. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman has called for restoring Roe v. Wade, advocating for federal protections for abortion rights. Anderson, on the other hand, has stated that while he does not support a national ban on abortion, he believes the decision should be left to individual states, allowing them to determine their own abortion laws.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are two fundamental questions in this race: Will you restore women’s right to reproductive health care, as it was under Roe v. Wade?” Vindman asked. “And will you stand against a national abortion ban? I will restore Roe v. Wade, and I will stand against the national abortion ban.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson, in the UMW debate, denied supporting a federal abortion ban, or taking away reproductive rights to in vitro fertilization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson also said he would support over the counter contraceptives, but in a previous </span><a href="https://starexponent.com/news/local/government-politics/elections/article_a5197e3e-7609-11ef-8e03-2bb78dfa980f.html#tncms-source=login" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">forum </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">for both the 7th and 10th congressional districts, he stopped short of saying if he would support a woman’s right to choose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I support the states to be able to make those decisions that best fits those states,” Anderson said at the time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson has falsely stated that former Gov. Ralph Northam supported infanticide, which is illegal in all 50 states. Northam was talking about </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/13/virginia-democrats-do-not-support-infanticide-but-heres-why-trump-keeps-saying-they-do/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">palliative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> care for babies born with complications during a 2019 interview that has been widely misquoted in every election cycle since.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Immigration</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On immigration, both candidates acknowledge issues at the U.S. southern border, but their approaches differ.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman has proposed reviving the Border Act of 2024, a federal measure aiming to address border security and immigration reform that nearly passed before </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/border-immigration-senate-vote-924f48912eecf1dc544dc648d757c3fe" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">being blocked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by congressional Republicans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In contrast, Anderson has emphasized the need for strong immigration and foreign policies to enhance community safety, but he has not offered a specific plan or proposal to address the issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with several other measures, the Senate proposal would have given the Department of Homeland Security emergency authority to shut down the border if daily migrant encounters reached 4,000 over a one-week span. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If those crossings rose to over 5,000 on average per day in a given week, DHS would be required to close the border to migrants crossing through ports of entry. Some migrants could stay if they proved they were escaping torture or prosecution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman said he would have supported the bill, which “would have been the toughest bill in decades, and we&#8217;re badly in need of comprehensive immigration reform.” </span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods /Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Affordable Care Act saved my life,” said Laura Packard, a Virginia resident, Stage 4 Hodgkin’s Lymphoma survivor and health advocate who joined other advocates and state and federal Democratic lawmakers on Monday as part of a national bus tour highlighting Democrat-led efforts to expand health care access.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dubbed “Care Force One,” the bus is making stops around Virginia and 16 other states over the next few weeks featuring speakers from Congress and state legislatures, alongside people sharing stories of how they benefited from the Affordable Care Act and the Inflation Reduction Act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A hallmark of Democratic President Barack Obama’s administration, the ACA established a public insurance marketplace and prevented insurance companies from denying coverage based on preexisting conditions. Currently, over 20 million people utilize it nationwide and nearly 400,000 Virginians could pay more for health insurance if it were repealed. Amid this year’s congressional and presidential election where Trump hopes to win a second term in the White House, Democrats caution he will again seek to undo the ACA. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around the time of Packard’s 2017 diagnosis, Republicans in the U.S. Congress and then-President Donald Trump were </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-gop-leaders-take-victory-lap-after-house-passes-trumpcare-n754896" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">celebrating steps towards repealing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the now 14-year-old federal policy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump’s campaign hasn’t formally rolled out plans for healthcare policy if re-elected. But speakers at Monday’s event pointed to his past actions — like his </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trump-to-propose-big-cuts-to-safety-net-in-new-budget-this-week/2017/05/21/62c01f44-3e34-11e7-adba-394ee67a7582_story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">budget proposals to cut Medicaid funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> —  along with statements his running made made in recent media interviews and statements Trump made during his debate with Vice President Kamala Harris as clues to his intentions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his debate with Harris in early September, Trump said that there are “concepts and options” for a cheaper system than the ACA that he will outline in the “not-too-distant future.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent interviews vice presidential candidate Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance indicated the administration would </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/vance-says-future-trump-administration-defund-planned-parenthood-rcna174211" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">end federal funding to organizations like Planned Parenthood</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and suggested a plan to </span><a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2024/09/18/vance-targets-inflation-immigration-at-raleigh-event/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">separate patients into different health insurance pools based on individual risks.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are not going to let their ‘concepts of a plan’ happen where insurance companies get to pick and choose who they want to cover,” Packard said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Democratic 1st Congressional District candidate Leslie Mehta, Medicaid helped her family cover additional expenses for her disabled daughter Brooke. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before her death, Brooke lived with a rare neurological disorder called Rhett’s Syndrome that severely limits motor skills and language. Mehta said Monday that initially, she was denied Medicaid coverage for her daughter’s condition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once covered, the family was able to get a device that helped them communicate with her. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Medicaid allowed me to be able to hear the words ‘I love you’ from my oldest daughter,” Mehta said. “When we talk about Medicaid, and we talk about the ability to have it for so many in our country, this is what it means.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement last week, Trump’s campaign said that more concrete outlines are forthcoming with a goal of reducing health care costs by other methods. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He will release more details, but his overall position on healthcare remains the same: bring down costs and increase the quality of care by improving competition in the marketplace,” national campaign secretary Karolina Leavitt said in a statement sent to The Mercury. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, noted how Democrats in Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022 — which included price caps on insulin and the ability to negotiate the prices of other popular prescription medications. At the state level and prior to being elected to congress, McClellan helped pass a bill to create Virginia’s state healthcare exchange. And in 2018, a few Virginian Republicans backed Democrat-led efforts to expand Medicaid eligibility. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speakers, including McClellan, also pointed to the “Project 2025” policy guidebook from conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation as a reason for caution. Trump has distanced himself from the blueprint, which outlines cuts to Medicaid, despite his ties to several of its authors and the organization having </span><a href="https://www.heritage.org/impact/trump-administration-embraces-heritage-foundation-policy-recommendations" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">praised him for tapping into previous their proposals in his first term</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Donald Trump, J.D. Vance, and Project 2025 are coming for our healthcare,” McClellan said. “We have a lot of work to do to build on the progress we have already made.”</span></p>

(Jonathan Ernst/Scott Olson/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, leads Republican Donald Trump by 11 points (52-41%) among Virginia likely voters, according to </span><a href="https://cnu.edu/wasoncenter/surveys/archive/2024-10-07.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a new poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> released Monday by the Wason Center for Civic Leadership at Christopher Newport University. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey found that 4% of voters remain undecided four weeks before the Nov. 5 election, while 3% say they will vote for someone else. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the U.S. Senate race, Democrat Tim Kaine leads Republican Hung Cao by 20 points, or 55% to 35%, with 8% saying they are undecided and 2% saying they will vote for someone else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Top-of-mind issues for Virginia likely voters include inflation and the economy (29%), threats to democracy (18%), immigration (11%), followed by abortion (10%). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the survey, voters think Harris would do a better job than Trump handling an array of policy issues, with a narrow lead on inflation and the economy (49% to 48%), a moderate advantage on threats to democracy (54-40%) and a large advantage on abortion (60-32%), racial inequality (61-31%) and climate change (61-29%). Trump has a narrow advantage over Harris on handling immigration (49-48%). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, Harris has a +9 favorability rating (51-42%) in Virginia, with 8% indicating they have no opinion or don’t know. Trump is underwater with a -22 favorability rating (36-58%); 6% say no opinion or don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, has a +12 favorability rating (47-35%), with 19% indicating no opinion or don’t know. Ohio Sen. JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, has a –16 favorability rating at 34 to 50%, with 16% indicating no opinion or don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine has a +23 favorability rating (53-30%) with 17% saying they have no opinion or don’t know. Cao has an even favorability rating (23-23%); however, he is less well known, with a majority of likely voters indicating no opinion or don’t know (54%). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With early voting underway in Virginia since Sept. 20, likely voters are “fairly enthusiastic” to vote in the elections, with 82% indicating they are either very enthusiastic (64%) or somewhat enthusiastic (18%). Democratic voters have an enthusiasm advantage with 75% indicating they are very enthusiastic compared to 68% of Republicans and 46% of Independents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While most Virginia likely voters surveyed have yet to cast their ballots, a higher percentage of Democrats say they have voted when compared to Republicans and Independents (22-11-9%). In past elections Democrats have been more likely to vote early than Republicans, though Gov. Glenn Youngkin made a push in the 2022 General Assembly elections for Republicans to vote early and has </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/20/as-early-voting-starts-in-virginia-political-parties-rally-their-bases/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advocated for early voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the current election cycle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results of the Wason poll are based on 800 interviews with registered Virginia voters who are likely general election voters, including 211 on landline and 589 on cell phone, conducted Sept. 28 to Oct. 4, 2024. The margin of error for the whole survey is +/-4.4%</span></p>

Tim Kaine, D-Va., at an interview in Richmond (Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury) and Hung Cao (courtesy of Hung Cao campaign)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The morning of Monday, April 16, 2007, is forever etched in Virginia Democratic U.S. Rep. Tim Kaine&#8217;s memory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On that tragic day, Seung-Hui Cho, an undergraduate student at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, killed 32 people and wounded 17 others in a mass shooting before taking his own life. The incident, carried out with two semi-automatic pistols, remains one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I still have a lot of almost PTSD kind of scar tissue about that,” said Kaine in a recent interview. At the time, he was in the second year of his four-year term as Virginia’s governor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, 17 years later, Kaine is seeking a third term in the U.S. Senate. The Democrat faces a challenge from Republican Hung Cao, a retired Navy captain and political newcomer. With </span><a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2024/virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">polling data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showing Kaine holding a comfortable lead, both candidates are ramping up their campaigns as they approach the final stretch.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="A3R7TVJDVd"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/02/kaine-and-cao-clash-on-immigration-the-economy-in-heated-debate-at-norfolk-state-university/">Kaine and Cao clash on immigration, the economy in heated debate at Norfolk State University</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Kaine and Cao clash on immigration, the economy in heated debate at Norfolk State University&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/02/kaine-and-cao-clash-on-immigration-the-economy-in-heated-debate-at-norfolk-state-university/embed/#?secret=VJiTIC8JOO#?secret=A3R7TVJDVd" data-secret="A3R7TVJDVd" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the Minnesota-born, Harvard-educated lawyer, who began his career in public service as a civil rights attorney before moving into politics, sensible gun regulations are one of the key issues defining Kaine’s campaign and setting him apart from his opponent. If reelected, it’s an area that he wants to continue to work on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We haven’t done enough yet to reduce gun violence,” Kaine said in the interview. “I had a teacher tell me not long ago, ‘when we do that moment of silence at the beginning of every day, I know every adult in the building is thinking, let today not be that day.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s children, parents, and teachers shouldn’t have to worry every day, Kaine added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So I do feel like there is more that can be done. Virginia has done some good things, and with the NRA headquarters here, we ought to be able to pass some of these gun safety laws in Congress,” he said, referring to universal background checks, closing loopholes in gun sales, and banning assault weapons, measures he has advocated for in his time on Capitol Hill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout his 12-year tenure in the Senate, Kaine has been a steadfast advocate for progressive policies, focusing on healthcare, education, and climate change. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His bipartisan efforts relating to military issues — such his role in sponsoring the War Powers Consultation Act, which seeks to clarify the role of Congress in war decisions, and his support of the expansion of the GI Bill and improving mental health services for military personnel — have also helped solidify his reputation in a state with a significant military presence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine’s incumbency gives him a distinct advantage, not only due to name recognition but also thanks to his deep ties across the commonwealth. As the husband of Anne Holton — the daughter of former Republican Gov. Lindwood Holton — he has positioned himself as a champion of Virginia’s diverse demography, from residents of urban centers like Northern Virginia to the rural regions of the Shenandoah Valley and the Blue Ridge Mountains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Showing up is part of the job, and I tell people if somebody won’t show up for it, they’re never gonna stand up for you,” Kaine said about his strategy for remaining a popular contender in Virginia, a state that has leaned Democratic in more recent times, but that still remains open to electing Republicans, as Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s 2021 victory has shown.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I want people to know that I will stand up for them and you do that by being everywhere. Plus I enjoy it. I mean, I love the job, but more than the 36 weeks a year I’m in D.C., I love the 16 weeks when I’m in Virginia, and figuring out ways I can help with whatever challenges or aspirations people have.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine’s opponent Cao, who immigrated to the U.S. as a child after fleeing communist Vietnam, presents a sharp contrast to the Democratic incumbent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a platform closely aligned with former President Donald Trump — who endorsed him earlier this year — the Loudoun County resident has focused heavily on issues like immigration and national security, echoing Trump&#8217;s “America First” rhetoric. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cao declined to be interviewed for this story, but he has openly supported Trump’s plan to deport all undocumented immigrants that are currently in the country. Cao also supports the former president’s effort to build a border wall, which he began during his first term in the White House.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We will build the wall, we will secure the border through advanced technology, we will support the Border Patrol and border states, and we will repel this invasion,” Cao said on </span><a href="https://www.hungforva.com/border/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">his website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Republican has also echoed Trump’s calls for imposing more tariffs for imports from countries like China, which </span><a href="https://www.hungforva.com/economy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">he called </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">“an existential threat” to the United States. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is no excuse for American exports to be taxed at a higher rate than Chinese imports,” Cao said on his website. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a former Navy special operations officer who has served in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Somalia, Cao has lamented the drop in the U.S. military’s recruitment numbers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2013, male enlistments have decreased by 35%, going from 58,000 men enlisting in 2013 to 37,700 in 2023, according to the </span><a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/06/14/armys-recruiting-problem-male.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">service data.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Meanwhile, female recruitment has hovered around 10,000 recruits each year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our military must have the resources it needs to face growing instability around the world. Right now, we face abysmal recruiting numbers and deficits in overall readiness. This is a leadership problem first and foremost and our active duty servicemembers deserve better,” Cao said on his website. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead to the Nov. 5 election, Kaine conceded in the interview that at least the presidential contest will be close, in part because Democrats have failed to communicate what he called the economic victories of President Joe Biden’s administration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among these accomplishments, Kaine named the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which authorized $1.2 trillion for transportation and infrastructure spending with $550 billion of that figure going toward new investments and programs, such as the Green New Deal, and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I do blame Democrats’ messaging, because if you ask people, ‘If you see a Republican ad on TV, what are they talking about?’ Maybe inflation, something about the economy,” Kaine said. “When they see a Democrat on TV, what Democrats talk about is access to abortions, a really important issue, but you often don’t see Dems really leaning into the economy. That’s why our first ad, which is up on TV, is an economy ad.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine said that his positions on the economy contrast sharply with those of Cao, his Republican opponent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He opposes the infrastructure bill, and he opposed the inflation Reduction Act, including all these clean energy investments,” Kaine said. “I mean, we’re going to have a vote on reauthorizing the infrastructure bill in 2026. I’ll vote, yes, he’d vote no. For those who care about infrastructure investments, like roads, rail, bridges, ports, broadband, you know, electric transmission, offshore wind, I’m going to keep these.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At their only </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/02/kaine-and-cao-clash-on-immigration-the-economy-in-heated-debate-at-norfolk-state-university/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">televised debate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Norfolk State University last week, the two candidates clashed over a variety of positions, including abortion rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Kaine said that he has introduced legislation that would codify Roe v. Wade in order to statutorily protect women’s access to abortion, Cao accused his opponent of supporting “unlimited abortion” up to and including after birth.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What he wants to do is take it out of the hands of voters,” Cao said at the debate. “I want to keep it back in the hands of voters because I don’t want a senator from California or a congressman from Idaho making decisions for Virginians.”</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="606MQASWXl"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/17/they-dont-like-abortion-but-kaines-gop-challengers-say-they-wont-seek-a-federal-ban/">They don’t like abortion, but Kaine’s GOP challengers say they won’t seek a federal ban</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;They don’t like abortion, but Kaine’s GOP challengers say they won’t seek a federal ban&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/17/they-dont-like-abortion-but-kaines-gop-challengers-say-they-wont-seek-a-federal-ban/embed/#?secret=zKPQ5Q9lBa#?secret=606MQASWXl" data-secret="606MQASWXl" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cao also said that Kaine has had a 99% failure rate in passing legislation, claiming that only three out of the 220 bills Kaine has introduced during his time in the Senate have been successful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Kaine challenged the accuracy of this claim, Cao responded with a remark that drew a reaction from the audience: “There are two truths in the world — never walk into a Target store wearing a red shirt, and never go against an Asian when it comes to math.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Larry Sabato, the director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, said that although Virginia’s Senate race “isn’t even vaguely competitive,” Kaine has shown no fear of running tough races. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“His first for the city council in Richmond wasn’t easy. Same for lieutenant governor in 2001, and governor in 2005. Kaine’s first race for the Senate was against a former governor and senator — George Allen — who had barely been ousted in 2006. He won them all,” Sabato said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine’s contest against Cao is more like 2018, when Kaine defeated Corey Stewart, his Republican challenger, with 57-41% of the votes, Sabato added, “though 2024 isn’t as Democratic a year as 2018 was.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cao could only have a chance if he were running a “vigorous first-rate campaign” while Trump was winning Virginia, Sabato said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Neither precondition applies. Even Republicans complain that Cao hasn’t been seen enough on the trail. And despite a questionable poll or two, Trump isn’t winning Virginia.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Kaine could be considered lucky given these circumstances, in politics and other parts of life, “you still make your own luck to a great degree,” Sabato said. “Kaine is smart, hard-working, and reflects the state’s values and partisan lean. That’s why he’s on his way to a third term.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine also has a significant fundraising advantage, having raised almost $16 million for his reelection bid, as opposed to Cao, who has raised just a little over $3 million, </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/elections/us-senate/?year_and_type=2024regular" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Virginia Public Access Project, a nonprofit tracking candidates and campaign money in Virginia politics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Cao vowed at the NSU debate to certify the presidential election if Harris won on Nov. 5 — “If she won, then she won,” he said — Kaine warned the  audience that his opponent had affirmed in a recent </span><a href="https://virginiaconservatives.net/candidate-survey-2022#results_anchor" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Constitutional Conservatives survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that if elected, he would sponsor legislation to release and seek compensation for the offenders jailed for their role in the violent riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have experienced January 6th, I’ll never forget this, I&#8217;ll never forget,” Kaine told The Mercury. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I never want it to be repeated, whether I’m in the Senate or not, it should never be repeated. But we certainly saw it, and we could see it again. I do not expect Donald Trump to lose this race and do anything other than raise hell. If we win, I still think he’ss going to raise hell and pretend that he won. So we have to be prepared for that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine said that with the 250th anniversary of the United States around the corner, there is also a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">forward looking aspect to the debate around the events of Jan. 6. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every generation has to carry the mantle of putting the torch of a functioning democracy in the hands of the next generation,” Kaine said. And by stepping aside, Biden had done just that, he added. “The president made a patriotic decision, and those of us who are in leadership positions now, we have to be able to put the torch of democracy in the hands of the next generation.”</span></p>

(Photos courtesy Kaine for Virginia and Hung Cao for Congress campaigns)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a high-stakes faceoff on Wednesday at Norfolk State University, U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., and his Republican challenger Hung Cao, a retired Navy captain, drew stark contrasts in a debate that underscored their divergent views on the economy, immigration, green energy and the role of government in education. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lively, one-hour debate at the historically Black university marked the first and only televised encounter between the two candidates less than five weeks ahead of the Nov. 5 election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cao was the first to dodge a question when co-moderator Deanna Allbrittin of Richmond TV news station WRIC asked him what kind of deal he would try and broker with members of the International Longshoremen’s Association (ILA) who went on strike Tuesday, leaving cargo in limbo at East and Gulf Coast ports, including at the Port of Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The economy is hitting us all the same way, that’s exactly why the ILA is doing the boycott right now and going on strike,” Cao said. “The only people better off today than ever four years ago are illegal aliens, criminals, and senators like Tim Kaine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cao said that the U.S. is spending “billions of dollars a day to house and feed illegal aliens” — money that he believes would be better spent supporting local economies and benefitting American workers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Again, they’re hurting because of the immense inflation that is going on right now,” Cao said of the longshoremen when pressed again by Allbrittin about what “a good deal” between the ILA and the the United States Maritime Alliance would look like.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Just like with the hurricane that&#8217;s going on right now, where&#8217;s the leadership? Joe Biden is on the beach, Kamala Harris is with a bunch of billionaires doing a fundraiser, and Tim Kane is at a pig roast. If it has to do with Ukraine, or if it’s about illegal aliens, they’re all over it. But if you’re an American, you’re on your own.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Responding to Allbrittin’s question, Kaine said that the longshoremen haven’t had a new contract in six years, and that they were entitled to better treatment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s what I would be urging if I was in the room,” he said, adding that he was on the phone earlier on Wednesday with acting U.S. Secretary of Labor Julie Sue. “If you’re in the room, what you’re doing is you&#8217;re trying to get the sides to come closer, and that&#8217;s what they’re doing. We are narrowing the differences, and I think we’re gonna find a deal.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine, who is seeking a third term in the U.S. Senate, has previously served as the mayor of Richmond from 1998 to 2001, lieutenant governor from 2002 to 2006, and governor of Virginia from 2006 to 2010. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Senate, Kaine has focused on issues such as national security, education, and healthcare — a background that he touted repeatedly at Wednesday’s debate and used to position himself as the best choice for continued leadership in the Senate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The choice is pretty clear for Virginians: do you want results or you want extremism?” Kaine said. “When I was governor, we were the best state for business, the best educated and best managed state. In the Senate, I’ve worked on powerful legislation so that we are building again with infrastructure, we’re making again with manufacturing, and we’re innovating.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In return, Cao, a former special operations officer in the Navy who served in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Somalia before his first unsuccessful run for political office challenging U.S. Rep. Jennifer Wexton, D-Loudoun, in 2022, used his background as an immigrant to proclaim his patriotism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When Vietnam fell, we had nowhere to run to. But this great country called the United States took us in and gave us an opportunity and gave us life,” Cao said. “But this country has taken a dark turn and the Democrats are turning this country into whatever I ran away from.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both candidates presented different visions for how to improve economic conditions in a country still struggling with inflation, price gouging and a cost of living that remains higher than at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic more than four years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Cao, the answer lies in American energy independence, which he called “the crux of everything.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats under the administration of President Joe Biden have made the United States dependent on oil “from countries that hate us, you know, Iran and Venezuela and the Middle East,” Cao said. “We need to be energy independent in this country, and that means unleashing all the energy we can get in order to bring forth American power.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cao also said that he would support former President Donald Trump’s plan for slapping new tariffs — basically important taxes — on foreign goods entering the United States, which he said would create more factory jobs, shrink the federal deficit and lower food prices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we need to do is not tax our industries here, what we need to do is tax other countries bringing in goods, because our people are getting tax here and when they bring abroad as well,” Cao said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine countered that under the Biden administration, the United States is producing more domestic energy than at any time in the nation’s history. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The good news is the production is nuclear, which I support, natural gas, which I support, but also wind and solar, and that is making a huge difference in the economy right here in Hampton Roads, with the Chesapeake announcement of GreenLink building a manufacturing facility here,” Kaine said, referring to the plans by a subsidiary of South Korea-based LS Cable &amp; System to spend over $680 million to build a submarine cable manufacturing facility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine added that the U.S. economy has rebounded faster than any other nation after the pandemic, which he said was owed, in part, to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act signed by Biden in 2021 and 2022. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Fed just dropped rates and they are signaling that they’re gonna do it again,” Kaine said. “What would I do? Let’s continue to invest in clean energy that’s affordable.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine and Cao both clashed on their views of immigration, when the Republican nominee skirted a question by co-moderator Tom Schaad of WAVY-TV whether he supports a plan proposed by former president Trump to mass-deport all undocumented immigrants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you come here illegally, then you need to leave, especially if you’re a violent crime person,” Cao said, adding that Immigration and Customs Enforcement data recently provided to Congress showed that more 13,000 immigrants convicted of homicide are living outside of ICE detention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine responded that he had supported “strong immigration policies” since he was first elected to the Senate, including a proposal that included $45 billion in border security investment which was blocked by Senate Republicans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In 2018, I cobbled together a bill with $25 billion for border security in exchange for protection for Dreamers. President Trump said that he would support it, but when the Senate introduced the bill in a bipartisan fashion, he told them to kill it,” Kaine said. “As soon as we can get Republicans to work for common sense immigration reform, we can keep folks from coming here illegally and we can also have the workforce that America needs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Schaad asked both candidates whether they supported “some form” of reparations for the descendants of enslaved Americans, Kaine and Cao agreed in a rare moment of bipartisanship that the best way to try and eliminate persistent inequalities is to focus on education. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have been a proud backer of funding for HBCUs like Norfolk State, helping this university to get funding for STEM careers for students, helping HBCUs start medical schools, and training the next generation of classroom teachers,” Kaine said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cao concurred, calling education the “only equalizer out here.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our country needs to heal, and we cannot heal if we continue picking at the scabs. That’s why I want to make sure that all Americans have the ability to go to school,” he said. </span></p>

J.D. Vance squared off Tuesday night in a vice presidential debate that marked the last scheduled in-person meeting for the campaigns as Americans decide the country’s next chapter.</p>
<p>Meeting for the first time, Walz and Vance engaged in a policy-heavy, nearly two-hour back-and-forth hosted by CBS News at its studios in New York City. The debate was moderated by Norah O’Donnell, host of the “CBS Evening News,” and Margaret Brennan, who anchors the network’s Sunday political show “Face the Nation.”</p>
<p>The vice presidential candidates emphasized their modest upbringings and laid out their visions to lower high living costs, address charged issues like reproductive rights, immigration and gun violence, and navigate a quickly worsening conflict in the Middle East.</p>
<p>And, with the presidential contest marking the first since the violent aftermath of the 2020 election, and Trump’s continued false claims that he won, the moderators pressed the men on whether voters would see a peaceful transfer of power, no matter the winner. Vance would not provide a direct answer whether he would have certified the 2020 vote.</p>
<p>Walz is a second-term governor who previously served six terms in the U.S. House. Prior to his election, Walz worked as a public school teacher and football coach while also enlisted in the Minnesota Army National Guard for 24 years.</p>
<p>Vance served in the U.S. Marines for four years before earning his Yale law degree and becoming a venture capitalist and bestselling memoirist. He was first elected to public office in late 2022 to serve as Ohio’s junior U.S. senator.</p>
<p>The mostly amicable debate, with some moments of tension, was a noticeable departure from the bitter polarization on display daily during the presidential campaign. Walz and Vance shook hands and lingered onstage afterward chatting and introducing each other to their wives.</p>
<p>The presidential nominees, former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, met on the debate stage <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/harris-tears-trump-over-abortion-rights-and-race-tense-presidential-debate" target="_blank">last month</a> in a more acrimonious exchange during which the former president falsely claimed immigrants were eating pets in Ohio and Harris ripped into him for his remarks on race and abortion.</p>
<p>Trump has <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/harris-presses-trump-debate-again-and-democrats-launch-chicken-billboards" target="_blank">refused</a> to debate again. Following the Vance-Walz exchange, the Harris campaign renewed its offer for another presidential meetup offered by CNN in Atlanta later this month.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Growing Middle East conflict</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Answering the first question from the moderators Tuesday night, Walz and Vance sparred over which administration, if elected, would best quell signs of a widening war in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Tensions in the region escalated earlier Tuesday when Iran fired nearly 200 ballistic missiles at Israel, according to the Pentagon.</p>
<p>Walz accused Trump of being “fickle” on foreign policy and said the world is worse off since Trump <a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-ending-united-states-participation-unacceptable-iran-deal/" target="_blank">pulled</a> the United States out of the Iran nuclear deal. Walz argued for “steady leadership.”</p>
<p>“You saw it experienced today where, along with our Israeli partners and our coalition, (we were) able to stop the incoming attack,” Walz said.</p>
<p>“It’s clear, and the world saw it on that debate stage a few weeks ago, a nearly 80-year-old Donald Trump talking about crowd sizes is not what we need in this moment,” the governor continued.</p>
<p>Vance maintained that Trump headed off heated global conflict by invoking fear.</p>
<p>“We have to remember that as much as Governor Waltz just accused Donald Trump of being an agent of chaos, Donald Trump actually delivered stability in the world, and he did it by establishing effective deterrence,” Vance said. “People were afraid of stepping out of line.”</p>
<p>The barrage in the Middle East followed Israel’s ground <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/01/israel-order-evacuation-southern-lebanon-border-villages-incursion" target="_blank">incursion</a> into Southern Lebanon and its recent <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/29/g-s1-25322/biden-nasrallah-hezbollah-israel" target="_blank">assassination</a> in Beirut of Hassan Nasrallah, leader of the Iranian proxy militant group Hezbollah.</p>
<p>While Israel intercepted the majority of the rockets Tuesday, U.S. Navy destroyers in the Middle East fired roughly a dozen interceptors at incoming Iranian missiles, Pentagon spokesman Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder said.</p>
<p>The Biden administration promised “severe consequences,” though it has not provided details. Harris said late Tuesday that Iran poses a “destabilizing, dangerous force in the Middle East” and her commitment to Israel is “unwavering.”</p>
<p>Despite a <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/zelenskyy-washington-meets-us-leaders-beef-support-ukraine" target="_blank">visit</a> to Washington less than a week ago from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the CBS moderators did not ask about the ongoing war in Ukraine, and neither candidate brought up the costly and ongoing fight against Russia’s continued invasion.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">2020 election</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Vance and Walz sparred over how Trump handled his loss in the 2020 presidential election and his actions leading up to Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of his supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol following a rally that Trump hosted.</p>
<p>Walz said while he and Vance found some areas of common ground at other points during the debate, the two were “miles apart” on Trump’s actions following the 2020 election.</p>
<p>“This was a threat to our democracy in a way that we had not seen, and it manifested itself because of Donald Trump’s inability to say – he is still saying he didn’t lose the election,” Walz said.</p>
<p>Vance didn’t directly answer whether he would have certified the electoral count for President Joe Biden had he been a member of Congress at the time, to Walz’s dismay.</p>
<p>“I’m pretty shocked by this,” Walz said. “He lost the election. This is not a debate.”</p>
<p>Walz said he was concerned that Vance wouldn’t follow the example set by former Vice President Mike Pence, who refused to go along with a scheme to recognize fake slates of electors and deny Biden the presidency.</p>
<p>Vance tried to pivot to Harris’ actions following the COVID-19 pandemic and whether she “censored Americans from speaking their mind” before saying that both he and Trump “think that there were problems in 2020.”</p>
<p>There was no evidence of widespread voter fraud during the last presidential election, during which Trump lost both the popular vote and the Electoral College.</p>
<p>Walz also criticized Trump and Vance for using the same narrative ahead of this November’s elections, saying they were “already laying the groundwork for people not accepting” the results should Trump lose.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Taxes and tariffs</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Both Harris and Trump have <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/taxes-where-do-trump-and-harris-stand" target="_blank">released</a> economic plans that would add trillions to the national deficit — though analysis after analysis shows Trump’s proposals <a href="https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2024/8/26/trump-campaign-policy-proposals-2024?te=1&amp;nl=the-morning&amp;emc=edit_nn_20240903" target="_blank">outpacing</a> Harris’ by at least a few trillion.</p>
<p>Harris and Walz are <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/harris-unveils-plan-curb-price-gouging-boost-child-tax-credit-tackle-rent-hikes" target="_blank">running on</a> an “opportunity economy” theme that would permanently expand the Child Tax Credit, including giving $6,000 to new parents, and provide tax credits and deductions to first-time homebuyers and entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Harris, following Biden’s earlier budget proposal, has said she would impose a minimum tax on high-wealth individuals, but vowed steeper levies on long-term capital gains.</p>
<p>Trump has promised to fund the Treasury’s coffers with money raised by taxing imported goods. Largely he wants to extend his signature 2017 tax law and permanently lower the corporate tax rate.</p>
<p>When asked by the moderators how the candidates could accomplish those goals without ballooning the national debt, both Vance and Walz sidestepped directly answering the question. Rather they touted Trump and Biden administration policies and then went on the attack.</p>
<p>“Donald Trump made a promise, and I’ll give you this: He kept it. He took folks to Mar-a-Lago (and) said, ‘You’re rich as hell. I’m gonna give you a tax cut,’” Walz said, adding that Trump’s tariff plan would be “destabilizing” for the economy.</p>
<p>Economists <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/taxes-where-do-trump-and-harris-stand" target="_blank">warn</a> that Trump’s plan to slap tariffs on imports across the board —  as high as 60% on Chinese imports and 100% to 200% on cars and John Deere tractors manufactured in Mexico — could cause consumer prices to increase and invite retaliation.</p>
<p>But Vance said he wanted to “defend my running mate” on the issue.</p>
<p>“We’re going to be taking in a lot of money by penalizing companies for shipping jobs overseas and penalizing countries who employ slave laborers and then ship their products back into our country and undercut the wages of American workers. It’s the heart of the Donald Trump economic plan,” the senator said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">High costs and housing</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Both candidates spent significant time addressing housing and child care costs.</p>
<p>Walz touted Harris’ “bold forward plan” that calls for construction of 3 million new homes and “down payment assistance on the front end to get you in a house.”</p>
<p>“A house is much more than just an asset to be traded somewhere. It’s foundational to where you’re at,” Walz said.</p>
<p>Vance said some of Walz’s ideas on housing were “halfway decent.”</p>
<p>One of the central pillars of Trump and Vance’s housing plans is to turn over federal lands to private hands for development.</p>
<p>“We have a lot of federal lands that aren’t being used for anything. They’re not being used for national parks. They’re not being used, and they could be places where we build a lot of housing,” Vance said.</p>
<p>On child care, Walz pledged a paid federal family and medical leave mandate as a priority for the Harris campaign, and advocated a parallel workforce development program for the care professions.</p>
<p>“We have to make it easier for folks to be able to get into that business, and then to make sure that folks are able to pay for that,” Walz said.</p>
<p>The dual goals, he said, “will enhance our workforce, enhance our families, and make it easier to have the children that you want.”</p>
<p>Vance said he sees an opportunity for a “bipartisan solution” to the high cost of child care, though he stopped short of agreeing with a federal paid leave law.</p>
<p>Instead he proposed expanding the potential recipients for federal child care grants.</p>
<p>“These programs only go to one kind of child care model. Let’s say you’d like your church maybe to help you out with child care. Maybe you live in a rural area or an urban area, and you’d like to get together with families in your neighborhood to provide child care and the way that makes the most sense. You don’t get access to any of these federal monies,” Vance said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Immigration, again</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Vance also repeatedly connected the housing shortage and high costs to immigration — the central issue for Trump’s campaign and a common answer from him for several of the nation’s woes.</p>
<p>The Ohio senator said housing is “totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans for scarce homes.”</p>
<p>“The people that I’m most worried about in Springfield, Ohio, are the American citizens who have had their lives destroyed by Kamala Harris’ open border,” Vance said, referring to the town where he and Trump falsely claimed over and over that Haitian migrants were stealing and eating pets.</p>
<p>Debate moderator Brennan pressed Vance on his claim: “Senator on that point, I’d like for you to clarify. There are many contributing factors to high housing costs. What evidence do you have that migrants are part of this problem?”</p>
<p>Vance said he would share on social media following the debate a Federal Reserve study that supported his claim.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Reproductive rights </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Access to abortion and fertility treatments was one of the more contentious areas of disagreement, though neither candidate trod new ground for their party.</p>
<p>Vance maintained the Trump stance that abortion laws should be set by voters or state lawmakers, while Walz said women and their doctors are best suited to make those decisions.</p>
<p>Vance told a story about a woman he grew up with having an abortion, then telling him a few years ago that “she felt like if she hadn’t had that abortion, that it would have destroyed her life because she was in an abusive relationship.”</p>
<p>“And I think that what I take from that, as a Republican who proudly wants to protect innocent life in this country, who proudly wants to protect the vulnerable, is that my party, we’ve got to do so much better of a job at earning the American people’s trust back on this issue, where they frankly, just don’t trust us,” Vance said. “And I think that’s one of the things that Donald Trump, and I are endeavoring to do.”</p>
<p>Walz rejected Vance’s position that state lawmakers should determine women’s access to the full slate of reproductive decisions, including fertility treatments.</p>
<p>Walz referenced some of the stories women have told in the last two years about being denied medical care for miscarriages or other dangerous pregnancy complications because of vaguely written state laws that banned or significantly restricted access to abortion.</p>
<p>“This is a very simple proposition: These are women’s decisions to make about their health care,” Walz said, later adding that people should “just mind their own business on this.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Gun violence</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The two vice presidential candidates had one of the more genuine exchanges of the debate after the moderators asked them about solutions for gun violence.</p>
<p>Vance conceded that he and Walz both want to reduce the number of people killed by guns every year, but said the solution should center around addressing illegal guns, including those used in drug trafficking, and through changing how schools are designed.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, I think that we have to increase security in our schools. We have to make the doors lock better. We have to make the door stronger. We’ve got to make the windows stronger,” Vance said. “And of course, we’ve got to increase school resource officers, because the idea that we can magically wave a wand and take guns out of the hands of bad guys, it just doesn’t fit with recent experience.”</p>
<p>Walz said school shootings are every parent’s “worst nightmare” before telling a story about how his son witnessed a shooting at a community center while playing volleyball.</p>
<p>“Those things don’t leave you,” Walz said, before talking about meeting with parents of the children killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, when he was a member of Congress.</p>
<p>“We understand that the Second Amendment is there, but our first responsibility is to our kids to figure this out,” Walz said. “In Minnesota, we’ve enacted enhanced red flag laws, enhanced background checks.”</p>
<p>Walz said he absolutely believes Vance hates it when children die from gun violence, but added that’s “not far enough when we know they’re things that work.”</p>
<p>“No one’s trying to scaremonger and say, ‘We’re taking your guns,” Walz said. “But I ask all of you out there, ‘Do you want your schools hardened to look like a fort?’ … when we know there’s countries around the world that their children aren’t practicing these types of drills.”</p>
<p>Vance expressed sympathy that Walz’s son had witnessed a shooting and thanked him for bringing up Finland as an example of a country with a high rate of gun ownership that doesn’t have school shootings.</p>
<p>“I do think it illustrates some of the, frankly, weird differences between our own country’s gun violence problem and Finland,” Vance said, before mentioning higher rates of substance abuse and mental health issues within the United States.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s the whole reason why we have such a bad gun violence problem, but I do think it’s a big piece of it,” Vance said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Hurricane Helene response, climate change </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The two candidates expressed dismay about the destruction stemming from Hurricane Helene in states in the Southeast, but disagreed about how best to address climate change.</p>
<p>Vance said “a lot of people are justifiably worried about all these crazy weather patterns,” before criticizing how Democrats have drafted climate change laws.</p>
<p>“This idea that carbon emissions drive all the climate change; well let’s just say that’s true, just for the sake of arguments,” Vance said. “Well, if you believe that, what would you want to do? The answer is that you’d want to restore as much American manufacturing as possible, and you’d want to produce as much energy as possible in the United States of America, because we’re the cleanest economy in the entire world.”</p>
<p>Walz said that Biden and Harris have worked with Congress to enact legislation addressing climate change that also created jobs.</p>
<p>“We are producing more natural gas and more oil at any time than we ever have. We’re also producing more clean energy,” Walz said. “Reducing our impact is absolutely critical, but this is not a false choice. You can do that at the same time you’re creating the jobs that we’re seeing all across the country.”</p>
<p>Walz also said that farmers in Minnesota know climate change is real because some years they experience significant drought and other years they’re inundated with too much rain for their crops to handle.</p>
<p>“They’ve seen 500-year droughts, 500-year floods back-to-back,” Walz said. “But what they’re doing is adapting, and this has allowed them to tell me, ‘Look, I harvest corn, I harvest soybeans, and I harvest wind.’”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While both women share some priorities, like reducing inflation and the costs of living, their divergence on abortion policy is something Smasal and Democrats are hoping can help flip the district. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Kiggans and Republicans hope that maintaining control of the House of Representatives can put America closer to completing former president Donald Trump’s proposal of building a wall along the U.S. &#8211; Mexico border. </span></p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virginia’s 2nd Congressional District: Republican lean, pockets of Democratic support</h4>

	</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_39960" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:1490px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/va02-map_supreme-court-of-virginia/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-39960 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VA02-map_Supreme-Court-of-Virginia.png" alt="" width="1490" height="1008" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VA02-map_Supreme-Court-of-Virginia.png 1490w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VA02-map_Supreme-Court-of-Virginia-300x203.png 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VA02-map_Supreme-Court-of-Virginia-1024x693.png 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VA02-map_Supreme-Court-of-Virginia-768x520.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1490px) 100vw, 1490px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Virginia Congressional District 2 (courtesy Supreme Court of Virginia)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A drive along Route 13 on the Eastern Shore shows Kiggans signs sprinkled along much of the highway, signaling the district’s Republican lean. But pockets in Northampton and Accomack went for Kiggan’s Democratic opponent Elaine Luria in 2022, as did portions of Chesapeake, Suffolk and Isle of Wight on Virginia’s mainland. Much of Virginia Beach, which anchors the district, is also Republican territory, but 51% of the area </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/localities/virginia-beach-city-va/election-results-map/?electype=general&amp;election=10135" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">showed up for President Joe Biden in 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Despite the GOP lean, the district has oscillated between the parties over the years and is among several competitive ones in Virginia and around the nation to help determine partisan control of the U.S. House of Representatives. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Candidates’ local impact</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smasal said constituent services is something that most excites her about potentially becoming a congresswoman. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That&#8217;s one of the most interesting parts,” she said. “And when I go across the district and (people) have stories for me … they remember when somebody in Elaine Luria’s congressional office helped them out.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiggans, whose campaign did not follow through on organizing an interview with The Mercury, has kicked it local with some of her advertising. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent digital advertisements featured the refrain “</span><a href="https://x.com/JenKiggans/status/1834947865824612859" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">that’s Jen Kiggans!</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” as people noted some of her voting records to include supporting veteran health care. Home to the largest naval base in America, veterans and active duty service members make up a sizable portion of the 2nd District. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, she supported the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/8580" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” which includes funding for VA health care programs and benefits. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Reproductive health</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As they prepare for an upcoming debate next month, a poll from Christopher Newport University released on Sept. 13 showed Kiggans with a </span><a href="https://cnu.edu/news/2024/09/13-cnu-wason/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">five point lead</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over Smasal. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also showed that surveyed voters trust Kiggans more with veterans’ concerns while Smasal is more trusted to handle reproductive rights issues like abortion access.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pew Research Center shows 55% of Virginians believe abortion should be </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religious-landscape-study/database/state/virginia/views-about-abortion/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in all or most cases. A top issue for Smasal, she hopes it’s key to unseating Kiggans so that she can help restore federal protections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People are talking to me constantly about protecting reproductive rights,” Smasal said. “It&#8217;s really the number one thing that I&#8217;m hearing from people they&#8217;re concerned about.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smasal took issue with Kiggans last year over how the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act played out when it passed the House and failed to progress in the Senate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill was part of a hullabaloo between parties with President Joe Biden’s administration </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/H.R.-8580-%E2%80%94-Military-Construction-and-Veterans-Affairs-and-Related-Agencies-Appropriations-Act-2025-SAP.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">opposing it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in part, for a provision that would revoke veteran access to funding should they need to travel out of state for an abortion if the location of their duty assignment bans the procedure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over in the U.S. Senate Alabama Republican Tommy Tuberville </span><a href="https://alabamareflector.com/2023/12/05/tuberville-relents-on-months-long-blockade-of-most-military-nominees-blaming-democrats/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">held up military promotions in protest over the Biden administration’s VA  abortion travel policy.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> At the time, Kiggans told the media that she didn’t agree with his method but supported his reasons.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Taxpayers should not be funding elective procedures,” she </span><a href="https://www.wavy.com/news/politics/local-lawmakers-react-to-block-of-hundreds-of-military-promotions-by-alabama-senator-over-abortion-policy" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told an NBC affiliate in Hampton Roads </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">last summer. “If I wanted to get a Hollywood nose job in California, I do not expect the Navy to pay for my travel expenses to get there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Smasal stressed the complexities of why someone may want or medically need an abortion and how the national patchwork of state laws is creating various additional barriers for people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don&#8217;t know how any female veteran could do that to other service women,” Smasal told Virginia Mercury in a recent interview.  &#8220;She went to Congress and voted to restrict reproductive rights, so she&#8217;s chosen to be more extreme.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>But Kiggans took aim at Smasal in a <a href="https://x.com/JenKiggans/status/1839824215807078560" target="_blank">recent video on her social media</a> and asserted that Smasal is lying when referring to Kiggans as someone who is &#8220;extreme.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the video, Kiggans cited her status as the 19th most bipartisan member of congress from a <a href="https://www.thelugarcenter.org/ourwork-Bipartisan-Index.html" target="_blank">Lugar Center and Georgetown University ranking report</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe it is an issue that should be legislated at the state level,&#8221; Kiggans added to clarify her abortion policy preferences. &#8220;I&#8217;ve always been an advocate for women to choose life, allowing for exceptions in the cases of rape, incest and the life of the mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no mention of <a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/two-women-two-pregnancies-two-agonizing-decisions/article_24e5d5fc-742d-11ee-984d-6befc702d5d0.html" target="_blank">fetal anomalies</a>, many of which are detected at or after 15 weeks of gestation.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while Kiggans supports abortion laws being up to individual states, she has also </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/13/virginia-democrats-do-not-support-infanticide-but-heres-why-trump-keeps-saying-they-do/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">echoed a false claim</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Democrats support it to “</span><a href="https://jenforcongress.com/issues/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the moment of birth.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span></p>
<p>On other reproductive health laws, both women have expressed support for protecting contraception access and family planning procedures like in vitro fertilization. As<span style="font-weight: 400;"> the incumbent, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiggans has </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/4626/cosponsors" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voted for expanded contraception access</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://mace.house.gov/media/press-releases/protecting-fertility-rights-urgent-legislation-addressing-deepening-concerns" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cosponsored a resolution to protect IVF</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Immigration views</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Immigration policy has featured prominently in both presidential and congressional campaigns this year. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans and Democrats tend to diverge on solutions when it comes to concerns about immigration. Republicans have favored ramping up deportations of people who enter America illegally while Democrats have proposed enhancing pathways to U.S. citizenship. This year, Democrats in congress worked with Republicans on </span><a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2024/05/24/bipartisan-border-bill-loses-support-fails-procedural-vote-in-u-s-senate/#:~:text=By%3A%20Ariana%20Figueroa%20%2D%20May%2024%2C%202024%207%3A15%20am&amp;text=The%20Senate%20bill%20failed%20to,aid%20package%20earlier%20this%20year." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">boosting funding for border security, but the efforts failed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nobody&#8217;s done enough to fix things,” Smasal said. “Both Democrats and Republicans have failed on this issue.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, she was glad to see Democrats coming to the table with Republicans on the bipartisan border deal that was toppled earlier this year. It’s something she would have supported and something Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris has </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/09/10/harris-slams-trump-for-killing-border-bill-in-debate-here-are-the-facts/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said she would support</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“(Republicans in Congress and Trump) wanted the political issue (for this election) as opposed to doing something substantial to actually help address the border,” Smasal said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She stressed how supporting border security efforts can help detect drugs like fentanyl entering the country and combat human trafficking. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I firmly believe we need to be security minded,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On related legislation, Kiggans has co-sponsored the “</span><a href="https://chavez-deremer.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/chavez-deremer.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/Summary%20-%20Defending%20Borders,%20Defending%20Democracies%20Act.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defending Borders, Defending Democracies Act.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” The </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7372/cosponsors%5C" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which has not progressed past introduction, would suspend entry of some immigrants at the U.S. border and require asylum seekers to “remain in Mexico” during adjudication of their immigration status. </span></p>
<p>She also voted for the &#8220;<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/2/all-actions" target="_blank">Secure The Border Act</a>&#8221; which would expedite construction of border barriers. It passed the House but did not clear the Senate.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On her website, Kiggans called the rise in border crossings a “self-inflicted crisis” that is “threatening the safety of Americans and emboldening cartels, which are making massive profits off of drug trafficking and exploiting vulnerable migrants.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Addressing inflation</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a local-yet-national issue, both candidates have stressed how they want to curb inflation and rising costs of living. Kiggans’ campaign website points to her support of the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3746/summary/00#:~:text=This%20bill%20increases%20the%20federal,work%20requirements%20for%20federal%20programs." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which passed congress and was signed into law by the president. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smasal </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">said that addressing affordable housing is a key part of addressing the cost of living. If elected, she aims to start by championing federal legislation to prevent large corporations from purchasing housing stock and raising prices or creating more short-term rentals in places like Virginia Beach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If everything is turned into an Airbnb, where are our teachers and our firefighters and our police officers going to find their housing?” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both women are also supportive of ways to help </span><a href="https://kiggans.house.gov/posts/kiggans-supports-bipartisan-bill-to-address-childcare-workforce-shortage" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">alleviate the nation’s growing childcare cost and access issues</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiggans called it an “unfortunate reality” that some parents are feeling forced to leave the workforce, take on debt or tap into their savings as a result of the growing issue. </span></p>

Vance and Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will face off Tuesday night for a vice presidential debate, the final scheduled in-person exchange between the campaigns as polls continue to show a tight race just over five weeks out from November’s election.</p>
<p>The debate, hosted by CBS News, is scheduled to begin at 9 p.m. Eastern and last for 90 minutes. The event will air live on local CBS affiliate stations and stream on the CBS News app, CBSNews.com, YouTube and Paramount+.</p>
<p>The matchup between the running mates of former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris brings together two men who both claim congressional records and previous service in the U.S. armed forces.</p>
<p>The debate also comes as the southeastern U.S. <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-pledges-federal-help-states-southeast-stricken-catastrophic-storm" target="_blank">reels</a> from the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, which barreled inland as a tropical storm that brought record-breaking flooding and claimed more than 100 lives — a third of them in North Carolina, a swing state in the 2024 presidential election.</p>
<p>Republican National Committee and Trump campaign officials said Monday that Vance, Ohio’s junior senator, plans to attack Walz during the debate on several fronts, including tying Walz to the Biden administration.</p>
<p>“No amount of Minnesota nice is going to make up for the fact that Walz embodies the same disastrous economic, open-border and soft-on-crime (record) Harris has inflicted on our country over the last four years,” said Minnesota GOP Congressman Tom Emmer, who has been standing in as Walz during Vance’s debate prep.</p>
<p>“J.D. Vance is prepared to wipe the floor with Tim Walz and expose him for the radical liberal he is,” Emmer told reporters on a Monday morning call.</p>
<p>But Jason Miller, senior adviser for the Trump campaign, warned “Walz is very good at debates. I want to repeat that Tim Walz is very good in debates, really good. He’s been a politician for nearly 20 years.”</p>
<p>Trump <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/113227471530921481" target="_blank">posted</a> Monday on his Truth Social platform that he will be doing a “personal play by play” of the debate.</p>
<p>The Harris campaign has not revealed details about Walz’s debate preparation. CNN <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/28/politics/tim-walz-vice-president-debate/index.html" target="_blank">reported</a> that Walz is nervous and has been practicing with Department of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg as a stand-in for Vance.</p>
<p>Walz spent Saturday in Ann Arbor at the University of Michigan Wolverines vs. University of Minnesota Golden Gophers football game, where he was greeted by local elected officials and rallied students about the importance of the youth vote, according to the campaign.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Military service, China</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Trump campaign surrogates said debate watchers are guaranteed to see Vance attack Walz on his military service.</p>
<p>Vance touts his own four years in the U.S. Marine Corps from 2003 to 2007, during which he was <a href="https://www.armytimes.com/news/your-military/2024/08/06/jd-vance-represents-veterans-on-ballot-but-some-ask-at-what-cost/" target="_blank">deployed</a> to Iraq in 2005 as a military journalist.</p>
<p>The Trump campaign maintains Walz retired to avoid being deployed to Iraq. Trump campaign officials featured two veterans on Monday’s call who slammed Walz for being a “turncoat.”</p>
<p>“He deserted his post and his unit after 24 years of military service,” said Tom Behrends, a retired Command Sergeant Major for the Minnesota National Guard.</p>
<p>Walz, a former six-term congressman who represented the state’s 1st Congressional District, served in the Army National Guard for 24 years prior to running for office. He deployed to Italy between 2003 and 2004 to support Operation Enduring Freedom, a non-combat post.</p>
<p>A fact check by PolitiFact <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/aug/09/jd-vance/jd-vance-attacked-tim-walz-on-military-record-his/" target="_blank">found</a> he filed his candidacy paperwork in February 2005, a month before the Walz battalion was notified of possible deployment within two years. Walz filed retirement paperwork five to seven months before the deployment notification, according to the fact check.</p>
<p>Walz led a U.S. House resolution in 2007 to honor the Minnesota service members for their deployment to Iraq, <a href="https://www.nationalguard.mil/News/Article/573070/guard-unit-recognized-for-record-deployment/" target="_blank">according</a> to the National Guard.</p>
<p>Walz carries the distinction of being the highest-ranking enlisted soldier to ever serve in Congress, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/115/meeting/house/105558/witnesses/HHRG-115-HA00-Bio-WalzT-20170215.pdf" target="_blank">according</a> to his congressional biography published in 2017.</p>
<p>Walz suffered hearing loss and tinnitus after specializing in heavy artillery for two decades, according to Department of Veterans Affairs records he shared with journalists when running for governor in 2018.</p>
<p>He wrote in a 2013 benefits application that blasts “would knock us down and after firing I had ringing in my ears,” <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2018/10/03/tim-walz-national-guard-career-minnesota-governor-race" target="_blank">according</a> to the records reviewed by Minnesota Public Radio. Eventually Walz underwent surgery to improve his hearing loss.</p>
<p>Retired Sgt. 1st Class Tom Schilling, who joined the RNC call Monday, also attacked Walz’s trips to China and how the governor handled “the George Floyd thing,” referring to protests that rocked Minneapolis following the murder of Floyd, a Black man, by police.</p>
<p>“He had 30 trips to China that really haven’t been answered. As a governor, he let Minneapolis burn,” said Schilling, who served in the Minnesota National Guard.</p>
<p>Walz has said he’s proud of the way local, state and federal officials handled the protests in Minneapolis and St. Paul. Walz ordered full National Guard mobilization roughly three days into the protests. However, Democratic Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and state Republican officials both criticized parts of the response by Walz, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/walz-george-floyd-riots-minnesota-national-guard-2b9b0bf883828e0429c379843f16005d" target="_blank">according</a> to a review by The Associated Press.</p>
<p>Walz taught for a year in the southern China city of Foshan. As a public school teacher in Minnesota he then took students on annual trips to China. In the past he said he visited China <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXqY0Eb_QAI&amp;t=415s" target="_blank">30 times</a>. When pressed for documentation of the trips by <a href="https://www.apmreports.org/story/2024/09/30/tim-walz-experience-in-china" target="_blank">APM Reports</a>, the Harris campaign said his visits totaled “closer to 15.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump visits Helene’s destruction in Georgia</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Trump <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?538811-1/fmr-pres-trump-remarks-georgia-hurricane-helene" target="_blank">delivered</a> remarks Monday in front of a damaged furniture store in Valdosta, Georgia, wearing his signature red “Make America Great Again” hat.</p>
<p>“We’re here today to stand in complete solidarity with the people of Georgia, with all of those suffering in the terrible aftermath of Hurricane Helene,” Trump said, standing alongside American evangelist Franklin Graham, who was coordinating the delivery of supplies.</p>
<p>Trump also said the presidential campaigns should take a backseat to the storm response. “We’re not talking about politics now, we have to all get together and get this solved.”</p>
<p>Moments later he stated falsely that Biden had not taken calls from Georgia’s Republican Gov. Brian Kemp. Biden had spoken with Kemp by phone Sunday.</p>
<p>Journalists traveling with Harris in Las Vegas, Nevada, reported in the wee hours of Monday that the vice president was canceling her campaign events to return to Washington. D.C., to be briefed on the response to Helene.</p>
<p>Harris issued a statement Saturday saying that her “heart goes out to everyone impacted by the devastation unleashed by Hurricane Helene.</p>
<p>“Doug and I are thinking of those who tragically lost their lives and we are keeping all those who loved them in our prayers during the difficult days ahead. President Biden and I remain committed to ensuring that no community or state has to respond to this disaster alone,” she continued.</p>
<p>At his campaign rally Sunday in Erie, Pennsylvania, Trump criticized Harris for being in San Francisco “at fundraising events with her Radical Left lunatic donors, when big parts of our country have been devastated by that massive hurricane and are underwater, with many, many people dead.”</p>

<p>President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-pledges-federal-help-states-southeast-stricken-catastrophic-storm" target="_blank">delivered</a> remarks from the White House early Monday and pledged federal support to the affected areas. Biden has already issued <a href="https://www.fema.gov/disaster/declarations?page=0" target="_blank">emergency declarations</a> for Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia. He also said he would visit the storm-ravaged areas as soon as his motorcade would not get in the way of response efforts.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Republicans for Harris</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The Harris campaign continues to tout its growing endorsements from Republicans.</p>
<p>Former conservative Sen. Jeff Flake, of Arizona, announced his endorsement of Harris over the weekend.</p>
<p>“I’ve served with Kamala in the U.S. Senate. I’ve also served with Tim in the House of Representatives. I know them. I know first hand of their fine character and love of country,” Flake <a href="https://x.com/JeffFlake/status/1840347576823902338" target="_blank">wrote</a> on X Sunday.</p>
<p>Republican Voters Against Trump also announced on Sunday a new multi-million-dollar ad blitz in swing states.</p>
<p>The group launched a $5.8 million ad campaign in Pennsylvania’s Philadelphia, Harrisburg and Pittsburgh media markets. The ad launch is part of a $15 million campaign that will also reach <a href="https://azmirror.com/briefs/anti-trump-gop-group-hopes-to-convince-arizona-republicans-to-back-harris/" target="_blank">Arizona</a>, Michigan and Wisconsin, according to a press release.</p>
<p>“Many swing voters are going to be making up their minds in the coming weeks, and it’s critical that we let them know what’s at stake,” Sarah Longwell, the political action committee’s executive director, said in a statement.</p>
<p>“You can repudiate him without renouncing your deeply held conservative values. We’re here to help establish a permission structure for right-leaning swing voters to do the right thing and vote their conscience,” the statement continued.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Ahead on the campaign trail</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Trump is scheduled Saturday to <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/election-2024/trump-to-hold-rally-at-pennsylvania-site-where-he-survived-assassination-attempt/" target="_blank">return</a> to Butler, Pennsylvania — the location of the first attempt on his life, during which he suffered a non-life-threatening ear injury and one spectator was killed by gunfire while two others were severely injured.</p>
<p>Trump also plans to hold a town hall Thursday in Fayetteville, North Carolina, well east of the devastation caused by Helene.</p>

John McGuire, shown here campaigning with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene in Louisa County in May, won his first election in Virginia's 5th Congressional District earlier this month. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a sign of deepening divisions among Republicans in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District, at least four members of the district’s 37-member GOP Committee, including the vice chair, were ousted over the weekend, and another resigned after refusing to sign renewed loyalty pledges for state Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland, the party’s nominee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The four purged members and the resignee were among 25 Republican officials who in early June signed </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/06/06/top-gop-leaders-in-the-5th-district-urge-trump-to-reconsider-mcguire-endorsement/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an open letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> urging former President Donald Trump to reconsider his endorsement of McGuire, advocating instead for Trump’s support of U.S. Rep. Bob Good, R-Farmville, the incumbent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jim Herring, who has served as the committee’s vice chair for two years and the former chair of the Goochland County GOP, told members in an email Sunday that the Republican Party of Virginia’s decision to demand the renewed pledges was “unwarranted, unprecedented and unauthorized.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After consulting with Chris Marston, the RPV’s official legal counsel, other attorneys and past Republican officials, his belief was confirmed, Herring wrote in the email, which was obtained by The Mercury.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In fact, it is very similar to the actions of prosecutors against Donald Trump. They make up allegations, find a politically weaponized judge, and then convict him knowing that all of this will probably be overturned on appeal,” Herring wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire has been a source of contention within the party since he announced his bid for Congress just one week after winning his seat in the 10th state Senate District last year — particularly among those backing Good, who went on to lose to McGuire in the June 18 primary election by a mere 366 votes out of more than 62,000 cast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even after McGuire’s narrow victory was confirmed by a recount, which Good requested, and an </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/28/outcome-of-5th-district-gop-primary-unchanged-after-further-review-of-ballots/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the results, some Republican hardliners in the district have refused to accept the former Navy SEAL as their party’s nominee, instead turning to social media to launch </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/03/a-growing-number-of-5th-district-republicans-vow-to-write-in-good-on-nov-5/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a write-in campaign</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on behalf of Good, who has not publicly supported this effort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a Sept. 14 meeting of the executive committee of the RPV’s State Central Committee, the party’s 80-member governing body in Virginia, Jeff Ryer, chairman of the 1st Congressional District Committee and the spokesman for the Trump campaign in Virginia, expressed concern that McGuire lacked “fulsome support” in the 5th District, RPV Chair Rich Anderson said in a phone interview Monday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consequently, Ryer made a motion for the committee to require a renewed loyalty pledge from the 25 party officials who had signed the letter to Trump.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s an affirmation statement, I don’t call it a loyalty statement,” Anderson said. “It just reaffirms that they will support the eventual nominees that would come out of these contests, whether they are a primary or a party run process. And with all the contention down in the 5th District because of a hotly contested race, a number of our congressional district committee chairs were concerned that perhaps not all were going to support McGuire.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in his email to committee members, Herring, the former vice chair, alleged that top party officials decided to “dictate to the 5th District Committee” members who had signed the Trump letter that they would have to “sign a loyalty oath or get kicked out” of the Republican Party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This decision was NOT brought to the (whole) State Central Committee for review or approval, and most were not even aware of this action,” Herring wrote, adding that the committee then agreed to “send a letter to those affected” and set a deadline by which they had to return their signed pledges for Sept. 27 at 5 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The form they sent in their letter was similar to the loyalty oaths they had required before, with the exception of one part … the naming of specific candidates you pledge to support. To my knowledge, this action has not been done before, at least in the over four decades that I have been involved,” Herring wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryer said Monday that he made the motion to ask for the renewed pledges because based on several news accounts it had become apparent that what he believed to be “a false narrative was developing that leaders in the party were not fully supportive of our nominees.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryer pushed back against allegations that the loyalty pledges had been used to force 5th District Republicans on the record in an effort to get them removed from the party as a punishment for asking Trump to reconsider his endorsement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was my hope — and the hope of the executive committee — that all who had signed the June 6 letter would fulfill their previously professed pledge to support all our nominees, as required by the party plan,” Ryer said, adding that he had made his motion solely in the capacity of his role as the 1st District chair and a longtime member of the State Central Committee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Rick Buchanan, the chairman of the 5th District GOP Committee, in an email to Anderson and State Central Committee leadership sent after the deadline had passed on Friday afternoon pointed out that members had already signed similar pledges of support earlier this year, as a requirement under the RPV’s party plan to attend mass meetings and conventions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although he “immediately” forwarded the request for the renewed affirmations to the entire committee, Buchanan also said that no member of the State Central Committee had reached out to him directly or any of the district’s 24 unit chairs “to inquire about the necessity of this action as a remedy,” suggesting that the distrust between the two fractions was based on miscommunication.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hearsay and assumption lead directly to dysfunction. The truth can only be found by going straight to the source, and the SCC and RPV have yet to reach out to develop an understanding. Mr. Chairman, this is not the way to work together as brothers in our political fight against our common enemies,” Buchanan wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Singling out Republican officials from the 5th District for supporting the candidate “we felt was the best candidate in a primary is more than an overreach,” Buchanan said in the email. “This action is pay-back for sending the letter to President Trump. Though some question the veracity of the letter, we firmly stand behind everything the letter says.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buchanan declined to comment for this story Monday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In their letter to Trump, the district’s top GOP officials had hailed Good, the chairman of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, as a champion of America First policies “by introducing legislation to codify policies defunding chain migration and requiring that immigrants are self-sufficient.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his time in Congress, Good also offered multiple bills that would build upon Trump’s regulatory relief for businesses across the country, the party officials wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We the undersigned leaders of the 5th District Republican Congressional Committee strongly urge President Donald Trump to reconsider his endorsement of Congressman Bob Good’s opponent in the Republican Primary,” they concluded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After receiving the request for his renewed loyalty pledge, at least one 5th District Committee member — Glenn Mozingo of Cumberland County — handed in his resignation on Thursday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am writing to advise that I will not sign the pledge form that was enclosed with your letter dated September 16, 2024, and I am resigning as a member of the Cumberland County Republican Committee with immediate effect. I understand that my membership on the 5th District Congressional Committee will lapse as well,” Mozingo wrote in an email to RPV Executive Director Ken Nunnenkamp which was obtained by The Mercury. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mozingo wrote that he wasn’t aware of any reservations among 5th District Committee members regarding their loyalties to Trump or Hung Cao, the Republican nominee for U.S. Senate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Consequently, it is apparent that this is a transparent attempt to coerce each committee member to publicly go on record in support of John McGuire, which I will not do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although he signed the pledge, James Hankins, another 5th District vice chair, also lashed out against RPV leadership. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“On a personal leave I feel insulted by being asked to sign this,” Hankins wrote in an email to Anderson. “I am signing this form this one time. If I am ever asked to do this again, I will resign from all posts I hold with the Republican Party and I will never raise another dollar for the 5th.”</span></p>

Though he has not formally outlined specific proposals, the report noted previous comments from Trump and his vice presidential pick U.S. Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, and previous actions he took when president — such as his </span><a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/55195" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FY2020 budget proposal that would have cut federal support for health care</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of Trump’s other actions as president illustrate his opposition to a long-debated topic between Republicans and Democrats: the Affordable Care Act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often referred to as “Obamacare” by its opponents, the ACA was a hallmark of former democratic president Barack Obama’s administration. The act established a public insurance marketplace and prevented insurance companies from denying coverage based on preexisting conditions.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Trump’s first day as president in 2017, he issued an </span><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/24/2017-01799/minimizing-the-economic-burden-of-the-patient-protection-and-affordable-care-act-pending-repeal" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executive order to prompt its repeal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He also </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-gop-leaders-take-victory-lap-after-house-passes-trumpcare-n754896" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">celebrated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a repeal effort that passed the House before it failed in the Senate. In 2020 he also </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/politics/obamacare-trump-administration-supreme-court.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">supported a lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before the U.S. Supreme Court that sought to tear down ACA. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, over 20 million people </span><a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/marketplace-2024-open-enrollment-period-report-final-national-snapshot" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">utilize it </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">nationwide and nearly 400,000 Virginians could  pay more for their health insurance if the ACA were repealed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an example of what could be lost, the Harris campaign’s Virginia-based team used a Kaiser Family Foundation </span><a href="https://www.kff.org/interactive/subsidy-calculator/#state=va&amp;zip=23450&amp;income-type=percent&amp;income=325&amp;employer-coverage=0&amp;people=4&amp;alternate-plan-family=&amp;adult-count=2&amp;adults%5B0%5D%5Bage%5D=45&amp;adults%5B0%5D%5Btobacco%5D=0&amp;adults%5B1%5D%5Bage%5D=45&amp;adults%5B1%5D%5Btobacco%5D=0&amp;child-count=2&amp;children%5B0%5D%5Bage%5D=10&amp;children%5B0%5D%5Btobacco%5D=0&amp;children%5B1%5D%5Bage%5D=8&amp;children%5B1%5D%5Btobacco%5D=0" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">calculator tool</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to show how a middle class family based in Virginia Beach is currently eligible for about $9,000 per year as a premium tax credit to offset their coverage costs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his debate with Harris in early September, Trump said that he has “concepts of a plan” when it comes to health care policy if re-elected. He added that there are “concepts and options” for a cheaper system that he will outline in the “not-too-distant future.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report also takes aim at Trump’s “concepts” quote and the fact that he’s yet to fully articulate what his plans are. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“(Trump and Vance) may not want Americans to see the details of their plan, but Vice President Harris and Governor Walz won’t let them get away with hiding its effects,” Harris campaign senior policy advisor Brian Nelson said in a release. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But formal outlines should be on the horizon, Trump’s team said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As President Trump said, he will release more details, but his overall position on health care remains the same: bring down costs and increase the quality of care by improving competition in the marketplace,” Trump’s national campaign secretary Karolina Leavitt said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report was released ahead of a vice presidential debate on Tuesday where Harris’ running-mate Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minnesota, will face off against Vance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When pressed about their healthcare proposals on a recent episode of “Meet the Press,” </span><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/4880616-jd-vance-donald-trump-health-care/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vance said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “a lot of it comes down… to deregulating the insurance market so that people can choose a plan that actually makes sense for them.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a recent event in North Carolina, Vance also suggested a plan to </span><a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2024/09/18/vance-targets-inflation-immigration-at-raleigh-event/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">separate patients into different health insurance pools based on individual risks.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leavitt, of Trump’s campaign, accused Harris of showing “support for a socialist government takeover of our healthcare system that would force people off their private plans and result in lower quality care.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The accusation stems from Harris’ previous co-sponsorship of a “Medicare For All” bill when still a U.S. Senator as well as her </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/kamala-harris-wants-end-private-health-insurance-new-democratic-litmus-n964241?_nlid=QjzdJemnN7&amp;_nhids=PolxhrO3Xn" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">embrace of it </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">during her 2019 bid for president. </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/19/medicare-for-all-harris-progressives-2024-elections-00174447" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">She has since moved away from that stance </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">which has been popular with the more progressive wings of the Democratic party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris’ recent health care proposals have included protecting the ACA and continuing price negotiations on medications that started as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, a measure for which she cast the tie-breaking vote to proceed. A price </span><a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/4829873-trump-biden-insulin-price-cap/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cap on insulin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has emerged as a debate within a debate for Trump, as his administration had implemented a temporary cap on the drug while the Inflation Reduction Act made the cap law unless it is repealed by future congressional action. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Harris-Walz campaign infers that Trump and Vance’s “message to America is: ‘you’re on your own.’”</span></p>

(Photos courtesy of respective campaigns)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, and Republican nominee Mike Clancy are vying to represent Virginia’s 10th Congressional District and succeed Democratic U.S. Rep. Jennifer Wexton, who is </span><a href="https://wexton.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=854" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">retiring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after being diagnosed with a severe neurological disorder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subramanyam opposes Project 2025 — a proposed conservative plan to change how the federal government operates — and said it is a key issue in his race. He is also prioritizing the cost of living and the economy in his campaign. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clancy said he does not support the project, but sees a path forward for himself focusing on areas that matter to voters, namely the economy, parental rights and public safety.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">District 10</h4>

	</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_39958" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:1480px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/va10-map_supreme-court-of-virginia/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-39958 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VA10-map_Supreme-Court-of-Virginia.png" alt="" width="1480" height="996" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VA10-map_Supreme-Court-of-Virginia.png 1480w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VA10-map_Supreme-Court-of-Virginia-300x202.png 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VA10-map_Supreme-Court-of-Virginia-1024x689.png 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VA10-map_Supreme-Court-of-Virginia-768x517.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1480px) 100vw, 1480px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Virginia Congressional District 10 (courtesy Supreme Court of Virginia)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past three congressional elections, Democrats have maintained control of the district even after it was redrawn to include the counties of Loudoun, Fauquier and Rappahannock, the cities of Manassas, Manassas Park, and parts of Prince William and Fairfax Counties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wexton, who has represented the district in the U.S. Congress since 2019, won her first two races by at least 12 percentage points in 2018 and 2020. However, in her final election in 2022, she narrowly won the redrawn district by six percentage points to Republican nominee Hung Cao, who is now running for U.S. Senate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After serving three straight terms in Congress and announcing her decision not to seek reelection, Wexton endorsed Subramanyam over several Democratic primary candidates hoping to succeed her. If elected, Subramanyam said he wants to carry on Wexton’s work in advocating for federal funding — potentially on the appropriations committee — for infrastructure projects and keeping the federal government open to avoid shutdowns that impact federal government employees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Jennifer Wexton was a leader in trying to push legislation to prevent shutdowns and being outspoken and her support of federal workers and contractors, so I want to continue that work because it&#8217;s important to our community and it&#8217;s what makes us so special,” said Subramanyam. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that the federal government should spend more resources in District 10 to keep it functioning because of the many civil servants who live and work there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If elected, Clancy would be the first Republican to hold the seat since Wexton unseated former congresswoman Barbara Comstock, who succeeded longtime congressman Frank Wolf. Wolf has endorsed Clancy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He was solution-focused, and that&#8217;s what I want to be,” Clancy said about Wolf. “(I) want to make sure that we&#8217;re representing the people of our constituency in the 10th District, doing what&#8217;s good for the people.” Like Wolf, Clancy added that he is “very focused on human rights issues.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Project 2025 and federal workers</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 34,000 federal government workers and contractors reside in the 10th District, according to a Sept. 23 </span><a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47716" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Congressional Research Service. There is a growing concern among residents and government employees about the impact of the recommendations outlined in Project 2025 if implemented by a Republican presidential administration, particularly the proposal to replace federal workers with political appointees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members of the American Federation, the largest federal workers union in the nation, wrote that such a proposal would negatively impact employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a takeover of our federal government in a manner that is not loyal to the Constitution and the law, has no interest in listening to the people, and will force employees to take orders, legal or not, or be terminated,” AFGE President Everett Kelley said in a </span><a href="https://www.afge.org/article/project-2025-seeks-to-dismantle-agencies-terminate-up-to-1-million-federal-workers/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">July statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clancy, a tech executive and lawyer, told The Mercury rejects the project’s proposal targeting federal government workers, refuting claims from his opponent and some media that he has connections to the Heritage Foundation. This conservative think tank published Project 2025. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I want to create jobs for the 10th District, not to decrease them,” Clancy said. “And here in Northern Virginia, in our district, a key component of the job market here is not only federal government employees, but government contractors, and that&#8217;s an important constituency that we&#8217;re trying to promote.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clancy admitted to donating to the organization in the past but said he is not a member of the Heritage Foundation, despite a Newsmax </span><a href="https://www.newsmax.com/insiders/mikeclancy/bio-834/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">webpage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stating he is a member. He calls Subramanyam’s attempt to tie him to Project 2025 and the Heritage Foundation a way to “distract” voters from the “failed” decisions made by the Biden-Harris administration on the economy, border security, fentanyl and “weak” foreign policy that led to two wars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Other than a small donation to the Heritage Foundation several years ago, I have never had any ‘connection’ to the Heritage Foundation,” Clancy said in a statement. “I have never worked with Heritage or attended any of their events. I have no connection to Project 2025. I never heard of Project 2025 until the Democrats started fear-mongering over it. I do not support and never have supported Project 2025.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subramanyam, a former tech policy advisor to former President Barack Obama, said Project 2025 would be “a complete disaster” for the 10th District if implemented by impacting businesses that rely on customers who are likely federal government workers and contractors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It will affect everyone, and in a time where people are worried about the economy and rising costs and being able to afford things like housing and childcare and prescription drugs, we don&#8217;t need a self-imposed recession,” Subramanyam said.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Parental rights</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 10, parents have </span><a href="https://dcist.com/story/22/02/03/youngkin-lawsuit-school-board-mask-mandate/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">challenged</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> local school divisions and boards and cited concerns about how schools operate, including what is taught and what students learn. Like elsewhere in the state, schools in the 10th District are facing </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2023/10/05/loudoun-sexual-assault-stone-bridge/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lawsuits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and confrontations from parents over controversial social issues, such as the types of books that are allowed in libraries and the treatment of transgender students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clancy said he supports parental rights, or a parents legal authority to make decisions about their child’s care and education. He said he also understands Project 2025 may overlap with his views, especially in the area of </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/04/what-could-project-2025-mean-for-education-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">education</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by supporting school choice, or the idea that parents should be able to use tax dollars designated for their child’s public education and send them to a private or charter school of their choice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Things shouldn&#8217;t just be for the rich,” Clancy said. “We should be able to empower parents at the middle-income and low-income levels to give them opportunities for school choice.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also claimed that his opponent voted against the interest of parents and children during his time in the Virginia House of Delegates, pointing to </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=221&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb656" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requiring schools to notify parents of sexually explicit instructional materials in school libraries, which Subramanyam opposed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of those books being considered was “Beloved” by author Toni Morrison, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in Literature for the book. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I support current Virginia law; the fundamental right for parents to be involved in their child&#8217;s education,” Subramanyam said in response. “I’m a father to two daughters, and being an involved parent is important to me.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Cost of living</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both candidates said they are committed to addressing inflation for Virginians in District 10. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to data provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to the Senate Joint Economic Committee in </span><a href="https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/republicans/virginia-inflation-report/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">August</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the average Virginia household has spent $30,688 more annually due to inflation since January 2021. </span><a href="https://www.fauquiernow.com/news/government_politics/10th-district-candidates-clancy-subramanyam-square-off-at-loudoun-county-debate/article_68f031a8-7773-11ef-bafe-2f320e87e58b.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clancy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and local </span><a href="https://loudoungop.com/subramanyam-denies-tax-relief-to-all-virginians/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have said Subramanyam’s votes against tax cuts have cost Virginians.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subramanyam denied that and said Democrats have done “a lot” to ensure Virginia has a “fair tax system.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have not increased income taxes since getting into the General Assembly, and I don&#8217;t plan on increasing personal income taxes in Congress,” he said, adding that he would like to find ways to cut taxes for people in the middle class, and continue his work by addressing rising costs and boosting the economy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clancy stated Subramanyam’s votes, including one opposing a </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb472" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tax relief bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2023, show the state senator does not represent the entire constituency of the 10th District. The Republican nominee said he hopes to support district voters by revitalizing the economy and minimizing President Joe Biden’s spending, curtailing inflation through “American innovation, American energy production,” and saving “small businesses from burdensome, stifling regulatory burdens.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a follow-up to the Mercury’s interview, Subramanyam’s campaign said the then-delegate ultimately </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?232+sum+HB6001" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in favor of the tax relief legislation within the budget, which included over $1 billion in tax reductions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The relief package provided an immediate tax rebate of $200 for individual filers, $400 for families and joint filers, and increased the standard deduction to $8,500 for individual filers and $17,000 for families and joint filers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My opponent is wrong — in the General Assembly, I supported tax relief for families and worked in a bipartisan way to do so, including a version of the very proposal my opponent cites,&#8221; Subramanyam said.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Immigration</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immigrants often come to the U.S. to leave adverse conditions in their home countries and seek safer living conditions and opportunities for employment. While migrants have become a staple of the country’s workforce, immigration has created backlash among some Americans concerned about migrants entering the country illegally and being granted rights and benefits without being a U.S. citizen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clancy and Subramanyam agree that something must be done to address challenges stemming from immigration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If elected, Clancy said he would advocate for “strong border security” legislation that would address sanctuary cities and legally mandate local governments to work with federal agencies and law enforcement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subramanyam said Republicans had a chance to address immigration and have failed to do anything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, the state senator told the Mercury that the U.S. immigration system is “broken” and he supports the country taking a comprehensive approach to the problem. He said one of the steps begins with securing the border and ensuring that people doing “the right things the right way and contributing to our economy“ have a path to citizenship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said the country must also fix its “broken” asylum system.</span></p>

																						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1024" height="768" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VIRGINAI@-1024x768.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="" style="margin-bottom: 10px;" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VIRGINAI@-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VIRGINAI@-300x225.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VIRGINAI@-768x576.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VIRGINAI@-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VIRGINAI@-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p style="font-size:12px;">A sign representing the Virginia delegation at the Democratic National Convention, held in Chicago, Aug. 19-22, 2024. (Ariana Figueroa/States Newsroom)</p><p>The Democratic National Committee will send $2.5 million to more than 30 of its state and territorial parties in the closing weeks of the 2024 election cycle, the DNC said in a Friday statement.</p>
<p>With the new grants, national Democrats will have contributed to all 57 state and territorial chapters for the first time in a presidential cycle, according to the party.</p>
<p>“From the school board to the White House, the DNC is doing the work to elect Democrats to office at all levels of government,” DNC Chair Jaime Harrison said in the statement, given to States Newsroom ahead of a wider announcement.</p>
<p>“We are the only committee responsible for building Democratic infrastructure to win elections across the map, and with a new $2.5 million in grants, the DNC is delivering a multi-million dollar investment across all 57 state parties this cycle – a historic first for our committee.”</p>
<p>The new grants go beyond the seven swing states considered ultra-competitive in the presidential election that have gotten the lion’s share of attention and spending at the national level — and the handful with key U.S. Senate races that have also attracted a national focus.</p>
<p>Though some grants are relatively small, they represent a commitment by the national party to states across the country, including traditionally red states, Democrats said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Field workers in Idaho</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In Idaho, where Democrats hold just 18 of the 105 seats in the Legislature, a more-than $70,000 commitment from the national party will fund two field workers to reach Hispanic voters in two rural counties and tribal members on the Nez Perce Reservation, state party chair and state Rep. Lauren Necochea said.</p>
<p>Necochea, who spoke with States Newsroom in a Thursday interview ahead of the official announcement, said the funding was significant both for the symbolism of the national party’s investment in the overwhelmingly Republican state and for campaign operations this fall.</p>
<p>“We’re just gratified to see that this investment hit all 57 states and territories for the first time … so that no state is left behind,” she said. “We’re a traditionally red state, and that means we need the funding to fight back.”</p>
<p>The two organizers funded by the national money will help boost turnout in the state’s four battleground state legislative districts, Necochea said.</p>
<p>“This level of investment is also meaningful when it comes to winning races and getting out the vote,” she said, noting that a race in the last cycle was decided by 37 votes.</p>
<p>The outcomes in those races could determine which faction of the state’s Republican Party — either the hard right or the more moderate wing — will control the legislative agenda next session, she said.</p>
<p>The Democratic minority in the Legislature sometimes partners with moderate Republicans on legislation to fund education and health care programs, including maintaining the state’s Medicaid expansion, Necochea said.</p>
<p>“It is essential for state government to continue operating that we have a critical mass of Democrats in the Idaho Legislature,” she said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Other grants</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The DNC provided a partial list of the spending included in Friday’s announcement. State parties are free to use the funds as they wish, a DNC spokesman said. The national party noted some state organizations had already determined how to allocate the money.</p>
<p>Many state organizations planned to pursue outreach to voters of color, including in tribal communities.</p>
<p>Some examples of the spending and objectives, according to the DNC:</p>
<ul>
<li>Florida: More than $400,000 for statewide programs targeting “key coalitions.”</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Oregon: $125,000 to help the state party’s efforts in three key U.S. House races.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Pennsylvania: $100,000 “to supercharge voter outreach” in the only presidential battleground state on the new list. A portion of the funding will target the state’s large Puerto Rican community, the DNC said.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Minnesota: At least $100,000 to boost the state’s paid canvassing campaign. The new funding brings the total DNC allocation to the state to about $630,000, according to the party. The canvassing effort will help protect Democrats’ slim majorities in both legislative chambers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Missouri: “Nearly $100,000” for new organizing staff focused on breaking GOP supermajorities in both statehouse chambers and passing <a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2024/09/25/amendment-3-challenges-abortion-missouri-legislation/" target="_blank">an abortion ballot measure</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Maryland: $75,000 for the state party’s mail program, with a focus on reaching Asian American and Pacific Islander voters, a growing segment of the state’s voting base, the DNC said. The DNC noted its support for U.S. Senate candidate Angela Alsobrooks, calling her race against former GOP Gov. Larry Hogan critical to protecting reproductive rights.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>South Carolina: More than $70,000 for a get-out-the-vote staffer, focusing on outreach to new voters.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Maine: $61,250 for three staffers to focus get-out-the-vote efforts in rural parts of U.S. Rep. Jared Golden’s swing district.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Arkansas: Nearly $60,000 to hire six coalition directors targeting young, Black and Latino voters, including Spanish-speaking organizers. It’s the first DNC spending in Arkansas this cycle.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Louisiana: $55,000 for an organizer to help the state party reach voters in the new majority-Black 6th Congressional District.</li>
</ul>

But for the last 13 years, Republican Morgan Griffith has held the seat with little opposition, solidifying his status as the incumbent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That could change this election cycle as Democrat Karen Baker hopes to unseat the lawmaker from Salem. A native midwesterner who moved to Floyd County from South Carolina in 2014, she has spent the last seven months traveling thousands of miles criss-crossing the deeply rural and mountainous district. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39967" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:1476px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/va09_supreme-court-of-virginia/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-39967 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VA09_Supreme-Court-of-Virginia.png" alt="" width="1476" height="1000" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VA09_Supreme-Court-of-Virginia.png 1476w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VA09_Supreme-Court-of-Virginia-300x203.png 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VA09_Supreme-Court-of-Virginia-1024x694.png 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VA09_Supreme-Court-of-Virginia-768x520.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1476px) 100vw, 1476px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  (courtesy Supreme Court of Virginia)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baker’s campaign centers on a nonpartisan message focused on improving access to health care — an issue critical to the region’s residents, which is why she believes she can appeal to voters across the political spectrum and break Griffith’s long-standing hold on the seat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Baker takes pride in her decades-long record as a public servant — first as a trial lawyer for the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and as an administrative law judge for the Social Security Administration — she has never run for public office before, “except for treasurer in 11th grade, which I won,” she told The Mercury in a recent interview.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baker decided to challenge Griffith in Virginia’s most Republican district after being approached by “some concerned Democrats who felt it was important to have a credible candidate on the ballot. And so I said, well, if not me, then who?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 9th District, Virginia’s second largest, is a mostly sprawling and rugged region in the southwestern part of the state covering a large swath of rural and mountainous terrain, including the Appalachian region, stretching from Lee County in the west all the way to Bedford County in the east. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Known for its deep-rooted cultural ties to coal mining, agriculture, and manufacturing, the 9th has historically been a battleground for political power. But in recent years, it has leaned solidly Republican since Griffith flipped it in 2010, defeating Democratic U.S. Rep. Rick Boucher after 28 years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This district is a fascinating place, because it was the last stronghold for Southern Democrats and did not fall to the GOP until that year,” said David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People there respond to in-person retail politics, they want to see and speak to their candidates,” Richards added. “I think Baker can capitalize on this and she has the right idea by campaigning hard on the ground. But because Griffith has regularly won with over 60% of the vote, it will be a very steep climb for her.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By campaigning on access to health care, Baker brings her own experience in the field to the table. After her law career, she went to nursing school at Greenville Technical College in South Carolina. She became a registered nurse in 2011 and spent several years at a small rural hospital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There were rural hospitals before that may have been struggling in terms of their budgets, but now those hospitals either are closed, or they’ve become urgent cares, so we have maternity deserts where people have to drive hours over twisting mountains and secondary roads to get care,” Baker said.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ASPTVc7Fqv"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/rural-health-committee-hears-from-maternal-health-dental-specialists-in-farmville/">Rural health committee hears from maternal health, dental specialists in Farmville</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Rural health committee hears from maternal health, dental specialists in Farmville&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/rural-health-committee-hears-from-maternal-health-dental-specialists-in-farmville/embed/#?secret=U0eXwJI6Nn#?secret=ASPTVc7Fqv" data-secret="ASPTVc7Fqv" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many residents in the district are unsatisfied by the services provided by </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/25/after-appalachian-hospitals-merged-into-a-monopoly-their-ers-slowed-to-a-crawl/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ballad Health</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a chain of hospitals that has a monopoly on medical care in Southwest Virginia, Baker said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People are upset about the quality of care because Ballad underpays its staff. It’s been a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/sen-warner-hopes-to-boost-funding-to-rural-hospitals-amid-obstetrics-closures/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">revolving door</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in terms of professionals coming fresh out of medical school, getting a couple of years under their belt and leaving for greener pastures.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To address this problem, Baker proposes scaling up the Program of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE), a Medicare and Medicaid program that provides health care services for adults 55 and older with chronic health conditions or disabilities. In addition, she wants to utilize the community health care centers in the district. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The majority of people in the district are already on Medicaid, so we have a template for creating better conditions with fairly simple enabling legislation to spread these two programs throughout,” Baker said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other issues on Baker’s campaign platform include the creation of a better jobs market that she hopes will retain more younger people in the district, and expanding access to public education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since launching her campaign in March, Baker said she has talked to thousands of voters in the district. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I go to concerts, flea markets, I’m looking for the people that wouldn’t automatically think to vote for me. In other words, leaning Republicans or Republicans. Those are the people that I need to get to know me and to like me in order for me to win, and so that’s where I am.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But despite the excitement among Democrats over Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential bid, Baker said she isn’t running on a national ticket. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s not my campaign, because nobody expects Harris to win in the 9th, and I can win because I am for everybody in this district. I tell people I’m a Democrat, but I don’t run out yelling I’m a Democrat. I run out saying, ‘I’m here for you, I will work for you.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When talking to voters, Baker said she always asks them about Griffith, her opponent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People sometimes go, who’s that?  And generally, I would say 80 to 90% of the time, people say, ‘he doesn’t do anything for us.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griffith, however, insists that he hasn’t become complacent in a district where he has previously run for reelection unopposed, underscoring that he takes Baker’s challenge seriously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Am I doing more than when I don’t have an opponent? Yes,” he told The Mercury in a phone interview earlier this week. “But I generally work the district pretty hard anytime I have an opponent. We’ve had about 350 stops in the last term in the district, averaging about four events on the days that I am here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Philadelphia native who grew up in Salem and returned home after graduating from Washington and Lee University School of Law in 1983, Griffith first ran for public office in 1993, when he was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates, where he served as the House Majority Leader for 10 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2010, he ousted Boucher, the 13-term Democratic incumbent in the 9th Congressional District, by 51-46%. In the most recent congressional election in 2022, Griffith was reelected to his sixth term after defeating Democrat Taysha DeVaughan by a staggering 73-27%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a legislator, Griffith said he was proud of his role in advocating for the Abandoned Mine Land Economic Revitalization Program (AMLER) to implement strategies that return former coal mining sites to productive uses. Since its creation in 2016, the program has brought more than $10 million to the district every year, Griffith said. </span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Data centers, proliferating statewide, could soon be built on mined lands in Southwest Virginia&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/15/data-centers-proliferating-statewide-could-soon-be-built-on-mined-lands-in-southwest-virginia/embed/#?secret=xA3zMQtvhq#?secret=SxopI0zG6W" data-secret="SxopI0zG6W" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his time in Congress, Griffith has also sponsored or supported legislation to push back against what he called high taxes, unnecessary regulation, and an over-reliance on foreign industry that have strangled private businesses in our communities and prevented job growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He has also introduced the </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=258609" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EPA Regulatory Relief Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to reduce what he considered burdensome regulations on hospitals, manufacturers, and other businesses in the district. The measure failed in the Senate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rebuking his opponent’s claims that he had done little to help expand health care in the 9th, Griffith said he has been a strong supporter of federally qualified health centers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have more than any other in the state of Virginia,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griffith also was part of a bipartisan effort to expand care options for people who experience strokes by introducing the </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=398682" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthering Access to Stroke Telemedicine ACT (FAST) Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2017, which helps stroke victims gain faster access to high-quality care through remote evaluation and treatment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m a big supporter of the telehealth concepts, of our federally qualified health centers, and of trying to make sure that we continue to pay our health care providers enough that they can make it,” Griffith said in the interview. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In June, Griffith touted his role in securing a $1.6 million federal grant benefitting the Piedmont Planning District’s Commission’s Route 122 Regional Corridor Plan, which was funded under the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in 2021 — which he voted against.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the interview, Griffith explained this contradiction by stating that as a congressman, he had two jobs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One is to legislate, and the other is to act like an ombudsman. On my legislative side, I still think it was bad policy. But on my ombudsman&#8217;s side, on the side that says I’m supposed to help the district, once it’s passed into law, I would be failing to do my job if I didn’t then advocate for those federal monies to come to the 9th District.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If reelected on Nov. 5, Griffith vows to continue advocating for what he considers issues that are in the best interest of the people in his district, such as “fighting for medicine, making sure that rural health is getting a fair shake,” and leading the charge against regulations trying to eliminate coal, among other priorities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to get broadband finished up, and that&#8217;s an important issue. I’m hopeful that that will actually happen in the next couple of years. But we just have to keep moving forward and I want to make sure that our tax rates are low,” Griffith said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Jan. 6, 2021, Griffith was one of </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/01/07/us/elections/electoral-college-biden-objectors.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">147 House Republicans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who voted against certifying the 2020 presidential election, which Democrat Joe Biden won by more than 7 million votes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost four years later, Griffith said that he never took the position that fraud was an issue during that election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Some people did, but I believe fraud is a purview of the states and not the federal government,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, he said that he had concerns with changes that bureaucrats in states like Arizona and Georgia had made to their election laws within 30 days of the election that had not been approved by the respective state legislatures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That is in violation of the federal law, therefore, those elections are subject to not being certified,” Griffith said, adding that he doesn’t foresee this happening again after this year’s election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t know that we’ll have the same problems that we had in the 2020 election.”</span></p>

<p>Wisconsin carpenter Efrain Campos just retired this summer after 30 years, working mostly in commercial multi-story buildings — “from 15 floors and up,” he said. For him the last four years have been a boom period.</p>
<p>On Labor Day, Campos, 68, was among the thousands of union members and their families who turned out for Laborfest on Milwaukee’s festival grounds on the shores of Lake Michigan.</p>
<p>He had planned to vote for President Joe Biden for a second term in office, but when the Democratic Party pivoted to Vice President Kamala Harris as its candidate, he pivoted as well. “We need somebody to help the middle people,” he said, “so they can advance, get a little bit better than what we are now.”</p>
<p>Campos dismisses the notion that the Republican candidate, former President Donald Trump, is a pro-worker candidate despite Trump’s populist appeal that grabbed a slice of the working class electorate in 2016.</p>
<p>“Not at all,” he said. “It’s ignorant. He’s a rich man, he gets his way. That’s not what this country is about.”</p>
<p>As the Nov. 5 presidential election nears, Democrats are counting on union workers to deliver voters, particularly in the swing states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Nevada where unions have remained an influential bloc, even as their strength has declined over the decades.</p>
<p>Many labor union leaders say they’re working as hard as they ever have to oppose Republican candidate and former President Donald Trump and elect Vice President Kamala Harris. The AFL-CIO, a federation of 60 unions that range from Major League Baseball players to firefighters to workers in the food industry, has endorsed Harris.</p>
<p>A growing share of rank-and-file union members, however, have been less likely to follow their leadership — some of them among Trump’s base.</p>
<p>“It has to be recognized that union members are not monolithic in terms of the party they support,” said Paul Clark, a professor of labor and employment relations at Penn State University. “Many unions have 30, 40, maybe 50% or more of their members who either are registered Republicans or are going to support Donald Trump in this election.”</p>
<p>Last week, International Brotherhood of Teamsters General President Sean O’Brien announced the union’s executive council <a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2024/09/18/teamsters-wont-endorse-either-candidate-in-presidential-race/" target="_blank">would not endorse either ticket</a> and cited the support of a majority of his members for Trump. (The Teamsters aren’t part of the AFL-CIO).</p>
<p>Other union leaders insist that O’Brien is an outlier.</p>
<p>Nick Webber, a political organizer for the North American Building Trades Unions, said, “It’s unprecedented the amount of interest in people in getting involved” as he marshals  union canvassers this fall for the Democratic national ticket. He said in his conversations he’s hearing union members say “not only, ‘am I going to be voting,’ and [that they’re] tuned in, but ‘how can I get involved’ and ‘doing my part.’”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Appeals to steel and culinary workers</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>When Biden dropped out July 21, the national executive council of the 12.5 million-member AFL-CIO endorsed Harris the next day “because we knew that the administration that has been fighting for working people for the last three and a half years, we know what they’ve delivered, and we knew that her record spoke for itself,” said Liz Shuler, national AFL-CIO president, in an interview with NC Newsline.</p>
<p>But the Trump campaign is continuing to try to reach union voters, even as union leaders argue his record as president and his rhetoric — such as <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-and-musk-discussed-firing-striking-workers-the-uaw-is-now-seeking-an-nlrb-investigation" target="_blank">suggesting in a conversation with Elon Musk that employers should fire strikers</a> — should make him unacceptable.</p>
<p>In an appeal to United Steelworkers, the most powerful union in western Pennsylvania, Trump <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/01/31/trump-us-steel-sale-00138910" target="_blank">said in January</a> he would block a potential acquisition of U.S. Steel by Japan-based Nippon Steel.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the union endorsed Biden, who said in a visit in April he also opposed the sale. Both he and Harris reiterated that stance during a Labor Day visit to Pittsburgh. “I couldn’t agree more with President Biden: U.S. Steel should remain in American hands,” Harris said.</p>
<p>In Nevada, Trump held a rally in June where he proposed ending federal taxes on tipped income — an appeal aimed at the workers in the state’s largest industry, hotel-casinos.</p>
<p>Harris adopted the no-tax-on-tips position as well in a visit in August, a<a href="https://nevadacurrent.com/2024/08/11/harris-walz-energize-crowd-at-first-nevada-rally-as-democratic-presidential-ticket/" target="_blank"> day after </a>the powerful Culinary Workers Local Union 226, <a href="https://nevadacurrent.com/2024/08/11/harris-walz-energize-crowd-at-first-nevada-rally-as-democratic-presidential-ticket/" target="_blank">endorsed her</a>. The union reports that its 60,000 members are 55% women and 60% immigrants.</p>
<p>In a return visit in August, Trump suggested his “no tax on tips” position would draw Culinary members’ support — “A lot of them are voting for us, I can tell you that,” he said.</p>
<p>But the union responded by doubling down on its support for Harris, who on a visit months before had <a href="https://nevadacurrent.com/2024/01/04/harris-touts-administrations-commitment-to-labor-in-las-vegas-visit/)" target="_blank">celebrated</a> the union’s successful contract negotiations with the Las Vegas Strip’s largest gambling-resort corporations.</p>
<p>“Kamala Harris has promised to raise the minimum wage for all workers — including tipped workers — and eliminate tax on tips,” said Culinary Vice President Leain Vashon. Vashon said Trump didn’t help tipped workers while he was president, so “Why would we trust him? Kamala has a plan, Trump has a slogan.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Making the case</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>For most union leaders, the case for Harris is the stark contrast they see between Trump’s record in the White House from 2016 to 2020 and that of his successor.</p>
<p>“When you talk about the politics of what’s at stake in this election, it’s very clear,” said Kent Miller, president and business manager for the Laborers Union Wisconsin District Council.</p>
<p>The 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law, the 2022 bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act and the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which passed with only Democratic votes, opened the sluices to fund a range of investments in roads and bridges, clean energy and electric vehicle infrastructure.</p>
<p>The programs include strong incentives for union labor and for the enrollment of new apprentices in training programs operated by unions and their employers.</p>
<p>Larry Davis, a Michigan United Auto Workers local president, said Biden-Harris administration policies helped boost the auto industry.</p>
<p>“I can just go from Detroit-Hamtramck, [which was] on the brink of closing, and now you have over 3,000 almost 4,000 workers in there now,” Davis said.</p>
<p>But the messages unions have been pushing about manufacturing growth, the infrastructure advances and jobs — even unemployment rates that have fallen to just over 4% nationally and <a href="https://www.bls.gov/web/laus/laumstrk.htm" target="_blank">3% or lower in states such as Wisconsin</a> — have been slow to resonate with voters who are focused on higher prices resulting from supply chain shortages.</p>
<p>“Part of that is the investment is still in the works,” said William Jones, a labor historian at the University of Minnesota. “It was slow to be distributed, and it depended largely on state and local government taking it up and creating jobs. It’s possible some people haven’t felt the full impact.”</p>
<p>Jones also suggests there may have been inadequate messaging from the administration — something that unions are trying to make up for in their member outreach.</p>
<p>Beyond what Miller and other union leaders see as those bread-and-butter accomplishments are other policy stakes in who holds the White House, such as the makeup of the National Labor Relations Board and who holds the post of general counsel, the principal architect of the agency’s legal perspective.</p>
<p>Those differences further underscore what most union leaders see as a sharp distinction between the two tickets. “We’ve seen both these movies before,” said Webber of the electrical workers union.</p>
<p>Under the Trump administration the NLRB veered to positions less favorable to unions, Miller observed. Under Biden, it has issued more decisions that have supported union positions.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How much does Trump appeal?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Can the former president succeed in once again carving out some support among union voters?</p>
<p>Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan, all previously reliable Democratic states with strong union political involvement, famously flipped to Trump by narrow margins in 2016, leading to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton’s defeat that year. All three flipped back to help carry Biden to victory against Trump in 2020.</p>
<p>Jones said Trump’s criticism of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 2016 — enacted under Democratic President Bill Clinton in 1993 — “helped him among a certain demographic in 2016” — primarily working class white men from rural and small town regions.</p>
<p>When Teamsters President O’Brien announced the union wouldn’t make an endorsement this year, the <a href="https://teamster.org/2024/09/teamsters-release-presidential-endorsement-polling-data/" target="_blank">union released a poll</a> of rank-and-file members that found nearly 60% support for Trump compared to 31% for Harris. The union said the survey was conducted by Lake Research Partners, a Democratic polling firm.</p>
<p>O’Brien’s announcement followed his precedent-breaking speech to the Republican National Convention in July, where he called Trump “one tough SOB,” proclaimed a willingness to work with either political party and attacked business lobbies and corporations.</p>
<p>“I think he feels that at least half of his members are Trump supporters,” said Clark, the Penn State professor, in an interview before the non-endorsement announcement. “And while I think he recognizes that Biden has been very pro-labor, you know, politically, I think he felt a need to sort of send a message to his members that he hears them.”</p>
<p>The outcome opened up a rift in the union, however. Within hours of O’Brien’s announcement, local, state and regional Teamsters bodies representing at least 500,000 members of the 1.3 million-member union endorsed Harris, including groups  in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Nevada.</p>
<p>The pro-Harris Teamsters highlighted Biden’s role in signing legislation, included in the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act, that<a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2021/03/23/collapsing-union-pension-plans-win-long-sought-help-from-rescue-package/" target="_blank"> shored up the union’s Central States Pension Fund</a>. The fund faced insolvency by 2026 after years of underfunding.</p>
<p>In a statement, Bill Carroll, president of the union’s Council 39, representing about 15,000 Wisconsin Teamsters, said Harris would also build on Biden’s pro-union record. “In contrast, Donald Trump tried to gut workers’ rights as president by appointing union busters to the NLRB and advocating for national right-to-work,” Carroll said. “Trump’s project 2025 would go even further, attacking the ability for unions to even have the ability to organize.”</p>
<p>The labor-related provisions in the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 document — billed as a blueprint for the next Republican White House — include proposals that experts have said would eliminate public sector unions nationwide, make forming private sector unions more difficult and allow states to opt out of federal labor laws. Other proposals would reduce federal protections for workers whether unionized or not.</p>
<p>Union messaging to members has emphasized the document and its ties to Trump, despite his repeated disavowal of the agenda and claims of ignorance about its contents.</p>
<p>“It is absolutely his plan,” the AFL-CIO’s Shuler told NC Newsline. “He’s had over 100 former administration officials and the Heritage Foundation basically writing the blueprint for his next term, which would eliminate unions as we know it.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Reaching out to members</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Union leaders say they’re trying to make sure their members are seeing the campaign the way they see it.</p>
<p>In Nevada, where the Culinary’s canvassing and get-out-the-vote effort is regarded as one of the state’s most formidable, the union boasts that during the 2022 campaign cycle it <a href="https://unitehere.org/press-releases/over-1200-unite-here-canvassers-drive-labors-largest-field-operation-for-democrats-in-tightest-races-knocking-2-7-million-voter-doors-in-nevada-arizona-pennsylvania-and-georgia/" target="_blank">knocked on 1 million doors</a>.</p>
<p>This year, UNITE HERE <a href="https://m.culinaryunion226.org/news/press/culinary-union-canvass-launch-with-unite-here-and-aft" target="_blank">says</a> it is once again mobilizing its members and plans to knock on more than 3 million doors in Nevada, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Ohio, North Carolina and Michigan “to ensure that Kamala Harris wins the presidency.”</p>
<p>In Wisconsin, the Laborers are building political messaging into a union project to engage members more closely, “connecting union members with other union members,” Miller said, to explain how negotiations affect wages and health and retirement benefits, as well as the importance of increasing union representation.</p>
<p>“We’re a jobs club,” Miller said. The message to the union members, he adds, is that “at the end of the day it’s everybody’s right to decide who to vote for — but we want to let you guys know these are the issues at stake in this upcoming election.”</p>
<p>Experienced union members are holding one-on-one conversations, particularly with newer and younger members. “We’re not just doing phone calls, we’re doing job site visits, and member-to-member doing doors,” Miller said.</p>
<p>Webber’s work with the building trades group is similar. “We’ve been doing a lot of reaching out and making sure to have those conversations,” he said — on job sites and during union meetings.</p>
<p>The message: “These jobs don’t come out of thin air,” Webber says. “There’s been strategic, intentional investment for a need in the community.”</p>
<p>The communications don’t just focus on other union members, either, he said. “You need to be sure people on the periphery of the union hear [the message],” said Webber. “Union household members are a huge part of these conversations — a partner, a spouse or child.”</p>
<p>On Monday, the United Auto Workers union unveiled a national<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Icz9AQarHWc" target="_blank"> YouTube video</a> aimed directly at members who might still see Trump through the lens of his attacks on NAFTA in his first presidential campaign.</p>
<p>The UAW has endorsed Harris. In the 3 1/2-minute video, UAW President Sean Fain finds both Democrats and Republicans culpable for NAFTA and the factory closings over the quarter-century since it was enacted. In 2016, Fain says, “All of that pain had to go somewhere. And for a lot of working-class people, it went to voting for Donald Trump.”</p>
<p>The video, however, portrays Trump as a con man, highlighting his 2017 tax cut as favoring the wealthy and the USMCA, the trade law Trump enacted, as no better than NAFTA, which it replaced.</p>
<p>While emphasizing that “both parties have done harm to the working class,” Fain said that under Biden and Harris, “we’ve seen the tide starting to turn.”</p>
<p>Under Biden there’s been “more manufacturing investment in this country than at any point in my lifetime,” he says, and under Harris, “the Democratic Party is getting back to its roots.”</p>
<p>Paula Uhing is president of the local Steelworkers union at a suburban Milwaukee factory. She’s another enthusiastic Harris supporter, but said she and other labor leaders “know that we still have a lot of work to do” to pull more union voters behind the vice president.</p>
<p>“We have so many union members that vote against their own interests,” Uhing said. “It’s just because they’re not paying attention, they’re not listening to the right people.”</p>
<p>She describes herself as “optimistically cautious,” though. One reason has been some of the conversations she’s had with coworkers.</p>
<p>“There are people at work who are not necessarily turning away from the Republican Party altogether, but they are considering the Democratic ticket,” Uhing said. “They’re looking at it in a completely different way than they did last cycle, which is a good thing.”</p>

Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears and U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Prince William, the two leading declared candidates for governor, are tied at 39% support each, according to a </span><a href="https://www.umw.edu/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/09/UMW-Survey-Topline-Two-1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new statewide poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the University of Mary Washington’s Center for Leadership and Media Studies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The remaining 22% of respondents in the survey of 1,000 adult Virginians said they were undecided, did not plan to vote,  would back another candidate or refused to answer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The poll is in line with the results from </span><a href="https://www.umw.edu/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/09/UMW-Survey-Topline-One-1-1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">another UMW survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that also found Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump locked in a tight contest in Virginia, with the Democrat edging her Republican opponent by 48-46%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger, who has represented Virginia’s 7th Congressional District since 2019, was the first candidate </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/11/13/abigail-spanberger-virginia-governor-00126815" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to announce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> her gubernatorial bid in November 2023. Earle-Sears, the first Black woman in the commonwealth to hold statewide office, and the first woman to attain such a role since Mary Sue Terry’s tenure as attorney general in the 1990s, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/06/lt-gov-winsome-earle-sears-announces-run-for-virginia-governor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched her campaign</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> earlier this month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorney General Jason Miyares, another potential Republican candidate for his party’s gubernatorial nomination, would be equally competitive in a general election, the poll found. In a possible match-up between Spanberger and Miyares, 40% of survey respondents backed Spanberger while 39% favored Miyares, well within the survey’s margin of error.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares has not yet announced his intentions for 2025, but Virginia attorney generals often either run for re-election to the commonwealth’s top legal office or campaign to become governor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Glenn Youngkin, the current governor, cannot run for re-election next year because of Virginia’s one consecutive term limit for governors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia elections are often close, and the look ahead to next year suggests more of the same in the campaign for governor,” said Stephen J. Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington and director of UMW’s Center for Leadership and Media Studies. “The big challenge for these potential candidates is becoming better known across the commonwealth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginians were more negative about the direction of the nation than about the direction of the commonwealth, with 24% saying Virginia was headed in the right direction and 26% saying it was headed in the wrong direction. The rest offered mixed views. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the nation overall, 51% of those surveyed said that things in the country were headed in the wrong direction, with only 16% saying the nation was on the right track.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginians in this new survey said they approved of Youngkin’s job performance by a 46 to 34% margin. As for President Joe Biden’s job performance, 37% of survey respondents approved while 53% disapproved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Elections never stop in Virginia, and 2025 looks to be another very interesting electoral year in the commonwealth,” Farnsworth said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UMW poll was conducted by Research America Inc. between Sept. 3 and 9, 2024. The survey included a total of 1,000 Virginia residents, consisting of 870 registered voters and 774 likely voters. The margin of error is +/- 4.1%. </span></p>

<p>ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. — The signs on the empty historic buildings envision an urban utopia of sorts, complete with street cafes, bustling bike lanes and a grocery co-op.</p>
<p>“IMAGINE What Could Be Here,” gushes one sign outside the empty, Neoclassical post office. “IMAGINE! A Vibrant Downtown,” reads another mounted on the glass front of a long-ago closed drug store.</p>
<p>In a place like Rocky Mount, North Carolina, it’s not such a stretch: Just across the street, white-collar workers peck away at laptops and sip lattes at a bright coffee bar lined with dozens of potted tropical plants. A few blocks away, a mammoth events center routinely brings in thousands of visitors from across the country. And alongside a quiet river nearby, a meticulously redeveloped cotton mill would be the envy of any American city, with its modern breweries, restaurants and loft living.</p>
<p>An industrial community long in decline, Rocky Mount is slowly building itself back. But in this city of about 54,000, sharply divided by race and class, many residents struggle to cover the basic costs of groceries, housing and child care.</p>
<p>North Carolina reflects the duality of the American economy: Unemployment is low, jobs are increasing and businesses are opening new factories. But high housing and food costs have squeezed middle-class residents despite the gains of rising wages.</p>
<p>“The economy stinks,” said Tameika Horne, who owns an ice cream and dessert shop in Rocky Mount.</p>
<p>Her ingredient prices have skyrocketed, she said, but she can’t continuously raise prices on ice cream cones or funnel cakes. She said last month was her slowest ever, with only $2,000 in sales.</p>
<p>It’s not just the slow sales at her store: Only a few years ago, she paid $700 a month to rent a three-bedroom apartment. Now, her similarly sized rental home costs her $1,350 a month.</p>
<p>Aside from the ice cream shop, Horne also runs a cleaning business with her family and just started a job delivering packages for FedEx.</p>
<p>“It’s just hard right now,” she said.</p>
<p>The economy, a top issue for voters during any election, is particularly important this presidential cycle: Prices of necessities such as groceries aren’t rising as fast as they were, but years of post-pandemic inflation have soured voter attitudes.</p>

<p>And across the country, millions of families are struggling with rising housing costs. In four of the seven swing states — Arizona, Georgia, Michigan and Nevada — more than half of tenant families <a href="https://stateline.org/2024/09/12/rent-is-eating-up-a-greater-share-of-tenants-income-in-almost-every-state/" target="_blank">spend</a> 30% or more of their income on rent and utilities, according to the 2023 American Community Survey.</p>
<p>In North Carolina, voter anxiety about the soaring rents and grocery bills could tip the scales.</p>
<p>“In terms of its political influence, it’s not actually your personal financial situation that is important, it’s your vision of the national economy,” said Matt Grossmann, a political science professor at Michigan State University. “So if I get a raise, I tend to credit myself. If I see higher prices, I tend to blame the government or the current situation.”</p>
<p>Around the corner from Horne’s ice cream store in downtown Rocky Mount, Kristie Hilliard greets a steady flow of customers to her new shop, Kristie Kandies. An armed cop, a nurse in scrubs and waist-high kids trickle in to grab a sweet treat.</p>
<p>After getting tired of her manufacturing job at the local Pfizer plant, Hilliard started making confections at home. As her following grew, she got a concession trailer and now has a storefront selling candied grapes, plums, kiwis and pickles.</p>
<p>Hilliard’s treats have attracted attention on social media, causing some buyers to drive in from as far away as Pennsylvania, she said.</p>
<p>A Democrat, she said she still hadn’t made up her mind on the presidential race. But she doesn’t believe either a Harris or a Trump administration would drastically change much for her business.</p>
<p>“They ain’t doing nothing for me now,” she said. “So, what would change?”</p>

    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A community divided looks to the future</h4>

	
<p>About 60 miles northeast of the state capital, Rocky Mount lies between the prosperous Research Triangle area and North Carolina’s scenic beach communities.</p>
<p>Railroad tracks and a county line slice through the middle of downtown. On the one side is the majority Black and lower-income Edgecombe County. On the other, the more prosperous and whiter Nash County.</p>
<p>While some officials say long-standing attitudes centered on division are fading, the county line has for decades provided a clear delineation of class, race and politics.</p>
<p>Edgecombe County is a Democratic stronghold, but the more populous Nash County is a bellwether of sorts. It was among the <a href="https://www.oldnorthstatepolitics.com/2024/04/counties-to-watch-in-2024-north.html" target="_blank">10 closest</a> of North Carolina’s 100 counties in the last presidential election, and one being closely watched this cycle. With 51,774 <a href="https://www.politico.com/2020-election/results/north-carolina/" target="_blank">ballots cast</a>, President Joe Biden took Nash County by 120 votes.</p>
<p>Around Rocky Mount’s downtown area, stately red brick churches and banks line the wide streets. But just a few blocks away, weeds overtake vacant lots, glass is smashed out of abandoned buildings, and razor wire tops the fencing of no-credit-needed car lots and used tire shops.</p>
<p>While the nearby Raleigh metro area has experienced explosive suburban growth, Rocky Mount Mayor Sandy Roberson said his community has seen an erosion of its middle class with the loss of corporate headquarters and factory jobs.</p>
<p>But he’s optimistic.</p>
<p>Young business owners are investing in downtown. Industries with operations in the Raleigh area are moving east. And both Republicans and Democrats just celebrated the news that Natron Energy plans to build a $1.4 billion electric vehicle battery plant nearby that will employ more than 1,000 people.</p>
<p>“We’ve got a lot of great things that are happening,” the mayor said. “But the key is, how do you build and retain a middle class? Because that’s who does the living and the dying and the investing in a community.”</p>
<p>The mayor’s position is nonpartisan, but Roberson is a Republican who in 2022 ran in the Republican primary for a congressional seat here. This election, however, is a difficult one for him.</p>
<p>Roberson said the economy and his financial position were unquestionably better during former President Donald Trump’s term, but the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection and the chaos of the last Trump presidency make him hard to support. At the same time, Roberson worries about Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris’ economic policies; he believes the current administration has accelerated inflation by pumping too much money into the economy.</p>
<p>“At some levels, it feels like I’m voting for somebody who wants to either be a dictator or somebody who wants to create a socialist state,” Roberson said. “And I’m not in either place.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Nobody is immune’</h4>

	
<p>In North Carolina and other swing states, Trump’s television ads hammer the vice president over high prices and “Bidenomics.”</p>
<p>Nash County Republican Party volunteer Yvonne McLeod said the economy, along with immigration, are the top concerns locally. Businesses still struggle to hire, rents have soared and food prices are still up, she said.</p>
<p>“Economically, we’re hurting,” she said.</p>
<p>Democrats must be honest about the financial pressures facing voters, said Cassandra Conover, a former Virginia prosecutor who now leads the Nash County Democratic Party. She noted that Harris ads running in North Carolina speak directly to middle-class concerns.</p>
<p>“Nobody is immune from what’s going on,” Conover said. “She’s telling all of us who are hurting, ‘I know, and we’re working for you.’”</p>
<p>Polling has shown voters are sour on the economy, with <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4870214-poll-us-economy-wrong-track/" target="_blank">63%</a> saying the economy was on the wrong track in a Harvard-CAPS-Harris poll released this month. Republicans take a far dimmer view than Democrats.</p>
<p>“From past experience, we would expect Harris to inherit some of the blame or credit for the current economy, but so far in the polls, I would say there has been a surprising willingness of voters to not extend the blame for inflation that they had for Joe Biden onto Kamala Harris,” said Grossmann, the Michigan State University professor.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Housing anxiety</h4>

	
<p>Housing costs have <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/featured-stories/rent-house-prices-and-demographics" target="_blank">outstripped</a> income gains in the past two decades, but those challenges have intensified since the COVID-19 pandemic, when demand increased, construction costs soared and interest rates spiked.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter if you’re a buyer or a renter,” said Molly Boesel, an economist at CoreLogic, a financial services information company. “You’re seeing your housing costs increase.”</p>
<p>Affordability is “the No. 1 issue” among voters in Nevada this year, said Mario Arias, the Nevada director of the Forward Party, a centrist political party founded by former Democratic presidential hopeful Andrew Yang.</p>
<p>A resident of the Las Vegas area, 30-year-old Arias said housing is his biggest financial concern. Throngs of Californians have moved into Nevada to lower their housing costs, but it’s driven up costs for everyone else, he said.</p>
<p>“If you want to get out of being a renter, you have to be in not just a good financial situation, but in a very stable financial situation,” he said.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve cut interest rates last week for the first time in four years, which could open the housing market to more homebuyers as mortgage rates ease in the coming months.</p>
<p>The Biden administration has <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/uncategorized/a-look-at-how-federal-plans-could-make-the-costs-of-housing-more-affordable/" target="_blank">proposed</a> several housing-related policies, including incentives to loosen zoning regulations and capping rent increases from corporate landlords. Harris has announced a proposal to provide up to $25,000 in housing assistance for a down payment to some potential first-time homeowners and promised tax incentives that she say’s would lead to 3 million more housing units by the end of her first term, if she’s elected.</p>
<p>Trump has not waded far into the details of how he would address the affordability issue in a second term. He has <a href="https://www.wsj.com/real-estate/trump-says-he-would-ban-mortgages-for-undocumented-immigrants-3dbbbb94" target="_blank">said</a> he plans to bring down prices by barring immigrants in the country without legal authorization from getting mortgages. But his proposed <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/06/business/undocumented-immigrants-trump-mortgage-ban/index.html" target="_blank">immigration policies</a> could further reduce the labor force for building homes. Previously, Trump’s administration talked about trying to cut state and local housing regulations, and it suspended federal regulations on fair housing.</p>
<p>In North Carolina, more than a quarter of the state’s households are cost burdened, meaning they spend more than 30% of their income on housing costs. It’s particularly challenging for renters, nearly half of which are cost burdened, according to the North Carolina Housing Coalition, a nonprofit affordable housing organization.</p>
<p>Stephanie Watkins-Cruz, housing policy director at the coalition, noted that the federal government’s calculation of fair market rent in North Carolina has shot up 14% in just one year — and 38% over the past five years.</p>
<p>“So unless everybody and their mama’s getting 14 to 20 to 38% raises, the math begins to not math,” she said.</p>
<p>It’s a familiar challenge in every swing state.</p>
<p>Wendy Winston, a middle school math teacher in Grand Rapids Michigan, said that though no one political candidate is responsible for the state of the economy, the cost of groceries and housing is hard to ignore.</p>
<p>“I don’t think the economy is terrible. It is sometimes difficult to make ends meet,” Winston said. “I don’t believe that it’s the fault of the government or policies of the government. I feel like it’s the individual corporations trying to make profit off the backs of the middle class.”</p>
<p>The average rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Grand Rapids is about $1,550 a month, according to rental site Apartments.com. Though Michigan ranks fairly average compared with other states for rent prices, the state saw some of the steepest rent increases in the country in recent years, and wages have not kept up. Residents unable to rent new, “luxury” apartments find themselves short of options for places they can afford.</p>
<p>“It’s not just cost, it’s availability,” Winston said. “There are a lot of new housing developments. Apartments and condos and things are being built, but I’m priced out of them. And I have a college degree, so I don’t think that’s helping our families.”</p>
<figure id="attachment_40176" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="max-width:100%;width:1024px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=40176" rel="attachment wp-att-40176"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-40176 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/swing-state-economy-furniture.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/swing-state-economy-furniture.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/swing-state-economy-furniture-300x225.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/swing-state-economy-furniture-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Melanie Davis, the co-owner of Davis Furniture Company in Rocky Mount, N.C., says business has been good lately, though she believes customers are anxious about the presidential election.

    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Hoping for revival</h4>

	
<p>Back in North Carolina, near the banks of the Tar River, Rocky Mount Mills has a healthy waiting list for the apartments and the revamped homes it rents.</p>
<p>A former cotton mill <a href="https://www.dncr.nc.gov/blog/2023/12/12/rocky-mount-mills-e-7" target="_blank">built and once operated</a> by slave labor, the campus closed in 1996, reopened in 2015 after a $75 million renovation, and is now home to breweries, restaurants and dozens of high-end apartments.</p>
<p>Chapel Hill native and entrepreneur Cameron Schulz never had Rocky Mount on his radar. But the development’s brewery incubator helped him launch HopFly Brewing Co., now one of the state’s largest self-distributing breweries.</p>
<p>After outgrowing its original space, HopFly relocated to Charlotte, but still operates a taproom in Rocky Mount. The Mills project has reinvigorated the city, Schulz said.</p>
<p>“Rocky Mount’s got one of the most beautiful, quintessential downtown strips that I’ve ever seen anywhere,” he said. “We’ve just got to fill it up with cool places to go, and people to go into those places.”</p>
<p>Main Street suffered for decades after the arrival of malls and a highway bypass. Over at Davis Furniture Company, two employees keep watch over an empty storeroom of sofas, beds and home decor.</p>
<p>Co-owner Melanie Davis said business has been good, though she believes customers are anxious about the presidential election.<strong> </strong>Pointing down the sidewalk to new restaurants and some loft apartments overlooking the railroad tracks, Davis said she’s bullish on the trajectory of downtown.</p>
<p>“I do feel like we’re on an upswing,” she said.</p>

(Photo by Jim Vondruska/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris said Tuesday during a radio interview that she supports changing a Senate procedure in order to codify the right to an abortion.</p>
<p>Vice President Harris said she is in favor of ending the 60-vote threshold in the Senate, known as the filibuster, to advance abortion rights legislation. But that task would hinge on Democrats agreeing to do so and holding on to majority control in the Senate, a difficult feat this November as <a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2024/09/23/racing-toward-election-day-control-of-u-s-senate-and-house-up-for-grabs/" target="_blank">Republicans appear potentially poised to take back the upper chamber. </a></p>
<p>“I think we should eliminate the filibuster for Roe, and get us to the point where 51 votes would be what we need to actually put back in law the protections for reproductive freedom and for the ability of every person and every woman to make decisions about their own body and not have their government tell them what to do,” she said during an interview with Wisconsin Public Radio.</p>
<p>Harris in 2022 said she would <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/09/10/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-at-the-2022-democratic-national-committee-summer-meeting/" target="_blank">cast a tie-breaking vote</a> in favor of abortion rights in her role as vice president. She has often pledged to sign into law a codification of Roe v. Wade, the constitutional right to an abortion struck down by the conservative U.S. Supreme Court in 2022.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said in August that Democrats would talk about rules changes to codify abortion rights, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/chuck-schumer-outlines-2025-agenda-democrats-sweep-eying-filibuster-ch-rcna167433" target="_blank">NBC reported.</a></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump in Pennsylvania</h4>

	
<p><a href="https://penncapital-star.com/election-2024/trump-talks-agriculture-and-china-in-smithton-ahead-of-rally-at-iup/" target="_blank">At a Monday rally in Pennsylvania</a>, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump referred to himself as a “protector” of women. Trump said women no longer needed to think about abortion and it is “now where it always had to be, with the states.”</p>
<p>“All they want to do is talk about abortion,” the former president said at the rally, referring to Democrats. “It really no longer pertains because we’ve done something on abortion that no one thought was possible.”</p>
<p>Trump has called for Senate Republicans to dismantle the filibuster, but GOP Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and other Republican leaders like No. 2 Sen. John Thune of South Dakota have vowed to keep the procedure in place.</p>
<p>Current Senate projections indicate Republicans are likely to gain control of the Senate. Republicans are also expected to pick up a seat in West Virginia, and only need to hold on to seats in Florida, Texas and Nebraska.</p>
<p>Democrats will need to secure wins in Arizona, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Additionally, Senate Democrats would need to break a possible 50-50 tie through a Democratic presidency — if they want to remain the majority party and change the filibuster.</p>
<p>If Harris wins, and Democrats hold 50 seats in the Senate, then Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, the vice presidential nominee, would be the tie-breaking vote.</p>
<p>During a Tuesday Senate press conference on abortion, Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington said she was supportive of Harris’ stance and that it would be a carve-out of the filibuster, rather than an elimination of it.</p>
<p>“What we are talking about is a simple procedure to allow, whenever rights are taken away from someone, that the U.S. Senate can, without being blocked by a filibuster, be able to restore those rights,” she said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Harris, Trump and the economy</h4>

	
<p>The Harris campaign hosted a Tuesday press call with business owner and  “Shark Tank” investor Mark Cuban, to advocate for Harris’ economic policies.</p>
<p>Polls have found that voters view Trump as better for the economy. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/09/09/in-tied-presidential-race-harris-and-trump-have-contrasting-strengths-weaknesses/" target="_blank">Pew Research</a> found that Trump’s key advantage is the economy, with 55% of voters viewing the former president as making good economic decisions, and 45% of voters viewing Harris as making good decisions about the economy.</p>
<p>“In a nutshell, the vice president and her team thinks through her policies,” Cuban said. “She doesn’t just off the top of her head say what she thinks the crowd wants to hear, like the Republican nominee.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Battleground states still the favorite spot</h4>

	
<p>The candidates will continue to campaign and travel, especially around battleground states this week.</p>

<p>GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. — Some voters are already casting early ballots in the first presidential election since the global pandemic ended and former President Donald Trump refused to accept his defeat.</p>
<p>This year’s presidential election won’t be decided by a margin of millions of votes, but likely by thousands in the seven tightly contested states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p>

<p>How legislatures, courts and election boards <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/how-voting-laws-have-changed-battleground-states-2020" target="_blank">have reshaped</a> ballot access in those states in the past four years could make a difference. Some of those states, especially Michigan, cemented the temporary pandemic-era measures that allowed for more mail-in and early voting. But other battleground states have passed laws that may keep some registered voters from casting ballots.</p>
<p>Trump and his allies have continued to spread lies about the 2020 results, claiming without evidence that widespread voter fraud stole the election from him. That has spurred many Republican lawmakers in states such as Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina to reel back access to early and mail-in voting and add new identification requirements to vote. And in Pennsylvania, statewide appellate courts are toggling between rulings.</p>
<p>“The last four years have been a long, strange trip,” said Hannah Fried, co-founder and executive director of All Voting is Local, a multistate voting rights organization.</p>
<p>“Rollbacks were almost to an instance tied to the ‘big lie,’” she added, referring to Trump’s election conspiracy theories. “And there have been many, many positive reforms for voters in the last few years that have gone beyond what we saw in the COVID era.”</p>
<p>The volume of election-related legislation and <a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/cases/" target="_blank">court cases</a> that emerged over the past four years has been staggering.</p>
<p>Nationally, the Voting Rights Lab, a nonpartisan group that researches election law changes, <a href="https://tracker.votingrightslab.org/pending/search" target="_blank">tracked 6,450 bills</a> across the country that were introduced since 2021 that sought to alter the voting process. Hundreds of those bills were enacted.</p>
<p>Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, cautioned that incremental tweaks to election law — especially last-minute changes made by the courts — not only confuse voters, but also put a strain on local election officials who must comply with changes to statute as they prepare for another highly scrutinized voting process.</p>
<p>“Any voter that is affected unnecessarily is too many in my book,” he said.</p>

    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">New restrictions</h4>

	
<p>In many ways, the 2020 presidential election is still being litigated four years later.</p>
<p>Swing states have been the focus of legal challenges and new laws spun from a false narrative that questioned election integrity. The 2021 state legislative sessions, many begun in the days following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, brought myriad legislative changes that have made it more difficult to vote and altered how ballots are counted and rejected.</p>
<p>The highest-profile measure over the past four years came out of Georgia.</p>
<p>Under a 2021 law, Georgia residents now have less time to ask for mail-in ballots and must put their driver’s license or state ID information on those requests. The number of drop boxes has been limited. And neither election officials nor nonprofits may send unsolicited mail-in ballot applications to voters.</p>
<p>Republican Gov. Brian Kemp said when signing the measure that it would ensure free and fair elections in the state, but voting rights groups lambasted the law as voter suppression.</p>
<p>That law also gave Georgia’s State Election Board more authority to interfere in the makeup of local election boards. The state board <a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2024/08/19/georgia-election-boards-right-wing-oks-rule-to-give-local-officials-power-to-delay-certification/?emci=808603a7-e55e-ef11-991a-6045bddbfc4b&amp;emdi=d0eb7f95-fa5e-ef11-991a-6045bddbfc4b&amp;ceid=32621" target="_blank">has made recent headlines</a> for paving the way for counties to potentially refuse to certify the upcoming election. This comes on top of <a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2024/07/08/groups-readying-mass-voter-challenges-in-georgias-2024-elections-theres-an-app-for-that/" target="_blank">a wave</a> of voter registration challenges from conservative activists.<i></i></p>

(Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder)</p></figure>
<p>In North Carolina, the Republican-led legislature last year <a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2023/10/11/overriding-gov-coopers-vetoes-the-nc-legislature-makes-it-harder-to-vote-easier-to-pollute/" target="_blank">overrode</a> Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper’s veto to enact measures that shortened the time to turn in mail-in ballots; required local election officials to reject ballots if voters who register to vote on Election Day do not later verify their home address; and required identification to vote by mail.</p>
<p>This will also be the first general election that North Carolinians will have to comply with a 2018 voter ID measure that was caught up in the court system until the state Supreme Court <a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2023/04/28/breaking-nc-supreme-court-sides-with-gop-lawmakers-on-elections-and-voting/" target="_blank">reinstated</a> the law last year.</p>
<p>And in Arizona, the Republican-led legislature pushed through<a> </a><a href="https://legiscan.com/AZ/bill/SB1003/2021" target="_blank">a measure</a> that shortened the time voters have to correct missing or mismatched signatures on their absentee ballot envelopes. Then-Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, signed the measure.</p>
<p>“Look, sometimes the complexity is the point,” said Fried, of All Voting is Local. “If you are passing a law that makes it this complicated for somebody to vote or to register to vote, what’s your endgame here? What are you trying to do?”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Laws avoided major overhauls</h4>

	
<p>But the restrictions could have gone much further.</p>
<p>That’s partly because Democratic governors, such as Arizona’s Katie Hobbs, who took office in 2023, <a href="https://azmirror.com/briefs/katie-hobbs-vetoed-a-trio-of-republican-election-bills/" target="_blank">have vetoed</a> many of the Republican-backed bills. But it’s also because of how popular early voting methods have become.</p>
<p>Arizonans, for example, have been able to vote by mail for more than three decades. More than 75% of Arizonan voters <a href="https://azmirror.com/2024/03/01/more-than-75-of-voters-use-early-ballots-every-az-house-republican-voted-to-take-that-away/" target="_blank">requested</a> mail-in ballots in 2022, and 90% of voters in 2020 cast their ballots by mail.</p>
<p>This year, <a href="https://legiscan.com/AZ/bill/HB2876/2024" target="_blank">a bill</a> that would have scrapped no-excuse absentee voting passed the state House but failed to clear a Republican-controlled Senate committee.</p>
<p>Bridget Augustine, a high school English teacher in Glendale, Arizona, and a registered independent, has been a consistent early voter since 2020. She said the first time she voted in Arizona was by absentee ballot while she was a college student in New Jersey, and she has no concerns “whatsoever” about the safety of early voting in Arizona.</p>
<p>“I just feel like so much of this rhetoric was drummed up as a way to make it easier to lie about the election and undermine people’s confidence,” she said.</p>
<p>Vanessa Jiminez, the security manager for a Phoenix high school district, a registered independent and an early voter, said she is confident in the safety of her ballot.</p>
<p>“I track my ballot every step of the way,” she said.</p>
<p>Ben Ginsberg, a longtime Republican election lawyer and Volker Distinguished Visiting Fellow at the think tank Hoover Institution, said that while these laws may add new hurdles, he doesn’t expect them to change vote totals.</p>
<p>“The bottom line is I don’t think that the final result in any election is going to be impacted by a law that’s been passed,” he said on a recent call with reporters organized by the Knight Foundation, a Miami-based nonprofit that provides grants to support democracy and journalism.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Major expansions</h4>

	
<p>No state has seen a bigger expansion to ballot access over the past four years than Michigan.</p>
<p>Republicans tried to curtail access to absentee voting, <a href="https://michiganadvance.com/2021/03/31/here-are-the-voting-restriction-bills-introduced-in-michigan-this-year/" target="_blank">introducing 39 bills</a> in 2021, when the party still was in charge of both legislative chambers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.legislature.mi.gov/Bills/Bill?ObjectName=2021-SB-0303" target="_blank">Two</a> GOP <a href="https://www.legislature.mi.gov/Bills/Bill?ObjectName=2021-SB-0304" target="_blank">bills</a> passed, but Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer vetoed them.</p>
<p>The next year, Michigan voters approved ballot measures that added nine days of early voting. The measures also allowed voters to request mail-in ballots online; created a permanent vote-by-mail list; provided prepaid postage on absentee ballot applications and ballots; increased ballot drop boxes; and allowed voters to correct missing or mismatched signatures on mail-in ballot envelopes.<i></i></p>
<p>“When you take it to the people and actually ask them about it, it turns out most people want more voting access,” said Melinda Billingsley, communications manager for Voters Not Politicians, a Lansing, Michigan-based voting rights advocacy group.</p>
<p>“The ballot access expansions happened in spite of an anti-democratic, Republican-led push to restrict ballot access,” she said.</p>
<p>In 2021, then-Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, a Democrat, <a href="https://nevadacurrent.com/briefs/as-other-states-restrict-voting-access-nevada-expands-it/" target="_blank">signed into law</a> a measure that transitioned the state into a universal vote-by-mail system. Every registered voter would be sent a ballot in the mail before an election, unless they opt out. The bill made permanent a temporary expansion of mail-in voting that the state put in place during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Nevada voters <a href="https://nevadacurrent.com/2024/06/10/preference-for-mail-ballots-high-nevada-early-voter-turnout-data-show/" target="_blank">have embraced</a> the system, data shows.</p>
<p>In February’s presidential preference primary, 78% of ballots cast were ballots by mail or in a ballot drop box, according to the Nevada secretary of state’s office. In June’s nonpresidential primary, 65% of ballots were mail-in ballots. And in the 2022 general election, 51% of ballots cast were mail ballots.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Last-minute court decisions</h4>

	
<p>Drop boxes weren’t controversial in Wisconsin until Trump became fixated on them as an avenue for alleged voter fraud, said Jeff Mandell, general counsel and co-founder of Law Forward, a Madison-based nonprofit legal organization.</p>
<p>For half of a century, Wisconsinites could return their absentee ballots in the same drop boxes that counties and municipalities used for water bills and property taxes, he said. But when the pandemic hit and local election officials expected higher volumes of absentee ballots, they installed larger boxes.</p>
<p>After Trump lost the state by fewer than 21,000 votes in 2020, drop boxes became a flashpoint. Republican leaders claimed drop boxes were not secure, and that nefarious people could tamper with the ballots. In 2022, the Wisconsin Supreme Court, then led by a conservative majority, <a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2022/07/08/wisconsin-supreme-court-declares-absentee-ballot-drop-boxes-are-illegal/" target="_blank">banned</a> drop boxes.</p>
<p>But that ruling would only last two years. In July, the new liberal majority in the state’s high court <a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2024/07/05/ballot-drop-boxes-now-allowed-in-wisconsin-after-state-supreme-court-reverses-2022-decision/" target="_blank">reversed the ruling</a> and said localities could determine whether to use drop boxes. It was a victory for voters, Mandell said.</p>
<p>With U.S. Postal Service delays stemming from the agency’s restructuring, drop boxes provide a faster method of returning a ballot without having to worry about it showing up late, he said. Ballots must get in by 8 p.m. on Election Day. The boxes are especially convenient for rural voters, who may have a clerk’s office or post office with shorter hours, he added.</p>
<p>“Every way that you make it easy for people to vote safely and securely is good,” Mandell said.</p>
<p>After the high court’s ruling, local officials had to make a swift decision about whether to reinstall drop boxes.</p>

<p>Milwaukee city employees were quickly dispatched throughout the city to remove the leather bags that covered the drop boxes for two years, cleaned them all and repaired several, said Paulina Gutierrez, executive director of the City of Milwaukee Election Commission.</p>
<p>“There’s an all-hands-on-deck mentality here at the city,” she said, adding that there are cameras pointed at each drop box.</p>
<p>Although it used a drop box in 2020, Marinette, a community on the western shore of Green Bay, opted not to use them for the August primary and asked voters to hand the ballots to clerk staff. Lana Bero, the city clerk, said the city may revisit that decision before November.</p>
<p>New Berlin Clerk Rubina Medina said her community, a city of about 40,000 on the outskirts of Milwaukee, had some security concerns about potentially tampering or destruction of ballots within drop boxes, and therefore decided not to use the boxes this year.</p>
<p>Dane County Clerk Scott McDonell, who serves the state capital of Madison and its surrounding area, has been encouraging local clerks in his county to have a camera on their drop boxes and save the videos in case residents have fraud concerns.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A risk of confusing voters</h4>

	
<p>Many local election officials in Wisconsin say they worry that court decisions, made mere months before the November election, could create <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/ap-norcusafacts-poll-republicans-trust-trump-official-election-113540763" target="_blank">confusion</a> for voters and more work for clerks.</p>
<p>“These decisions are last-second, over and over again,” McDonell said. “You’re killing us when you do that.”</p>
<p>Arizonans and Pennsylvanians now know that late-in-the-game scramble too.</p>
<p>In August, the U.S. Supreme Court <a href="https://azmirror.com/2024/08/22/scotus-arizona-may-require-proof-of-citizenship-on-state-voter-forms-at-least-for-now/" target="_blank">reinstated</a> part of a 2022 Arizona law that requires documented proof of citizenship to register on state forms, potentially <a href="https://www.votebeat.org/arizona/2023/12/18/arizona-federal-only-voters-concentrated-college-campuses-proof-of-citizenship/" target="_blank">impacting</a> tens of thousands of voters, disproportionately affecting young and <a href="https://azmirror.com/2024/08/30/scotus-ruling-on-citizenship-proof-for-new-voters-has-an-outsized-impact-in-indian-country/" target="_blank">Native</a> voters.</p>
<p>Whether Pennsylvania election officials should count mail ballots returned with errors has been a subject of litigation in every election since 2020. State courts continue to <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/election-2024/pennsylvania-supreme-court-mail-in-ballots-with-missing-or-incorrect-dates-wont-be-counted/" target="_blank">grapple</a> with the question, and neither voting rights groups nor national Republicans show signs of giving up.</p>
<p>Former Pennsylvania Secretary of the Commonwealth Kathy Boockvar, who is now president of Athena Strategies and working on voting rights and election security issues across the country, said voters simply need to ignore the noise of litigation and closely follow the instructions with their mail ballots.</p>
<p>“Litigation is confusing,” Boockvar said. “The legislature won’t fix it by legislation. Voter education is the key thing here, and the instructions on the envelopes need to be as clear and simple as possible.”</p>
<p>To avoid confusion, voters can make a plan for how and when they will vote by going to <a href="https://vote.gov/" target="_blank">vote.gov</a>, a federally run site where voters can check to make sure they are properly registered and to answer questions in more than a dozen languages about methods for casting a ballot.</p>

	[/subhed]
<p dir="ltr">Richard Keech is deputy director of elections for Loudoun County, where 224,862 <a href="https://historical.elections.virginia.gov/elections/view/144567/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://historical.elections.virginia.gov/elections/view/144567/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1727200847642000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1eUAeX-9172P0ESKRZSMN0">votes </a>were cast for president in the 2020 November election, according to state election results. Keech has worked in elections for 16 years and been in his current position since March 2011, he stated.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Two Loudoun voters previously took claims of election fraud to <a href="https://www.loudountimes.com/news/government/trump-supporters-file-suit-claiming-loudoun-uses-illegally-certified-electronic-voting-machines/article_82fa846c-5af2-11ed-beba-5bfaf62d1b30.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.loudountimes.com/news/government/trump-supporters-file-suit-claiming-loudoun-uses-illegally-certified-electronic-voting-machines/article_82fa846c-5af2-11ed-beba-5bfaf62d1b30.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1727200847642000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0h7sHgaLCd9r1ius4MrUZa">court</a>, but the lawsuit was dismissed. The allegations were that the voting machines were not certified and not secure. There was no evidence to substantiate the claims, according to Keech.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A lack of voter knowledge about how elections operate has caused anxiety and fear in the general population, according to Keech.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“There comes a point where we have to tell our story,” Keech said. “We have to tell the truth. We have to be transparent. We have to be up front about what we’re doing to provide safe, secure and efficient elections.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Loudoun officials worked to combat this dynamic and make voters feel confident. Election officials shared more behind the scenes videos, and hosted walk-throughs of their office for the public, according to Loudoun communications manager Samantha Shepherd.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Repeat election volunteers can get specialized training in courses such as technology, help desk training and advance precinct management, according to Keech.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The lack of education around how elections occur is mind boggling to me,” Keech said. “There’s this vision that it’s all occurring on the internet and all these various actors are involved, and the reality is that it’s your friends and your neighbors [who volunteer].”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Citizens are encouraged to ask questions and look at their locality’s website for more information, Keech said.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">CITY OF RICHMOND</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Keith Balmer is the general registrar of the City of Richmond, where 111,159 votes were cast for president in the 2020 November election. Virginia has an election every year, so officials are experienced with the procedures, he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The way we prepare for this election is really no different than any of the elections,” said Balmer, who has 14 years of experience in this field and three years serving as general registrar.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Preparation includes testing, hiring and training &#8212; and more testing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We test a lot of ballots,” Balmer said. “We are talking hundreds, and this election we&#8217;re talking thousands of test ballots to get tested into our machines.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">A test election is run with filled-out ballots to certify the machine is counting correctly, Balmer said. This process occurs for every election.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Any citizens concerned about the validity of the electoral process should volunteer, so they can get a front row seat of the process, Balmer said. Possible positions include pollbook officer, ballot officer and overseeing the voting equipment and booths.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“You get to see there&#8217;s so many checks and balances here in place, that you&#8217;re going to walk away convinced that there&#8217;s zero fraud going on around here,” Balmer said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The city will need about 1,200 officers, or about 15 per precinct, according to Balmer. Staffing is important to help avoid long lines and ensure a smooth process, he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Getting poll workers has always been challenging because of the long 16 to 18-hour shifts, Balmer said. He pushed for a stipend increase for volunteers, from $120 to $200.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Election officials are focused on the process, not the results, Balmer said. The doubt cast toward election officials in recent years has been “deeply hurtful” and caused people to leave.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">YORK COUNTY</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Walter Latham is the general registrar of York County, where 38,787 votes were cast for president in the 2020 November election.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Voters have questioned the electoral process since at least 2000, according to Latham. That election, between candidates George W. Bush and Al Gore, resulted in a Florida vote recount that ultimately went to the U.S. Supreme Court. Latham does think maybe it became “more intense after 2020.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It’s a public process, the elections belong to the people of the country,” Latham said. “They have a right to have questions and they have a right to have them answered.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Candidate certification deadlines could be set earlier to allow for more time to proof, print and test ballots, he said. The state <a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/media/candidatesandpacs/2024-president-candidate-and-party-docs/2023-11-05-Presidential-Independent-and-Third-Party-Candidates-Bulletin_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.elections.virginia.gov/media/candidatesandpacs/2024-president-candidate-and-party-docs/2023-11-05-Presidential-Independent-and-Third-Party-Candidates-Bulletin_FINAL.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1727200847642000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3ReLts-I_FjhlObHVM18k1">deadline </a>for changes for third-party presidential candidates was Sept. 6, two weeks before early voting began.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Standard election preparation includes proofing ballots to ensure all candidate names are spelled correctly and in the correct order, per the Virginia Board of Elections, according to Latham. Then machines are programmed and tested for accuracy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Election officer training is state mandated, with training held in person no more than 30 days before the election and no less than three, according to Latham.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Latham said they are “blessed” to have a good number of volunteers for Election Day, many who are returning to the role.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We try to rely on the ones we have because we appreciate their knowledge and skill and dedication,” Latham said. “Because they work a long day for not a lot of money.”</p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With early voting now underway in Virginia, former President Donald Trump appears to have warmed up to the practice of sending out mail-in ballots to voters for the November general election — a position contrary to his many deprecatory comments regarding mail-in voting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In this election we must use every appropriate tool to beat the radical left Democrats, that’s why I am urging every Virginia patriot to vote early, and don’t wait,” Trump said during a telephone rally hosted by Gov. Glenn Youngkin Sunday evening. “You’ve heard a lot about voting by mail, but that’s what we have right now.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the 15-minute call, Trump asked Republican voters to cast their ballots “either by mail, early in person or on election day.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have long term voting, we used to have one day, paper ballots, all the things that you know we want to do, but you’re in the first group and I am asking you to get your friends, get your family, get everyone you know and make a plan to vote for Trump,” the GOP’s presidential nominee said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is one of just three states — the other two being Minnesota and South Dakota — where early voting started on Friday, 45 days before the Nov. 5 election. At least 59,686 Virginians have since cast their ballots as of Sunday evening, according </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/elections/early-voting/#2024" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Virginia Public Access Project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With just 895 returned ballots, mail-in voting marked just a fraction of the total number of votes cast by that time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump has consistently spoken against mail-in voting on the campaign trail while spouting conspiracy theories and falsely claiming that the 2020 presidential election that he lost to Democrat Joe Biden by more than 7 million votes had been stolen from him. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mail-in voting is totally corrupt. Get that through your head. It has to be,&#8221; </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2024/06/29/trump-attack-vote-by-mail-election-ad/74218068007/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at a rally in Michigan in February. And during an </span><a href="https://www.gbnews.com/politics/us/donald-trump-interview-nigel-farage-in-full-watch" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">interview with the British GB News</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in March, he asserted that “anytime the mail is involved, you’re going to have cheating.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump’s cautious embrace of early and mail-in voting aligns with the GOP’s slow acceptance of a practice that has expanded the tent of voters nationwide in recent years and proven to be beneficial for increasing turnout on both sides of the aisle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Both campaigns are really talking about the election in apocalyptic terms, and this is really motivating voters,” said Stephen Farnsworth, a political science professor at the University of Mary Washington. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Early voting absolutely works for campaigns; you don&#8217;t have to worry about getting voters to the polls on election day. If the ballot is locked in at election time, it gets a lot easier, and election officials can focus on voters who haven’t made it to the polls,” Farnsworth said</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During Sunday’s telephone rally, Trump rattled off a list of different ways for Virginians to cast their ballots early.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every county in Virginia has at least one early voting location, so that’s important to know. Most counties have early voting Monday through Friday. Any registered Virginia voter can get out and vote as early as possible, you can vote tomorrow,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump said that he could be the first Republican presidential candidate to carry Virginia since President George W. Bush won his reelection bid in 2004. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Because if we are really going at it, we have a really good chance to win Virginia, there hasn’t been one in decades by a presidential candidate,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump still faces an uphill battle in the commonwealth, where he trails Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, by 10 percentage points, according to a </span><a href="https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/2024-election-state-polls" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morning Consult poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conducted between Aug. 30 and Sept. 8.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a </span><a href="https://www.umw.edu/news/2024/09/20/new-survey-from-umw-center-for-leadership-and-media-studies-takes-closer-look-at-presidential-election-in-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more recent survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the University of Mary Washington released last week found that the race has since tightened, with Harris leading Trump with just 48 to 46% in a two-way contest, within the poll’s margin of error.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Democrats, however, pushed back against the narrative that the presidential race in the commonwealth was competitive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While Trump is literally phoning it in here in Virginia, Team Harris-Walz and Virginia Democrats are turning unmatched enthusiasm into action, highlighting the stark contrast between Vice President Harris’ new way forward and Trump’s extreme Project 2025 agenda that would give him unchecked control over our daily lives,” said Virginia Democratic Party chair Susan Swecker. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris has yet to campaign in the commonwealth as the Democratic presidential nominee. Her husband, Douglas Emhoff, is set to visit Charlottesville on Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also on Sunday’s call, Youngkin reiterated that elections in Virginia are safe and that voters can trust the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have paper ballots, we have counting machines, not voting machines, lock boxes are under 24-7 security, and we have a great process to make sure that the ballots are not only kept but custody is clear. And finally, non-citizens will be prosecuted if they vote,” he said.</span></p>

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)</p><p><strong><em>Editor’s note: </em></strong><em>This five-day series explores the priorities of voters in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin as they consider the upcoming presidential election. With the outcome expected to be close, these “swing states” may decide the future of the country.</em></p>
<p>It’s been a wild few months in the presidential race: President Joe Biden dropped out and Vice President Kamala Harris captured the Democratic nomination. Former President Donald Trump survived an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania and was targeted again at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida.</p>
<p>Despite the historic lead-up to Election Day, the race has now settled into familiar territory: Much like 2020’s contest, top political strategists on both sides of the aisle expect control of the White House could come down to just a few thousand votes in a handful of battleground states.</p>
<p>“This is not going to be an election where you will see a landslide. It’s going to be won in the margins in six to seven swing states,” Democratic strategist Donna Brazile told a crowd of state lawmakers from across the country last month.</p>
<p>Brazile, who ran Al Gore’s 2000 presidential campaign, shared the stage with Republican strategist Kellyanne Conway, who managed Trump’s 2016 campaign and advised him in the White House.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the pair disagreed on much.</p>
<p>But while speaking at the National Conference of State Legislatures in Kentucky, the two senior strategists framed the race similarly to the 2020 contest, when <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/11/25/937248659/president-elect-biden-hits-80-million-votes-in-year-of-record-turnout" target="_blank">fewer than 50,000 votes</a> in Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin separated Biden and Trump from an Electoral College tie.</p>
<p>“It is a different race. It has turned in very short time, but the issue set hasn’t changed at all,” Conway said. “And I think that’s what’s important here.”</p>
<p>Like last cycle, the two campaigns are pouring millions into Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p>
<p>In “The Deciders” series, States Newsroom, the nation’s largest state-focused nonprofit news organization, explores the political issues and groups of voters that could make the difference in those seven states and, consequentially, in the race for the White House.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, economic issues <sub>—</sub> namely, stubbornly high prices — are proving central for many voters across the swing states. But voters also are concerned about immigration, abortion access and the future of the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>In states such as Michigan and Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, labor unions could prove instrumental for Harris after years of significant gains by organized labor.</p>
<p>In Georgia and North Carolina, Black voter turnout could make the difference, while Latino voters are closely divided in Nevada after helping propel Biden to victory there four years ago. In every swing state, campaigns are focused on all-important suburban voters.</p>
<p>The election’s outcome also could be shaped by the work of officials who have been debating who can vote and which votes should count since the mayhem of the last presidential contest.</p>
<p>Four years ago, a false narrative that questioned the security and integrity of elections took hold in some legislatures. New laws changed ballot-counting practices and made it more difficult to vote in many states, including swing states. In states such as Michigan and Wisconsin, there is broad concern that despite the checks and balances built into the voting system, local Republicans tasked with certifying elections will be driven by conspiracy theories and refuse to fulfill their duties if Trump loses again.</p>
<p>Fears that these efforts could sow chaos and delay results is not unfounded: Over the past four years, county officials in the swing states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada and Pennsylvania have refused to certify certain local elections.</p>
<p>With such a close race, voter turnout and motivation will be key in all the battleground states.</p>
<p>As in other swing states, North Carolina’s 16 Electoral College votes could hinge on how political independents vote, said Carter Wrenn, a longtime Republican strategist who has worked on many campaigns.</p>
<p>And those independents can be unpredictable in North Carolina: Their votes helped both Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper and Trump carry the state in the last two general elections.</p>
<p>“It’s the independents that are up for grabs, and they don’t mind splitting a ticket at all,” Wrenn said. “Ultimately, in the general election, that’s the key group.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The economy</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In every state this year, the economy is a central issue.</p>
<p>As Trump tries to fault Harris and Biden for the high costs of everyday living, polling shows voters blame Harris less for the situation than they did Biden — though likely voters profess more confidence in Trump’s ability to manage the economy.</p>
<p>For her part, Harris has unveiled plans to <a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2024/08/16/harris-unveils-plan-to-curb-price-gouging-boost-child-tax-credit-tackle-rent-hikes/" target="_blank">lower prices of rent, homebuying and groceries, </a>arguing she will remain focused on the middle class from Day One, contrasting her ideas with what she characterizes as Trump’s catering to billionaires.</p>
<p>In Georgia, Republicans and Democrats alike have found success in recent statewide campaigns by highlighting similar kitchen table issues. After attending a Harris rally in Savannah last month, Georgia voter Sarah Damato said she doesn’t believe Trump will fight for the middle class.</p>
<p>At the event, the vice president told listeners she would lower costs by fighting corporate price-fixing and touted her proposal for a “care economy,” a set of progressive proposals including benefits for parents of newborns and credits for first-time homebuyers.</p>
<p>“Kamala Harris made it very evident today that the American family is the most important thing on her mind these days, and she’s going to make it easier for each one of us to have a brighter future,” Damato said.</p>
<p>In Kenosha, Wisconsin, meanwhile, Republican Party volunteer Sharon Buege said she supports the GOP ticket because she sees the race as a matter of “good versus evil.” Speaking outside a news conference by Trump running mate J.D. Vance, Buege said she opposed “the whole left agenda,” adding that her top issues in the race were border security, the economy, human trafficking, homelessness and “indoctrination” in public schools.</p>
<p>At that same news conference, a man who would only give his name as “John” said the economy and inflation mattered most: “I don’t need a reminder of why to support Trump. I can get that every time I go to the gas station or grocery store.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Groups of voters</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>With Republicans looking to run up margins in rural parts of the battleground states and Democrats banking on big leads in cities, the suburbs remain pivotal.</p>
<p>In Georgia, diverse and growing suburbs have helped move the state from reliably red to purple.</p>
<p>In the state’s two largest suburban counties of Cobb and Gwinnett, Biden picked up more than 137,000 votes in 2020 over 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, according to data from the Georgia Secretary of State’s office. The same year, Trump boosted his total by just under 32,000 votes over his 2016 performance.</p>
<p>The Trump campaign boasts a mighty in-state operation: nearly 15,000 volunteers signing up between mid-July and the end of August, nearly 300 events scheduled for September, and 4,000 neighborhood organizers and canvassers — known as Trump Force Captains — joining the cause in July and August.</p>
<p>But Team Harris says they are running the largest Georgia operation of any Democratic presidential campaign cycle, with more than 200 campaign staff in 28 offices. Harris’ recent visit to the more conservative south side of the state marked her 16th trip to Georgia since becoming vice president and her seventh trip this year.</p>
<p>Harris is hoping to fire up the young, diverse Democratic base, but her team also is hoping she can hang onto or expand on Biden’s coalition of older, affluent, educated and largely white suburbanites.</p>
<p>“Those are the people who are actually kind of pivotal and who will modify or change their behavior,” said University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock.</p>
<p>“These people are largely Republicans, but they can’t bring themselves to vote for Donald Trump or for Republicans who are closely associated with him,” Bullock said.</p>
<p>Larry Ceisler, a Philadelphia public affairs executive and political analyst, said the four suburban Philadelphia counties surrounding Pennsylvania’s largest city are key to winning that state. Once a Republican bastion, the so-called collar counties of Bucks, Chester, Delaware and Montgomery have swung strongly in the other direction since 2016.</p>
<p>That complicates messaging for both campaigns, Ceisler said. Trump’s anti-abortion stance and Harris’ effort to back away from her earlier statements against fracking — both positions that appeal to rural and western Pennsylvania voters — are potential liabilities in suburbs.</p>
<p>Democrats have a 343,000-voter registration advantage over Republicans in Pennsylvania. But the state has been decided by narrow margins in the last two presidential elections.</p>
<p>Daniel Mallinson, an associate professor of public policy and administration at Penn State Harrisburg, noted that the Trump campaign has paid attention to Black and Latino voters.</p>
<p>“One of the weaknesses that Biden had as a candidate was he had weakening support among African American voters. And then Trump has actually done fairly well, particularly in some other states, like in Florida, with Latino voters,” Mallinson said, adding that Harris’ nomination changes the equation somewhat.</p>
<p>After Democrats seemingly all but wrote off Arizona for Biden, the contest there is proving more winnable for Harris. Biden narrowly won Arizona in 2020, but he had been hemorrhaging Latino support this year.</p>
<p>In the manufacturing-heavy upper Midwest, labor unions could prove consequential in not only persuading voters but also motivating them to the polls.</p>
<p>Biden was the first sitting president to visit a picket line when the United Auto Workers last year took on the “Big Three” Detroit automakers — Ford, General Motors and Stellantis — by going on strike. That effort led to significant increases in pay and benefits for workers.</p>
<p>The UAW, which in August announced <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/2024/08/14/uaw-kamala-harrris-campaign-money/74799278007/" target="_blank">a national campaign</a> to motivate its 1 million active and retired members to vote for Harris, says its membership accounted for 9.2% of Biden’s 2020 votes in Michigan alone.</p>
<p>“To me, this election is real simple,” UAW president Shawn Fain <a href="https://michiganadvance.com/2024/08/08/in-detroit-harris-and-walz-talk-about-the-midwest-the-middle-class-and-voters-in-the-middle/" target="_blank">told a crowd</a> of about 15,000 people last month at a rally in Detroit for Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. “It’s about one question. It’s a question we made famous in the labor movement: Which side are you on?”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Political weaknesses </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>While Democrats are more motivated than when Biden was the presumptive nominee, they still face internal conflicts, the most high-profile of which has been about the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.</p>
<p>Dee Sull, a Las Vegas attorney who works in immigration and family law, is a registered Democrat who said she would never vote for Trump. Yet she doesn’t really want to vote for Harris, leaving her “very torn” this election.</p>
<p>“I believe our foreign policy in Gaza is completely ridiculous. I’m very disturbed,” she said of U.S. military aid to Israel. “If we’re going to spend money, I want it spent on my kids here — on my neighbors’ kids here.”</p>
<p>Sull said both parties have silenced the voices of those who protest the death and destruction in Gaza. And she was irritated that Palestinian American activists were not allowed to speak at the Democratic National Convention last month.</p>
<p>Sull won’t sit out the election, but said she would prefer to vote for a third candidate with a viable shot at winning.</p>
<p>“Probably like a lot of Americans would if they had that opportunity,” she said.</p>
<p>For Trump, voters’ overwhelming support for abortion rights could prove a huge liability in swing states.</p>
<p>While Trump has wobbled in recent months on whether he would veto a national abortion ban, the Supreme Court justices he appointed dismantled abortion access across the country in 2022 — an unpopular position even in red states such as Kansas, Kentucky and Ohio that since have voted to expand abortion rights.</p>
<p>In Wisconsin, Planned Parenthood stopped offering abortions at its health clinics after the court’s Dobbs decision because of an 1849 “trigger” state law that immediately took effect. Wisconsin women lost all abortion services there for a year and a half, until a court re-interpreted the state law.</p>
<p>This summer’s shakeup has reset the race, said Amy Walter, publisher of The Cook Political Report, an independent, nonpartisan newsletter that analyzes elections. So far, likely voters in the swing states view Harris more favorably than Biden, she said. But with Trump benefiting from an electorate skeptical of the state of the economy, the newsletter characterized the race as “a battle of inches.”</p>
<p>The campaigns both face a lot of voters who are disenchanted with politics altogether, or else unhappy with their options.</p>
<p>Amy Tarkanian, a conservative television commentator who once lauded Trump to national audiences and was chair of the Nevada State Republican Party in 2011-12, said she’s at “a complete loss” this year. She remains a Republican, even after the state party heavily criticized her when, two years ago, she endorsed a pair of Democratic candidates for state offices.</p>
<p>“I’m not happy, or necessarily sold on Kamala,” Tarkanian said. “… But I absolutely do not want to vote for Donald Trump.”</p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce / For the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting Friday, voters across Virginia can begin casting their ballots in this year’s critical elections for the White House, a U.S. Senate seat, and  the state’s 11 congressional districts that will not only impact the future of the commonwealth but also help shape next year’s gubernatorial race. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An </span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/election-law/proposed-amendments-for-2024/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">amendment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the Constitution of Virginia and a variety of local offices are also on the ballot. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the Sep. 20 kick-off of the 45-day early voting period, Virginians have the option to vote in person until Nov. 2 at their local election offices or send absentee ballots by mail. This marks a turning point in campaign season, as both parties ramp up rallies and events to energize their bases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just south of Richmond, Gov. Glenn Youngkin will attend a rally at Chesterfield County Airport Saturday. He will be joined by U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Westmoreland, Bill Moher, the Republican nominee in Virginia’s 4th Congressional District, and Hung Cao, who is seeking to oust U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin in a statement Thursday encouraged “every Virginia citizen to make a plan and vote early” to ensure that each vote is counted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can trust that Virginia’s elections are secure with clean voter rolls, secure paper ballots, certified counting machines and well-trained election officials,” he said. </span></p>

Glenn Youngkin at an early voting rally in Henrico County in 2023. (Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later on Saturday, Youngkin will join Derrick Anderson, the Republican nominee in the 7th District, at an Early Voting Rally at the Professional Building Maintenance in Fredericksburg. The event is set to begin at 1:30 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former President Donald Trump has yet to return to the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/28/trump-rallies-in-chesapeake-backed-by-virginia-governor-gop-leaders/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">campaign trail in Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a state where he trails Vice President Kamala Harris, his Democratic opponent, by several percentage points </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/new-polling-finds-harris-ahead-of-trump-by-a-comfortable-margin-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to recent polling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Rally Virginia is hosting a Women’s Rally for the Republican presidential nominee at the Trump Winery in Charlottesville on Saturday. The event  starts at 2 p.m., featuring guest speaker U.S. Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-NY.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Team Trump Virginia has been working diligently to ensure an impressive  — and winning — performance in Virginia’s early vote. Across the commonwealth, we have been priming our voters to turn out in record numbers. Trump Force 47 will be mobilizing our supporters to vote,” said Jeff Ryer, a campaign spokesman. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While much of Southwest Virginia leans Republican, Democrats are firing up their bases there with some events, like an early voting kickoff event in Roanoke Friday to support Democratic candidates for city council and mayor, a canvassing kickoff on Saturday in Bristol with local elected officials, ad a Sunday gathering in Montgomery County with 9th District Democratic nominee Karen Baker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Urging citizens of the Southwest region of the state to take advantage of early voting, Bristol city councilor Neil Osborne said, “Don’t risk having something unexpected come up on Election Day.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine will jaunt around the state for various early voting events over the weekend to support Democratic congressional candidates in competitive races — such as Eugene Vindman in the 7th District, Suhas Subramanyam in the 10th and Missy Cotter Smasal in the 2nd — and to boost his own re-election campaign. </span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friday gatherings will also be hosted with Democratic challengers Leslie Mehta in Chesterfield County, who wants to unseat Wittman and 5th District candidate Gloria Witt. The 5th District election </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/16/amid-internal-gop-feud-in-the-5th-district-democrat-gloria-witt-sees-her-chance/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">could test the effect</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of GOP infighting over nominee John McGuire, a state senator from Goochland, and Rep. Bob Good, R-Farmville, whose supporters have mounted a write-in campaign after the incumbent lost his primary this summer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think we’ve already held over 1,000 events across the Commonwealth, but (there’s) more to come,” said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic Party of Virginia chairwoman Susan Swecker. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a big week with the kickoff for early voting.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On boosting awareness of the different campaigns and to encourage early voting, Swecker said that Democrats have opened 25 campaign offices around the state and hired 150 people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As election seasons become increasingly competitive, early voting has emerged as a vital part of the electoral process, and Virginia is no exception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early voting allows voters to participate on their own schedules, whether by visiting local election offices or mailing in absentee ballots. In recent elections, both parties have recognized its significance — a shift that is reshaping the strategies of political campaigns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Voters like the convenience of early voting options,” said Mark Rozell, a political scientist at George Mason University. “Importantly, Republicans have adjusted to the reality that early voting is here to stay.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, Youngkin’s political action committee </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/glenn-youngkin-virginia-politics-election-day/article_f250116c-6936-11ee-9bad-2b7f054e466e.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">invested millions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into the promotion of early voting initiatives, following years of GOP opposition to the expanded options. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Past GOP leadership claims that early voting leads to fraud likely had some negative impact on Republican turnout,” Rozell said. “The smart strategy now is to embrace the reality and use flexible voting options as a means to mobilize core supporters.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But opponents of early voting are not devoid of credible arguments, Rozell added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot can happen in October that might affect the viewpoints of those who voted in Virginia in late September. You can’t take it back once you’ve voted, so you better be sure when you vote that your opinion will not change under any circumstance.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Ways to vote early</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To vote early in-person, registered voters may go to the general registrar’s office for the jurisdiction in which they are registered, present their ID and cast a ballot. The location of the general registrar’s offices for all jurisdictions can be found on the Virginia Department of Elections’ </span><a href="https://vote.elections.virginia.gov/VoterInformation/PublicContactLookup" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in addition to </span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/registration/voterid/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a list</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of acceptable forms of identification. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Requested absentee ballots will also be mailed beginning Friday, including ballots to registered military and overseas voters. Any registered voter can request an absentee ballot either in person, by mail, </span><a href="https://vote.elections.virginia.gov/VoterInformation" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or by contacting their general registrar’s office. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Registered voters do not need a reason to request an absentee ballot, which can be dropped off at the general registrar’s office or polling location on Election Day. Absentee ballots returned by mail must be postmarked no later than Nov. 5 and received by noon on Nov. 8.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deadline to request a mailed absentee ballot is Oct. 25, but amid national U.S. Postal Service delays, state officials suggest those voting by mail </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/05/virginias-top-elections-official-warns-of-possible-delays-in-mail-in-voting-this-year/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">do so as soon as possible</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deadline to register to vote and cast a regular ballot is Oct. 15. After that date, voters can still register and vote on Election Day using same-day registration, but they will cast a provisional ballot. Same-day registration must be done in person, either at an early voting location within the voter’s jurisdiction or at their polling place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some jurisdictions offer early in-person voting at satellite locations in addition to the general registrar’s office. Dates and times vary by j</span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/casting-a-ballot/early-voting-office-locations/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">urisdiction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Curbside voting is available for voters with disabilities and those 65 and older who prefer to vote in person. For details on voting hours, additional locations, and ballot drop boxes, contact your local registrar&#8217;s office.</span></p>

(Witt campaign)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Republicans in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District remain divided over their support of their party’s nominee, state Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland, and U.S. Bob Good, R-Farmville, the incumbent, Democrat Gloria Witt sees an opening in the traditionally conservative district. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Political analysts suggest the GOP infighting could provide Witt, a political newcomer with lifelong roots in the mostly rural district, an advantage in the Nov. 5 election, after some Republican hardliners have vowed to write in Good, the chairman of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And in a district where turnout and enthusiasm are crucial, a divided Republican electorate could allow the Democrat to make unexpected gains in the general election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A write-in campaign benefiting a defeated GOP primary candidate is certainly part of a best-case scenario for a Democratic candidate in District 5,” said Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So too is a strong performance by Vice President Kamala Harris in the debate against former President Donald Trump last week. But even those tailwinds for Democrats do not erase the fact that the boundaries of the district are very, very friendly to Republicans.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But while Witt is quite aware that the rift between Good and McGuire supporters could potentially reshape the contest’s dynamics heading into November, she remains unfazed and vows to stay focused on shaping her own message. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m hearing the same things about the tensions between the McGuire and Good campaigns, but I’m really not paying too much attention to them, they do what they do,” Witt said in a recent phone interview. “My focus is on appealing to the interests of the voters of District 5, and I believe that we do have enough votes to win based on the interests that impact them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Witt, a businesswoman and community activist from Amherst County, won her party’s nomination in the June 18 primary after defeating her two primary opponents, Gary Terry, a Kentucky native and a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, and Paul Riley, an intelligence analyst and U.S. Army veteran. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to data from the Virginia Department of Elections, Witt prevailed with 57.17% of the vote, compared to Terry’s 22.43% and Riley’s 20.40%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Witt said in the interview that since announcing her candidacy in the spring, she has been crisscrossing the district that spans 11,000-square-miles t, which encompasses the majority of Southside, including Danville, and the cities of Charlottesville and Lynchburg. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m averaging about 3,000 to 4,000 miles a month. We are canvassing, we are phone banking, we are engaging in postcarding and doing the work,” Witt said. “We cannot afford to have anybody on the bench. We all have to be engaged, it is a crucial election cycle, every vote counts. We intend to win this based on what people care about.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the ongoing intra-party feud among supporters of McGuire and Good, Witt’s campaign remains an uphill battle in a district that has been mostly Republican since 2002, when former Democrat-turned-independent Rep. Virgil Goode joined the GOP. Trump won the 5th with 53% in both 2016 and 2020, and in the 2021 gubernatorial election, Republican Glenn Youngkin defeated Democrat Terry McAuliffe with 60% to 39.4% of the vote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Witt isn’t the only one hitting the road. Sean Brown, a spokesman for McGuire’s campaign, said in a text message that McGuire is “campaigning tirelessly to get the message out that we must grow our economy, secure our borders, and strengthen our national defense.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Voters in the 5th District understand what is at stake in this election and that the only way to achieve these goals is to elect Donald Trump and deliver a Republican majority in the House and Senate,” Brown said.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_17892" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:175px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2020/04/28/embattled-va-dems-stockpile-cash-ahead-of-november/mcguire/" rel="attachment wp-att-17892"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-17892 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/mcguire.png" alt="" width="175" height="220" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland. (Virginia House of Delegates)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Witt said that the GOP has changed in the eight years since Trump’s first presidential bid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are no longer operating with the standard GOP platform, which is not your momma and daddy’s platform. It has been hijacked and replaced by something that is new and different,” she said, citing </span><a href="https://www.project2025.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Project 2025</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an initiative launched by the Heritage Foundation in 2022 aimed at advancing conservative and right-wing policies to restructure the federal government and strengthen executive power in the event of a Trump victory in November.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe that the voters of District 5 are aware of the impact of Project 2025, and if we allow it to be implemented across the nation, it is going to impact all of us.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Witt said that codifying Roe v. Wade and women’s reproductive health remains the premier concern that she hears from voters as she travels the district. “There is a lot of energy from women to be recognized for having domain over their bodies,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other priorities include furthering economic growth across, access to public education with a focus on K-12, “and this whole idea of protecting social security, strengthening families and healthcare.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris’  nomination as her party’s presidential candidate has also helped motivate Democrats in the district, Witt said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think that there is a lot of energy around this concept of being future-focused driven by opportunity for all of us versus the other choice, which would mean the control of our rights, a loss of democracy and a questionable economic future. The choices are pretty clear, and I think the rise of Kamala Harris just paints this picture that is so much more positive.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Witt said that after six months of heavy campaigning, she has yet to meet her opponent, who has </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/09/fifth-district-gop-chair-where-is-john-mcguire/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">faced criticism</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from GOP officials in the district for what they said was a lack of campaigning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“From what I know he is pro-God, pro-Trump, pro-guns, and he was present on Jan. 6 at the Capitol,” she said, referring to the attack on the U.S. Capitol building by a mob of supporters of then–resident Trump in early 2021. While McGuire, a former Navy SEAL, </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/11/03/least-seven-jan-6-rallygoers-won-public-office-election-day/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">attended the rally</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that day, there is no evidence that he participated in any violent activities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And seven weeks before the election, both candidates have yet to face off in a debate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, the Amherst County Democratic Committee invited McGuire to a forum at the Nelson Heritage Center in Nelson County to be held in late September or early October. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe all citizens have a right to know the views of those who seek to represent them. We are hopeful Senator McGuire will agree to participate in the forum,” Craig Pleasants, vice president of the Amherst County Democrats, said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown, McGuire’s spokesman, said that his campaign was considering an invitation to a debate hosted by the Wilson Center for Leadership in the Public Interest at Hampden-Sydney College in Farmville. “We’re just waiting on dates and times,” Brown said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Witt said that she was ready to face McGuire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am willing to engage in a debate or forum, I am ready, willing and able, depending on whoever invites us to the table you will get a yes from me,” she said. </span></p>

<p>The debate at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia hosted by ABC News just 56 days before the election was also notable as the first exchange between the candidates since President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/president-joe-biden-bows-out-reelection-campaign-harris-vows-win-nomination-8" target="_blank">exited</a> the race weeks after his botched debate performance in late June.</p>

<p>It is the only debate the campaigns have agreed to before the November election, although the Harris camp afterward suggested they’re ready for another and Fox News offered to host it in October.</p>
<p>The night began with Democratic nominee Harris crossing the stage to initiate a handshake and introducing herself to Trump, the GOP candidate. The two had never before met.</p>
<p>But the back-and-forth quickly grew contentious, as Trump blasted Harris’ record as vice president under President Joe Biden, and Harris said Trump was unfit to be president for myriad reasons. The two did not shake hands at the close.</p>
<p>Harris portrayed herself as a champion of the middle class. She presented a hopeful vision of the country that she sought to contrast with what she described as Trump’s self-centered vision that included attacks on the country’s democratic traditions and people of color.</p>
<p>“I am actually the only person on this stage who has a plan that is about lifting up the middle class and working people of America,” she said. “I believe in the ambition, the aspirations, the dreams of the American people.”</p>
<p>The vice president lambasted Trump as “extreme” and sought to tie him to the ultraconservative Project 2025, with which he denied an association. Harris also underscored the numerous legal cases Trump <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trumps-jan-6-case-extend-beyond-election-day-under-timeline-laid-out-judge%C2%A0-2" target="_blank">continues</a> to face. Trump is the first former president to become a <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-found-guilty-34-felony-counts-ny-hush-money-trial-10" target="_blank">convicted</a> felon.</p>
<p>“Donald Trump actually has no plan for you,” she said. “Because he is more interested in defending himself than he is in looking out for you.”</p>
<p>Trump repeated unverified claims about migrants eating dogs in Ohio, returned time and again to complaints about immigration, defended his plan to raise tariffs and boasted about campaign rally crowd sizes — after Harris taunted him about his events, saying people left.</p>
<p>“In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs, the people that came in, they’re eating the cats. They’re eating, they’re eating the pets of the people that live there,” Trump said in one of the more jarring moments of the debate, when he repeated <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/misinformation/jd-vance-ohio-police-no-reports-haitian-immigrants-harming-pets-rcna170271" target="_blank">baseless</a> claims about Haitian migrants. The rumors have circulated on social media in recent days, and have been <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/GXC9L0aXQAAjeIm.jpeg" target="_blank">amplified</a> by Trump’s running mate, Ohio U.S. Sen. J.D. Vance.</p>
<p>Trump challenged Harris to use her position in the administration to address inflation and immigration, suggesting that she was not actually able to follow through on her promises.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="LvYR73wQrF"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/15/im-entitled-to-personal-attacks-against-harris-trump-asserts/"> ‘I’m entitled to personal attacks’ against Harris, Trump asserts</a></p></blockquote>

<p>“She doesn’t have a plan,” he said. “She copied Biden’s plan, and it’s like four sentences like, ‘Run, Spot, run,’ four sentences that are just, ‘Oh, we’ll try and lower taxes.’ She doesn’t have a plan.”</p>
<p>Polls show the race is <a href="https://scri.siena.edu/category/political/nyt/" target="_blank">virtually tied</a> nationally and in seven key states that will decide the Electoral College margin: Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. Harris enjoyed a polling bump soon after she became a candidate, but her numbers have dropped in the weeks since and recent polls showed her roughly even with Trump.</p>
<p>Among the top moments of the night touching on policy and politics:</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Election integrity</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The 2024 presidential election marks a test for the peaceful transfer of power after political violence marred the nation’s tradition when Trump’s refusal to accept his loss sparked a Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol.</p>
<p>Trump repeated false claims during Tuesday’s debate that he won the 2020 presidential election, even walking back recent public statements that seemed to accept defeat.</p>
<p>Asked by moderator David Muir if recent statements that he “lost by a whisker” and similar sentiments were acknowledgements he’d lost, Trump said the comments were sarcastic.</p>
<p>“I don’t acknowledge that at all,” he said. “That was said sarcastically.”</p>
<p>Harris called Trump’s answer “deeply troubling.”</p>
<p>“You did, in fact, lose that election,” she told him. She added that his continued denial “leads one to believe that perhaps we do not have, in the candidate to my right, the temperament or the ability to not be confused about fact. That’s deeply troubling, and the American people deserve better.</p>
<p>When asked if he regretted any of his actions when the U.S. Capitol was violently overrun by his supporters, Trump defended himself and returned to the topic of immigration.</p>
<p>“I had nothing to do with that, other than they asked me to make a speech,” Trump said.</p>
<p>Harris responded: “For everyone watching who remembers what January 6 was, I say ‘We don’t have to go back.’”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Race</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Moderators asked Trump about his <a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2024/07/31/trump-insults-harris-makes-false-claims-quarrels-with-black-journalists-at-conference/" target="_blank">disparaging comments</a> about Harris’ biracial identity to the National Association of Black Journalists last month. Muir questioned if it was appropriate for Trump to weigh in on his opponent’s race.</p>
<p>Trump said it was not appropriate, but seemed to defend the comment that Harris had “turned Black” to promote her political career.</p>
<p>“I don’t care what she is,” he said. “Whatever she wants to be is OK with me. All I can say is that I read where she was not Black, that she put out, and I’ll say that, and then I read that she was Black, and that’s okay. Either one was okay with me. That’s up to her.”</p>
<p>Harris called it “a tragedy” that Trump continued “to use race to divide the American people.”</p>
<p>She invoked allegations that he refused to rent his residential properties to Black families, spread conspiracy theories that the first Black president, Barack Obama, was not born in the United States and supported the execution of Black and Latino boys accused of murder in New York’s Central Park. The suspects were later exonerated.</p>
<p>“The American people want better than that, want better than this,” she said, adding that voters wanted a conversation about how candidates could improve their lives. “Regardless of people’s color or the language their grandmother speaks, we all have the same dreams and aspirations, and want a president who invests in those, not in hate and division.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Abortion and IVF</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The 2024 presidential election is the first since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a 6-3 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.</p>
<p>While Trump told debate moderators that he would not sign a nationwide abortion bill into law, he refused to give a yes or no answer when asked if he would veto one.</p>
<p>Moderator Linsey Davis corrected Trump after he claimed that some states allow abortion “in the ninth month,” but he continued to repeat it throughout the debate.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="qw37QWvj2i"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/13/virginia-democrats-do-not-support-infanticide-but-heres-why-trump-keeps-saying-they-do/">Virginia Democrats do not support infanticide, but here’s why Trump keeps saying they do</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia Democrats do not support infanticide, but here’s why Trump keeps saying they do&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/13/virginia-democrats-do-not-support-infanticide-but-heres-why-trump-keeps-saying-they-do/embed/#?secret=O8snATNWbx#?secret=qw37QWvj2i" data-secret="qw37QWvj2i" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>Trump hailed the Supreme Court justices — three of whom he appointed — for giving full control of abortion laws to state governments.</p>
<p>“What I did is something, for 52 years, they have been trying to get Roe v. Wade into the states, and through the genius and heart and strength of six Supreme Court justices, we were able to do that,” Trump said, adding that he “strongly” believes in exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother.</p>
<p>Harris said she would “proudly” sign a bill into law that restored the federal right to an abortion.</p>
<p>“One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government and Donald Trump certainly should not be telling a woman what to do with her body,” Harris said.</p>
<p>She attacked what she dubbed “Donald Trump’s abortion bans” and said his actions resulted in a reality where couples “who pray and dream of having a family are being denied IVF treatments.”</p>
<p>In vitro fertilization, or IVF, has become a <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2024/02/28/u-s-senate-republican-blocks-legislation-protecting-in-vitro-fertilization/" target="_blank">lightning rod for debate</a> on the right after an Alabama court ruled in early 2024 that frozen embryos counted as children. Legislators in the state have since passed a law to restore IVF access.</p>
<p>Trump said Harris was telling “another lie.”</p>
<p>“I have been a leader on IVF, with which is fertilization, the IVF. I have been a leader,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Taxes, the economy, health care</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>With Trump’s signature 2017 tax law expiring at the end of 2025, tax policy has been front and center of the 2024 presidential race.</p>
<p>Harris trumpeted her plans for an “opportunity economy” and panned Trump’s proposal to raise tariffs and “provide a tax cut for billionaires and big corporations.”</p>
<p>“Donald Trump has no plan for you, and when you look at his economic plan, it’s all about tax breaks for the richest people,” Harris said on the debate stage.</p>
<p>Harris’ proposals include increasing the corporate tax rate to 28%, permanently expanding the child tax credit to pandemic levels and extending up to $6,000 to new parents, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/harris-roll-out-new-plan-tax-relief-small-businesses" target="_blank">providing</a> up to $50,000 in tax relief for business start-up costs, and offering new homebuyers a $25,000 tax credit.</p>
<p>A large part of Trump’s economic plan is to impose universal tariffs of at</p>
<p>least 10% on all U.S. imports, with tariffs on Chinese goods at 60%. When asked by Muir if the approach could cause consumer prices to increase, Trump denied the possibility.</p>
<p>“We’re not going to have higher prices. What’s going to happen, who’s going to have higher prices is China, and all of the countries that have been ripping us off for years,” Trump said.</p>
<p>Trump has promised, at minimum, to extend his tax policies, which cut individual income tax rates, lowered the corporate tax rate to 21%, loosened business expensing and deductions, and doubled the child tax credit to $2,000.</p>
<p>Economists warn that if extended, the Trump-era tax cuts would add trillions to the deficit. That total could reach between $4 trillion and $5.8 trillion over the next decade, <a href="https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2024/8/26/trump-campaign-policy-proposals-2024?te=1&amp;nl=the-morning&amp;emc=edit_nn_20240903" target="_blank">according</a> to the University of Pennsylvania’s Penn Wharton Budget Model. In a separate model, the Tax Foundation <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/donald-trump-tax-plan-2024/" target="_blank">estimated</a> the policies could reduce federal revenue up to $6.1 trillion over a 10-year window.</p>
<p>The Penn Wharton model <a href="https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2024/8/26/harris-campaign-policy-proposals-2024?te=1&amp;nl=the-morning&amp;emc=edit_nn_20240903" target="_blank">estimates</a> Harris’ proposals would increase the deficit by up to $2 trillion over ten years. Modeling from the Tax Foundation released Tuesday <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/kamala-harris-tax-plan-2024/" target="_blank">predicts</a> the vice president’s plan would increase taxes by $4.1 trillion over the next decade, but after accounting for various tax cuts and credits, the projected revenue drops to $1.7 trillion, and even further if slowed economic growth is considered.</p>
<p>On health care, Trump said he had “concepts of a plan” to overhaul the law signed by President Barack Obama in 2010.</p>
<p>“I would only change it if we come up with something that’s better and less expensive,” he said. “And there are concepts and options we have to do that, and you’ll be hearing about it in the not too distant future.”</p>
<p>Harris defended the law known as “Obamacare.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Immigration and border security</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Trump tried several times to steer the conversation to immigration, his signature issue since he began his first White House run in 2015.</p>
<p>He referenced viral — but unverified — stories of sensational disruptions caused by immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, and Aurora, Colorado, and blamed Harris and Biden for the supposed episodes.</p>
<p>“These are the people that she and Biden let into our country,” he said.</p>
<p>Continuing Biden’s immigration policies would turn the country into “Venezuela on steroids,” he said.</p>
<p>Harris laughed after Trump pressed unverified claims about immigration. “Talk about extreme,” she said.</p>
<p>Harris promoted a bipartisan immigration and border security bill this year that included measures Republicans sought to strengthen enforcement. But the bill fell apart, she said, under opposition from Trump, who preferred campaigning on the issue to solving the problem.</p>
<p>When moderators then asked Trump about the bill, he began his answer by bragging about crowds at his campaign rallies, responding to a comment Harris had made.</p>
<p>Rally attendance remained high, he said, “because people want to take their country back.”</p>
<p>“Our country is being lost,” he said. “We’re a failing nation, and it happened three-and-a-half years ago. And what? What’s going on here? … What they have done to our country by allowing these millions and millions of people to come into our country and look at what’s happening to the towns all over the United States.”</p>
<p>He did not answer the question about the bill.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Energy and climate</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Moderators asked Harris about her position on hydraulic fracturing, a technique for extracting natural gas better known as fracking.</p>
<p>The process is controversial among environmentalists, but a major industry in gas-rich Pennsylvania. During her unsuccessful bid for the Democratic nomination in 2020, Harris told a climate activist during a televised town hall that she favored banning fracking, but has said this year that is not her position.</p>
<p>Asked by Davis to explain the change Tuesday night, she said she’s also made clear in 2020 that she did not want to ban fracking.</p>
<p>She also noted her tie-breaking vote in the Senate to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, a massive energy, taxes and domestic policy law Democrats passed along party lines in 2022 that included expanded leases for natural gas production.</p>
<p>Trump urged voters not to believe Harris.</p>
<p>“If she becomes president, fracking in Pennsylvania will end on day one,” he said.</p>
<p>The last question before closing statements was on climate change.</p>
<p>Harris called it a threat and touted the Biden administration’s work to expand the clean energy industry, while preserving natural gas jobs.</p>
<p>Trump declined to answer the question, instead focusing on the work of Hunter Biden, the president’s son, with a Ukrainian energy company. Trump called the Biden administration “corrupt.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Foreign policy</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>As the humanitarian crisis continues in the Gaza Strip with deaths mounting 40,000, according to Gaza health officials, Davis asked Harris how she could break through a stalemate on a proposed cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas militants.</p>
<p>The vice president offered little detail on how to finally broker a deal, but said, “What we know is this war must end.”</p>
<p>“It must end immediately, and the way it will end is we need a cease-fire deal, and we need the hostages out, and so we will continue to work around the clock on that — work around the clock — also understanding that we must chart a course for a two-state solution,” she said.</p>
<p>Harris added that she will “always give Israel the ability to defend itself, in particular as it relates to Iran.”</p>
<p>Trump lashed back with accusations that Harris “hates” Israel and the “Arab population,” and repeated his refrain that “if I were president, (the war) would have never started.”</p>
<p>“I will get that settled and fast, and I’ll get the war with Ukraine and Russia ended. If I’m president-elect, I’ll get it done before even becoming president,” Trump said.</p>
<p>He did not directly answer if he wanted Ukraine to win the war.</p>
<p>“I think it’s in the U.S. best interest to get this war finished and just get it done, negotiate a deal, because we have to stop all of these human lives from being destroyed,” Trump said when asked if a Ukraine victory is in the U.S.’s best interest.</p>
<p>Harris said she would continue to stand with NATO allies on defending Ukraine.</p>
<p>“I believe the reason that Donald Trump says that this war would be over within 24 hours is because he would just give it up. And that’s not who we are as Americans,” she rebutted.</p>
<p>Another foreign policy topic was on display at the U.S. Capitol hours before the debate when congressional leaders held a <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?537990-1/house-speaker-mike-johnson-holds-congressional-medal-ceremony" target="_blank">ceremony</a> honoring 13 service members who were killed during the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Trump and Republican lawmakers have ratcheted up criticism of Harris — implicating her hundreds of times in a damning <a href="https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WILLFULL-BLINDNESS-An-Assessment-of-the-Biden-Harris%20Administrations-Withdrawal-from-Afghanistan-and-the-Chaos-that-Followed.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> released Monday — for the Biden administration’s handling of the August 2021 exit from Afghanistan after two decades of war.</p>
<p>“I will tell you I agreed with President Biden’s decision to pull out of Afghanistan. Four presidents said they would, and Joe Biden did,” Harris told Muir when asked if she bears any responsibility for the deadly withdrawal.</p>
<p>Harris criticized Trump for “negotiating directly with a terrorist organization” when he struck a deal with the Taliban before he left office.</p>
<p>Trump defended himself saying “I got involved with the Taliban because the Taliban was doing the killing” and said he achieved a “very good agreement.”</p>
<p>Trump made waves on the recent third anniversary of the 13 service members’ deaths when his staffers pushed an Arlington National Cemetery official aside to take photos in a restricted area, according to the U.S. Army and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/27/nx-s1-5091154/trump-arlington-cemetery" target="_blank">reporting</a> by NPR.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Swift endorsement</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Shortly after the debate’s close, mega star Taylor Swift said in an Instagram post she would vote for Harris.</p>
<p>Part of Swift’s exuberant fan base had called on her to endorse Harris, following her support for Biden and Harris four years ago.</p>

(Jonathan Ernst/Scott Olson/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Vice President Kamala Harris gears up to debate former President Donald Trump at what may be their only presidential debate in Philadelphia on Tuesday, new polling shows the Democrat with a significant lead over the Republican nominee in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A poll by </span><a href="https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/2024-election-state-polls" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morning Consult</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conducted between Aug. 30 and Sept. 8 among 498 likely voters and published Monday has Harris up by 10 percentage points (52-42%) over Trump in the commonwealth — roughly the same margin by which Democrat Joe Biden defeated the then-incumbent in 2020 (54-44%). Among self-identified independent voters, Harris leads Trump by eight points, or 48-40%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey signals better news for the Harris campaign than a  </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/20/harris-holds-slim-lead-over-trump-in-virginia-roanoke-college-poll-says/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roanoke College poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> released last month, which had the vice president ahead by just three points (47-44%) and within the margin of error. It also marks a substantial improvement compared to </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/05/29/biden-and-trump-now-tied-in-virginia-roanoke-college-poll-says/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an earlier poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from May that had Biden and Trump tied by 42-42% in a head-to-head matchup, putting Virginia in play for Republicans for the first time in years.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For a brief moment, when Biden was at his lowest, it was possible to believe that Virginia would be competitive,” said Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While we always want to see more polling, I’d say a lead of +10 for Harris strongly suggests Virginia is headed for a fifth Democratic presidential victory,” Sabato said, adding that other ‘in-reach’ states for Trump, such as Minnesota, New Hampshire, and New Mexico, “have disappeared from the discussion” since Harris entered the race. </span></p>
<p>Jeff Ryer, a spokesman for the Trump campaign in Virginia, said in an email that the new <span style="font-weight: 400;">polls are “in no way reflective of what we’re hearing at the doors and on the phones from the tens of thousands Virginia voters our thousands of volunteers have personally contacted.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And since the Democrats have confirmed they have </span><a href="https://subscribe.newsleader.com/restricted?return=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newsleader.com%2Fstory%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2Felections%2F2024%2F09%2F06%2Fvirginia-2024-battleground-state-elections-trump-harris-biden%2F75085960007%2F&amp;gps-source=CPROADBLOCKDH&amp;gca-cat=p&amp;gca-uir=true&amp;gca-epti=z114332p000350c000350u114132e002008v114332&amp;sltsgmt=1001_B_20&amp;gnt-eid=control" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">25 offices and 132 staffers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the ground in Virginia, “it’s obviously not what they are hearing either,” Ryer said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokesman from the Harris campaign declined to comment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nationally, the Morning Consult poll finds Harris leading Trump by just three percentage points (49% to 46%), which is roughly in line with the survey’s results among registered voters in the previous weeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey also found that Harris’ popularity has declined a bit among likely voters over the past week, with voters just one point more likely to hold favorable opinions about her than unfavorable ones (50% to 49%).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But nationwide Harris remains more popular than Trump, whose net favorability rating is 10 points underwater, as she continues to receive more positive news coverage than the former president has ever received in Morning Consult’s tracking dating back to November 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/tablet/2024/09/09/sept-4-8-2024-washington-post-schar-school-poll-virginia-voters/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington Post-Schar School poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> released Tuesday morning has Harris ahead of Trump by eight percentage points (50-42%), largely owed to an 18-point advantage among women voters and by a sense of unity among Democrats. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey also found that 53% of Virginia voters have an unfavorable opinion of the former president, while 39% view him more favorably. In contrast, Harris enjoys a 49% favorability rating, with 42% of voters finding her unfavorable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., is also ahead of his Republican challenger, former Navy Capt. Hung Cao, by 12 points, or 53-41%, the poll says. </span></p>

John McGuire, shown here campaigning with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene in Louisa County in May, won his first election in Virginia's 5th Congressional District earlier this month. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rift between Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland, and party officials in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District widened further over the weekend after the Republican nominee failed to attend the district’s GOP committee meeting in Farmville on Saturday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire’s no-show at the gathering, which has traditionally served as a critical opportunity for candidates to solidify party support for their congressional bids, prompted the committee to withhold funding for his campaign and urge him to provide the panel with important contact information, and details on event planning and related activities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a letter to the campaign dated Sept. 6, Rick Buchanan, the district’s GOP chair, reminded McGuire that under the Republican Party of Virginia’s Party Plan, the committee “shall have general supervision over all district campaigns and shall cooperate with the State Central Committee in conducting statewide campaigns.”</span></p>
<a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Senator-John-McGuire-letter.pdf" class="pdfemb-viewer" style="" data-width="max" data-height="max" data-toolbar="bottom" data-toolbar-fixed="off">VA-5 GOP Committee letter</a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buchanan also notified McGuire that he had appointed a sub-committee of three party unit chairs “to work with your campaign to obtain, assimilate and distribute this information to all units within the 5th District so that efforts can be made to ensure success in November.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sean Brown, a campaign spokesman, said in a text message that McGuire was unable to attend Saturday’s committee meeting because he had already committed to door knocking events with the campaign of former President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, and to appear at an event with volunteer firefighters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown said that he and Bri Simon, McGuire’s campaign manager, attended the committee meeting on the candidate’s behalf. He declined to comment further. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a closed portion of the meeting, the committee voted to allot $8,000 to pay for Trump campaign signs in the district, but it denied McGuire’s campaign any additional funding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the reasons I believe for why the committee was hesitant was that John McGuire is nowhere to be found, he has not shown up at any unit meetings,” Buchanan said in a phone interview Monday. “Since the primary election he has only been to two unit meetings in Campbell County and Albemarle County out of 24 units.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In contrast, U.S. Rep Bob Good, R-Farmville, the incumbent who was defeated by McGuire in the June 18 primary election, met with all 24 unit chairs within weeks of first winning his party’s nomination in 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the disconnect between McGuire and the district’s party leadership predates the primary election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just days after Trump formally endorsed McGuire in late May, 25 Republican officials advised the former president in an </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/06/06/top-gop-leaders-in-the-5th-district-urge-trump-to-reconsider-mcguire-endorsement/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">open letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to rethink his endorsement and to instead consider backing Good.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Congressman Bob Good has championed America First policies by introducing legislation to codify policies defunding chain migration and requiring that immigrants are self-sufficient.

John McGuire, R-Goochland, prevailed in a recount of votes. (Good campaign)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it remains doubtful that this effort will split the Republican vote in a way that would hand the Republican-leaning district to Gloria Witt, the Democratic nominee, it’s a sign of the unease that many Republicans still feel about McGuire, who they say has made little effort  to unify the party and campaign district-wide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“McGuire seems to be running a fairly strange campaign, in my opinion, he does not seem very interested in doing the traditional things campaigns do,” said David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Perhaps the thinking is that in a district that rates a +7 to the Republican advantage he does not need to reach out very much. This may work out for him, but there is always a risk, and he needs to be sure he gets all of the Republican voters behind him lest Witt sneak in with a solid Democratic base that could win against a split GOP base.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While McGuire on Monday made several campaign stops in the district with Gov. Glenn Youngkin and Hung Cao, the Republican U.S. Senate nominee, Buchanan, the district’s GOP chair, said in the phone interview that his committee is being kept in the dark about the campaign’s efforts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s not a single thing on the district calendar of any events that he is doing, he’s not returning phone calls from the committee chairs who are trying to get him to come, and he’s not calling me or anybody that I know of. We’re very concerned, because I just don’t know what he’s doing. On Saturday, he couldn’t plan to spend 15 minutes addressing us in Farmville, which is in the very center of the district?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buchanan brushed off concerns that the committee’s support for McGuire is only lukewarm because most of the unit chairs remain supporters of Good, the incumbent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is only one mission that all of our units have, and that is to get Republicans elected,” Buchanan said. “John McGuire is the Republican candidate. We have trained and organized to do just that, and build our networks around getting out the vote and manning the polls. But where is John? I don’t know where John is today, I have no idea.” </span></p>

Tim Walz’s commitment to reproductive rights policy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tour will tout campaign promises to voters, such as Harris’ plan to sign into law a bill to restore federal abortion protections, should congress send one to her desk if she becomes president, while Walz will stand ready to cast a tie-breaking vote in the U.S. Senate if need be. With stops planned in Richmond, Virginia Beach and Northern Virginia, the tour’s foray across the commonwealth comes as early voting begins in Virginia next week and less than two months until Election Day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year while President Joe Biden was still seeking re-election, he and Harris had kicked off their campaign in Virginia on the platform to “restore Roe.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new bus tour will stop in all 50 states, including its three Virginia pit stops. A spokesperson for the Harris-Walz campaign in Virginia said that more details on the time and exact locations will be announced soon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stops in Virginia will feature rallies led by elected leaders to include Virginia congresswomen Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond and Abigail Spanberger, D-Henrico. House Democratic Whip Katherine Clark will join them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Featured speakers include Amanda Zurawski, who is </span><a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2024/05/31/texas-supreme-court-zurawski-abortion/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">part of a lawsuit against the state of Texas for being denied an abortion amid her pregnancy complications,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Louisiana resident </span><a href="https://lailluminator.com/2024/08/19/kaitlyn-joshua/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaitlyn Joshua who  shared the story of being denied care for a miscarriage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the Democratic National Convention last month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tour plans to highlight the differences between the Harris-Walz campaign and that of former President Donald Trump and Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio. The substantially-shifted national landscape surrounding abortion access has changed in recent years following the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, which had protected abortion federally for decades. Trump’s appointees to the court had upheld Roe as federal law during their confirmation hearings before ultimately ruling to undo it. As states now set their own laws on access or restrictions — something Trump has touted and claimed credit for —  Democrats point to growing uncertainty around access to birth control or family planning measures like in vitro fertilization. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several states have since voted to enshrine abortion protections into their constitutions — a process Virginia Democrats</span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/virginia-abortion-rights-restoration-same-sex-marriage/article_731f82a4-b4b0-11ee-9c14-7719906ce1fc.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hope to kickstart next year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — or drafted laws to </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/youngkin-contraception-virginia-general-assembly-hashmi-price/article_c74b197a-fb59-11ee-92c1-1b2a173616ec.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">protect other reproductive rights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congressional Democratic campaigns along with the Harris-Walz campaign also point to outlines in a Heritage Foundation guidebook called Project 2025 that entails </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/28/mcclellan-spanberger-work-to-repeal-parts-of-19th-century-law-that-could-ban-abortion-nationally/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">employing a long-dormant federal law to further restrict abortion medication and mailing of abortifacients.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Critics and reproductive rights advocates have said this could pave the way for a national ban.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As we crisscross the country, we are driving that contrast home to red and blue voters and independents,” Harris-Walz campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said in a statement. “The [tour] will drive home for voters that this threat to our fundamental freedoms touches every American.” </span></p>

Read their responses below, and stay tuned for in-depth profiles of these candidates in the coming weeks. You can also read continuing coverage of the races on our <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/category/election-2024/">Election 2024 hub,</a> and our <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/voter-guide/virginia-voter-guide-2024/">Voter Guide</a> for additional details on the races and voting information.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Abortion</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the only state in the South that hasn’t restricted abortion access since the Supreme Court overturned Roe. v Wade in 2022, which made abortion a federal right, Virginia is a key player in the country’s reproductive health landscape. By dismantling Roe v Wade, the nation’s highest court laid the groundwork for each state to restrict or enhance access to abortion; a spate of state bans on abortion have since emerged, with 14 states making the procedure illegal. Abortion remains legal in Virginia and state Democrats will push to enshrine it as a right in the commonwealth’s constitution next year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Republican candidates in Virginia’s congressional races assert that abortion access should be determined at the state level. In District 2, Republican incumbent U.S. Rep. Jenn Kiggans, a Navy veteran, nurse and former member of the state senate, has “consistently advocated for women to choose life, but respects exceptions for rape, incest, and life of the mother,” according to her campaign </span><a href="https://jenforcongress.com/issues/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Democratic challenger Missy Cotter Smasal, who is also a Navy veteran as well as the director of a nonprofit focused on women veterans, </span><a href="https://fb.watch/uhpo6DTiSN/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declared herself</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “the only pro-choice Navy veteran in this race.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 7, anchored in Prince William County but also spanning rural parts of the state, Spotsylvania attorney and former Green Beret Derrick Anderson, a Republican, is challenging career military officer and Democrat Eugene Vindman for the seat currently occupied by Abigail Spanberger, who is running for governor next year. Anderson has expressed support for the overturn of Roe and </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/DerrickAndersonforVA/videos/my-life-story-is-pro-life-and-thats-how-i-will-serve-in-congress-my-mother-got-p/414067620643367/?locale=ms_MY" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">called himself “pro-life” while sharing on social media</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that his mother had him as a single parent at 17 years old. Vindman plans to support </span><a href="https://vindmanforcongress.com/issues/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">access to abortions and contraception along with in vitro fertilization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 10, anchored in Loudoun County, Democratic state Sen. Suhas Subramanyam is running against Republican Mike Clancy to fill Rep. Jennifer Wexton’s seat. Wexton will not seek reelection due to a health issue, and endorsed Subramanyam during his democratic primary. He has supported an effort to </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SJ255" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">enshrine abortion protections into Virginia’s constitution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and plans to support federal protections. Clancy said that he “does not support federal action on abortion.” His campaign website lists “respect life” as a campaign issue and notes his support for resources for pregnant people and families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 9, incumbent Rep. Morgan Griffith faces Democratic challenger Karen Baker, a lawyer-turned-nurse. Griffith has voted against congressional efforts to protect abortion access and </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=402684" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Roe v. Wade had “produced decades of tragedy.” Baker wrote on her campaign website that “women’s choices must be respected.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, who is seeking reelection, has co-sponsored the </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/kaine-others-reintroduce-reproductive-freedom-for-all-act/article_f6cbd514-a8a7-11ed-8ac8-e388ae499856.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reproductive Freedom For All Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would protect access federally, now that Roe has been overturned. His Republican challenger, retired Navy veteran Hung Cao, told Virginia Mercury this summer that he </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/17/they-dont-like-abortion-but-kaines-gop-challengers-say-they-wont-seek-a-federal-ban/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">won’t support a federal abortion ban</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He has also </span><a href="https://www.hungforva.com/right-to-life/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">called himself “pro-life.” </span></a></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Housing </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing is an issue people experience practically and constantly, amid paying rent or mortgages. Local governments handle approvals or rejections of developments and craft zoning laws that guide development potential. But state and federal lawmakers have roles to play as well — largely through funding mechanisms or taking action where housing intersects with other policy platforms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While many congressional candidates this year don’t have housing policy outlined on their websites, some have been talking about how they plan to help states and local governments from the federal level. The Mercury reached out to others for more details on what they would do to help with housing supply and affordability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 2, Incumbent Rep. Jen Kiggans did not respond to inquiry for more details on housing policy by the time of this publication, though during her time in the state legislature as a senator, she voted in favor of the </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+vot+SV0271HB1889+HB1889" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her challenger, Democrat Missy Cotter Smasal, acknowledged the Mercury’s request for comment but did not follow through with a response in time for this publication. Her website touches on housing policy while addressing the economy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We need to stop the price gouging on groceries, and stop massive corporations from buying up houses and raising rent,” she wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 7, Democratic candidate Eugene Vindman expressed support for building more homes that middle-class families can purchase and “support programs that help first-time homebuyers buy a house.” He added that he’s concerned about out-of-state corporations buying homes that they then sell or rent at higher prices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Congress, I will work to take on these speculators who are putting regular people&#8217;s American dream out of reach,” he said in an email. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican candidate Derrick Anderson said he’s going to focus initially on how Congress can help reduce inflation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The first thing I’d do is pass a federal balanced budget amendment – ridiculous inflationary spending drove up housing prices (and grocery costs, gas costs, etc),” he said in an email. “Let’s stop the spending and get inflation down for the sake of Virginians who are struggling to get by.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 10, Republican Mike Clancy could not be reached for comment by the time of this publication. His campaign website doesn’t include housing policy, but it does stress his goal of helping to reduce inflation and stimulate the economy by “unleashing American innovation” and energy as well as reducing regulations on small businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Suhas Subramanyam’s campaign replied to The Mercury’s inquiry but did not follow through with his housing policy plans should he become a congressman before publication. He has supported affordability measures as a state senator: This year he </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB597" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">co-sponsored a bill </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to allow more Virginian localities to utilize Low Income Housing Tax Credits when approving developments, but it was vetoed by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 9, Democratic challenger Karen Baker supports expansion of tax credits that can help spur construction of affordable housing available to various levels of area median income. She also wants to</span><a href="https://www.bakerforva9th.com/affordable-housing" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “work on tailored solutions that address the specific needs of rural communities,”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like the Southwest Virginia ones she seeks to represent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his tenure as representative, Morgan Griffith has </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=402287" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">supported funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> appropriations to his district meant to help with affordable housing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine has cited his early-career experience as a fair housing lawyer before he went into politics. As a member of congress, he pointed to a bill he co-sponsored, the </span><a href="https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/klobuchar-kaine-introduce-legislation-to-address-nationwide-housing-shortage" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing Supply and Affordability Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would create a grant program for state and local governments to tap into. He’s also been involved with the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/2797" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low-Income First-Time Homebuyers Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would establish fixed-rate 20 year mortgages for first-time buyers whose income doesn’t exceed a certain amount. Both bills have been introduced multiple times but have yet to become law. Kaine also supports expansions to Low Income Housing Tax Credits, which helps increase affordable housing supply. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine’s opponent, Hung Cao, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/how-kamala-harris-new-policy-plan-could-impact-housing-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">echoes a stance of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump that ties housing issues to the U.S.-Mexico border</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“First and foremost, we need to secure the border,” Cao said in an email to The Mercury. “Everything that’s going wrong in our country right now is a direct result of our wide-open southern border. Housing costs are at an all-time high because there&#8217;s millions who were not here a few years ago for which we need to provide housing.” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Guns</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congress remains at a standstill as lawmakers fiercely debate the future of gun rights in America, with proponents of stricter gun control measures clashing with staunch defenders of the Second Amendment. Amid a surge in mass shootings and growing public outcry, both sides are digging in, setting the stage for what will likely be another defining battle over gun laws as the nation is headed toward the 2024 presidential election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Senate, U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., who was governor of Virginia when the deadly mass shooting at Virginia Tech took place in 2007, co-sponsored the Virginia Plan to Reduce Gun Violence, which he said would enact the same gun safety provisions passed by the Democratic-controlled Virginia General Assembly in 2020 at the federal level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hung Cao, Kaine’s Republican opponent, strictly opposes further legislation that he believes would infringe Second Amendment rights. Instead, Cao proposes that gun-related violence to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Prosecutors who refuse to enforce the law must be held accountable, the retired U.S. Navy captain said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia’s 2nd Congressional District, U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, in 2023 received a 100% rating by Gun Owners of America (GOA), a national gun rights organization, and a 92% rating by the National Rifle Association (NRA) in the previous year. While in the Virginia legislature, Kiggans has voted against universal background checks, expanding red flag laws that take guns out of the hands of domestic abusers and those who pose a threat to Virginians, and against prohibiting guns in schools and childcare centers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Missy Cotter Smasal, Kiggans’ Democratic opponent, states on her campaign website that she is committed to legislation seeking to prevent gun violence, create safer communities, and prevent veteran suicide. Smasal said that there are “commonsense measures supported by large majorities of Virginians” that can make Virginia’s neighborhoods safer while also protecting individual rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 7, Derrick Anderson, the Republican nominee, has stated that Second Amendment rights are sacred and shall not be infringed upon. As a former special forces Green Beret, Anderson vows to be “a strong advocate for gun owners in the halls of Congress.” Earlier this year, the Republican turned to the social media platform X, where </span><a href="https://x.com/DerrickforVA/status/1774127722647687559" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">he said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Americans have to “stand up for and protect our 2nd Amendment rights.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eugene Vindman, a former career military officer and the Democratic nominee, supports gun safety measures such as background checks and red flag laws to keep guns out of the hands of criminals, the mentally ill, and others who might cause harm. While he believes in the right of law-abiding gun owners to own firearms, Vindman also pushes for more legislation ensuring public safety. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, the incumbent in District 9, is a strong advocate for Second Amendment rights. Griffith said in a statement to The Mercury that he does not support government-mandated registrations of guns but that he backs harsher penalties for offenders who “abuse the right to have guns” by committing felonious crimes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Karen Baker, Griffith’s opponent and a gun owner, said she backs rigorous gun safety training for children in school. She is also pushing for enhanced gun safety laws, including tax credits for trigger locks, and she has called for enhanced mental health services for troubled individuals, and a legal mechanism to manage early reports of suspicious behaviors involving non-imminent ideation of shootings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the state in District 10, constitutional lawyer Mike Clancy, the Republican nominee, has vowed to defend Americans’ constitutional rights without exception, including the Second Amendment right to bear arms. Instead of regulating gun ownership. Clancy is pushing for legislation to fully fund law enforcement to ensure law enforcement has the training and equipment to protect Virginia’s communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his time in Virginia’s state legislature, Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, Clancy’s opponent, has actively supported several gun safety laws, including </span><a href="https://www.suhasforvirginia.com/press-and-media/key-gun-violence-prevention-bills-from-senator-subramanyam-vetoed-by-gun-lobby-backed-governor" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">several measures which passed the General Assembly just this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, two of which were signed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican. Suhas told The Mercury he believes America can achieve serious progress on this issue while respecting the Second Amendment, and without undermining the rights of responsible gun owners.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Education/Project 2025</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With divergent calls from some to eliminate the U.S. Department of Education and from others to improve teacher pay, public education is a top matter for voters in Virginia and across the nation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a Pew Research Center </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2024/04/23/what-are-americans-top-foreign-policy-priorities/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published in April, half of the Americans surveyed said that public K-12 education is going in the wrong direction. Some believe that schools should spend more time on core academic subjects. At the same time, communities, including those in Virginia, are sparring over what is taught in schools, particularly history, and gauging if students are falling behind in their studies and how to address that challenge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schools are also facing confrontation from parents over social issues, such as the types of books that are allowed in schools and the treatment of transgender students. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of these education issues and recommendations to address them are outlined in </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/04/what-could-project-2025-mean-for-education-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Project 2025</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — a conservative plan for how the country should operate if a Republican wins the White House. Some support the plan and others fear it could derail previous efforts to improve public education in Virginia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the state’s District 2 congressional race, Republican nominee and incumbent Jen Kiggans has publicly supported</span><a href="https://jenforcongress.com/issues/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> prioritizing students&#8217; safety and security</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and equipping teachers with tools and resources to improve student outcomes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She voted for the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/5" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parents Bills of Rights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a measure to “ensure the rights of parents are honored in public schools” and stands against critical race theory, a graduate-level framework that focuses on racial inequity and has not been found in Virginia curricula.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like the authors of Project 2025 and Kiggans, the Republican nominee for the District 10 seat Mike Clancy said he supports school choice. </span></p>
<p>Democratic nominee Eugene Vindman, in District 7, said he opposes book bans and the project, which he <a class="c-link" href="https://dailyprogress.com/opinion/column/eugene-vindman-project-2025-is-a-threat-to-democracy/article_709f3f3a-6a2a-11ef-927e-b310eb440bd5.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://dailyprogress.com/opinion/column/eugene-vindman-project-2025-is-a-threat-to-democracy/article_709f3f3a-6a2a-11ef-927e-b310eb440bd5.html" data-sk="tooltip_parent">sa</a>id his opponent and Republican nominee Derrick Anderson has failed to denounce.</p>
<p>Anderson said Vindman is “lying” and denied supporting the project&#8217;s proposal to eliminate the U.S. Department of <span class="c-mrkdwn__highlight">Education</span>.</p>
<p>He said he supports helping students in his home district “succeed” and will advocate for ensuring that “test scores go up and conflicts go down.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 9, Karen Baker, the democratic nominee, said she supports strengthening public schools, much like Vindman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Baker’s </span><a href="https://www.bakerforva9th.com/issues" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">campaign website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, she supports making universal preschool “a reality for all families” in Southwest Virginia. She also supports investing in vocational education and making it accessible to the area. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, the Democratic nominee in District 10, said if elected, he will work to expand Pre-K, access to “critical“ job training into apprentice programs, and support providing resources to local schools to close the pandemic, learning loss gap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He told the Mercury that if the recommendations for Project 2025 were implemented, it would “devastate” Virginia’s public education system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We must do the opposite: invest in our schools, support our parents and teachers, and make college and postgraduate education affordable,” Subramanyam’s campaign said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Environment/Climate</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic candidates in Virginia’s congressional races largely have expressed the desire to address climate change by transitioning to zero-carbon generation sources. Some candidates differentiate themselves, like District 3 incumbent U.S. Rep. Bobby </span><a href="https://www.bobbyscottforcongress.com/the-scott-record" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who’s advocated for funding Norfolk’s flood wall to reduce sea level rise damage. District 6 contender Ken </span><a href="https://www.kenmitchellforvirginia.com/issues" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitchell</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> highlighted a need to “transition public investments away from propping up fossil fuel companies” on his campaign site, while District 11 incumbent U.S. Rep. Gerry </span><a href="https://gerryconnolly.com/issues/environment/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connolly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has said he’s an advocate for environmental justice, an environmental lens that amplifies the voices and needs of overlooked and overburdened communities during development that could impact their area. District 9 candidate Karen </span><a href="https://www.bakerforva9th.com/coal-miners" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baker </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">doesn’t address climate change on her website, but highlights a need to protect coal miners’ health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the aisle, Republican congressional candidates also mostly fall in line with each other’s environmental policy views by advocating for  </span><a href="https://www.mikeclancyforcongress.com/services-5" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reducing regulations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.hungforva.com/enviornment/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">energy independence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or promoting energy sources stemming from </span><a href="https://cline.house.gov/issues/energy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fossil fuels</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://sitkaforcongress.com/on-the-issues" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nuclear</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some candidates don’t take clear positions about their environmental policy plans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking unique approaches on the GOP side are District 2 incumbent U.S. Rep Jen Kiggans, who signed onto a letter with other House Republicans earlier this year asking for House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana to </span><a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/some-house-republicans-warn-against-climate-law-repeal/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">not repeal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tax credits of the IRA, which have helped incentivize a burgeoning offshore wind </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2024/07/09/south-korean-company-plans-to-build-681-million-offshore-wind-submarine-cable-plant-in-chesapeake/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">development</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> industry in the Hampton Roads region.

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Election integrity</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concerns over election integrity and the potential for voter fraud have sparked a renewed focus in Congress, as lawmakers from both parties debate how best to safeguard the democratic process. With allegations of fraudulent voting making headlines in recent election cycles, the issue has become a political flashpoint. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some legislators call for stricter voting regulations to prevent potential abuse, others argue that such measures could suppress voter participation. As the 2024 election approaches, members of Congress are crafting new policies aimed at ensuring fair elections while addressing public concerns over security and accessibility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the U.S. Senate, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., has carried legislation such as the Freedom to Vote Act, which would implement provisions like automatic voter registration, same-day and Election Day voter registration, online voter registration, and no-excuse mail voting. Kaine has also co-sponsored the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which seeks to restore and update crucial protections against voting discrimination that were weakened by recent Supreme Court decisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine’s Republican opponent Hung Cao, a retired U.S. Navy captain who is backed by former President Donald Trump, has proposed few legislative means to secure the electoral process beyond a universal requirement for providing a voter ID in order to cast a ballot. But he said in a statement to The Mercury that “the only way to have election integrity is to have people watch the polls.” Cao has also suggested that the U.S. hold elections like the ones he witnessed in Iraq and Afghanistan, where people vote with their finger and blue ink. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In July, U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, who represents House District 2, voted in support of the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr8281/BILLS-118hr8281rh.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which passed in the House of Representatives by a 221-198 vote. Advocates of the SAVE Act say it would ensure that only citizens can vote in federal elections, partly by making it mandatory for states to obtain proof of citizenship to register voters and also requiring states to purge noncitizens from voter rolls. But President Joe Biden has vowed to veto the measure, stating that it would make it more difficult for eligible voters to register and increase “the risk that eligible voters are purged from voter rolls.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiggans’ Democratic challenger Missy Cotter Smasal, who previously mounted an unsuccessful campaign in Virginia’s 8th Senate District, has talked little about election integrity legislation. But the U.S. Navy veteran has attacked her Republican opponent for being  a “big supporter of President Trump” for backing “Big Lie” conspiracy theorists in Virginia’s state legislature by being one of </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/02/24/virginia-youngkin-tax-cuts-house-senate/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">only four Senators to vote for an audit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the 2020 election that would have cost Virginia taxpayers $70 million.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Derrick Anderson, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">former special forces Green Beret and the Republican nominee in District 7, has talked little publically about election integrity and he offers no clues about his views on his campaign website, but in </span><a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/government-politics/elections/derrick-anderson-talks-biden-the-border-and-inflation-ahead-of-tuesdays-gop-primary/article_a009bd2a-2837-11ef-9cbd-0f478e969dbd.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with The Daily Progress he acknowledged that Joe Biden is the legitimate president.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If elected, Anderson’s Democratic opponent Eugene Vindman, the twin brother of anti-Trump whistleblower Alexander Vindman, has vowed to work to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and strengthen protections for election workers, “so that anyone who threatens a poll volunteer or election official in an attempt to undermine our vote is held accountable.” Vindman, whose family emigrated to the United States from the former Soviet Union, has also warned against downplaying the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, which he blamed on a pro-Trump movement that did not recognize the nation’s norms of peaceful transfer of power and that he said undermines elections across the country to this day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, the incumbent in District 9, in 2023 sponsored the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/4460" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No Vote for Non-Citizens Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, seeking to ensure only eligible American citizens may participate in federal elections. The bill, which is still moving through the House, withholds some federal dollars that go to localities that allow non-citizens to vote in their elections. Griffith also voted for the SAVE Act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Karen Baker, Griffith’s opponent, told The Mercury that Republicans have failed to provide any evidence of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election and therefore there is no reason to believe that this year’s election will be different. Baker also stated that fears of undocumented immigrants voting are generated to induce distrust of election integrity but are absolutely without basis, and she has criticized Griffith for refusing to state that he will accept the outcome of the 2024 presidential election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Mike Clancy, an attorney from Loudoun County and the Republican nominee in District 10, does not list election integrity as one of his legislative priorities on his campaign website, he has been outspoken on social media about strengthening election laws. “Congress must pass the SAVE Act,” Clancy </span><a href="https://x.com/MikeClancyVA/status/1811031488923586986" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said on X</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in July. “Only U.S. citizens should be voting in our elections.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, Clancy’s opponent and a strict opponent of the SAVE Act, believes that “democracy is under attack” in America. The son of Indian immigrants, Subramanyam has vowed to continue to fight against “restrictive voter ID laws that are designed to suppress the vote, protect early voting to ensure greater access to the polls, and combat political gerrymandering.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Immigration</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Americans find that more migrants are turning to the United States for employment opportunities or to escape violent conflict in their home countries, among other reasons, they are increasingly interested in candidates&#8217; views on immigration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">America has become one of the most prominent destinations for migrants. However, over several years, many migrants have entered the country illegally, prompting backlash. At the same time, migrants have also been a staple of America’s workforce, including in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the </span><a href="https://map.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/locations/virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Immigration Council</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, immigrants comprised about 12.6% of Virginia’s total population in 2022, and 16.2% of Virginia&#8217;s labor force.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the District 9 race, Republican nominee and incumbent Morgan Griffith said immigrants are welcome to come to the United States “legally” and share in the “American dream,&#8221; but supports “cracking down” on illegal immigration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While criticizing the House for ducking its responsibility, Democratic nominee Karen Baker in District 9 said Congress needs to pass comprehensive immigration reform. She said she supports the Senate&#8217;s template for more border control agents and asylum officers and advocates for a DACA bill to protect children who have lived in the U.S. their entire lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the District 2 race, Jen Kiggans’ campaign said the Republican nominee and incumbent voted for legislation to increase security at the U.S. border by ensuring that federal immigration officials have the training and resources to stop the influx of illegal immigration, drugs and crime into the U.S. The measure has remained in the Senate since last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiggans supports strict enforcement of existing federal immigration laws and holding President Joe Biden’s administration accountable. She also backed legislation to prevent the administration from using National Parks to house illegal immigrants.</span></p>
<p>Derrick Anderson, the Republican nominee for the District 7 seat, said he <a class="c-link" href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/government-politics/elections/derrick-anderson-talks-biden-the-border-and-inflation-ahead-of-tuesdays-gop-primary/article_a009bd2a-2837-11ef-9cbd-0f478e969dbd.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/government-politics/elections/derrick-anderson-talks-biden-the-border-and-inflation-ahead-of-tuesdays-gop-primary/article_a009bd2a-2837-11ef-9cbd-0f478e969dbd.html" data-sk="tooltip_parent">supports</a> shutting down the border.</p>
<p>“It’s clear that the crisis at the border is hurting people right here in Virginia’s 7th District,” Anderson said in a statement. “Drugs, fentanyl, human trafficking – we need a serious change. We need to secure the border.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, the Democratic nominee in District 10, said with the U.S. immigration system being “broken,” he supports the country taking a comprehensive approach to the problem by starting with securing the border and ensuring that people who are doing “the right things the right way and contributing to our economy“ have a path to citizenship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said the country must also fix its “broken” asylum system.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Foreign policy (Israel-Hamas conflict, China, Ukraine)</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Virginia voters are following their congressional candidates&#8217; views on common issues in the U.S., they are also considering their responses to global conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a Pew Research Center </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2024/04/23/what-are-americans-top-foreign-policy-priorities/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that was completed in April, two of the most important issues to Americans are limiting the powers of China and finding a solution to the Israel-Hamas conflict.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Americans are also interested in limiting Russia’s powers following its invasion of Ukraine in Feb. 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said he takes pride in the fact that he is among a wide slate of lawmakers President Vladimir Putin of Russia permanently banned from visiting Russia in response to his record of standing against Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine two years ago. Kaine has voted for aid to Ukraine, and earlier this year he helped pass a supplemental package that included support for the country to defend its sovereignty. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine also said he views the U.S.-China relationship as the most consequential bilateral relationship of the century. Kaine voted to pass the </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/09/fact-sheet-chips-and-science-act-will-lower-costs-create-jobs-strengthen-supply-chains-and-counter-china/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CHIPS and Science Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> designed to outcompete China by shoring up domestic supply chains and bringing manufacturing back to America. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Hamas terrorists attacked Israeli territories on Oct. 7, 2023, Kaine has worked with Democrats, Republicans, and the Biden administration to ensure that Israel has defensive support. But Kaine has also called for a reduction of civilian casualties, supported the safe and swift delivery of humanitarian assistance to civilians in Gaza and the West Bank, and for long-term solutions to allow Palestinians and Israelis to live alongside each other in peace.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;More than 125 arrested at four Virginia universities amid nationwide protests over Israel-Hamas war&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/06/more-than-125-arrested-at-four-virginia-universities-amid-nationwide-protest-over-israel-hamas-war/embed/#?secret=npph43ErfD#?secret=andlM785qX" data-secret="andlM785qX" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine’s Republican opponent and former U.S. Navy captain Hung Cao in a statement criticized the Biden administration and Congress for giving “blanket amounts of money” towards Ukraine’s defense effort, alleging the financial support instead helps fund Ukraine’s retired workers pension plans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cao considers China an “existential threat” to the United States, and he has further called for the continued support of Israel, which he considers one of the United States’ closest allies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Jen Kiggans’ campaign, the District 2 Republican nominee and incumbent supports legislation to impose sanctions against China for its responsibility in the fentanyl crisis and </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/22/cosponsors" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prevent selling any petroleum to Chinese Communist Party-controlled entities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her campaign also said she prioritizes protecting American jobs and intellectual property from being stolen by the CCP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Derrick Anderson, the Republican nominee in District 7 and a former special forces Green Beret with six tours of duty overseas, including Afghanistan, Iraq, and various countries throughout the Middle East, told the </span><a href="https://jewishinsider.com/2024/04/virginia-congressional-candidate-derrick-anderson-military/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Jewish Insider”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in an interview in April that Congress needs to move quickly to provide additional aid to the Jewish state in its war against Hamas. He added that he was skeptical of sending more U.S. funds to the Palestinians, noting that other countries are providing aid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Anderson, his Democratic opponent Eugene Vindman, also a veteran, called for continued support for Israel, while asking that the U.S. continue to ensure that all the hostages — including Americans — are returned safe and sound to their families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman has also pushed for the continued support of Ukraine in both military and economic terms, and for taking on China&#8217;s state-directed economic system, which he said unfairly competes in the market and compromises America’s national security. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, voted for the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2022, which allowed the lending and lease of American defense material to the country in its defense of the Russian invasion, he also also voted to block similar legislation last year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griffith </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=403045" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has called</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> China a “dangerous, power-hungry actor” over the country’s territorial claims in the South China Sea, as well as its escalating efforts to control Taiwan, while </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=403086" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criticizing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> President Joe Biden’s decision to hold an arms shipment to Israel last spring. Griffith also said that America’s dealings with other countries must be driven by a careful analysis of what best serves the United States and its citizens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In relation to the conflict between Israel and Hamas, Karen Baker, Griffith’s Democratic opponent, has pointed out that while she acknowledged Israel’s right to exist, there are “bad acts on both sides.” Baker has also endorsed the continued financial and military support of Ukraine by the United States, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, the Democratic nominee in District 10, said he supports the U.S. in opposing Russia leader Vladimir Putin&#8217;s territorial ambitions in Europe and standing up to China, which is “violating international law and illegally dumping goods to prop up their economy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also supports the CHIPS Act, which helped to boost domestic research and manufacturing of semiconductor chips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the Israel-Hamas war, Subramanyam said he supports the U.S. returning hostages, especially  American citizens, and helping to rebuild communities affected by the war.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also supports a two-state solution, adding that Hamas cannot be one of the states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The human lives lost in this conflict have been devastating for all sides,” Subramanyam said in a statement. “I have visited the region, including the areas of Israel that were attacked, and made good friends there. I want to see an end to the war and a long-term path to peace.”</span></p>

(Getty Images)</p><p>Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump will take the stage tomorrow, Sept. 10, in the only planned debate between the respective Democratic and GOP presidential candidates between now and November.</p>
<p>It’s the first presidential debate since President Joe Biden bowed out of the race following his own disastrous debate performance in late June against Trump. Biden, who faced mounting calls to resign, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/pass-torch-biden-addresses-nation-why-he-wont-seek-second-term" target="_blank">passed the torch</a> to Harris back in July.</p>
<p>The veep has embarked on an unprecedented and expedited campaign as she and Trump vie for the Oval Office. The election is just two months away.</p>
<p>Though the Harris and Trump campaigns clashed over debate procedures in recent weeks, both candidates have agreed to the finalized rules. ABC News, host of the debate, released the rules Wednesday.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">When and where is the debate?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The debate will be Tuesday, Sept. 10, at 9 p.m. Eastern time at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The debate will be 90 minutes long and include two commercial breaks, <a href="https://abc.com/news/5e38600c-4732-4cd2-a99c-3dedfa81beb0/category/1138628" target="_blank">according to ABC</a>.</p>
<p>The Keystone State — where both Harris and Trump have spent a lot of time campaigning — could determine the outcome of the presidential election. The battleground state has narrowly flip-flopped in recent elections, with Biden <a href="https://www.politico.com/2020-election/results/pennsylvania/" target="_blank">turning Pennsylvania blue</a> in 2020 after Trump <a href="https://www.politico.com/2016-election/results/map/president/pennsylvania/" target="_blank">secured a red win</a> in 2016.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How can I watch the debate? </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The debate will air live on ABC News and will also be streaming on ABC News Live, Disney+ and Hulu.</p>
<p>ABC News’ David Muir and Linsey Davis will moderate the debate.</p>
<p>Harris and Trump will each have two minutes to answer questions and two minutes to give rebuttals. They will also be granted one additional minute to clarify or follow up on anything.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Will the mics be muted? </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Microphones will be muted when it’s not a candidate’s turn to speak, just like the previous debate between Biden and Trump in June.</p>
<p>The candidates will not give opening statements. Trump won a coin flip to determine the order of closing statements and podium placement. Trump, who selected the statement order, will give the final closing statement.</p>
<p>Each closing statement will be two minutes long.</p>
<p>Harris and Trump are not allowed to bring any props or prewritten notes to the debate stage. They will each receive a pen, a pad of paper and a water bottle.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Will there be a live audience?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>There will be no live audience at the National Constitution Center, as was the case in the last presidential debate.</p>
<p>Harris and Trump are not permitted to interact with their campaign staff during the two commercial breaks.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump slams ABC ahead of debate</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Trump went on the attack over the details of the debate, telling <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/town-hall-no-questions-trump-grouses-about-polls-attacks-debate-host" target="_blank">Fox News’ Sean Hannity</a> during an interview Wednesday in Pennsylvania that “ABC is the worst network in terms of fairness” and “the most dishonest network, the meanest, the nastiest.”</p>
<p>He accused the network of releasing poor polls on purpose ahead of a previous election to drive down voter turnout.</p>
<p>Trump also claimed, without evidence, that Harris would get the questions in advance of the debate. ABC’s debate rules state that no candidates or campaigns will receive any topics or questions ahead of the event.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Ohio Republican Sen. J.D. Vance will battle it out at the <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/mark-your-calendar-vp-candidates-walz-and-vance-debate-oct-1" target="_blank">vice presidential debate</a> hosted by CBS News on Oct. 1 in New York City.</p>

Recent polling shows Harris with a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/20/harris-holds-slim-lead-over-trump-in-virginia-roanoke-college-poll-says/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">slight lead</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over Trump. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday afternoon at Ettrick Deli near Virginia State University, McClellan hosted a meet and greet with Pearson to talk about key issues, two months before the general election that will determine the outcome of McClellan’s race against Republican challenger Bill Moher to represent Virginia’s 4th Congressional District. Though the district is reliably Democratic, McClellan said she hopes to gain re-election with higher margins than she did when she first won the seat by a special election in </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/mcclellan-beats-benjamin-in-special-election-for-virginia-congressional-seat/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2023</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With that win, McClellan became the state’s first Black congresswoman. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She and Pearson said that driving up interest about Harris’ campaign in Virginia and elsewhere can benefit Democrats up and down the ballot. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McClellan also called Pearson, 29, a “rising star” in her party who she believes may go on to serve in congress someday. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He made national headlines last spring as one of two state lawmakers to be expelled from the state legislature for </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/expulsion-of-tennessee-lawmakers-opens-questions-about-protections/article_ec4aa832-d583-11ed-9a38-0b3da5a287c4.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">participating in a protest from the House floor concerning gun violence. </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Dubbed the “Tennessee Three” by supporters, he and colleagues Justin Jones and Gloria Johnson were reprimanded for speaking without formally being recognized on the House floor. Johnson, a white woman, was spared from the expulsion while her Black male counterparts were temporarily kicked out of the legislature. Pearson and Jones went on to win </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/08/04/1192068281/the-2-expelled-members-of-the-tennessee-3-win-back-their-state-house-seats" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reelection </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to their seats. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pearson is still hopeful for more gun violence prevention policy to prevail in state legislatures and said that he thinks a federal assault-style weapon ban would be a big step in gun violence prevention. This year, Virginia’s own proposed version of an assault firearm ban cleared the Democratic-controlled legislature before being </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB2" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While speaking with Virginia State University students on the deli’s patio, Pearson noted young voters’ role in helping to shape their own future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Folks from the age 18 to 36 are the largest voting bloc in the country,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, of the over 36,000 new voter registrations last month, over 22,000 of the people are</span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/media/registration-statistics/2024/08/pdf/Monthly_New_Registrant_By_Age_Gender_2024_09_01_053637.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">under the age of 35, </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to Department of Elections data. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research also shows that Democrats have an </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/04/09/age-generational-cohorts-and-party-identification/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">edge </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in younger voter demographics while Republicans tend to have an edge with older voters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You&#8217;ve already got the first Black woman congressperson from the state of Virginia (and the) first Black woman vice president of the United States of America,” Pearson said, before suggesting that young Democrats “are going to be the deciders.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While environmental and social issues have been prominent for young voters, Pearson noted that economics and affordable housing are concerns he’s hearing from younger constituents, as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re talking about a fight for our future,” he said. “We’re talking about the climate. We’re talking about having enough money to be able to find a home and start a family.” </span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commissioner of Elections Susan Beals on Wednesday expressed concerns with the operational performance of the U.S. Postal Service ahead of the 2024 presidential election in Virginia, warning that mail-in ballots may not be processed in time to be counted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Election officials depend on the U.S. mail service to deliver ballots to voters and to return ballots to election officials,” Beals told members of the Virginia House of Delegates Privileges and Elections Committee at a meeting in Richmond. “What I am hoping to change is the expectation of voters, that if I put my ballot in the mail five days before election day that it is going to get there. You need to plan further out than that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals, who was </span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/virginia-news/youngkin-appoints-susan-beals-as-virginias-new-elections-commissioner/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">appointed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as Virginia’s commissioner of election by Gov. Glenn Youngkin in March 2022, responded to a question by Del. Phillip Scott, R-Fredericksburg, who had asked what she considered “the biggest threat” to the upcoming election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals said since before the 2023 election cycle, the Department of Elections has seen issues with mail-in ballots cast by voters who had been living in the same house for decades.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For example, the registrar tries to mail you a ballot and it gets mailed back to the registrar with one of those yellow stickers,” Beals said. “We had some cases where voters were trying to mail their ballot to an elections office and it’s being returned to the voter. We’ve had long delivery times and we’ve had examples of ballots that were sitting in the processing centers for days.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Postal Service has faced significant challenges in delivering mail-in ballots on time since the 2020 presidential election. The surge in mail-in voting due to the COVID-19 pandemic strained the postal system, leading to delays and concerns about the timely counting of votes. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week during a </span><a href="https://www.newsweek.com/postal-service-outlines-plans-mail-ballots-1946552" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">news conference</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Postal Service outlined its preparations for the “secure and successful delivery of election mail” in the Nov. 5 general election and briefed U.S. House and Senate committee staff of its preparedness to deliver the nation’s ballots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our letter carriers and facilities teams across the country, the 640,000 women and men of the Postal Service, are fully focused on the critical mission of delivering the nation’s election mail — just as we have done so excellently through this current primary season and as we have done in the past,” Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But despite these efforts to improve operations, issues such as staffing shortages, operational changes, and the sheer volume of ballots have continued to cause problems during more recent elections in many states — including in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals told the committee on Wednesday that her department first started raising concerns with the Postal Service prior to the 2023 election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia was a little bit of a canary (in a) coal mine on the issue of USPS and their performance because we had that statewide election in 2023, and a lot of other states did not, that’s their off-year,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the department started hearing from registrars about issues with mail ballots not being delivered to voters, not receiving them back in time, and ballots coming back as being undeliverable to voters who had not changed their address in years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We immediately reached out to USPS, we had an in-person meeting prior to the November election, and another in-person meeting after the election,” Beals said. But when the concerns remained, Beals requested to meet with members of Virginia’s congressional delegation and with representatives of both U.S. Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, D-Va., on Capitol Hill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They sent me immediately to their committees to detail the types of issues that we were seeing in Virginia,” Beals said, adding that she additionally flagged the mail delivery problems with the National Association of State Election Directors </span><a href="https://www.nased.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(NASED)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the U.S. Postal Regulatory Commission, an independent agency overseeing the operations of the Postal Service.</span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s been frustrating for us because every time we’ve raised these issues we were assured that they were going to be addressed, and then the subsequent elections weren’t necessarily seeing them get addressed, we’re still seeing some of the same issues,” Beals told the committee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokesman for the Postal Service in Virginia did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment Wednesday. But according to </span><a href="https://about.usps.com/newsroom/national-releases/2024/0829-election-mail-webinar.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data released</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the agency last week, nationally, the Postal Service in 2022 delivered 99.89% of ballots from voters to election officials within seven days. The 2022 midterm elections saw a similar level of on-time performance, with 99.93% of ballots delivered within the same timeframe. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Del. Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax, a member of the committee, cautioned against drawing conclusions before more data on mail-in voting in Virginia is available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think it’s important that we don’t scare the voters into thinking that this is not a safe and valid way to vote, because absentee balloting has been a hallmark of our democracy,” Krizek said in a brief interview Wednesday. “I think it’s a very important form of voting and I’d hate to see it go away or people be afraid to do it.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals’ message to Virginians planning to vote by mail this year is to not wait until the last minute to request and mail back their ballot — and to stay on top of the process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Make sure that once you request your ballot and it’s been a week or two, go ahead and call your registrar’s office and ask where it is. And as soon as you receive it, turn it around and put it back in the mail, don’t let it sit,” Beals said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know folks sometimes get their ballot and sometimes let it marinate and think about it, but you can’t do that this year. You need to make sure that you mail it back or you can drop it at a dropbox at your registrar’s office or at a polling location on Election Day.” </span></p>

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Latino voters are concerned with the high cost of living, the minimum wage and rising housing costs heading into the November elections, according to a comprehensive survey released Wednesday by UnidosUS, the largest Hispanic civil rights and advocacy center in the nation.</p>
<p>“Laying out a coherent economic policy agenda that will resonate with Latinos … would go a long way, I think, for our community,” Janet Murguía, the president and CEO of UnidosUS, said on a call with reporters detailing the <a href="https://unidosus.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Natl-deck-UnidosUS-2024-Pre-Election-Poll-of-Hispanic-Electorate.pdf" target="_blank">results of the survey.</a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://unidosus.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/National-crosstabs-UnidosUS-2024-Pre-Election-Poll-of-the-Hispanic-Electorate.pdf" target="_blank">survey included 3,000 eligible Hispanic voters</a> who were interviewed in either English or Spanish, from Aug. 5-23, with oversampling of residents of Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Florida, Texas and California. The poll, conducted by BSP Research, had a margin of error of plus or minus 1.8 percentage points.</p>
<p>Murguía said Latinos are the second-largest voting-age population and 1 in 5 of them will be casting ballots for the first time in a presidential election this November.</p>
<p>“Top of mind are pocketbook issues,” she said. “Hispanic voters are most deeply concerned, like many of their fellow Americans, about the rising cost of living.”</p>
<p>Another issue that Latinos strongly supported is access to abortion. By a 71% to 21% margin, Latinos oppose abortion bans, according to the survey.</p>
<p>“They do not support making it illegal,” Murguía said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Minimum-wage workers</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Wages and jobs that provide economic security are a top priority for Latino voters, Gary Segura, who conducted the research poll for UnidosUS, said.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/swa-wages-2022/#:~:text=Low%2Dwage%20workers%20are%20disproportionately%20women%20and%20Black%20and%20Hispanic" target="_blank">Latino workers are disproportionately workers</a> who earn the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, which has not increased since 2009. If the federal minimum wage had kept pace with inflation, it would be around $24 an hour, <a href="https://aflcio.org/what-unions-do/social-economic-justice/minimum-wage#:~:text=Since%20then%2C%20it%20has%20lost,would%20be%20%2424%20an%20hour." target="_blank">according to the AFL-CIO.</a></p>
<p>“The lived economy for Latinos is different than the lived economy for the nation as a whole,” Segura said.</p>
<p>Segura said during the poll, interviewers followed up with respondents on their concerns about jobs and wages and found that being able to afford necessities like food and housing were top issues.</p>
<p>“People are struggling to make ends meet,” he said.</p>
<p>The number one response was that “jobs don’t pay enough, or I have to take a second job to make ends meet,” Segura said. “We talk a lot about the low levels of unemployment in this society now, which is certainly good news, but the issue is that many of those jobs do not pay enough for the holder of that job to essentially pay their basic living expenses.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Opinions on immigration</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Murguía noted that immigration, which the Republican presidential nominee, former President Donald Trump, has made a core campaign issue, ranks fifth in priorities among Latino voters, tied with concern about gun violence and too-easy access to assault weapons.</p>
<p>“We want to be crystal clear that Latino voters overall are not buying into campaign tactics that demonize immigrants,” Murguía said. “They know the difference between those who mean us harm and those who are contributing to the fabric of our nation.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-promises-mass-deportations-undocumented-people-how-would-work" target="_blank">Trump has promised mass deportations</a> should he win a second term, a policy issue that has “virtually no support” by Latino voters sampled in the survey, Segura said.</p>
<p>Segura added that while Trump has campaigned on the issue, his promise to launch mass deportations is not particularly well known in Latino communities.</p>
<p>“Many of the people we speak to believe that (Trump) will do it if he can, but they just don’t actually believe that he can pull that off,” Segura said. “So there’s both a lack of awareness of these really draconian measures or proposals and then a lack of belief that they would actually come to pass.”</p>
<p>He added that he thinks it’s an opportunity for Democrats to campaign on the issue, but Vice President Kamala Harris has mainly criticized Trump for tanking a bipartisan border security deal.</p>
<p>“Our own results suggest that the primary border concern comes from voters who lean in the GOP direction in the first place, and so I don’t see a lot of movement there or a lot of risk for (Democrats), particularly in targeted advertisements and Hispanic voters,” Segura said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Dismissive and diminishing language’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The poll found that 55% of those Latinos had not been contacted by either political party this year.</p>
<p>“We often hear a really dismissive and diminishing language about Latino participation in elections,” Segura said. “‘Latinos don’t vote as often as they should. Latinos will let you down’ and so forth, and no one ever wants to address the elephant in the room, which is that no one is asking Latinos to vote.”</p>
<p>The Harris campaign last month launched a bilingual WhatsApp campaign to target Latino voters. Michelle Villegas, the national Latino engagement director for the Harris campaign, said during a Hispanic Caucus meeting at the Democratic National Convention that <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/harris-campaign-launches-bilingual-whatsapp-channel-draw-latino-voters-swing-states" target="_blank">the Latino vote is key to victory in three battleground states</a> — Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The survey also found that running mates had an impact on Latino voters. Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, gave her a 3-point boost, Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, made his rating drop by 3 points.</p>
<p>“Vance has (a) negative impact on the Republican ticket, which is consistent with his low favorability among Latino voters,” according to the survey.</p>
<p>While Democrats have an advantage with Latino voters, and Harris has seen a boost in support compared to when President Joe Biden was in the race, she is still not reaching the levels of Latino support seen in previous elections, Clarissa Martinez De Castro, the vice president of the Latino Vote Initiative at UnidosUS, said.</p>
<p>“There is work to be done to reach the levels of support Democrats need and had achieved in previous elections, and more intense communication with these voters is needed, particularly on economic issues and immigration,” Martinez De Castro said.<br />
Equis Research, which conducts research and polling specifically about Latino voters, <a href="https://www.weareequis.us/research/xssaug2024bgmemo" target="_blank">found in a recent poll t</a>hat Harris has gained significant support from Latinos but that Harris “remains a few points shy of what Biden received in 2020” across battleground states.</p>

(Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Virginia leaders tout improvements in public education, they are still working to address achievement gaps, facility improvements and the diverse needs of students and educators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, recommendations in Project 2025 — a conservative plan for how the country should operate if a Republican wins the White House — if implemented, could derail those efforts. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, has for years made recommendations found in the Project, and some were used in former President Donald Trump’s </span><a href="https://www.heritage.org/impact/trump-administration-embraces-heritage-foundation-policy-recommendations" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first term</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project includes conservative policy recommendations in various government areas, including defense, health and human services, and education. Some state leaders are concerned about the project’s proposed impact on school funding and resources. In contrast, others, including Gov. Glenn Youngkin, say the focus should be on what the presidential campaigns are proposing instead of Project 2025, which the governor characterized as a routine transition plan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;At the end of the day, there are lots of transition plans that are written, and they&#8217;ve been written for decades,” said Youngkin during an Aug. 15 meeting with reporters. “I do believe that what would really benefit Virginians and Americans is if the media would actually report on what the candidates are talking about, what they will do, or candidates that have yet to tell anybody what they&#8217;re going to do, as opposed to supposing what they might do from some transition plan that&#8217;s been written for presidents, literally since Ronald Reagan.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The plan’s stance on public education </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonathan Butcher, co-author of the education plan and senior research fellow with the Heritage Foundation, said nearly everything found in Project 2025 came from foundation research or is something it has advocated for years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project’s </span><a href="https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_CHAPTER-11.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">education plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suggests eliminating the U.S. Department of Education, which is responsible for serving students, executing plans by the president and Congress, and advocating for parental choice in education and for civil rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Butcher said the agency “failed” to address its goals of closing the achievement gap and improving the outcomes of children from low-income areas, while the federal government is spending billions on schools, compared to 50 years ago. He also said reading and math scores have reached historic lows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The authors of the plan also propose advancing school choice options, eliminating student loan forgiveness programs, eliminating a childcare program that focuses on children from low-income families, and rolling back regulations to protect transgender students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The education chapter states: “When power is exercised, it should empower students and families, not government. In our pluralistic society, families and students should be free to choose from a diverse set of school options and learning environments that best fit their needs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal recommends that the next president issue a series of executive orders requiring an unspecified group report on the “negative” influence of action civics on students’ understanding of history and civics and their disposition toward the United States. The report would also include an accounting of how federal programs and grants spread critical race theory and ideology centered on gender and diversity, equity, and inclusion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic legislators leading the General Assembly’s education committees have expressed concern about the proposed ideas. Several Republican legislators did not return The Mercury’s requests for comment on how Project 2025 could impact education in the state, or said that they weren’t well versed in the material. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, the House and Senate are controlled by Democrats who have prioritized funding teacher pay increases, and dedicating additional funds for disadvantaged students, higher education and providing more mental health resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats have dismissed Republican legislative efforts to ban certain books and allow parents to use state funding to cover the costs of educational opportunities outside of the public school system. But the two parties have worked together to improve special education and address child care needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we’re seeing in Project 2025 is really steering away from those critical core issues that we need to focus on in education, particularly around giving our students the skills that they need to succeed in a very complex world not just in the academic sense, but also socially and culturally,” said Senate Education and Health Committee Chair Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In another section of Project 2025, the authors recommend eliminating the Head Start program, which has fostered educational and social development for children under 5 years of age across the country since 1965. In 2021, the Heritage Foundation </span><a href="https://www.heritage.org/education/commentary/preschool-funding-35-trillion-spending-bill-modeled-after-failed-head-start" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the program negatively affected children and that the federal government should sunset it in 2023. Virginia currently offers 52 Head Start and Early Head Start programs across four regions statewide, according to the </span><a href="https://headstartva.org/about-us/membership/membership-directory/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Head Start Association</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Butcher said Project 2025 and the foundation have also called for an end to the federal student lending program, stating that it&#8217;s not “Washington’s job to be the bank for every college student.” Instead, the plan calls for consolidating student loans, moving them to the U.S. Department of Treasury and opening an opportunity for private lenders to offer loans to students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Education Committee Chair Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke, said the plan is “dangerous for business” and could negatively affect early education, increase college costs, and deprive disadvantaged students of resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;ve made record investments in public education, and just this year, we put an extra half billion dollars into early childhood slots because businesses were saying ‘Our workers need this,’” Rasoul said. “This is sadly a poorly concocted right-wing agenda to just prey on people, and to me, it clearly would be taking Virginia backward, and a lot of the good work that we&#8217;ve done in a bipartisan way would be unraveled.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hashmi said Republican members at the state and federal levels have long pushed ideas to dismantle the Department of Education and return control to the localities, which she said has likely adversely affected public education funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While a lot of these ideas are not necessarily new, they are really, really concerning in the ways in which Project 2025 spells out with great clarity the efforts to, in essence, destroy public education in the country.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said the plan also attacks the teaching of American History in schools, and protections for transgender and nonbinary children.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan lists several principles for safeguarding parental, student, and civil rights. The authors stated that “enforcement of civil rights should be based on a proper understanding of those laws, rejecting gender ideology and critical race theory.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The authors added that federal officials should protect educators and students in jurisdictions under federal control from “racial discrimination by reinforcing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and prohibiting compelled speech.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Butcher said while the education plan has no curricular recommendations based on gender, Project 2025 does follow the foundation’s </span><a href="https://www.heritage.org/model-legislation/the-given-name-act#:~:text=No%20public%20education%20employee%20or,a%20student's%20parents%20or%20guardians." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Given Name Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which states that “no public education employee or contractor shall use a name to address a student other than the name listed on a student’s birth certificate, or derivatives thereof, without the written permission of a student’s parents or guardians.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In higher education, Hashmi said there is also a growing argument from Republicans that higher learning is not essential and students should be diverted to trade programs instead. While workers are needed across the economic sector, she said, the proposed measure should not be implemented at the expense of higher education.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Governor keeps Project 2025 author on GMU Board of Visitors</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lindsey Burke, appointed by Youngkin to a four-year term on the Board of Visitors at George Mason University, is one of the authors of Project 2025 and director of the Center for Education Policy at the Heritage Foundation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some state leaders have criticized her role in the plan. Virginia House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, </span><a href="https://x.com/DonScott757/status/1820884230999830666" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">urged</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the governor in an Aug. 2 letter to remove Burke from her seat on the board, writing that “her extreme views are alarming and contradicts the commonwealth’s efforts.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin responded by writing that the commonwealth is “very fortunate” to have Burke on the board and said he has no intention of removing her. He said Burke was among his early higher education appointees because of her extensive preschool, K-12 and higher education policy background.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Removing her would not only do a tremendous disservice to George Mason University, but it would also undermine the spirit of Virginians from all walks of life coming together to improve their community and their commonwealth,” Youngkin wrote. </span></p>

Bob Good, R-Campbell, speaks at a campaign rally in Powhatan County. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even after an additional review of the recount results in the GOP primary in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District last week </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/28/outcome-of-5th-district-gop-primary-unchanged-after-further-review-of-ballots/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">confirmed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> state Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland, as the winner, some Republican hardliners in the district refuse to accept the former Navy SEAL who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump as their party’s nominee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, they have vowed to write in U.S. Rep. Bob Good, R-Farmville, the incumbent, who lost what has been deemed one of the most expensive and viciously fought nomination battles nationwide this year by a mere 366 votes out of more than 62,000 cast.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="m3uVfZfHcX"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/28/outcome-of-5th-district-gop-primary-unchanged-after-further-review-of-ballots/">Outcome of 5th District GOP primary unchanged after further review of ballots</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Outcome of 5th District GOP primary unchanged after further review of ballots&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/28/outcome-of-5th-district-gop-primary-unchanged-after-further-review-of-ballots/embed/#?secret=pft4Xcx0mI#?secret=m3uVfZfHcX" data-secret="m3uVfZfHcX" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Anyone with the right moral conviction would write in Bob Good, one of the 10 true conservatives left in Congress,” said Rob Reese, owner of the Virginia Archery Center in Goochland County and a member of a group of self-described “real conservatives” who are encouraging fellow Republicans in the district to write in Good on Nov. 5.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a phone interview Tuesday, Reese painted McGuire as a RINO, a​​ derogatory moniker meaning “Republican In Name Only,” who was handpicked by the GOP establishment in Washington, D.C., as part of an effort to replace true conservatives in Congress. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The swamp has been trying to get rid of every conservative that they can get their hands on,” Reese said. The Republican Party — in Virginia and on the national level — “pulled the same garbage in District 5 that the Democrats pulled” when they replaced President Joe Biden with Vice President Kamala Harris as their presidential nominee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They just hid it better. You don’t primary the most conservative Congress member and replace him with a uni-party yes-boy,” Reese said, adding that the number of Republicans who insist on making Good their nominee has continued to grow despite the incumbent’s failed recount challenge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s thousands of us, enough to cause McGuire to lose the election unless he ponies up and talks to the people,” Reese said. “This isn’t a we-win game to me, it’s about the republic, and people taking the republic back from D.C., and I think they are more in a panic than they can believe.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the district’s Republicans air their differences on social media — like the Facebook group </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/Va5thDistrictGOP/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia&#8217;s 5th Congressional District GOP Voters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and even Good’s own campaign account on the platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Responding to </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/17EToxdKG3/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a post from Good</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from last week in which he thanked </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the judges for their efforts to “address some mistakes that had been identified after the recount,” several of his supporters chimed in, thanking him for his service and encouraging others to join the write-in effort.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Folks … write in Good for Congress! Express your anger, don’t vote McGuire, write in Bob! Mount the write in campaign, don’t let McGuire win that seat,” one commenter wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another told Good to “keep up the good work … and folks, please write Bob Good in come November, he’s the only choice we have for America First conservative constitutional representation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The comment prompted a response from a McGuire supporter: “Why do you keep telling people to write Bob in, are you trying to get a Democrat control? Cause that will happen if McGuire doesn’t receive all Republican votes. Bob Good lost, don’t have our state lose.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire will face Democrat Gloria Witt, a businesswoman and native of Amherst County, in the Nov. 5 election. Witt is fighting an uphill battle in a heavily Republican district where  Trump won twice with 53% of the vote in 2016 and 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a significant amount of write-ins splitting the Republican vote could potentially put the district in play for Democrats, said David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The 5th is a tricky district, it is clearly Republican-leaning, but the margin of the win has been all over the place. And in 2008 the Democratic Party won it by 800 votes, so I don’t think the McGuire campaign can just ignore a write-in effort on behalf of Bob Good,” Richards said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And McGuire is facing several headwinds in his general election campaign, Richards added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is the write-in campaign, ill-will left over from the primary, a small but vocal </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/03/va-republican-voters-officials-press-for-harris-over-trump/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans for Kamala Harris</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> effort, a muted campaign so far from McGuire, a very active campaign from Democrat Gloria Witt, and general national excitement among Democrats that may elevate Democratic turnout. It is not clear that all of this will add up to enough to swing the district, but it certainly makes it more likely.”</span></p>

Republican voters, officials press for Harris over Trump&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/03/va-republican-voters-officials-press-for-harris-over-trump/embed/#?secret=e7WPL6W0Rr#?secret=GKuITNBkSL" data-secret="GKuITNBkSL" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It remains unclear if the write-in effort by Good supporters would trigger Virginia’s so-called </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/27/2023-elections-bring-new-scrutiny-of-virginias-sore-loser-rule/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sore loser law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which was designed to ensure that when a candidate is defeated in a Republican or Democratic primary, they can’t drop their party affiliation and appear on the general election ballot next to the person who beat them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rich Anderson, the chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia, said in a phone interview Tuesday that under state party rules, “any member of a subunit of RPV who supports a candidate against a nominated Republican” is deemed to have resigned from the Republican Party and is prohibited from engaging in any party activity for a period of four years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That is a rule that I must and will enforce stringently in this or any future election cycle,” Anderson said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sean Brown, a spokesman for McGuire’s campaign, said while  McGuire “is working hard to deliver Virginia for Donald Trump and build a conservative majority in the House and Senate,” Good and a “very small handful of his supporters” continue to undermine Trump. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For the sake of the country, Bob should put his personal ambitions and hard feelings towards President Trump aside, and work to elect Trump and Trump-backed candidates,” Brown said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Good himself has not mounted a write-in campaign, and he has remained silent on the ongoing effort by his supporters. His campaign spokeswoman Diana Shores on Tuesday echoed Anderson’s remarks about the party rules and code of conduct. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Individuals who are members of their local units are bound by the party plan to support the nominees. I am urging all Republicans to stay engaged with their Republican committees to do the work that needs to be done,” Shores said in a text message. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin has also vowed to step up and rally in support of McGuire in the 5th District, where the two will be joined by Anderson and Hung Cao, the Republican nominee for U.S. Senate in Virginia, at four events in Amherst, Bedford and Pittsylvania counties and the town of Altavista on Monday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matt Moran, the executive Director of Youngkin’s Spirit of Virginia PAC, said in a statement that the governor is “committed to bringing Republicans together around our nominees so we can win in November,” but he stopped short of singling out the grassroots write-in campaign for Good in the 5th District as a concern for McGuire’s bid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He’s campaigning with Republicans across Virginia on why we need strong leadership back in the White House and in Congress,” Moran said of Youngkin. “We are confident that Republicans are united as our campaigns gear up for the fall.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the governor’s efforts will likely fall on deaf ears among some of Good’s most loyal supporters who have long made up their minds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among them is Russ Simpson, owner of the Apple Shed &amp; Chapel in Lovingston, who said that McGuire lost his vote because he did not debate Good during his primary campaign. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you’re running for office to represent me, you damn well better be a fighter. If you’re not willing to fight and to debate, then I’m not interested in supporting you, whether you’re a Republican or whatever,” Simpson said in a phone interview. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While he doesn’t support the policies of the Democratic Party, he is not willing to vote for a candidate just because he has an R by his name, Simpson added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s going to be a lot of people who will write in Bob Good, you’re looking at a significant amount of people, and that could play heavily into him losing. I don’t like being in this position but (McGuire) has put the whole district in a conundrum, and I wish there was a remedy to this situation,” Simpson said. </span></p>

(Photo by Stephen Maturen/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Clint Taylor, for years the extent of his engagement in politics had just been filling in circles on ballots, he said. But now, he’s active in  political advocacy, encouraging people to shift support from Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump this year — despite having voted for Trump in 2016 himself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taylor decided to back President Joe Biden in 2020 and will support Vice President Kamala Harris this year, he said. It’s a move that some Virginia Republicans are making as they seek a candidate whose values align more closely with their own. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There must be other Republicans like me out there that are uncomfortable with Trump,” Taylor said in a call. “I just want to tell them that you don&#8217;t have to vote for him.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fairfax County lawyer also offered up a testimonial video for a campaign called </span><a href="https://rvat.org/?state_filter=va&amp;text_search#testimonials" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Voters Against Trump</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The website features videos from Republicans or former Trump voters around the country sharing why they’re not voting for Trump in this year’s presidential election, according to Rylee Boyd, a campaign spokesperson. Some of the participants voted for Trump during his 2016 or 2020 campaigns, or both, before deciding they can no longer support him. The campaign is investing $50 million in digital advertisements and outreach with a focus on swing states like Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeff Ryer, a spokesperson for Trump’s campaign in Virginia, is skeptical of some of the video participants. He noted how Virginia doesn’t have party registration when signing up to vote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am anxious to hear exactly what leads some of these individuals to identify as Republicans,” he said. “As was the case in 2016 and 2020, President Trump is the Republican nominee this year. Might I suggest that if they’ve yet to vote for him and plan on voting against him this year, they may never have been Republicans in the first place.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taylor once considered himself more of a Republican, having grown up in a conservative bastion in Texas, and he agrees with the party’s fiscally conservative approach to governance. But he doesn’t think Trump’s </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/27/trump-harris-tax-cuts-00175441" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plans to further cut corporate tax rates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will be able to benefit people widely. More than policy, he is concerned about Trump’s temperament as a national leader and his influence within the Republican party. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two pivotal moments for Taylor came when Trump appeared to refer to the Nazis and white supremacists that violently marched through Charlottesville as “very fine people” and when a violent mob stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 following Trump’s refusal to accept the 2020 election results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t believe that this man said that,&#8221; Taylor said in his video. &#8220;It still gets me riled up today that he would defend those torch-wielding Nazis.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>In a 2017 <a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2019/apr/26/context-trumps-very-fine-people-both-sides-remarks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.politifact.com/article/2019/apr/26/context-trumps-very-fine-people-both-sides-remarks/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1725466097541000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2DUbwV93uFfBq_4gBdO7ro">press conference after the Unite The Right rally</a>, Trump told reporters that he thought there were &#8220;very fine people on both sides&#8221; and condemned the Nazis within the crowd.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump’s connections to authoritarian leaders of other countries also concerns Taylor, a sentiment shared by Washington County resident Greg Hawley, who also submitted a testimonial to Republican Voters Against Trump. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a military veteran and retired school teacher, Hawley wants to peacefully enjoy his retirement years. However, he’s been “fretting over this election.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hawley said he’s been concerned about Trump’s growing influence on the Republican party along with the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank’s, influence on Trump. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The writings are on the wall,” he said of the foundation’s presidential playbook, “Project 2025,” and of actions Trump has already taken that align with some of it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hawley points to how Trump’s U.S. Supreme Court picks stemmed from Heritage Foundation and Federalist Society recommendations — </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all of whom upheld Roe v. Wade as federal law during confirmations hearing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s before ultimately ruling to undo the federal abortion protections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hawley sees the ability to get an abortion as “primarily a healthcare issue” and he worries how much Trump might tap into the rest of the playbook. On abortion alone, chapter 14 entails </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/28/mcclellan-spanberger-work-to-repeal-parts-of-19th-century-law-that-could-ban-abortion-nationally/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">employing a long-dormant federal law to further restrict abortion medication and mailing of abortifacients</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Critics and reproductive rights advocates have said this could pave the way for a national ban.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump has distanced himself from the blueprint, despite his ties to several of its authors. The foundation has previously published presidential playbooks dating back to President Ronald Reagan, and </span><a href="https://www.heritage.org/impact/trump-administration-embraces-heritage-foundation-policy-recommendations" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">touted how Trump utilized previous guidance during his first term as president</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hawley is also worried about a statement Trump made this summer at a gathering where he told people that “</span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-tells-christians-they-wont-have-vote-after-this-election-2024-07-27/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in four years, [they] won’t have to vote again</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hawley said that moments like that are where he believes Trump has “let it slip” that he would move towards a more “strong arm government.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Pushback from politicians</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the Democratic National Convention earlier this month, </span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/21/who-are-the-anti-trump-republicans-showing-up-at-the-dnc" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a handful of Republicans, including former Trump administration officials</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, offered support for Harris’ campaign. Some high-profile conservative leaders in Virginia are backing Harris as well. Former Republican 10th District Rep. Barbara Comstock</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/18/barbara-comstock-vote-kamala-harris/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said in an interview earlier this month that she will be voting for Harris</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and former 5th District Rep. Denver Riggleman hosted a campaign event at his distillery. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“After Jan. 6, after Donald Trump has refused for four years to acknowledge that he lost, and his threats against democracy, I think it’s important to turn the page,” Comstock said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview with The Mercury, Riggleman said he believes that independent and Republican </span><a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/government-politics/denver-riggleman-says-kamala-harris-could-help-reset-republican-politics/article_b5b21f80-55d9-11ef-b136-ffdc8b61e1af.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voters feeling frustrated with Trump can help give her an edge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What it comes down to is the moral depravity of that man — what he&#8217;s done against our democratic institutions,” Riggleman said in a call with Virginia Mercury. “But also his treatment of women, his treatment of immigrants, and what he says about them, his words about military veterans. You get that feeling that this is just a narcissist who only cares about himself.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/20/harris-holds-slim-lead-over-trump-in-virginia-roanoke-college-poll-says/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> out of Roanoke College shows Harris has a slight lead over Trump. It’s among the first polling since Harris became the new Democratic candidate following Biden dropping out of the race. Democratic strategists </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/26/strategists-analysts-see-excitement-and-pathways-for-kamala-harris-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">see pathways to victory for Harris </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">given her support for reproductive rights and past experience in politics and as a prosecutor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Ryer called Riggleman and Comstock “lapsed Republicans” that are endorsing Democrats to seek “fawning press coverage and appearances on MSNBC.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Riggleman also said Trump’s presence looms too large over the party he was once represented. He noted how the contest between his congressional successor U.S. Rep. Bob Good, R-Farmville and challenger </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/28/outcome-of-5th-district-gop-primary-unchanged-after-further-review-of-ballots/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">John McGuire</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hinged largely on whoever appeared to have the most </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/05/marjorie-taylor-green-calls-bob-good-a-liar-and-john-mcguire-a-loyalist-at-rally/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fealty to Trump</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rather than policy debates. (McGuire defeated Good, an outcome confirmed after a lengthy recount process and extra court review of ballots in five precincts.)  Riggleman also pointed to how Virginia U.S. Senate candidate Hung Cao — who hopes to unseat Democrat Tim Kaine — emerged from a crowded GOP candidate pool with Trump’s endorsement.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It goes to show where the Republican Party of Virginia is right now,” Riggleman said. “[It’s] so damaged in this state that Cao could get through the nomination process.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine and Harris will have Riggleman’s vote this year and while the 5th District is reliably Republican and poses an uphill battle for McGuire’s democratic challenger Gloria Witt, Riggleman said he’s considering voting for her, too. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This doesn’t mean he always agrees with Democrats on policy, he said, but “at least they don’t want to overturn our Democratic institutions.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Editor&#8217;s note: </i>This article has been updated to clarify that Trump referred to different groups at the Unite the Right rally, including white supremacists and counter protesters, as having &#8220;very fine people&#8221; and also condemned Nazis in the same press conference.</p>

Every voting bloc will count – including members of labor unions and other people in their households.</p>
<p>The majority of union leaders have over generations <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7591/j.ctv3s8mr0" target="_blank">endorsed Democratic candidates</a>, and <a href="https://theconversation.com/democratic-partys-embrace-of-organized-labor-in-2024-elections-has-long-roots-that-had-started-to-wither-237002" target="_blank">this race is no exception</a>. Although rank-and-file union members have also historically sided with the Democratic Party by large margins, that support has wavered for at least the past 45 years. In 2016, <a href="https://onlabor.org/the-union-household-vote-revisited/" target="_blank">exit polls indicated</a> that voters in union households supported Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton over Trump by only 8 percentage points, down from 18 percentage points in 2012 when Barack Obama was on the ballot.</p>
<p>No Democratic presidential nominee had fared worse with union voters since Ronald <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/labor-unions-hillary-clinton-mobilization-231223" target="_blank">Reagan’s wins over Jimmy Carter and Walter Mondale in 1980 and 1984</a>.</p>
<p>Union voters are particularly <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/union2.pdf" target="_blank">prominent in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Nevada</a>, three swing states where the share of voters who belong to unions is above the national average of 10%.</p>
<p>A late 2023 <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/31/politics/union-voters-election-trump-biden/index.html" target="_blank">New York Times/Siena College poll of six swing states</a> that Joe Biden won in 2020 – those three plus Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin – shows that Biden and Trump were tied at 47% among union voters when they were asked who they’d vote for in 2024. Biden had an <a href="https://cces.gov.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">8 percentage point advantage with these same voters in 2020</a>, according to a different survey.</p>
<h2>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">3 key issues</h4>

	</h2>
<p>Union voters, like all U.S. citizens, are concerned about many issues. But they are more likely than most people to seriously consider a candidate’s record in terms of support for workers and organized labor. Labor historians generally concur that the <a href="https://theconversation.com/bidens-labor-report-card-historian-gives-union-joe-a-higher-grade-than-any-president-since-fdr-228771" target="_blank">Biden administration</a> has the second-strongest labor-friendly record, after Franklin D. Roosevelt.</p>
<p>And I find that <a href="https://prospect.org/labor/2024-07-18-grand-old-party-for-workers/" target="_blank">historian Nelson Lichtenstein, who contends that Trump’s years</a> in office were bad for organized labor, is representative of how labor experts see his track record.</p>
<p>In my view as a labor studies scholar, three aspects of the candidates’ records are the most likely to sway union members one way or the other.</p>
<p><strong>Federal workers</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/10/21/2019-23021/executive-orders-13836-13837-and-13839" target="_blank">Trump signed</a> <a href="https://www.federaltimes.com/management/2018/05/25/trump-targets-feds-in-latest-series-of-executive-orders/" target="_blank">three executive orders in 2018</a> that restricted the labor rights of approximately 950,000 federal government employees who belong to unions. In 2020, he signed another measure, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/02/28/trump-plan-omb-schedule-f-nteu/" target="_blank">known as Schedule F</a>, that The Washington Post described as “designed to gut civil service job protections.”</p>
<p>Biden <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/22/executive-order-protecting-the-federal-workforce." target="_blank">rescinded those executive orders</a>. He also established a White House task force charged with making recommendations for how to streamline the procedures for federal worker union organizing, which Harris chaired. The number of <a href="https://www.afge.org/article/union-membership-in-federal-sector-went-up-in-2023/" target="_blank">federal employees in unions</a> has <a href="https://www.govexec.com/federal-news/2024/07/unpacking-kamala-harris-record-federal-workforce-issues/398226/" target="_blank">risen by tens of thousands</a> during the Biden administration.</p>
<p><strong>Union elections</strong></p>
<p>Rules governing how elections are conducted once workers express an interest in forming a union date back to the 1930s, when Roosevelt signed the <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/guidance/key-reference-materials/national-labor-relations-act" target="_blank">National Labor Relations Act</a> into law. The <a href="https://sunypress.edu/Books/T/The-Making-of-the-National-Labor-Relations-Board2" target="_blank">National Labor Relations Board</a>, created by that legislation, oversees union elections.</p>
<p>In 2019, when Trump appointees held a majority of the NLRB’s five seats, the board overturned an Obama-era NLRB ruling mandating speedy elections. In 2023, when Biden’s appointees were in the majority, the board issued a ruling favorable to unions that rolled back that Trump-era ruling.</p>
<p>Today, when a majority of workers in a workplace say they want union representation, an employer must either recognize and bargain with the union or seek an election. If that employer violates labor law in the period before the election, the election is called off and the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/nlrb-restores-obama-era-rule-speeding-up-union-election-process-2023-08-24/" target="_blank">NLRB may order the employer</a> to recognize and bargain with the union.</p>
<p><strong>OSHA</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.osha.gov/aboutosha" target="_blank">Occupational Safety and Health Administration</a>, a Labor Department agency, is responsible for U.S. workers’ health and safety.</p>
<p>Fewer workplace inspections occurred during the Trump administration than during <a href="https://www.osha.gov/enforcement/2015-enforcement-summary" target="_blank">Obama’s second term</a>. This decline is largely attributable to the slow hiring of new OSHA inspectors to <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/8/18/21366388/osha-worker-safety-trump" target="_blank">replace those who had retired</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/safety/inspector-numbers-up-20-during-biden-administration-osha-says" target="_blank">number of inspections is rising again</a>. However, by OSHA’s calculations, workplace accidents and fatalities have <a href="https://publicintegrity.org/politics/system-failure/deaths-cutbacks-workplace-safety-inspections-osha/" target="_blank">increased during the Biden administration</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/03/02/osha-inspections-covid-oig-report/" target="_blank">Trump administration issued no workplace rules</a> about coronavirus safety, leaving hundreds of thousands of people employed in health care, groceries, meatpacking and education at risk.</p>
<p>By comparison, two days after taking office in 2021, Biden issued an executive order that established masking guidelines, and his administration <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/agencies/asa/hhs-covid-19-workplace-safety-plan/index.html" target="_blank">made health and safety protocols on the job</a> during the rest of the COVID-19 pandemic a high priority.</p>
<p>Compared with the inaction by the Trump administration during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Biden administration has been more active in proposing health and safety measures. For example, in July 2024 it proposed rules designed to protect some 36 million workers from <a href="https://www.osha.gov/news/newsreleases/national/07022024" target="_blank">health risks associated with extreme heat</a>. After a period for written comments, public hearings will be held on the bill.</p>
<p>When Trump tried cutting OSHA funding for 2018 by approximately US$10 million, Congress blocked his efforts. The Biden administration is <a href="https://www.safetyandhealthmagazine.com/articles/25147-biden-administration-seeking-a-37-budget-increase-for-osha" target="_blank">seeking a 3.7% increase in OSHA’s budget</a> for the 2025 fiscal year.</p>
<h2>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Legislative and gubernatorial records</h4>

	</h2>
<p>Harris was a U.S. senator before she became vice president; her vice presidential running mate, Tim Walz, is the governor of Minnesota and was a member of Congress before that; and Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance is currently a U.S. senator as well. The candidates’ records in those positions are also indicators of what they might attempt to do in the White House.</p>
<p>The AFL-CIO, the largest umbrella organization for U.S. unions, gave Harris a <a href="https://aflcio.org/scorecard/legislators/kamala-harris" target="_blank">lifetime score of 98%</a> on her Senate voting record. <a href="https://aflcio.org/scorecard/legislators/tim-walz" target="_blank">Walz</a> got a 93% rating for his votes from the AFL-CIO when he served in the House of Representatives. He belonged to the <a href="https://www.nea.org/about-nea/media-center/press-releases/nea-endorses-vp-walz" target="_blank">National Education Association</a>, the nation’s largest labor union, while working as a high school teacher.</p>
<p>As Minnesota’s governor, Walz signed into law <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/06/nx-s1-5065626/labor-unions-tim-walz-minnesota-running-mate-vp" target="_blank">paid sick days for the state’s workers</a> and a measure that made Minnesota the first state to establish a minimum wage for Uber and Lyft drivers. In 2023, Walz also signed a law that established the Nursing Home Workforce Standards Board to oversee the health and welfare of nursing home workers.</p>
<p>The AFL-CIO has given <a href="https://aflcio.org/scorecard/legislators/jd-vance" target="_blank">Vance a 0%</a> rating for his Senate votes as of mid-2024. Among other things, Vance opposed the nominations of several judges and government officials with pro-labor track records.</p>
<h2>Addressing auto workers</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most visible sign of <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/biden-makes-history-striking-auto-workers-picket-line-rcna117348" target="_blank">Biden’s support for labor unions</a> came when he walked a Michigan picket line with striking members of the United Auto Workers in September 2023. He was the first president to do so.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/sep/27/donald-trump-michigan-uaw-autoworkers" target="_blank">Trump turned up nearby</a> the next day. He gave a speech at a nonunion auto parts plant.</p>
<p>More recently, Trump did himself no favors with labor voters and their allies when, in a highly publicized conversation with Tesla, SpaceX and X CEO Elon Musk, <a href="https://x.com/UAW/status/1823343962012123254" target="_blank">he praised Musk for firing employees</a> who <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-and-musk-discussed-firing-striking-workers-the-uaw-is-now-seeking-an-nlrb-investigation" target="_blank">spoke out on workplace problems</a> and attempted to unionize.</p>
<p>How union households will vote in 2024 is not clear. But there’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/29/swing-states-candidate-visits-summer/" target="_blank">no doubt that the Harris and Trump campaigns</a> are certain that it will matter, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/silver-bulletpoints-the-union-vote-could-swing-the-election/" target="_blank">just as it did in 2020</a>, when Biden narrowly won <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/11/10/joe-biden-flipped-blue-wall-states-michigan-wisconsin-pennsylvania/6221295002/" target="_blank">Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania</a> – and in 2016, when Clinton lost those states.</p>

A shortage of new homes is driving continued high housing costs, casting doubt on Virginia's future growth. (Parker Michels-Boyce/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Democratic lawmakers praised Vice President Kamala Harris’ housing policy plans in a virtual call Wednesday afternoon. The gathering came on the heels of a new </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHgmtsNxT8c" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">campaign ad</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> highlighting Harris’ plan to build three million new homes and rental units if elected president. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan is part of a proposal she unveiled ahead of the Democratic National Convention, which includes providing $</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/16/harris-unveils-plan-to-curb-price-gouging-boost-child-tax-credit-tackle-rent-hikes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">25,000 in down payment assistance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for some first-time homebuyers and tax incentives for builders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2021 Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt559-1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that most Virginains affected by affordable housing issues are  renters. It also found that a declining number of Virginians can afford to purchase a home, while the state has an estimated shortage of at least 200,000 affordable rental units. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep. Don Beyer, D-Alexandria, said that Harris’ plans will help local governments handle affordable housing issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She can do this by deploying tax incentives to build starter homes to alleviate the shortage of houses on the market for aspiring homeowners,” Beyer said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He pointed to Harris’ support of increasing </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3238" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">low income housing tax credits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that local governments could utilize for construction of new homes and apartments. These tax breaks to developers help incentivize development of homes to various percentages of area median income. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/bill-to-boost-affordable-housing-advances-to-youngkin/article_33e7b884-dd8e-11ee-96af-a7e0399a77a3.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">many localities in Virginia lack the authority to utilize LIHTC credits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when negotiating developments and redevelopments with companies and a bill that would have expanded those abilities was </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb597" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this year by the governor. This is where state and federal levels of government can be helpful to local governments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alexandria councilman John Chapman stressed how increasing affordable housing options is “not a hyper-local issue.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to hear that at the state level, and we love to hear that at the federal level, that there’s a need for supply, and there are also going to be some additional tools,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing is a personal issue for him, Chapman said, as someone benefiting from living in the home that his mother was able to purchase, in part, from down payment assistance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know personally of the effect of the generational wealth that has passed along from family to family,” Chapman said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of Harris’ policy platforms will hinge on who controls the U.S. House and Senate next year if she is elected. In Virginia, Sen. Tim Kaine is running for re-election and all 11 congressional seats are in play.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyer said that he thinks the fact that both Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, have previously served in Congress can bode well for them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said that he thinks both candidates “struck a bipartisan and post-partisan tone in the convention.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bolstering housing supply is also something former president Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, wants to address if re-elected. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump&#8217;s </span><a href="https://rncplatform.donaldjtrump.com/?_gl=1*q92itj*_gcl_aw*R0NMLjE3MjQ4NTUyNDMuQ2p3S0NBandsYnUyQmhBM0Vpd0EzeVh5dXlZZkRuWFJsLWc0MUZVNGpZYm1lVHl5bDY1bnAtMmJ3UldUWDk3cEdOOTYwUGpVMExpb1d4b0NyRWdRQXZEX0J3RQ..*_gcl_au*MTEyODczNjg3NS4xNzI0ODU1MjQz&amp;_ga=2.204398551.651488926.1724855243-1160544380.1724855243&amp;_gac=1.22146377.1724855243.CjwKCAjwlbu2BhA3EiwA3yXyuyYfDnXRl-g41FU4jYbmeTyyl65np-2bwRWTX97pGN960PjU0LioWxoCrEgQAvD_BwE" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">housing plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> include opening portions of federal lands to allow for new home construction while addressing inflation overall, as well as building on previous efforts to r</span><a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-establishing-white-house-council-eliminating-regulatory-barriers-affordable-housing/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">educe regulatory barriers to construction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his first term in office he created Opportunity Zones meant to attract investors to underinvested neighborhoods, but there’s n</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/02/business/economy/opportunity-zones-trump-impact.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ot enough evidence to determine if poverty declined more in these zones than elsewhere.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>

<p>Jeff Ryer, a spokesman for the Trump campaign in Virginia said that &#8220;Trump will defeat inflation, lower mortgage rates and make homeownership an achievable dream again for Virginia families.&#8221;</p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland, remains the winner in a highly contested GOP primary in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District, following an unexpected additional review of ballots from five of the district’s 24 localities almost one month after a full recount that did not significantly change the outcome of the election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working with the registrars from Amherst, Cumberland, Halifax and Mecklenburg Counties and the city of Danville, who had </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/26/court-summons-back-five-localities-for-new-hearing-in-5th-district-gop-primary-recount/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">been summoned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the Goochland County Circuit Court Wednesday afternoon, a three-judge panel corrected some minor reporting errors that resulted in incumbent U.S. Rep. Bob Good, R-Farmville, picking up four more votes, bringing down McGuire’s winning margin down to 366 votes.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court also reviewed a petition filed by Good’s attorney Brad Marss objecting to some of the recount-related expenses billed to the congressman’s campaign. The court agreed to some of the objections, resulting in a reduction of the total cost from $104,000 to $88,918 — less than the $96,500 that Goochland’s Chief Judge Claude Worrell, who headed the recount panel, had estimated at a preliminary hearing in July. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve reviewed, and reviewed, and reviewed,” Worrell said at the conclusion of Wednesday’s hearing. “We asked the representatives of the different areas to come in to show us what we were looking at, but in the end it got a little bit more complicated than that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During their review the judges identified some reporting methods by the registrars that differed slightly from the court’s initial instructions, resulting in numbers that didn’t line up correctly with the final tally. But the differences were too small to impact the outcome of the recount or the election overall. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jason Corwin, the general registrar in Mecklenburg County, said in a phone interview earlier this week that his staff discovered several minor math errors made during the recount in two of the county’s 22 precincts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we took the original recount certification sheet, we put down a couple of wrong numbers. One was 36 and should have been 37, and one was for early voting where we put down 283 and 128, and they were both off by one vote,” Corwin said in the interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good’s campaign  </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/07/10/good-files-recount-petition-in-highly-contested-5th-district-gop-primary-race/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filed a petition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a district-wide recount eight days after the election </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/07/02/state-elections-board-certifies-congressional-primaries-cementing-mcguires-victory-over-good/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">was certified</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the State Board of Elections in early July. The chairman of the powerful House Freedom Caucus told supporters in an email at the time that he was seeking a “complete recount,” including a hand-count and paper ballot match to the reported machine results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bernard Goodwyn, the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Virginia, then appointed the three-panel recount court, consisting of Worrell, Judge J. Christopher Clemens of Salem and Judge Christopher Papile of Newport News. Initially, Worrell ordered the recount for July 31, but later pushed it back by a day due to scheduling conflicts. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the recount, McGuire’s lead over Good was 0.6%, which put the incumbent within the 1% margin allowing him to request a recount at his campaign’s expense, but above the 0.5% threshold that would require localities to pay for it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Candidate-funded recounts are rare in Virginia, because of the high cost and because they rarely change the outcome of elections. And after the court reviewed the recounted election returns that election officials from across the district had delivered to the Goochland County Circuit Court on Aug. 1, Good picked up a mere four votes, bringing down McGuire’s winning margin to 370 and effectively ending Good’s bid for a third term in office. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court on Wednesday agreed to honor some, but not all, of Good’s objections to the cost assessed by the court in the days after the recount. For example, it sustained a motion by Marss to toss out a $2,800 bill by Lunenburg County for its county attorney, agreeing that this expense was “undocumented” and not “reasonably necessary to the proceedings.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the court ruled other expenses billed by the localities as justified, including mileage and other travel expenses filed by election officials and sheriff’s deputies, who escorted registrars carrying ballots to Goochland on Aug. 1. The court also kept in place its order that Good’s campaign pay for meals and catering expenses incurred by election workers during the process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking with reporters inside the courtroom on Wednesday, Marss — Good’s attorney — said that the court’s decision to hold another hearing weeks after the conclusion of the recount was highly unusual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Having a hearing like this one I haven’t heard of before,” Marss said. “I consider it unfortunate that it happened that way. Had it not been for the discrepancies from the localities, this would have not been done in a hearing but by way of written memos.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good said in a text message after the hearing that his campaign will pay the cost determined by the court as required within 21 days. He also thanked the court for correcting the irregularities in the final tally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I appreciate the efforts of the judges to address some mistakes that had been identified after the recount,” Good said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sean Brown, a McGuire spokesman, said that the changes that the court reviewed Wednesday were “all clerical errors” by either the registrars or the court on recount day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The court sustained Good’s objections to costs for the Lunenburg County Attorney, Albemarle Clerk, and sheriff’s deputies. The court said that since it considered the recount to be a court proceeding, those costs shouldn’t be imposed on the parties. The court overruled all of his other objections,” Brown said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire, who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump three weeks before the primary election, had made his campaign a referendum on which candidate is a more loyal supporter of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Trump’s support likely helped push him over the edge — McGuire won the election by a mere 374 votes out of 62,792 cast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within days of losing the recount, Good squashed persistent rumors that he would be seeking the GOP nomination for lieutenant governor in Virginia by filing a formal “statement of candidacy” with the Federal Election Commission declaring that he will once again run in the 5th District in the 2026 election.</span></p>
