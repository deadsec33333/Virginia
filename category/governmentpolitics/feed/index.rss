Glenn Youngkin speaking with reporters on April 8, 2024. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As lawmakers consider Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s proposal to provide vehicle tax relief for Virginians and ultimately eliminate the property tax, policymakers can find comfort after repeals in Rhode Island and Georgia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of Virginia&#8217;s cities, counties and towns are subject to a personal property tax, which helps fund their respective governments. Municipalities are likely to be impacted by such a relief or repeal proposal, including some, like Chesapeake, that have been grappling with reforming vehicle-related taxes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Dec. 18, Youngkin said a family of four in Virginia pays about $290 on their vehicle taxes annually during his address to lawmakers and cabinet members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let&#8217;s give Virginia families relief on the most hated tax in America since the tax on tea &#8211; the local car tax,” Youngkin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the governor did not include a plan to repeal the tax when he first raised the idea last December, this year he proposed an amendment to the current biennium budget to allocate $1.1 billion into a car tax credit fund to provide income tax rebates to nearly 1.9 billion taxpayers earning up to $50,000 in adjusted gross income for individuals or $100,000 for couples filing jointly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eligible taxpayers would receive up to $150 for individual returns or $300 for joint returns annually for the next three years. After the fund is exhausted, the state would see a permanent reduction of $360 million in tax revenues each year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If successful, Virginia would join several states and jurisdictions that do not impose a vehicle tax including the District of Columbia, Georgia, Maryland and Rhode Island.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a Nov. 7, 2023 </span><a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/2023/rpt/pdf/2023-R-0196.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislative report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> completed in Connecticut, which was studying tax repeals, Rhode Island and Georgia over the past seven years repealed their vehicle property tax either by adjusting tax calculation factors by an increasing amount over a number of years, or enacting it only for taxpayers that perform a triggering action, such as applying for a vehicle title.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Georgia and Rhode Island took different approaches to address local governments’ revenue losses. Rhode Island reimbursed revenue losses from general appropriations and adjusted reimbursements based on sales tax revenues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Georgia replaced its state and local annual property and sales taxes with a one-time per owner tax, divided between the state and municipalities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, West Virginia </span><a href="https://www.wvnews.com/mountainstatesman/news/taylor-county-west-virginia-assessor-explains-hb2526-and-the-motor-vehicle-property-tax-adjustment-credit/article_182eafb2-257e-11ee-afe4-8ba9d7735e92.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">created</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a fully refundable tax credit to eliminate the tax’s impact on residents while holding municipalities harmless, which took effect in 2024.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1998, Virginia developed a vehicle tax </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title58.1/chapter35.1/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">relief program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but the reimbursement rate starting at 12.5% was frozen at 70% in 2021, below the anticipated 100%, due to unforeseen costs as new car values increased substantially faster than inflation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia lawmakers will start their 45-day session discussing proposed bills and budget amendments on Jan. 8.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TikTok and its parent company, ByteDance, sued the U.S. government over the law, saying it impeded their First Amendment rights, but a federal appeals court recently upheld the law. The high court will hear oral arguments in the appeal case Jan. 10.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Allowing TikTok to operate in the United States without severing its ties to the Chinese Communist Party exposes Americans to the undeniable risks of having their data accessed and exploited by the Chinese Communist Party,” Miyares, a Republican, said in a statement announcing the amicus brief. “The Supreme Court now has the chance to affirm Congress’s authority to protect Americans from foreign threats while ensuring that the First Amendment doesn’t become a tool to defend foreign adversaries’ exploitative practices.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7521/text?s=1&amp;r=1&amp;q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22Protecting+Americans+from+Foreign+Adversary+Controlled+Applications+Act%22%7D" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was introduced in March, members of Virginia’s congressional delegation supported it. Democratic U.S. Reps. Abigail Spanberger and Bobby Scott said the measure would protect Americans against foreign digital threats, while U.S. Sens. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, and Marco Rubio, R-Florida, who co-chair the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, supported the House’s action against TikTok. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In December 2023, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin issued an </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/eo/EO-24---Banning-the-Use-of-Certain-Applications-and-Websites-on-State-Government-Technology.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executive order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> banning the use of TikiTok “on any government-issued devices, including state-issued cell phones, laptops, or other devices capable of connecting to the internet except for public safety purposes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares co-led the amicus brief alongside Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen. Attorneys General in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, and Utah also signed on in support.</span></p>

<p><strong>From the story:</strong> Of the roughly 2 million Virginians who’d been enrolled in Medicaid before the COVID-19 pandemic, over 480,000 of them have been disenrolled as of this August. Typically eligibility determinations are made annually, but they’d been on pause nationwide amid the pandemic due to federal policy. That’s changed over the past year in what’s colloquially referred to as “Medicaid Unwinding” as provisions of federal law have expired. <em><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/nearly-500000-virginians-in-medicaid-have-been-disenrolled/"><strong>Read more.</strong></a></em></p>

General Assembly members mostly understand the connection, leading to a lively debate in last year’s legislative session over whether to override some local permit denials for solar projects – and if so, how to ensure the localities still have some say. Though none of the legislative proposals moved forward last year, the topic has become a central one for the recently revamped Commission on Electric Utility Regulation (CEUR). </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/03/data-centers-approved-solar-farms-rejected-what-is-going-on-in-rural-virginia/"><b>Read more.</b></a></p>

(Pixabay/Creative Commons license)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia lawmakers are preparing to reintroduce bipartisan legislation aimed at creating a regulated and taxed adult-use cannabis marketplace in the state. The renewed push comes after Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed a similar proposal earlier this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax, and Sen. Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach, are once again spearheading the effort, planning to bring forward the same proposal that previously passed both chambers of the General Assembly with bipartisan support. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB448" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The measure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as sent to Youngkin’s desk at the time, would establish a legal framework to regulate the sale and taxation of cannabis for adults 21 and older, marking a significant step toward implementing the retail market many advocates have long championed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re trying to start with the same bill since we were able to get both chambers aboard, including a couple Republicans. I think there’s a good chance that a few more Republicans will join in this time, especially in the Senate,” Krizek said in a phone interview earlier this week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While several GOP lawmakers supported the proposal at various points as it moved through the legislature during the 2024 session, only Sen. Christie New Craig, R-Chesapeake, voted for the bill’s final version in the state Senate. In the House, freshman Del. Chris Obenshain, R-Montgomery County, a former assistant attorney general, was the sole Republican to back the measure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia was the first southern state to legalize public possession of up to one ounce of marijuana by adults 21 and over and allow them to grow up to four plants of marijuana in a private residence. However, the General Assembly has yet to create a framework for a legal marketplace for cannabis products in the commonwealth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without a legal market in place, residents can grow small amounts at home or possess cannabis, but buying or selling it remains illegal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the proposed plan, the state would license cannabis retailers, establish clear rules for production and sales, and tax products to generate new revenue. Lawmakers argue that a regulated market would also curtail illegal cannabis sales and provide consumer protections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, the General Assembly approved a version of the bill that would have established a market, only for Youngkin to veto the legislation, citing concerns over enforcement and the state’s role in managing cannabis commerce. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The proposed legalization of retail marijuana in the commonwealth endangers Virginians’ health and safety,” </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/101RteYQu09LrjbzzSqiFu9EIxyw7jMcCEnRvwRap-NA/edit?tab=t.0" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">he said in a statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in March. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“States following this path have seen adverse effects on children’s and adolescent’s health and safety, increased gang activity and violent crime, significant deterioration in mental health, decreased road safety, and significant costs associated with retail marijuana that far exceed tax revenue.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin has since repeatedly expressed skepticism about expanding legal cannabis in Virginia, and his spokesman Christian Martinez said on Wednesday that this hasn’t changed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Krizek remains hopeful that in his final year as governor, Youngkin may be open to negotiating with Democrats as he looks to solidify his legacy.</span></p>

Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax (courtesy of Krizek campaign)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can’t get into his head, obviously, but I think it’s for that reason it’s worth trying, it’s worth putting this out as an opportunity for a compromise in some other capacity,” Krizek said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">”I think it&#8217;s very possible, because he’s already a lame duck and this is it for him, and if he wants to have one of his legacies be an unregulated cannabis free-for-all, then that will be his legacy. Or he could choose a rational marketplace with safe, tested and taxed products.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.roanoke.edu/documents/rcpoll/RC%20Poll%20Topline%20Feb2024.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conducted by the Institute for Policy and Opinion Research at Roanoke College and released during the legislative debate found that 63% of Virginians strongly or somewhat support measures to help small businesses compete with pharmaceutical companies and existing medical cannabis dispensaries, while only 15% are somewhat or strongly opposed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And advocates believe there is growing momentum to push the legislation forward again. Supporters highlight the potential for tax revenue, job creation, and investments in addiction treatment and restorative justice programs funded by cannabis taxes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greg Habeeb, a former Republican member of the House of Delegates from Salem and a lobbyist for the Virginia Cannabis Association who helped draft Rouse’s bill earlier this year, said in an interview Thursday that Youngkin’s veto of the legislation caused an explosion of illegal corner marijuana stores, pop up shops and street dealers across the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Everybody who was trying to engage in this market in a proper way, some of the people selling hemp products, some of the people selling CPD products, they’ve almost all been wiped out of business,” Habeeb said. “That’s exactly what we said would happen if the government vetoed the bill to the extent there was a legally operating market in which this is essentially destroyed, and yet every day there are stories about raids and busts and illegal stores.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually Virginia is “going to have to wake up and create a regulated system, so we can get rid of these illegal stores and get this stuff out of the hands of our dealers and kids,” Habeeb said, adding that Republicans will continue to say its  Democrats fault for legalizing cannabis in the first place, and both Democrats and Republicans will continue to blame each other for the status quo, if it remains unchanged.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How that plays out for their individual legacies will have to be seen, but collectively creating a system where it’s legal to possess, legal to share, legal to grow, but illegal to sell in a regulated way, has created this system. It is completely unacceptable and I think history will tell us that it was a disaster.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The discussion around creating a legal marketplace for adult-use cannabis in Virginia is reignited as the Virginia Cannabis Control Authority (CCA) — the state agency created in 2021 to oversee the regulation and enforcement of cannabis laws in Virginia — unveiled its </span><a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/664229cd06b6f9326d1e815c/t/675708223e9a06386996e75e/1733756963828/2024-Virginia-Statewide-Impaired-Driving-Survey-report.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">latest survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on marijuana-impaired driving. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between August and September, the CCA surveyed 783 Virginia residents aged 16 or older with a driver’s license, including 310 who identified as past three-month marijuana users. The results, which build on the inaugural 2022 study, were released as part of National Impaired Driving Prevention Month this December.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey revealed nearly one-third of Virginia drivers believe those who consume marijuana are typically safe drivers. Furthermore, 22% of respondents admitted to driving while high a few times a year or more, and 34% acknowledged riding as passengers with drivers under the influence of marijuana. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forty-six percent of marijuana users reported they do not always plan for a sober ride home. These figures remain unchanged or have increased since the 2022 survey, underscoring the need for continued education and awareness campaigns, the CCA said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite these concerns, the survey also pointed to progress. The percentage of drivers who believe they are likely to be pulled over for driving under the influence of marijuana increased to 29%, up from 24% in 2022. Additionally, 47% of marijuana users said they always plan for a sober ride home, up from 42% last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This survey shows that while we’ve made some progress, there’s still considerable work to do,” said Jeremy Preiss, acting Head and Chief Officer of Regulatory, Policy, and External Affairs at the CCA. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Driving under the influence of marijuana is illegal in Virginia. State law prohibits using cannabis while driving or as a passenger in a vehicle. Violations can result in fines, license suspension, or even jail time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the survey still found that 1 in 10 Virginia drivers (9%) incorrectly assume that there is no penalty for driving under the influence of marijuana.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite enforcement concerns and Youngkin’s previous resistance, Krizek and Rouse — who is seeking his party’s nomination for lieutenant governor in 2025 — remain optimistic that a renewed effort can succeed, especially with continued bipartisan backing and public support for a regulated market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their proposal is expected to be introduced when the General Assembly reconvenes in January. It will likely reignite debate over cannabis reform in Virginia, as lawmakers weigh economic benefits, public health concerns, and the political landscape leading up to the 2025 gubernatorial elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’d never say never, but I also realize that the governor has been pretty adamantly against the bill,” Krizek said. “I still think we have to do it, it would be legislative malpractice to not give it another try.” </span></p>

(Getty Images)</p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the less noticed features of the Virginia Way is the long-running tendency of the commonwealth’s leaders to conduct their decision-making behind closed doors. While the </span></i><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodepopularnames/virginia-freedom-of-information-act/" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Freedom of Information Act</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> presumes all government business is by default public and requires officials to justify why exceptions should be made, too many Virginia leaders in practice take the opposite stance, acting as if records are by default private and the public must prove they should be handled otherwise.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this feature, we aim to highlight the frequency with which officials around Virginia are resisting public access to records on issues large and small — and note instances when the release of information under FOIA gave the public insight into how government bodies are operating.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the sudden resignation of University of Virginia basketball coach Tony Bennett in October, Lee Enterprises sports editor Matthew Kiewiet filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request seeking details about the matter. The university failed to fulfill the request until Dec. 18 — 40 business days after it was filed, a clear violation of state FOIA laws. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Virginia law, public institutions must respond to FOIA requests within five business days, with an option to extend by seven additional business days if necessary. If a request is denied, institutions are required to cite specific state code exemptions and describe the withheld materials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiewiet, sports editor for Lee Enterprises, which owns the Richmond Times-Dispatch, had requested correspondence between Bennett and the university concerning a memorandum of understanding that had previously been described as a “signed contract.” Bennett, who led the Cavaliers for 15 seasons, including their 2019 National Championship win, announced his immediate departure in October.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now reviewing the records he finally received, Kiewiet described UVa’s FOIA process as “obnoxiously tedious.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe some folks have had better luck than me, but I haven’t heard glowing reviews from others,” he told The Mercury &#8220;They charge astronomical prices, which I am aware is legal, for their public records, and in this instance they didn’t seem especially eager to hand over what I requested.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The university waived the fees for Kiewiet’s request, a gesture he dismissed as inconsequential. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">”Whoopty doo,” he said.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Former Culpeper Sheriff Scott Jenkins convicted in federal bribery scheme</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott Jenkins, a former Culpeper, has been convicted on federal bribery and fraud charges after being accused of deputizing wealthy civilians who paid tens of thousands of dollars for badges. Key testimony in the case came from Jenkins’ former aide, Kevin Rychlik, who alerted the FBI to  the scheme and secretly recorded hours of conversations that became a cornerstone of the prosecution’s case. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the trial, Rychlik testified that in 2011 he gave Jenkins a $5,000 donation in exchange for an auxiliary deputy badge, </span><a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/investigations/culpeper-ex-sheriffs-longtime-aide-testifies-against-him/3794176/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NBC 4 reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The badge granted him the same rights as a sworn deputy. Rychlik also told the jury that he later became a campaign fundraiser for Jenkins and witnessed money and badges exchanged with others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After being investigated for unpaid taxes, Rychlik became an FBI informant and tipped off authorities about Jenkins’ scheme. Prosecutors revealed that Rychlik recorded meetings with Jenkins as part of the investigation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payments to Jenkins reportedly ranged from $5,000 to $25,000, with funds going to Jenkins’ re-election campaigns or being pocketed personally, according to </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/12/18/scott-jenkins-convicted-culpeper-sheriff/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Washington Post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jenkins is scheduled to be sentenced  in March of next year. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">King George Board of Supervisors wants to ‘eliminate restrictions’ on meetings</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The King George Board of Supervisors is asking the General Assembly to revisit state laws governing public meeting requirements, aiming to ease restrictions on how members can convene. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a recent meeting, the board </span><a href="https://www.kinggeorgecountyva.gov/DocumentCenter/View/14412/121724--KGCBOS-Legislative-Summary-Resolution" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">outlined</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> legislative priorities for the state government, including a request to “eliminate restrictions on the Board of Supervisors’ meeting capabilities,” </span><a href="https://substack.com/home/post/p-153269168" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FXBG Advance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Virginia law, any gathering of three or more members to discuss government matters must be advertised as a public meeting, with details on how the public can attend. This applies to both in-person and electronic meetings, such as those held over Zoom. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, a 2004 </span><a href="https://www.opengovva.org/foi-opinions/beck" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Supreme Court decision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ruled that email exchanges between members do not constitute a public meeting, provided the communications are not simultaneous. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin is pitching a tax cut, and cites a hefty state budgetary surplus as justification. But surpluses can evaporate in a Mar-a-Largo minute, and the prospects of declining revenue flowing to Virginia because of cutbacks in federal employment and reductions in Medicaid reimbursements are making Virginia budget makers skittish about the future. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">We have seen the &#8216;Swamp&#8217;– and &#8216;they&#8217; is us</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump has stated his desire to fundamentally change the federal bureaucracy by eliminating civil servants either deemed expendable or who do not exhibit sufficient loyalty to the president. He could start by reinstituting</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/15/us/politics/trump-biden-schedule-f.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Schedule F</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an executive order issued late in his first term (and rescinded by President Joe Biden) to strip job protections from many career federal employees and make them more like political appointees who can be fired at will. This would devastate the Commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More </span><a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/data-analysis-documentation/federal-employment-reports/reports-publications/federal-civilian-employment/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">federal workers live here than in any other state</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; 85,000 live in Northern Virginia and another </span><a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SMU51472609091000001SA" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">60,000 make Hampton Roads</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their home. Many earn a good salary and cuts in their positions would mean losing state revenue that comes both from their income taxes and the sales taxes generated from their purchases. Remember sequestration, when Virginia took a disproportionate hit from cuts in federal spending? Or the various government shutdowns? When the federal government sneezes, Virginia catches a cold.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Substantial cuts in federal employment might not dramatically affect the state budget until Youngkin has left office, but budget writers are justifiably concerned about future revenue shortfalls, thereby making any major tax cut problematic. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The Medicaid dilemma</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Trump’s attack on federal employees may garner the largest headlines, his plans for cutting Medicaid pose more serious fiscal challenges for the states. Since 1965, Medicaid has been the largest source of medical and health care funding for poor and disabled Americans, providing free health insurance to over 80 million people, many of whom are children. It is administered by the states, but major program funding is provided by the federal government. For every dollar a state spends on Medicaid, Washington provides a match to cover the costs. The </span><a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/state-indicator/federal-matching-rate-and-multiplier/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">match rate differs by state</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In states with higher per capita incomes such as Virginia and New York, the federal match equals 50% of costs. For poorer states like Mississippi and Alabama, the match is over 70%. Yearly federal spending on Medicaid exceeds $880 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big changes in the program have occurred since passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, which initially required states to expand Medicaid to people with incomes of up to 138% of the federal poverty level (which today equals </span><a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/7240229f28375f54435c5b83a3764cd1/detailed-guidelines-2024.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">about $35,600 for a family of 3</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court </span><a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2012.0766" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">made this optional</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but since the ACA required the federal government to pick up 100% of the state costs for the expansion population (gradually declining to 90%), many states concluded that expansion was a great way to provide insurance to those who could not afford it. </span><a href="https://www.kff.org/status-of-state-medicaid-expansion-decisions/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forty-one states plus D.C.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> eventually embraced the plan. Virginia joined in 2019, and its expansion population now numbers 758,000 of the 1,872,000 state residents in the program. Today, </span><a href="https://ihodvirginiageneralassembly.s3.amazonaws.com/agenda_block_docs/attaches/000/001/025/original/FINAL__Medicaid_Forecast_Presentation_11-19-24.pdf?1732028008" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medicaid covers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> almost 13% of the state’s population, and it is the second largest expenditure in the state budget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia budget writers were recently informed that there is a $632 million Medicaid shortfall that will require addressing in the next Assembly session. While that may be enough to throw a monkey wrench into the Governor’s plan for a tax cut, it is potentially only the tip of the iceberg.  Reducing Medicaid funding has been the target of conservatives for decades, and, with Republicans in control of the presidency and both chambers of Congress, a serious effort likely will be made to make cuts. The Heritage Foundation’s</span><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24088042-project-2025s-mandate-for-leadership-the-conservative-promise" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Project 2025 report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Republican Study Committee’s</span><a href="https://hern.house.gov/uploadedfiles/final_budget_including_letter_word_doc-final_as_of_march_25.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> budget plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the FY 2025 House budget</span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/118th-congress/house-report/568/1?outputFormat=pdf&amp;s=1&amp;r=4&amp;q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22HCR+117%22%7D" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> resolution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all propose Medicaid cuts, including the reduction of the federal match for the expansion population. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican proposals to reduce the match rate would be a budgetary disaster for all states, including Virginia.  Ironically, many of the states who voted for Trump would take the largest hit because their federal match is so high.  In Virginia, a reduction in the match for the expansion population to 50% reimbursement would mean </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">$3 billion</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> less per year for our budget, making the present shortfall mild by comparison. The commonwealth would either need to find additional funds to fill the gap, or dramatically cut services to those most in need.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;9 states, including Virginia, poised to end coverage for millions if Trump cuts Medicaid funding&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/11/9-states-including-virginia-poised-to-end-coverage-for-millions-if-trump-cuts-medicaid-funding/embed/#?secret=dWE8qgV4U0#?secret=INl8ozxXyw" data-secret="INl8ozxXyw" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it gets worse. Buried in the 2018 Virginia Medicaid expansion authorization is language that requires the state to</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/11/9-states-including-virginia-poised-to-end-coverage-for-millions-if-trump-cuts-medicaid-funding/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> unwind expansion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if the federal match falls below 90%. Eight other states  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, and Utah) have similar </span><a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/medicaid-expansion-is-a-red-and-blue-state-issue/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">laws</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that require termination of expansion if the share of federal funding drops.  This would create a bureaucratic nightmare and remove 758,000 recipients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This places Youngkin in a serious quandary.  Many of the people in the reddest counties in Virginia who voted for both him and Trump would likely be seriously harmed if they no longer qualified for Medicaid or their benefits were reduced. The Governor, could, of course, propose new language in his budget to eliminate the requirement that the commonwealth abandon expansion if the match declines. Or he could speak out against any proposed cuts. To do either would likely draw the ire of the MAGA faithful, a group the governor is attempting to court as he contemplates a run for higher office.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most likely, he does nothing, in hopes the U.S. Senate has enough spine to prevent anything serious from happening.  It isn’t exactly leadership, but it preserves his options for another day.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin presents his proposed amendments to the state's biennial budget before a joint meeting of the Virginia General Assembly's money committees in Richmond on Wednesday. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the third consecutive year, Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s proposed budget includes language seeking to eliminate state-funded abortions for severe fetal anomalies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title32.1/chapter3/section32.1-92.2/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> currently allows state insurance to cover abortions if a physician certifies that a fetus would be born with a “gross and totally incapacitating physical deformity or with a gross and totally incapacitating mental deficiency.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diagnoses like anencephaly, where a fetus’ skull and brain fail to fully develop, fall under this category.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s proposed </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/item/2025/1/HB1600/Introduced/4/4-5.04/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">budget amendments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> strike language permitting state coverage for such procedures. The bill reads that “no expenditures from general or non-general fund sources may be made out of any appropriation by the General Assembly for providing abortion services, except otherwise as required by federal law or state statute,” with the state-funded exception removed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The amendment has failed in past budget negotiations as the legislature was split between Democratic and Republican control. With Democrats now holding a majority in both chambers, the proposal faces even steeper opposition. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite this, Youngkin has continued to reintroduce the measure, aiming to reduce public funding spent on these abortions. Over the past four years, 121 state-funded abortions for severe fetal anomalies have been performed, according to the </span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/content/uploads/sites/38/2024/10/SFA_summary_GA25_SFY2020_2024.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Department of Health</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In 2020, two procedures cost the state about $5,000, while in 2024, 36 procedures cost approximately $61,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia Director Jamie Lockhart called Youngkin’s budget language “discriminatory” and “cruel.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People facing complex and heartbreaking situations, such as a severe fetal diagnosis, deserve compassion, support, and access to necessary abortion care — not stigma and funding barriers that put this care out of reach,” Lockhart said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lockhart emphasized that the proposal would disproportionately affect low-income Virginians who rely on state coverage to navigate and and afford their pregnancies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With many fetal anomalies not diagnosed until around or after </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/two-women-two-pregnancies-two-agonizing-decisions/article_24e5d5fc-742d-11ee-984d-6befc702d5d0.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">15 weeks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, she added that the policy would target families already grieving over the devastating realities of a wanted pregnancy gone awry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Youngkin’s administration defended the proposal as part of his broader budget focus on maternal health. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Governor Youngkin announced significant new maternal health initiatives this week that will continue to promote a culture of life in the commonwealth, including not forcing Virginia taxpayers to subsidize abortions except where it is required by federal law,” spokesperson Christian Martinez said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/youngkin-unveils-plan-to-improve-maternal-health-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has proposed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over $4 million in investments for pilot programs and efforts to expand the maternal healthcare workforces. Similarly, Democratic lawmakers </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/momnibus-package-aims-to-close-maternal-health-gaps-across-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have introduced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">  a “momnibus” package of legislative and budget proposals aimed at improving maternal  health outcomes and providing support for parents-to-be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite potential agreement on maternal health initiatives, Youngkin’s abortion proposal faces stiff resistance.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Democrats are also advancing a proposed </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/13/va-house-panel-advances-amendments-on-abortion-rights-marriage-equality-and-voting-rights/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">constitutional amendment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to enshrine abortion rights in Virginia’s Constitution. The amendment would need to pass in 2025 and 2026 legislative sessions before being placed on a statewide ballot for voter approval. </span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a new presidential administration taking office in January, Gov. Glenn Youngkin expressed optimism about potential fiscal benefits for Virginia, even as Democratic lawmakers voiced concerns about looming challenges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am so looking forward to having a period of tailwinds that will come out of Washington,” Youngkin said Wednesday following his budget proposal presentation in Richmond, signaling confidence in President-elect Donald Trump’s economic agenda.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump has indicated plans to bring back the 2017 corporate tax cuts, raise tariffs on imported goods, and cut federal jobs, sparking debate among Virginia lawmakers over potential impacts. Discussions also touched on federal Medicaid cuts, which could significantly affect the state’s healthcare funding.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking during a joint session of the General Assembly’s money committees, Virginia’s Secretary of Finance Stephen Cummings mixed corporate income tax trends, noting that while refunds tied to corporate tax payments were slightly up, corporate tax revenues are down by $177.4 million compared to the same time last year. Cummings cited an uptick in </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/08/15/youngkin-taxes-corporation-refunds/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">corporate tax refunds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a contributing factor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve actually built in on corporate income tax a very conservative corporate tax view, reflecting some of the things that have taken place to date,” Cummings said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin defended tariffs as a way to ensure “America gets good deals first with our adversaries,” noting that the policy, first implemented by Trump during his first term, has continued under President Joe Biden.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What I am seeing as a result of the discussion around tariffs is a literal line of businesses that want to invest in America, and particularly in Virginia,” Youngkin said, though he did not provide specific examples. “I think we’re going to see another level of growth here in the commonwealth as a result.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the </span><a href="https://taxfoundation.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tax Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a nonprofit think tank, projects that while tariffs </span><a href="https://taxfoundation.org/blog/trump-tariffs-revenue-estimates/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">could raise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between $2 billion and $3.3 trillion from 2025 through 2034, they would also increase the cost of goods. This could result in an average annual tax burden of $1,253 to $2,045 per U.S. household over the same period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Cliff Hayes, D-Chesapeake, expressed concerns over the broader application of tariffs compared to previous policies, which were more focused on China. “That’s a distinct difference from 2016 when it was more targeted on certain countries,” Hayes said. “Now we’re hearing about a more broad application.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cummings defended the previous tariffs, arguing that they contributed to economic growth despite targeting basic goods like steel and aluminum, which have widespread effects on manufacturing. “I don’t think you can really separate the two,” Cummings said, referring to the different types of tariffs being proposed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nationally, Democrats have touted improvements in the economy, pointing to a steady decline in inflation since its pandemic-era peak. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by another 0.25%, attributing the move to favorable economic conditions resulting from current policies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Candi Mundon-King, D-Prince William, raised concerns about the potential economic impact of federal job cuts, which would disproportionately affect Northern Virginia, home to a significant portion of the state’s federal workforce. A George Mason University analysis released before the election </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/30/trump-government-cuts-could-cost-house-republicans-majority-.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">estimated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that eliminating 100,000 positions could result in an annual loss of $27-28 billion for Virginia’s economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s very definitely on the radar screen,” Cummings said, acknowledging the potential effects of such “very aggressive actions” on Virginia’s more than 200,000 federal workers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cummings noted that while federal jobs represent a small percentage of Virginia’s 4.2 million workers, their loss would still be felt. ”It’s not insignificant, but it’s not huge,” he said, adding that the private sector could potentially absorb displaced workers, given Virginia’s low 2.9% unemployment rate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Barbara Favola, D-Arlington, expressed concerns about the potential for </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/11/9-states-including-virginia-poised-to-end-coverage-for-millions-if-trump-cuts-medicaid-funding/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">federal cuts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the Medicaid expansion program’s funding match, emphasizing the importance of maintaining coverage for Virginians. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s an incredible benefit to having all Virginians insured,” Favola said, noting the link between health insurance and workforce participation. “I would hope the administration would be very amenable to continuing, at a minimum, our policy of insurance remains as many Virginians need insurance.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cummings assured lawmakers that the state is prepared for potential Medicaid funding challenges. “We have fully provided for all the liabilities that we know of around Medicaid, and built in growth in our five-year plan.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic leaders, who control the House of Delegates and the state Senate, said Wednesday they are still reviewing Youngkin’s budget proposals ahead of negotiations set to begin when the legislative session starts on Jan. 8.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin presents his proposed amendments to the state's biennial budget before a joint meeting of the Virginia General Assembly's money committees in Richmond on Wednesday. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the cusp of his last full year in office, Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Wednesday unveiled a sweeping budget proposal that he hopes will define his legacy as Virginia’s 74th governor. Focused on tax cuts, infrastructure, education, and public health, the plan sets the stage for what could be a high-stakes 2025 legislative session as lawmakers weigh his ambitious priorities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We reopened Virginia’s economy after a global pandemic all while delivering surplus after surplus,” Youngkin said during a joint meeting of the General Assembly’s money committees in Richmond. “Virginia is growing, Virginia is leading, and Virginia is winning. And this morning I ask you to join me in continuing that work together.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin emphasized the state’s strong economic performance, pointing to job growth, corporate investment, and robust revenue increases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The stock market is strong, and the Federal Reserve appears poised to reduce interest rates over the next year,” he said. “This backdrop further supports Virginia’s ongoing strong performance, with year-to-date revenues up 7.3% over 2024.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Highlighting more than $5 billion in tax cuts already delivered to Virginians over the last three years, Youngkin proposed additional measures to lower the cost of living. “Together, the commonwealth can make a clear statement that reducing tax burdens so Virginians can keep more of their hard-earned money in their pockets is not a Republican idea, it’s not a Democrat idea, it’s just common sense,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A cornerstone in Youngkin’s proposed revisions to the two-year budget is a renewed push to eliminate the locally imposed personal car tax, an issue that he first came to embrace earlier this year after two Democrats campaigning for legislative seats in Southwest Virginia </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2023/10/13/two-virginia-democrats-embrace-a-former-republican-governors-signature-policy-eliminate-the-car-tax/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">adopted it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as part of their platforms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The car tax has been a Republican rallying point since 1997, when GOP gubernatorial nominee Jim Gilmore successfully campaigned on repealing the unpopular levy. However, without a clear plan during the 2024 legislative session, the proposal quickly fizzled. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, Youngkin once again urged the General Assembly to abolish what he called Virginia’s “most hated tax since the tax on tea” that he said cost the average Virginia family of four about $290 annually. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Standing here today, I will renew my call for us to work to fully eliminate the car tax, but recognizing that this might not be possible in this short session, there is an incremental step that we should take together to provide additional car tax relief,” Youngkin said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the new proposal, the state would deposit $1.1 billion into a car tax credit fund to provide income tax rebates to nearly 1.9 million taxpayers earning up to $50,000 in adjusted gross income for individuals or $100,000 for couples filing jointly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eligible taxpayers would receive up to $150 for individual returns or $300 for joint returns annually for the next three years. After the fund is exhausted, the state would see a permanent reduction of $360 million in tax revenues each year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin also is asking the legislature to extend the standard deductions for state income tax returns — currently set at  $8,500 for individuals and $17,000 for joint filers — that are set to expire at the end of next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Failure to make the standard deduction permanent before Jan. 1, 2026, would result in tax increases of $57 million in fiscal year 2026 and $1.2 billion in fiscal year 2027, the governor said. “My friends, there is no reason to raise taxes on Virginians. We are running surplus after surplus after surplus.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic lawmakers responded cautiously to Youngkin’s budget plan Wednesday, emphasizing the need to review the details before committing to any initiatives. With the legislative session set to begin in January, both the House and Senate are preparing to roll out their own budget amendment proposals, signaling potential negotiations ahead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our focus will remain on targeted investments that benefit all Virginians,” said House Appropriations Chair Del. Luke Torian, D-Prince William. “We will explore how we can work across the aisle to ensure K-12 schools are fully funded, higher education is accessible, and affordable housing becomes a reality for more families. These are areas where we can and should find common ground.”</span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, in a statement thanked Youngkin for presenting his budget and for “initiating this important conversation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now, our responsibility is to evaluate these proposals thoughtfully and collaboratively to ensure they reflect the priorities of all Virginians. We can craft a budget that strengthens our schools, supports our communities, and provides real solutions for working families,” Scott said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, the Senate’s president pro tempore, said that while her chamber will consider his proposal, the Democrats’ amendments will look different. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Senate budget will provide relief to working families and individuals and invest in their education and well-being, while maintaining the commonwealth&#8217;s long-term fiscal health,” Lucas said. “Here in the Senate, we look beyond elections and talk-show appearances and budget for the long-haul.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other key initiatives in Youngkin’s proposed budget amendments:</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘No tax on tips’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The administration is also proposing </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/16/youngkin-pitches-tax-relief-for-tipped-workers-in-budget-plan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to eliminate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> state taxes on tips for service industry workers, a policy similar to one championed by President-elect Donald Trump. If approved, the measure would allow tipped workers to claim a deduction on their state tax returns, with compliance monitored through IRS data and employer-reported W-2 forms. The proposal could benefit an estimated 250,000 Virginians. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia has an incredible hospitality, restaurant and service industry, and hardworking Virginians should keep every penny of the tips they earn through their exceptional service. My proposal is very simple — no more taxes on tips,” Youngkin said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the move is being framed as a win for workers, its broader implications remain unclear. Economists warn that some employers might exploit the policy by shifting more of a worker’s compensation to tips rather than wages, a concern </span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/trump-and-harris-say-theyll-kill-taxes-on-tips-how-would-that-work" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">also raised</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> around similar federal legislation. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Education </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin is proposing nearly $1 billion in new education funding, including a $50-million Virginia Opportunity Scholarship Program to provide $5,000 annual grants for private school expenses like tuition and transportation. About 10,000 K-12 students from families earning up to twice the federal poverty limit to qualify for free school meals would qualify, with funding coming from revenue growth, not existing education budgets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan includes $25 million for lab school partnerships with historically Black colleges and universities and nearly $500 for higher education capital projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there is no new funding for college operating expenses, and Youngkin is pushing for a 2.5% cap on tuition increases. “It’s time for our colleges to cut administrative bloat and handle costs without asking taxpayers for more,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additional proposals include $290 million for school construction, $550 million in direct aid, $6.8 million for school resource officers, and $50 million to support underperforming schools. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">VMSDEP</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Military Survivors and Dependents Education Program </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/07/jlarc-review-of-vmsdep-no-evidence-of-peak-or-decline-in-participation-levels/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(VMSDEP)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which provides tuition waivers to spouses and children of military members killed or permanently disabled in service, would receive $60 million from a surplus in the state’s 529 college savings program to address a funding shortfall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers scrutinized the program last year after it was initially excluded from budget negotiations. Concerns over its sustainability arose as participation surged by nearly 350%, growing from about 1,400 participants in 2019 to about 6,400 in 2023. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The allocation would come without any new policy proposals.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Withholding funds to quash ‘sanctuary cities’ </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin further echored national Republican rhetoric by declaring that “every state has become a border state” as he unveiled plans to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/youngkin-wants-to-restrict-funding-for-localities-that-dont-comply-with-immigration-enforcement/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cut funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to localities that limit or refuse compliance with U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement (ICE). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal aligns with a broader GOP push against “sanctuary city” policies, which vary but often involve local governments choosing not to inquire about immigration status or declining full cooperation with ICE. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But with Virginia’s legislature under Democratic control, this proposal is expected to face significant opposition during the upcoming budget negotiations.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Boosting maternal health outcomes</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin and Democratic lawmakers are prioritizing </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/momnibus-package-aims-to-close-maternal-health-gaps-across-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">maternal health</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in their legislative and budget </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/17/in-bipartisan-push-virginia-lawmakers-target-rural-healthcare-crisis/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, increasing the chances that some measures will make it through budget negotiations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s plan </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/youngkin-unveils-plan-to-improve-maternal-health-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">includes $2.5 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for perinatal health hubs, expanded funding for OB-GYN residencies, and a $500,000 education campaign to help parents recognize life threatening conditions like heart attacks or eclampsia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also proposes $1 million to support workforce development for midwives and doulas, both crucial professions in addressing care gaps and advocating for patients, particularly those of color impacted by racial health disparities. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Mental health support</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Virginia enters its third year of its Right Help, Right Now initiative, Youngkin’s latest budget request includes </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/13/meet-people-where-they-are-special-teams-aid-va-s-efforts-to-expand-mental-health-care-services/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$35 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to improve crisis response involving law enforcement. The funding would support hiring </span><a href="https://www.dcjs.virginia.gov/licensure-and-regulatory-affairs/special-conservators-peace" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">special conservators of the peace</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or “s-cops,” as Youngkin calls them.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These intermediaries would assist with individuals awaiting hospital admissions after mental health crises, aiming to de-escalate situations where people in crisis might unintentionally harm  officers and face jail time. Youngkin envisions the “s-cops” fostering better outcomes for those in crisis while allowing law enforcement officers to focus on their regular duties.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Disaster relief</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The administration proposes allocating $127 million toward a permanent </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/20/after-hurley-and-whitewood-floods-virginia-considers-state-relief-fund/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">disaster relief fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to aid victims of natural disasters beyond what the federal assistance, insurance and private donations cover. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Southwest Virginia has faced repeated flooding in recent years, most recently from Hurricane Helene in September, which claimed three lives and caused $4.4 billion in </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/03/va-dept-of-transportation-estimates-hurricane-helene-debris-cleanup-will-take-3-to-6-months/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">damage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Youngkin said $25 million could come from the general fund, with $102 million sourced from the latest round of revenues of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin had previously </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/20/judge-deems-youngkins-actions-to-withdraw-virginia-from-rggi-unlawful/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sought to withdraw</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Virginia from RGGI, despite praise from environmental groups for its funding for flood resilience and energy efficiency programs. “I fully expect that the General Assembly will work constructively together in this next short session to appropriate funds specifically for Hurricane Helene relief,” he said on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, questioned the governor’s proposal, pointing to his approach of using RGGI revenues. “Why not just put us back in RGGI?” she asked, while noting uncertainty about the fund’s legislative support.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t know yet,” she said in an interview. </span></p>

(Photo courtesy of the Chesapeake Bay Program)</p><p>A new bill in the U.S. Senate aims to combat illegal fishing practices and trade of endangered species worldwide, according to U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy.</p>
<p>The Louisiana Republican is sponsoring the proposal with with Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va. The Protecting Global Fisheries Act would expand the U.S. government’s authority to create and enforce maritime law alongside other nations, with their efforts centered on illegal and unregulated fishing practices.</p>
<p>The bill would also extend powers to the president to sanction people and vessels from other countries that violate these international agreements or participate in the sale, movement or purchase of endangered species.</p>
<p>“Illegal fishing practices abroad threaten Louisiana. Seafood production is a driver of our economy and way of life,” Cassidy said in a news release.</p>
<p>The bill will prevent “unfair competition” from countries such as China and “can preserve jobs, protect our local economies, strengthen national security, and safeguard marine habitats,” the senator added.</p>
<p>Illegal fishing practices the bill aims to curb include fishing without proper licensing, failure to report catches or falsifying reports, use of prohibited fishing gear and unpermitted transfer of fish to cargo vessels.</p>
<p>Louisiana has a long standing history with the fishing industry, generating around $2.4 billion a year, according to numbers Cassidy cited. Louisiana is well-known for its shrimp, crab, crawfish and oyster fisheries but also brings in between 600 million and 900 million <a href="https://lailluminator.com/2024/10/31/fish-spills/" target="_blank">menhaden</a> a year. Also known as pogies, menhaden are used to make fertilizer and animal feed. Their offshore harvests generate $25 million in state tax revenue annually and employ around 2,000 people.</p>
<p>The Cassidy-Kaine bill is also being pitched as a defense for the state’s shrimping industry, which has <a href="https://lailluminator.com/2023/06/02/louisiana-shrimpers-say-theyve-been-stranded-while-lawmakers-tread-water/" target="_blank">suffered</a> in recent years from onslaught of imported seafood flooding the market and tanking prices of local catch.</p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Jasmine Storrs took the stage Tuesday, she didn’t hold back: She nearly died after childbirth because she ignored her body’s warning signs. Now, she wants other women to listen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Storrs, who suffered a heart attack after days of chest tightness, shared her harrowing experience before Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced a slate of investments aimed at improving maternal health outcomes in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Time is muscle,” she recalled her doctor saying before nine hours of open-heart surgery — words that saved her life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The message was echoed by Sen. Emily Jordan, R-Suffolk, who ignored eclampsia signs after the birth of her third child in September. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think a lot of women feel guilty going through the birthing process or pregnancy process because they have other responsibilities,” Jordan said. “We have to be empowered to ask the right questions at the right time.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both women joined Youngkin who wants to invest $2.5 million in perinatal health hub pilot programs, $1 million to expand support for doulas and community health workers in local health districts, $500,000 for a public awareness campaign on life-threatening pregnancy complications, and additional funding for OB-GYN and psychiatric medical residencies in the state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposals are part of Youngkin’s broader budget request, which he will present to the state legislature’s finance committees on Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visibly emotional during the announcement, Youngkin reflected on his mother’s career as an OB-GYN nurse practitioner, calling the moment a “chance to speak for her.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also issued an </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/executive-actions/ED-11---Maternal-Health-FINAL-12.17.24.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executive directive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the state health department to include pregnancy-related data on its Maternal and Child Health Data dashboard. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s latest efforts  build on previous work to strengthen  maternal health, including his support for</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expanding </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/04/17/petersburg-maternal-hub-opening-reignites-discussion-over-commercial-doula-benefits/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">maternal health hubs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Petersburg and signing a bill earlier this year  requiring health insurance </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/youngkin-doulas-black-maternal-health-general-assembly/article_34a9f222-f379-11ee-8dc9-e36a8194fce6.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">coverage for doulas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s announcement comes as Democrats prepare their own push to address maternal disparities through a comprehensive “</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/momnibus-package-aims-to-close-maternal-health-gaps-across-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">momnibus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” package of bills and budget proposals — a riff on the term omnibus.  The effort follows an October summit in Richmond that brought together lawmakers and medical experts to tackle maternal health challenges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bipartisan rural healthcare committee has also highlighted maternal health gaps in its legislative recommendations following a statewide tour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the 2025 legislative session set to convene on Jan. 8, improving maternal healthcare is emerging as a shared priority, offering a rare opportunity for bipartisan action in Richmond.  </span></p>

He highlighted that these pharmacists will serve the areas of the state that national chains sometimes won’t. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers criss-crossing rural Virginia this year heard a common refrain: Rural communities are struggling with healthcare workforce shortages and transportation challenges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After months of meetings and site visits, the bipartisan  House Select Committee on Advancing Rural and Small Town Health Care on Tuesday released its report with a slate of legislative and budgetary recommendations aimed at tackling those challenges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the proposals are state-funded grants to help rural healthcare providers recruit professionals and increased investments in nursing education programs to build a stronger workforce. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To improve transportation access, the report proposes  a new program to provide rides to free clinics and federally qualified health centers. Lawmakers point to Virginia’s existing non-emergency transportation program for Medicaid patients, run by the Department of Medical Assistance Services, as a potential model. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve got something that’s at least serving some people,” Committee Chair Rodney Willett, D-Henrico, said during a September meeting on the Eastern Shore. “Can we leverage that? Is there a way to expand that for non-Medicaid folks who have certain income levels or live in certain areas? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee also recommends requiring insurers to cover audio-only telehealth services. Willett previously told The Mercury that it would be a lifeline for people with limited broadband access, as well as older patients or those without computers who rely on phones for remote medical care.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Support for rural parents-to-be</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A key section of the report focuses on maternal healthcare, aligning with a recently announced “</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/momnibus-package-aims-to-close-maternal-health-gaps-across-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">momnibus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” package of bills and budget proposals from Democratic lawmakers. Gov. Glenn Youngkin has also outlined his own plans to address maternal health, setting the stage for a bipartisan push in the 2025 legislative session. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With about 30% of Virginians living in areas with limited or no maternity care services, rural patients are often forced to travel long distances  for care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Midwives have become essential in filling these maternal care gaps providing perinatal care in homes, birth centers and rural hospitals. To bolster this workforce, the report recommends increased Medicaid reimbursement rates for midwives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Midwives are often rooted in the communities they serve and more likely to stay, compared to some OB-GYN medical residents that may work in rural areas for a time before leaving for work elsewhere. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Youngkin has committed to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/17/virginias-state-budget-will-fund-ob-gyn-medical-residencies-amid-obstetrics-closures/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">continuing funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for OB-GYN and family practice medical residencies — which are critical as rural hospitals close obstetrics units — the report calls for broader investment in medical residencies statewide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, Youngkin on Tuesday announced his support for legislation to streamline out-of-state midwives seeking to practice in Virginia, further strengthening the maternal health workforce. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report further recommends boosting funding for community college doula training programs, recognizing the critical role doulas play in supporting parents-to-be and improving health outcomes. This support is especially impactful for patients of color, who face disproportionate risks during pregnancy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black women are significantly </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/maternal-mortality/2021/maternal-mortality-rates-2021.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more likely to die </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">from pregnancy complications when compared to white women. Studies point to </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7384760" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">racial bias</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a contributing factor to poorer health outcomes for women of color, where doulas have been key advocates for patients’ needs and care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, Youngkin signed a bill supporting health insurance </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/youngkin-doulas-black-maternal-health-general-assembly/article_34a9f222-f379-11ee-8dc9-e36a8194fce6.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">coverage for doulas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, acknowledging their role in maternal health. But he </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/20/youngkin-vetoes-bills-on-contraception-access-skill-games-confederate-heritage-rollbacks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a separate measure that would have required unconscious bias training for nursing license renewals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bias training remains a key recommendation from the rural health committee, though it has faced resistance from some Republicans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Committee member Del. Otto Wachsmann, R-Sussex, clarified the hesitation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The problem isn’t that Republicans are against cultural awareness training — I think everybody is really for that —  but it’s putting another burden on the providers,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier in the day, when Youngkin outlined maternal health policies that he supports, The Mercury asked what changes might make him reconsider the unconscious bias bill if reintroduced, he acknowledged the disparities in health outcomes for patients of color compared to white patients, but didn&#8217;t specify if he would support the bill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think the right way to address it is to use the data that we gather and analyze to put forth really specific initiatives,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin was referring to an </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/executive-actions/ED-11---Maternal-Health-FINAL-12.17.24.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executive directive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the state’s health department to include pregnancy-related data on its Maternal and Child Health Data dashboard.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Looking forward</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As lawmakers discussed the recommendations from their report, many reflected on the bipartisan companionship built during their work on the committee — a spirit of collaboration they hope to carry into the 2025 session. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These were overnight trips,” Wachsmann said. “We found a lot of camaraderie together just breaking bread at the table and spending time together.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Representing a rural district, Wachsmann has firsthand experience with the challenges highlighted in the report. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve watched as our areas have lost pharmacies,” Wachsmann said. “I’ve seen our grocery stores leave.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that it was “refreshing” to see lawmakers  from both rural and urban districts come together to focus on the unique struggles facing  rural communities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Willett, the committee chair, emphasized that while the proposals aren’t a complete solution, they represent important steps toward improving healthcare access. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if all of the committee’s roughly 30 proposals are eventually adopted, Willett said  that rural healthcare issues won’t “go away” overnight. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can speak for all of us here in saying that we’re committed to staying on the case and making that progress,” he said. </span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s top investigatory body is turning its attention to Red Onion State Prison following alarming reports of self-harm and poor conditions at the supermax facility in Wise County.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrea Sapone, the state’s new corrections ombudsman, announced Monday that her office will prioritize an investigation into living conditions and the health and safety of incarcerated individuals at the prison, which has faced scrutiny after a hunger strike in 2023 and six cases of people burning themselves this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Office of the State Inspector General takes all allegations of abuse seriously,” she told the House of Delegates’ Public Safety Committee. “A Red Onion investigation will be prioritized as soon as we have full staff to do it properly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An offer has been extended for one position, and a pool of candidates is under consideration to fill four more roles, an OSIG spokesperson confirmed to The Mercury.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calls for oversight at Red Onion have grown louder from prison reform advocates, lawmakers and families of incarcerated individuals. Allegations against the facility include poor living conditions, mistreatment and the extended  use of solitary confinement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a presentation to the committee on Monday, Department of Corrections director Chad Dotson suggested the recent incidents of self-harm were attempts by inmates to secure transfers to other prisons closer to their families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s no evidence whatsoever that there was any kind of a plot or a protest,” Dotson said. “All the inmates involved said they did it because they wanted to get away from Red Onion. Two of these have a history of self-harm.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Taj Mahon-Haft, founder of the Humanization Project, pushed back, emphasizing that the underlying issue is the level of desperation that drives people to harm themselves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mahon-Haft, who was formerly incarcerated, said he understands firsthand the challenges of imprisonment, particularly how prolonged isolation can lead to harmful thoughts or actions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">April Wright shared a harrowing account during the meeting, revealing that her incarcerated son had apparently attempted to hang himself. Wright said she only learned of the incident when another inmate reached out to inform her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of solitary confinement, or what Virginia calls “restorative housing,”  was another major focus of the discussion. Under a state law enacted last year, incarcerated individuals in restorative housing are now granted four hours a day outside their cells. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dotson described the practice as a temporary measure, explaining that it is reserved for individuals with serious behavioral infractions who may pose a threat to themselves or others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plaintiffs in a </span><a href="https://www.acluva.org/en/press-releases/hundreds-virginians-held-prolonged-solitary-confinement-join-aclu-virginia-class#:~:text=%E2%80%93%20A%20federal%20judge%20in%20the,Department%20of%20Corrections%20(VADOC)." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filed by the Virginia chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) allege they were placed in confined housing for extended periods, with at least one person claiming the experience left them feeling suicidal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s clear that this is a systemic problem,” ACLU attorney Geri Greenspan said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, the General Assembly passed a </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB719" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">aimed at further reforming confinement practices in Virginia prisons, but it was vetoed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin. While it remains unclear if a similar bill will be introduced in the upcoming legislative session, members of the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus have hinted at the possibility. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, Del. Marcus Simon, D-Fairfax, is looking forward to a formal investigation into Red Onion State Prison. 	<div class="halfwidth">

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think the most important thing we heard was the commitment from the ombudsman to make this investigation into Red Onion her top priority,” Simon said. “I think that&#8217;s a win.”</span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia lawmakers are gearing up for a renewed push to tackle maternal health disparities in the 2025 session, with a slate of bills and budget amendments focused on improving outcomes for parents across the state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A key proposal is a bipartisan effort to mandate </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/virginia-black-maternal-health-carroll-foy-youngkin/article_4608fd84-d1ae-11ee-8379-138efdfc34c7.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unconscious bias training</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for nursing license renewals, which previously passed the legislature but </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/20/youngkin-vetoes-bills-on-contraception-access-skill-games-confederate-heritage-rollbacks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">was vetoed </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">by Gov. Glenn Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers say that targeted training is critical in addressing preventable deaths and complications during childbirth, marking it as a vital step in the broader push for maternal health reform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reveals a stark disparity in maternal health: Black women are significantly </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/maternal-mortality/2021/maternal-mortality-rates-2021.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more likely to die</span> </a><span style="font-weight: 400;">from pregnancy-related complications than white women. Research also highlights that women of color often face worse  health outcomes, partly due to </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7384760" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">racial bias</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in healthcare settings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, emphasized the urgency of addressing these inequities, stating that the proposed legislation aims to tackle the “broken systems and lack of resources” contributing to poor maternal health outcomes, particularly for Black parents. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “momnibus” package — a play on the term omnibus — also includes proposals to enhance healthcare monitoring and expanded Medicaid coverage to improve maternal health outcomes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One key initiative by Del. Amy Laufer, D-Charlottesville, seeks to pilot remote monitoring for conditions like hypertension and diabetes. This approach is designed to assist expectant parents, particularly those in rural areas with limited access to hospitals or healthcare providers, by ensuring their conditions are closely monitored during pregnancy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 30% of Virginia counties lack a birthing center within a 30-minute drive, according to the March of Dimes, a non-profit that works to enhance the health of mothers and babies. In Southwest and Southside Virginia, recent years have seen the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/17/virginias-state-budget-will-fund-ob-gyn-medical-residencies-amid-obstetrics-closures"><span style="font-weight: 400;">closure of several obstetrics units</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> However, the latest state budget includes funding to support OB-GYN residencies in hospitals, aiming to bolster care in underserved areas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The momnibus package also includes proposals to expand Medicaid coverage to include diapers and limited baby supplies, as well as legislation to establish a women’s health commission focused on developing targeted maternal health policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers and maternal health experts first previewed the momnibus package during a Black Maternal Health </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/18/momnibus-bill-plans-announced-at-virginias-black-maternal-health-summit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Richmond in October, where public health professionals and legislators from around the country gathered to collaborate on solutions to improve maternal health outcomes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Candi Mundon King, D-Prince William, on Monday expressed optimism about bipartisan support for the upcoming maternal health proposals, noting that Republicans have previously supported and even co-sponsored some Democrat-led maternal health initiatives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re hoping that when these bills get before them, they will continue that support,” Mundon King said.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin serves coffee to patrons at McLean's Restaurant in Richmond after announcing a "no-tax-on-tips" budget proposal on Dec. 16, 2024. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin served more than pancakes and coffee at McLean’s Restaurant in Richmond Monday morning. He also unveiled another key part of his budget proposal: eliminating state taxes on tipped employees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Describing the measure as a “foundational piece” of his budget, which he is expected to present before a joint meeting of the legislature’s money committees on Wednesday, Youngkin emphasized the need to ease financial pressures, stating “It is time for us to reduce tax burdens on hard working Virginians.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An estimated 250,000 people working in food service and hospitality could see tax relief under the plan, according to the Virginia Department of Taxation and the Virginia Employment Commission. Tipped workers would be able to claim a deduction on their state tax returns, with compliance ensured through IRS data and employer-reported W-2 information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal must still get approval from the General Assembly as lawmakers and the governor work toward an amended biennial state budget during the upcoming legislative session, which begins in January.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, who is running for governor in 2025 and joined Youngkin at the announcement, expressed optimism about the policy, suggesting that Virginia could be the first state to implement such a measure if approved. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think this should be bipartisan,” Youngkin said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, the leading Democrat in the state Senate who chairs the finance committee, did not have a comment at the time of this publication. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s push to eliminate state taxes on tips mirrors discussions at the federal level, where the idea gained traction during the fall campaign season. Both President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris floated similar proposals, and </span><a href="https://nevadacurrent.com/2024/08/13/horsford-announces-bill-to-make-sure-high-end-earners-cant-exploit-an-end-to-tax-on-tips/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">related bills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have been introduced </span><a href="https://www.taxnotes.com/research/federal/legislative-documents/proposed-legislation/s-4621-no-tax-tips-act/7kgn8" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in Congress</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While eliminating taxes on tips might seem like a clear win for workers, the policy’s broader impact remains uncertain. Economists have raised concerns that some employers could exploit the measure by shifting more of a worker’s compensation to tips rather than wages, a possibility also </span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/trump-and-harris-say-theyll-kill-taxes-on-tips-how-would-that-work" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">noted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as similar  national legislation has been filed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked about this concern, Youngkin acknowledged variations across the food service industry. “It depends, of course, on the establishment,” he said. “But, we see a substantial portion of our waiters and waitresses earnings in the form of tips, and this is a great way for us to say that ‘You keep that money.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the preview of his upcoming budget presentation on Wednesday, Youngkin also announced </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/youngkin-wants-to-restrict-funding-for-localities-that-dont-comply-with-immigration-enforcement/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to cut funding to localities that limit or refuse compliance with U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement (ICE). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal aligns with a broader GOP-led national movement to counter “sanctuary city” policies. These policies vary but often involve local governments opting not to ask about an individual&#8217;s immigration status or refusing to fully cooperate with ICE. However, with Virginia’s legislature under Democratic control, the proposal is likely to face significant resistance during the upcoming budget negotiations. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hired in late September by the Office of the State Inspector General, Sapone said her office has already begun tracking letters and emails from those seeking assistance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It takes a village to raise and identify concerns and find solutions,” Sapone told members of Virginia’s Corrections Oversight Committee Friday morning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Office of the State Inspector General (OSIG) plans to improve transparency and accessibility for its corrections ombudsman unit by updating its website to include the unit’s mailing address and an online complaint form,Sapone said. She added that she is working on protocol to ensure that inmates and family members who reach out can be informed about the status of investigated claims. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sapone also called for a formal memorandum of understanding between OSIG and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Department of Corrections to establish coordination procedures for investigations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Dave Marsden, D-Alexandria, a member of the Corrections Oversight Committee, said that he and other lawmakers are frequently  contacted by incarcerated people and their families seeking assistance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He emphasized that while it may be tempting for lawmakers to intervene directly in complaints it is crucial to forward the information to the ombudsman to ensure a proper investigation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You know, you hear compelling stories that may or may not be true and we need to regulate ourselves to make sure that our role is to oversee the ombudsman’s office and not get engaged in individual cases,” Marsden said. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">People in Red Onion State Prison relay poor conditions</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An investigation into living conditions and treatment of inmates at Red Onion State Prison is what some lawmakers, prison reform advocates and loved ones of people incarcerated there have been calling for in recent weeks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ahead of Thanksgiving, Department of Corrections Director Chad Dotson confirmed that six incarcerated individuals had intentionally </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/virginia-department-of-corrections-confirm-inmates-burned-themselves-lawmakers-want-investigation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">burned themselves</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He said that they received medical treatment and were referred to mental health services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The confirmation came after the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus (VLBC) urged Dotson and Gov. Glenn Youngkin to investigate. The caucus, which had been contacted by families of those incarcerated, suggested the self-harm incidents were acts of protests against prison conditions or efforts to prompt transfers to other facilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Red Onion has also seen hunger strikes, with inmates citing  poor living conditions and food, mistreatment,racism by some correctional officers and the excessive use of solitary confinement, according to the caucus </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, the caucus said the hunger strike and the self-harm “reflect the psychological and physical toll that gruesome prison conditions can have on incarcerated individuals.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Dotson confirmed that at least six people at the prison had harmed themselves, he said they did so by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“tampering with electrical outlets.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dotson dismissed reports from the prison as “bad-faith efforts to try to score cheap political points by advocacy groups.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also accused these groups of pushing for “prison abolition and policies that would make Virginians less safe.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ekong Eshiet, who is incarcerated at Red Onion, has recently expressed concerns about his safety. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allegedly among those who engaged in self-harm, Eshiet was contacted by The Mercury through JPay, a service that allows incarcerated people to communicate with those who are outside the prison. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He suggested reaching out to his sister, who did not respond to calls or messages before this article’s publication. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prison Radio, an organization that amplifies the voices of incarcerated individuals, has released an </span><a href="https://www.prisonradio.org/commentary/hunger-strike-and-self-immolation-update/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">audio recording of Eshiet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the recording he recounts facing discrimination due to his name and Muslim faith and described the challenges he encountered during his personal hunger strike. He also spoke openly about setting himself on fire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eshiet described his situation as being “in fear for my life.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expressing his hope for a transfer to another facility to serve the remainder of his  sentence, Eshiet said, “I’m trying to get up off this. I’m doing my best, like I’m going about this the right way. I guess, like with the hunger strike way. But if I have to, I don’t mind setting myself on fire again.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Sen. Barbara Favola, D-Arlington, the situation seems like “a cry for help.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I mean something has to be going on, right?” she said in an interview with The Mercury. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like the VLBC, Favola has been working to uncover more information about potential issues within the prison. Earlier in November, she and Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, sent a letter to Dotson, requesting a detailed report after families of inmates shared troubling anecdotes about conditions at Red Onion and another facility, Wallens Ridge. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can’t say that I have any evidence to point specific fingers at,” Favola said. However, she expressed hope that the newly established ombudsman position will facilitate  a thorough investigation into the matter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Lamont Bagby, D-Henrico, the VLBC chair, told The Mercury that he and his colleagues are still “gathering intel”on the conditions at Red Onion. As the caucus prepares to unveil its legislative priorities ahead of the upcoming General Assembly session, Bagby suggested that continued prison reform efforts may be among the initiatives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB719" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aims to regulate the duration a person can spend in solitary confinement. Although Virginia law refers to the practice as “restorative housing,” concerns about its excessive use have been raised by lawmakers and reform advocates. The measure passed the Democratic-controlled legislature earlier this year but was ultimately </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+amd+SB719AG" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">by Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill would have mandated  mental health evaluations every two days for individuals in solitary confinement and built on a related reform </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB887" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">signed into law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Youngkin last year. That earlier legislation requires that people in solitary confinement receive a designated number of hours outside their cells each day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his veto message for the 2024 bill, Youngkin described the measure as “unnecessary bureaucracy” that would burden facility administrators and hinder the department’s focus on “safety and inmate rehabilitation.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Renewed hope’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, prison reform advocates, incarcerated individuals and their families continue to speak out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the recent Corrections Oversight Committee meeting, several people used the public comment period to share concerns about the conditions their loved ones have reported. They urged lawmakers to visit the prisons firsthand and called for thorough investigations into the issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kimberly Dyke-Harsley El shared that a family member, currently incarcerated at Greensville Correctional Center, went several days without access to his blood pressure medication. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, Gigi Badawi recounted spending over a year navigating back-and-forth communications with the Department of Corrections to ensure necessary medication for her son at Indian Creek Correctional Center. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And activist Phil Wilayto called on  lawmakers to investigate  the allegations emerging from  Red Onion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s time for those of us who have advocated for our incarcerated loved ones to be taken seriously instead of immediately dismissed,” Badawi said. “I have renewed hope that the new ombudsman and her team will look into allegations.”</span></p>

(Courtesy of Luther Cifers campaign). </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luther Cifers, a businessman from Prince Edward County, emerged victorious in the Republican nomination contest for Virginia’s 10th Senate District during a mass meeting at the Goochland Rec Center.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The meeting, which drew hundreds of Republican voters, began Friday evening and stretched into the early hours of Saturday as participants navigated a lengthy multi-ballot process to select a nominee from a crowded field of seven candidates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cifers secured the majority needed to clinch the nomination, defeating a mix of seasoned politicians and newcomers in three rounds of voting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cifers will now face Democrat Jack Trammel in the Jan. 7 special election to fill the vacancy left by Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland, who resigned after his recent election to Congress. The winner of the special election will serve the remainder of McGuire’s term, which runs until 2027.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other contenders included runner-up Duane Adams, the chairman of the Louisa County Board of Supervisors who previously ran for the Republican nomination in the district in 2023 but was defeated by McGuire​, and Amanda Chase, a former state senator from Chesterfield County who served in the Virginia Senate for eight years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were four other bids for the seat by Shayne Snavely, a veteran and former Chase aide, Jean Gannon, a Powhatan County real estate appraiser, Alex Cheatham, a recent college graduate, and Bryan Hamlet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Luther emerged from a field of seven outstanding candidates who sought the nomination. The Republican Party of Virginia and I look forward to marching in lockstep with Luther and his team over the next three weeks in ensuring that he is victorious on January 7th and takes the oath of office on January 8th,” said Rich Anderson, the chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the district’s strong Republican lean — with 62.8% of voters supporting former President Donald Trump and 67.8% backing Gov. Glenn Youngkin — Cifers is seen as the favorite in the upcoming election.</span></p>

When her son experienced a trauma this past summer, a local mobile crisis unit was able to provide immediate counseling and connect the family to follow-up mental health resources. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><i>Editor’s note: The Mercury is not identifying the name of Asheley Tuck&#8217;s son to protect the child&#8217;s identity. Tuck&#8217;s statements were substantiated through interviews with mental health professionals with knowledge of her family&#8217;s situation. </i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With books, toys and artwork strewn about, Asheley Tuck’s son’s room is the typical sort one might expect from an 11-year-old boy. What is less typical: a piece of notebook paper taped to his door labeled “safety plan.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The paper outlines how sudden mood shifts, loss of interests, isolation or a racing heart could be warning signs of anxiety, so that he can better recognize when an attack might be coming on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuck’s son also has notes that outline techniques — like listing types of Pokemon in alphabetical order — which can help him cope with swelling negative emotions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The notes are relics from crisis response and follow-up counseling he received this past summer after he and some friends encountered an online predator during a sleepover.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuck said that she and her wife didn’t know how to best comfort their son when he called to be picked up from the sleepover and confided in them what had happened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“(The person) scared them and asked them to do some things that were not appropriate for anyone, much less, you know, an 11-year-old,” Tuck said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her son expressed feeling like “his life was ruined” and he was worried he would be “plastered on the internet and what the repercussions would be,” Tuck recalled. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He was devastated.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having known people who were social workers, Tuck realized she could call Richmond’s Crisis Response and Stabilization Team (CReST). Within less than an hour, a clinician arrived at their house to provide immediate counseling to the family. After the initial visit, CReST arranged follow-up visits for a few weeks and referred the family to additional counseling services if needed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The fact that he got services that quickly was a game changer for how he&#8217;ll be able to navigate his life going forward,” Tuck said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the clinician who responded to Tuck’s son was part of CReST through the Richmond Behavioral Health Authority, there are similar programs around Virginia, colloquially referred to as mobile crisis units. These professionals and teams are part of Virginia’s ever-expanding landscape of mental health resources and have played a role in keeping patients in their homes rather than hospitals or, in escalated cases, jails.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Clinicians on the scene</h4>

	</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_41484" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/img_3724/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-41484 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_3724-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_3724-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_3724-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_3724-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_3724-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_3724-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_3724-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Asheley Tuck holds notes that her son kept following some emergency counseling services he utilized after experiencing a trauma. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Erin DeLizzio, a program manager at CReST, explained that while some staff are located in the downtown Richmond office, others have take-home cars to be dispatched from around the region, from Hanover to Farmville to Emporia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said that her area, Region 4, was able to provide services to over 1,500 people in the 2024 fiscal year. Most of those people were diverted from hospitals and jails and were able to get help at their homes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’ve got to be able to meet people where they are,” said Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a longtime champion for bolstering mental health resources in Virginia who supported the 2021 legislation that paved the way for mobile crisis units and other services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CReST’s responses to calls for help can range from de-escalating situations over the phone to dispatching clinicians to meet with people directly. Sometimes patients need immediate counseling and connections to follow-up resources like therapists or psychiatrists. Sometimes they might need to be admitted to crisis receiving centers — which operate like emergency rooms in hospitals, but focus on mental health. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clinicians can be dispatched when people call the regional mobile crisis line directly or when routed through emergency calls to 911 or 988, a national mental health crisis hotline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the national mental health emergency hotline transitioned to the easier-to-remember 988 system, Virginia </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+ful+CHAP0248" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2021 funded expanded call centers and listed the deployment of mobile crisis units as part of 988’s responsibilities. The service has been </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/local/richmond/2024/09/25/virginia-988-hotline-mental-health-crisis" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on the rise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Virginia, which Gov. Glenn Youngkin has said he sees as a success because it means people are connected to resources before a crisis can escalate further. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s three-year </span><a href="https://www.hhr.virginia.gov/12-14-2022-Two-Page-BH-Plan-Summary.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right Help, Right Now</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> plan entails budget proposals from the governor and legislative actions by state lawmakers focused on mental health care. Youngkin recently celebrated the two year anniversary of the initiative.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right Help, Right Now is working,” he declared excitedly at a press conference on the two year anniversary of the initiative, Dec. 11. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The initiative’s bipartisan efforts build on a decade’s worth of work spearheaded by Deeds and the Behavioral Health Commission he helped establish. Outside of legislative sessions, the commission undertakes studies and hears from experts around the state to craft or endorse legislation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent years have seen new solutions born from local tragedies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bill dubbed “Irvo’s Law” allows families access to their loved one if they are taken into custody by law enforcement during a crisis. Its inspiration stemmed from the death of Henrico resident Irvo Otineo, who died in a mental health hospital while constrained by law enforcement officers and staff, and whose mother was denied access to him there.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2020 law called the “</span><a href="https://dbhds.virginia.gov/human-resource-development-and-management/health-equity/mdpa/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marcus Alert</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” stems from the death of Richmond resident Marcus-David Peters, who was killed by police in 2018 during a mental health crisis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a growing number of Virginia localities implement the law, it enables coordination between 911 and regional call centers to triage the best response from law enforcement and trained clinicians when handling mental health situations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A main goal is to not hospitalize someone if we can,” said Abigayle Hodges, a mobile crisis unit team leader at CReST. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trying to keep the peace</h4>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often, law enforcement officers are the first responders to crises and  escort people to hospitals where they sit waiting with them. Other times, people may be subject to emergency custody orders, which is when a magistrate orders that someone needs to be evaluated by health professionals because they could be a harm to themselves or others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consensus has been building between some lawmakers and members of law enforcement that officers and deputies aren’t always the best people to take point or remain with people in crises for longer periods of time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not only should there be less police interactions with someone who’s going through a crisis, but when you’re looking at rural areas such as the county where I’m from and small police departments throughout the region, then taking just one person off patrol can hurt a community,” said Tazewell County Sheriff Brian Hieatt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent </span><a href="https://bhc.virginia.gov/documents/BHC%20Staff%20-%20ABLEO.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">presentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Virginia’s Behavioral Health Commission also noted how arrests of people in mental health crises have a “devastating impact” on those in crisis and that it can “stress local and state resources.” People in crisis can also be more prone to lashing out and assaulting an officer, regardless of their coherence or intent, and end up facing jail time as a result. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his forthcoming budget presentation for 2025, Youngkin hopes that $35 million can be invested into creating “</span><a href="https://www.dcjs.virginia.gov/licensure-and-regulatory-affairs/special-conservators-peace" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Special Conservators of the Peace</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” he said this week. These are both armed and unarmed positions authorized by courts to carry out limited law enforcement duties. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While resources like 988 and mobile crisis units can help prevent people from going to the hospital, Youngkin believes the conservators can help improve the outcomes of those who are taken to hospitals by law enforcement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“(Officers) are brought into many of these circumstances that not only distract them from so many other responsibilities, but then have an individual who&#8217;s in crisis enter the criminal justice system unnecessarily — we need to address both of those,” Youngkin said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While state lawmakers will still need to collaborate with Youngkin throughout the first few months of 2025 to decide how the state’s budget will be allocated, Youngkin sees the conservator program as a temporary solution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We should see a reduction in hospital admittance, and therefore a reduction in the law enforcement needs around the hospital,” Youngkin said. “But for the time being, having our cops in place that allow this transfer of custody is really important.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anna Czaplicki Ryan, a program supervisor at CReST, described how some transfer of care is already happening between law enforcement and clinicians.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A ‘warm handoff’ is the terminology we use,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CReST staff and law enforcement already have some experience working together in instances where police are at the scene of an emergency first and ask for assistance or for clinicians to take over care, Czaplicki Ryan explained. When officers and clinicians demonstrate the transfer of care to patients, it can help them feel supported and know they are “not abandoned.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deeds, who serves on the Senate’s finance committee, said that he’s “fine with” Youngkin’s conservator proposal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I just think that our focus should not necessarily be on the moment of crisis,” Deeds said. “Our focus also needs to be on prevention, on keeping people out of crisis.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Asheley Tuck, whose son experienced a trauma, she said that she’s glad she knew that 988 and CReST existed in their moment of need. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If a friend had not mentioned that this program exists, I may not have known about it at all,” she said. “I think it should be regular public knowledge.”</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin speaks at an early vote rally in Chesterfield on Oct. 26, 2024. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ahead of his annual budget presentation to lawmakers next week, Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Thursday announced a <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/embargo-dec-12.pdf">proposal</a> to block state funding from any locality implementing a “sanctuary city” policy and “refusing to comply with federal law to deport” undocumented immigrants who have committed a crime. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The term sanctuary city refers to localities that choose to have limited or no cooperation with the U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If adopted in the final state budget, the Department of Criminal Justice Services director will be required to withhold from sanctuary city localities state funding that is usually earmarked for local police departments. The Compensation Board will also be required to withhold state per diem payments to local and regional jails. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal would also require local law enforcement and jail officials to provide notification to ICE 48 hours ahead of the release of  immigrants lacking permanent legal status who have committed a crime. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s administration noted a recent </span><a href="https://wjla.com/news/local/virginia-crime-herndon-virginia-man-arrest-repeat-offender-sexual-assault-rape-case-denis-humberto-navarette-romero-united-states-immigration-deportation-ice-illegal-immigrant-migrant-washington-old-dominion-railroad-trail-investigation" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">of an immigrant man in the U.S. illegallywith a previous criminal history who allegedly raped a woman on a running trail in Herndon, court documents show. Youngkin’s announcement also pointed out an instance this summer in Fairfax County where an undocumented person suspected of sex crimes against minors was </span><a href="https://wjla.com/news/local/fairfax-county-virginia-immigration-detainers-ice-services-migrants-undocumented-child-sex-crimes-tim-kaine-hung-cao-deportation?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">not detained</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A handful of cities and counties in Virginia have adopted policies to stop f law enforcement and municipal staff from voluntarily inquiring about a person’s immigration status, including  Arlington, Alexandria, Fairfax County and the city of Richmond. While most of the policies do entail compliance with ICE as federally mandated, they outline how municipal staff don’t need to make extra efforts to identify people who are potentially here illegally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, Arlington’s 2022 Trust Policy states that the city “will comply with all applicable federal or state regulations mandating cooperation with ICE and other federal immigration</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">officials &#8230; but will otherwise restrict sharing of personally identifiable information that could be used to further immigration enforcement efforts.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2017 </span><a href="https://www.wtvr.com/2017/02/06/stoney-policies-of-inclusion" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">directive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Richmond mayor Levar Stoney, however, entails noncompliance with ICE. Richmond City Jail and a few others around Virginia were listed as “non-compliant institutions” in an ICE report from June 2024. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of late November, according to the DCJS, nearly 1,000 incarcerated people in Virginia have had open immigration detainer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order for Youngkin’s proposal to take effect, it will need to be approved by the state legislature during 2025’s state budget negotiations. </span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans in Virginia’s 10th state Senate District will convene for a mass meeting on Friday to select their nominee in an upcoming special election. The vacancy was prompted by the resignation of Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland, who is set to leave his post after being elected to Congress​. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The meeting will take place at the Goochland Rec Center, with registration running from 4:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m., and proceedings beginning at 6:30 p.m. A total of seven candidates are vying to succeed McGuire. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organized by local party committees, mass meetings require party members to gather at a designated time and place to publicly select a candidate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike secret ballots, voting is often conducted through a show of hands, voice vote, or other public method. Participants must remain present for multiple rounds of voting until one candidate secures a majority — typically more than 50% of the votes — to be declared the winner. This process can be lengthy, especially in races with a crowded field of candidates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the GOP nominee is selected, they will face Democrat Jack Trammel in a special election on Jan. 7 set by Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, the Senate president pro tempore. The winner will serve out the remainder of McGuire’s term in the Senate, which ends in 2027.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the first Republicans to declare their candidacy for McGuire’s seat was Amanda Chase, a former state senator from Chesterfield County who served in the Virginia Senate for eight years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chase previously ran for re-election in 2023 but lost the GOP primary for her Chesterfield-based seat to Sen. Glen Sturtevant. To qualify for the 10th District race, Chase moved to Appomattox County, as Virginia law requires state legislators to live in the district they represent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joining the race is Shayne Snavely, an Amelia-based entrepreneur, veteran who was a former aide to Chase and worked on her failed 2021 gubernatorial campaign. Jean Gannon, a Powhatan County real estate appraiser and long-time Republican activist, has also thrown her hat into the ring. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Duane Adams, the chairman of the Louisa County Board of Supervisors, is making a bid for the seat as well. Adams previously ran for the Republican nomination in the district in 2023 but was defeated by McGuire​.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other contenders include Alex Cheatham, a recent college graduate aiming to make his political debut, and two late entrants: Luther Cifers, a businessman from Prince Edward County, and Bryan Hamlet, chairman of the Cumberland County Board of Supervisors​.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have a pretty good selection among the group there. I don’t know everybody, but I think that they will all be competitive candidates in that district,” Rich Anderson, chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia, said in a phone interview. “Obviously as a conservative Republican leading the conservative party, I want to get a conservative Republican nominated.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson said that the mass meeting could last late into the evening.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The process will probably require multiple ballots with that many people on the docket, so we’ll just see how it all turns out. I can’t predict who will walk away with all the marbles, but one of them will.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg, said that of the Republicans who have thrown their names in the ring for the special election to replace McGuire, “Chase is perhaps the best known or most notorious.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Richards doubts that Chase will get her party’s nod. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The mass meeting nomination process caters to party members, and Chase has little credibility with the local party after being expelled by the Chesterfield GOP and being noticeably absent from the one candidates forum already held. And she has little credibility with local Republicans, which will hurt her chances.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the remaining six candidates, Adams has been very active beginning with his unsuccessful bid for the nomination in 2023, which McGuire won, Richards said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The key to these mass meetings is name recognition in a positive way. Aside from the candidate forum held in late November, there has not been much opportunity or time for candidates to get their message out. Their pre-existing connections will tip the scale, which is why I expect Adams to win the nomination.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adams will still “get a run for his money” from Snavely, who also has a lot of party experience working for Chase earlier in his career, Richards added. “The other candidates have very low profiles, but Jean Gannon has been active in local GOP politics, which might help her.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire, who in June defeated incumbent U.S. Rep. Bob Good, R-Farmville, in one of the most viciously fought and expensive GOP primary battles nationwide this year, had kept Republicans </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/25/mcguire-still-hasnt-resigned-his-state-senate-seat-weeks-after-congressional-win/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on edge for weeks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after winning his election against Democrat Gloria Witt on Nov. 5. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically, elected officials who win a new position resign from their current office within days to allow for a special election to be called promptly, ensuring the seat isn’t left vacant when the next legislative session begins in early January. However, McGuire delayed his departure, formally stepping down on Wednesday​.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his official resignation letter, McGuire called his brief stint in the state Senate “the privilege of a lifetime” and said he hoped voters would choose “a strong candidate who loves We The People,” works well with others and who has “never wavered on our core Republican values.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, McGuire stopped short from publicly backing one of the seven candidates vying to succeed him. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was not too surprised that McGuire has not endorsed anyone, especially Adams,” said Richards. “When McGuire announced he was primarying Bob Good, Adams was very vocal about McGuire’s decision, calling him a liar, so there does not seem to be much love lost there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 10th Senate District, which spans 11 localities from Lynchburg in the west to the suburbs of Richmond in the east, leans heavily Republican. The district backed President-elect Donald Trump with 62.8% of the vote last month and gave Republican Glenn Youngkin an even stronger 67.8% support during his successful 2021 gubernatorial campaign.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin's proposal to invest another $290 million for school construction needs during the upcoming legislative session which begins in January. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Tuesday announced that he is asking the legislature for an additional $290 million to support school construction and modernization efforts across Virginia. This latest investment would bring the total funding for the current biennium to $700 million and raise the state’s overall contribution under Youngkin’s administration to nearly $2 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s funding request is included in his proposed budget amendments, which he plans to present next week at a joint meeting of the General Assembly’s money committees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the governor’s office, the state’s financial commitments have spurred an estimated $3.4 billion in total funding for school construction. The additional support would be made possible through a combination of local government contributions and federal matching funds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Over the last three years, we have invested historic amounts in our education system, including our public school facilities,” Youngkin said in a statement. “Our record economic growth and the resulting surplus allows us to make this critical investment to ensure every Virginia student has access to high-quality school facilities that support academic success.” </span></p>

Glenn Youngkin speaking with reporters outside the Capitol Building on March 7, 2024. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin plans to use the newly announced $290 million in non-general funds to expand competitive grant opportunities for school divisions, particularly in high-need areas. The money would also address critical infrastructure issues, supporting the construction and renovation of schools in urgent need of repair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State officials say the increased funding will provide K-12 students with safer, more conducive learning spaces, a move that has been welcomed by educators and community leaders alike. Local school divisions will be able to apply for grant support to fast-track modernization projects that may have been delayed due to funding shortfalls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Youngkin administration has framed the initiative as part of a broader effort to support Virginia&#8217;s educational system and improve outcomes for students. As schools across the state face aging infrastructure and capacity challenges, this investment aims to reduce disparities in facility quality, especially in underserved areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of our guiding principles since day one of the Youngkin Administration has been to provide safe, vibrant, and healthy learning environments for all of our students,” said Secretary of Education Aimee Guidera. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This investment in supporting new and refurbished school buildings makes it possible for every community in the commonwealth to have the means to provide a best-in-class education that prepares every student for success in our increasingly demanding knowledge- and skills-based economy.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Candi Mundon King, D-Prince William, a member of the Commission on School Construction and Modernization, said that while she welcomed Youngkin’s proposal, she needed more information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have been screaming from the rooftops about more money for school construction and ensuring that localities have what they need, so I’m glad to see that he&#8217;s trying to get on board,” Mundon King said. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_41173" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:280px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/10/youngkin-seeks-additional-290-million-boost-for-school-construction/screenshot-2024-12-10-at-3-02-35-pm/" rel="attachment wp-att-41173"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-41173" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-10-at-3.02.35 PM-280x300.png" alt="" width="280" height="300" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-10-at-3.02.35 PM-280x300.png 280w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-10-at-3.02.35 PM-957x1024.png 957w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-10-at-3.02.35 PM-768x822.png 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-10-at-3.02.35 PM.png 1032w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Del. Candi Mundon King, D-Prince William, is a member of the Commission on School Construction and Modernization (Courtesy Candi Mundon King).</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is clear that we need to put more money into school construction, but I can’t say more without seeing a fully fleshed out plan. So I’m looking forward to his presentation next week with the joint money committees so we can fully evaluate what this proposal actually is, and not just some slick press release that doesn’t go into detail.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022, Youngkin’s first year in office, the General Assembly in a bipartisan effort approved a historic $1.2 billion investment in school construction, aiming to modernize aging facilities and reduce funding disparities among school divisions. The sweeping plan combined grants and loans to support renovations, new construction, and capacity expansion for K-12 schools across the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the $1.2 billion, about $850 million was allocated for grants. This included $400 million in formula-based grants, which provided each of Virginia’s 134 school divisions with a $1 million base allocation. The remaining $266 million was distributed based on the Local Composite Index (LCI) — a state funding formula that considers factors like property values, taxable sales and population data to assess a locality’s financial ability to support its schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another $450 million was funneled into the newly created School Construction Fund and Program, a competitive grant program designed to assist divisions with the most critical infrastructure needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">School systems with poor building conditions and limited financial capacity could apply for these funds to support construction, renovation, or expansion projects. This program is primarily funded by 98% of gaming revenue from Virginia’s four new casinos in Bristol, Danville, Portsmouth, and Norfolk. The fund is administered by the Virginia Board of Education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia faces a mounting crisis with school infrastructure. Data released by the Virginia Department of Education in 2022 revealed that nearly 1,000 school buildings across the state are at least 50 years old. Replacing these facilities would cost more than $25 billion — a figure far beyond the capacity of most localities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditionally, local governments have shouldered the financial burden of school construction, relying on local tax revenue. But for economically distressed areas, particularly in Southwest Virginia and Southside, this has become an increasingly difficult challenge due to population decline and economic hardship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in April, Youngkin </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/11/youngkin-vetoes-measure-to-let-va-localities-increase-sales-tax-to-pay-for-school-construction/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed a bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lawmakers sent to his desk that would have allowed localities to implement a 1% sales tax to help cover the costs of school construction and modernization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB14" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> required voter approval through a referendum before the tax could be enacted by local governments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin acknowledged that school construction is a “worthy cause” but argued that Virginia has already taken substantial steps to address those costs. He contended that citizens should not face additional taxes, particularly the $1.5 billion annually that would have been raised by the 1% sales tax.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The commonwealth should pursue a tax policy that unleashes economic development and prioritizes job and wage growth through innovative reforms,” Youngkin said in his </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+amd+SB14AG" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">veto</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “These reforms must allow hardworking Virginians to keep more of their money, not less; any proposal that increases the cost of living and the cost of business is not a policy we should pursue.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to 2022, state assistance for school construction was limited, with much of it coming from the Literary Fund, a state-managed pool of money established in Virginia’s Constitution. Funded by sources such as unclaimed lottery winnings, criminal fines, and unclaimed property, the Literary Fund historically provided low-interest loans to support school construction and debt service for technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in recent years, much of the fund’s revenue was redirected to cover teacher retirement costs, leaving fewer resources for school building projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2022 legislative session retooled the Literary Fund’s loan program, significantly increasing its impact. Lawmakers raised the maximum loan amount from $7.5 million to $25 million and capped the interest rate at 2%. These changes made it more feasible for school divisions to finance major construction projects at a lower cost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the state’s total contribution now approaching $2 billion, education advocates are hopeful the increased funding will lead to long-term improvements in school facilities and better learning conditions for students throughout the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Board of Education President Grace Creasey said Tuesday that the panel will prioritize “those school divisions in greatest need that have missed out on prior grant opportunities,” especially rural divisions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We also know that school divisions are eager to adopt seat time flexibility and competency-based models which requires us to design learning environments and spaces differently. This new investment will make this possible,” Creasey said.</span></p>

Republican and Democratic lawmakers in some two dozen states have introduced bills aimed at restricting or legalizing the practice of for-profit companies charging veterans fees for help filing disability claims — an issue that often has pitted veterans against one another. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images)</p><p>For-profit consultants across the country make millions each year by charging military veterans for help in filing their disability claims with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.</p>
<p>The practice exists in a legal loophole: It’s illegal under federal law for companies that aren’t accredited by the VA to charge veterans fees for helping file their disability claims, but there’s no criminal penalty for breaking the law. Recent attempts to regulate this for-profit shadow industry have <a href="https://pappas.house.gov/media/press-releases/bipartisan-support-grows-for-pappas-bill-to-protect-veterans-benefits-from-predatory-claim-sharks#:~:text=In%20August%202022,the%20118th%20Congress." target="_blank">stalled in Congress</a>.</p>
<p>While some state lawmakers are trying to close the loophole by filing bills to restrict the practice, they’re up against their legislative peers and a cadre of industry leaders with a stable of lobbyists who want the loophole sealed into place at the state level.</p>
<p>Three states — Maine, New Jersey and New York — passed laws in the past year cracking down on for-profit consultants. Similar bills were introduced in 17 other states.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Louisiana <a href="https://legis.la.gov/legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=1381966" target="_blank">enacted a law</a> <a href="https://www.navr.org/2024/05/23/former-va-acting-secretary-peter-orourke-applauds-louisiana-house-of-representatives-for-voting-overwhelmingly-in-favor-of-sb-159-protecting-veterans-rights-with-the-preserving-lawful-utilization-of-s/" target="_blank">hailed</a> by the for-profit industry as a win; it allows companies to charge up to $12,500 in fees for a task that veterans service organizations such as The American Legion will do for free.</p>
<p>The issue is pitting veterans against one another.</p>
<p>“When we have organizations and companies out there like these claim sharks that are preying on our veterans and taking away their hard-earned benefits and making a profit off them, there’s something empirically wrong with that,” said Missouri Republican state Rep. Dave Griffith, a former Green Beret in the U.S. Army 8th Special Forces Group.</p>
<p>Griffith introduced <a href="https://legiscan.com/MO/text/HB1490/id/2861589" target="_blank">a bill</a> earlier this year that would impose criminal penalties on those receiving compensation for helping a veteran apply for benefits. The bill died in committee, but Griffith has refiled it for the upcoming legislative session.</p>
<p>“What’s even more disturbing to me,” said Griffith, who served in Vietnam, “is that many of these organizations are run by veterans.”</p>
<p>The for-profit consulting industry argues that veterans should have the freedom to hire whomever they want to help them navigate the VA’s plodding, glitchy application process. Disability claims currently take <a href="https://department.va.gov/pactdata/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2024/11/VA-PACT-Act-Dashboard-Issue-43-111524_Final_508.pdf" target="_blank">four or five months</a> on average to resolve, according to VA data, though some languish for <a href="https://www.vaoig.gov/reports/review/delays-occurred-some-veterans-benefits-claims-while-awaiting-decision#:~:text=some%20claims%20at%20the%20NWQ%20division%20had%20been%20awaiting%20decisions%20for%20one%20year%20or%20longer." target="_blank">a year or more</a>.</p>
<p>Some veterans have <a href="https://lailluminator.com/2024/05/06/lawmakers-ponder-whether-consultants-for-veteran-benefits-should-see-big-profits/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20DAV%20got%20me%20another%2030%25%20on%20the%20asbestos%2C%E2%80%9D%20Monroe%20said%2C%20%E2%80%9Cbut%20they%20weren%E2%80%99t%20going%20any%20further%20with%20it.%20Veterans%20Guardian%20got%20me%20bumped%20up%20to%2080%25%20with%20the%20depression%20caused%20by%20the%20asbestos%20%E2%80%A6%20So%20yeah%2C%20I%20didn%E2%80%99t%20want%20to%20give%20them%20that%20%248%2C000%2C%20but%20they%20earned%20it%20and%20I%20paid%20them.%20That%20was%20my%20agreement.%E2%80%9D" target="_blank">reported</a> that the expense is worth it — and have chided the government for not doing a better job marketing directly to vets about how to get their benefits.</p>
<p>The companies charging exorbitant fees, industry representatives say, are just a few bad apples.</p>
<p>“The key for us is having transparent disclosures, processes and statements of fees so veterans can make informed decisions,” said Peter O’Rourke, president of the National Association for Veteran Rights, a newly formed trade association for the claims consulting industry. O’Rourke, a U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force veteran, was formerly acting secretary of Veterans Affairs during the Trump administration before he was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/there-were-times-i-didnt-have-a-lot-to-do-trump-loyalist-at-va-forced-out-after-collecting-pay-but-doing-little-work/2018/12/11/26e4704a-fcb7-11e8-ad40-cdfd0e0dd65a_story.html" target="_blank">forced out</a> in 2018.</p>
<p>O’Rourke estimated he and his team have been to 38 states to testify at committee hearings and speak with legislators.</p>
<p>“There’s a better way of doing business, and we need to have more of that discussion, versus going back in time and criminalizing what the market has been able to provide veterans,” he said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Promises and profits</h4>

	
<p>The urgency from all sides of the issue follows Congress’ passage two years ago of the PACT Act, <a href="https://www.va.gov/resources/the-pact-act-and-your-va-benefits/" target="_blank">the largest expansion</a> of veterans’ benefits in generations. It offers disability-related benefits for veterans suffering from the effects of Agent Orange, toxic burn pits in recent wars and other toxic exposures over the past several decades. Under the act, millions more veterans <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/burn-pits-toxic-exposure-pact-act-veterans-affairs/" target="_blank">could qualify</a> for aid.</p>
<p>That increased funding represents a potential bonanza for private consultants who promise to help military veterans access it — for a price.</p>
<p>Veterans with a service-related disability, from cancer to asthma to depression, can apply to receive a monthly cash benefit from the government. Their checks could range from $500 to <a href="https://www.va.gov/disability/compensation-rates/veteran-rates/" target="_blank">more than $4,000 per month</a>, depending on the severity of the disability and other factors, such as their number of dependents.</p>
<p>But getting approved takes months. The claims process — sluggish and riddled with glitches, according to veterans and the VA’s own data — requires a lengthy application and detailed medical documentation.</p>
<p>Enter the private claims consultant. For a fee or a cut of a veteran’s future disability benefits — often five times what the veteran stands to receive from the VA, amounting to thousands of dollars — the consulting company promises to help smooth the process and maximize the veteran’s disability check.</p>
<p>“Veterans are often facing delays with the VA, and I can see why there’s a desire to get results. But these companies sometimes use exploitative practices and seize a big chunk of your benefits,” said Florida Democratic state Rep. Anna V. Eskamani. She partnered with Republican state Rep. Michelle Salzman, an Army veteran, to introduce a claim shark bill in the most recent legislative session. The bill died in committee, but Eskamani said they plan to continue talking with veterans and introduce a similar bill next session.</p>
<p>Since January, Republican and Democratic lawmakers in at least 17 states — from Rhode Island to Mississippi to California — have introduced bills to ban or restrict private claim consultants from profiting off veterans.</p>
<p>Most are based on the federal <a href="https://www.veterans.senate.gov/2024/3/tester-s-guard-va-benefits-act-receives-strong-support-at-final-hearing-with-veterans-service-organizations" target="_blank">GUARD Act</a>, currently stalled in Congress, which would impose penalties on unaccredited consultants who charge veterans for claims filing assistance. Organizations such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars and The American Legion have been outspoken supporters of the GUARD Act and similar state efforts to rein in for-profit consultants.</p>
<p>Last year, New Jersey became the first state to make it illegal for anyone lacking VA accreditation to charge a veteran for assistance filing a disability claim. Maine and New York soon followed.</p>

<p>The VA <a href="https://www.va.gov/resources/va-accredited-representative-faqs/" target="_blank">grants accreditation</a> to attorneys, veterans service organizations and other claims agents that meet certain requirements, such as a background check and a written exam. Organizations such as the VFW and The American Legion provide their services for free, though attorneys and agents are allowed to charge fees to assist with some claims, including appeals.</p>
<p>Griffith, the Missouri legislator, modeled his bill after the New Jersey law. When he first began researching the issue, he said, he didn’t like what he saw. Often, he said, companies will charge a fee for their services equal to five times the increase of the veteran’s monthly benefit.</p>
<p>For example: A new veteran approved for 100% disability receives about $3,800 per month from the VA. For help filing that claim, a consulting company might charge a one-time fee of about $19,000.</p>
<p>In some cases, Griffith said, consultants can pocket as much as $30,000 through tactics such as holding onto a claim for months before filing so that they can take their cut from the substantial backpay that the VA eventually awards the veteran.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Criticism and pushback</h4>

	
<p>O’Rourke said his group is in favor of some legal guardrails at the federal or state level to protect veterans from exploitation, such as setting certain limits around fees or requiring transparency in contract agreements. But, he said, private consulting should be freely available because the VA and its current accreditation process haven’t kept up with the needs of veterans.</p>
<p>“We’re looking at, after 20 years of war, a strain on our social infrastructure when it comes to how we take care of veterans,” he said, noting that the VA’s claims and appeals process is decades old, complex and cumbersome to navigate, even with accredited groups offering help. “Asking veterans to go into a system that uses a lot of their time and causes frustration … veterans are going to try to find workarounds for that.”</p>
<p>Groups including the VFW have been vocal opponents of for-profit consulting companies, urging lawmakers to take action and waging <a href="https://vfworg-cdn.azureedge.net/-/media/VFWSite/Files/PACT-Act/Dont-Feed-the-Sharks-One-Pager.pdf?v=1&amp;d=20240509T174110Z" target="_blank">public relations battles</a> against the industry. For-profit companies have been <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2023/07/05/veterans-disability-benefits-brian-reese-va-claims-insider/" target="_blank">investigated</a> by <a href="https://www.wbtv.com/2020/02/18/nc-company-charges-veterans-benefits-advice-they-could-get-free/#:~:text=He%20provided%20an%20email%20confirming%20his%20benefits%20had%20been%20submitted%20by%20the%20company." target="_blank">media</a> and officials in states including <a href="https://static.texastribune.org/media/files/588e1e97fd5cc96302fbb57b8a47697f/TX%20Attorney%20General%20request%20for%20information.pdf" target="_blank">Texas</a> and <a href="https://houmatimes.com/crime/ag-louisiana-company-targeting-veterans-shut-down/" target="_blank">Louisiana</a> for potentially illegal practices.</p>
<p>Last year, the <a href="https://www.vaoig.gov/sites/default/files/document/2023-10/september_2023_fraud_alert.pdf" target="_blank">VA issued a fraud alert</a>, warning veterans to avoid consultants who aren’t accredited.</p>
<p>But the industry is pushing back. One of the largest for-profit consulting companies spent more than $800,000 last year and $780,000 this year in federal lobbying efforts, <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/federal-lobbying/clients/summary?id=D000089168" target="_blank">according to</a> data compiled by the nonprofit OpenSecrets. That included pushing for <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1822/cosponsors?s=2&amp;r=6&amp;q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22plus+act%22%7D" target="_blank">a bill</a> that would make the legal loophole permanent. At the state level, representatives from some of the industry’s largest players are showing up in statehouses across the country to speak against bills.</p>
<p>“I got very close to getting my bill passed last year,” said Griffith. But claims consulting companies hired a lobbyist in Missouri, he said. “They lobbied the [House] speaker’s office and he delayed the bill.”</p>
<p>During a committee hearing, Missouri legislators heard opposition to the bill from O’Rourke, who <a href="https://veteranspolicy.org/post/florida-legislature-cracks-down-on-claim-sharks-stealing-va-benefits-from-disabled-veterans/#:~:text=In%20his%20testimony,proposed%20regulations%20public." target="_blank">also testified</a> against Eskamani and Salzman’s bill in Florida.</p>
<p>“I was surprised at the amount of money they’re willing to spend to try to keep things the way they are,” said Eskamani, who said she didn’t expect to see such a concerted effort to stop a bill in its first committee meeting.</p>
<p>In June, Louisiana <a href="https://alabamareflector.com/2024/06/07/louisiana-enacts-law-to-let-consultants-profit-off-disabled-veterans-benefit-claims/" target="_blank">quietly enacted a law</a> that will allow unregulated companies to profit from assisting veterans with their disability claims, though it caps consulting fees at $12,500. Republican Gov. Jeff Landry allowed the bill to become law without his signature. It marked an about-face for Landry: When he was the state attorney general, he worked to <a href="https://houmatimes.com/crime/ag-louisiana-company-targeting-veterans-shut-down/" target="_blank">shut down</a> the types of consulting businesses the law now explicitly allows.</p>
<p>Similar bills were introduced this year in <a href="https://legiscan.com/AZ/bill/SB1308/2024" target="_blank">Arizona</a>, <a href="https://legiscan.com/AZ/bill/SB1308/2024" target="_blank">Georgia</a>, <a href="https://legiscan.com/HI/bill/HB2225/2024" target="_blank">Hawaii</a> and <a href="https://legiscan.com/KY/bill/HB39/2024" target="_blank">Kentucky</a>, but did not pass.</p>
<p>Last month in Alabama, members of the legislative committee for the state veterans affairs department voted to work with state lawmakers on a bill to prohibit claims consultants from profiting off veterans. The issue is likely to show up again next year in state legislative sessions around the country.</p>

Glenn Youngkin's proposal to invest another $290 million for school construction needs during the upcoming legislative session which begins in January. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a Republican-controlled White House, U.S. House and Senate on the horizon, some special elections in Virginia next month are the first opportunity for voters to challenge or reinforce Democratic majorities in the state legislature.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee is putting a spotlight on Senate District 32 and House District 26. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After winning a Democratic primary, Del. Kannan Srinivasan, D-Loudoun, will face off against Republican Tumay Harding to be elected to the Virginia Senate. He could succeed Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, who was elected to the U.S. Congress last month.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Qvdt5FXd2u"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/08/virginia-prepares-for-special-elections-as-mcguire-subramanyam-head-to-congress-leaving-senate-seats-up-for-grabs/">Virginia prepares for special elections as McGuire, Subramanyam head to Congress</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, J.J. Singh, who won a Democratic primary for Loudoun County-based House District 26, could potentially succeed Srinivasan’s House seat. He faces Republican Ram Venkatachalam. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DLCC director Heather Williams issued a statement noting that protecting Democrats’ slim majorities will “position us to be competitive in November when the entire House of Delegates is on the ballot alongside a competitive </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/25/spanberger-and-earle-sears-tied-in-first-2025-gubernatorial-poll/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gubernatorial race</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats currently have a 21-19 edge in the Senate and a  51-48 lead in the House with Republican Glenn Youngkin as governor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She added that Virginia can be a key indicator of “what the fight ahead looks like” to build Democratic power in states amid the Republican majorities in federal government. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortifying the Democratic firewall in the states has never been more important, and that work starts in Virginia,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the DLCC “spotlight” program, Srinivasan and Singh will be assisted in fundraising and can tap into DLCC experts on staff for advice or help with organizing. The group has boosted legislative candidates around the country and focuses on seats that are crucial for protecting or making majorities, said Sam Paisley, an interim communications director with DLCC. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Democratic majority can jumpstart planned constitutional amendments</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While DLCC is watching key state elections around the country for how they can support Democrats’ ability to balance out federal GOP majorities, Virginia’s Democratic majorities will be a key part of advancing planned amendments to the state’s constitution.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="j6PDqB758w"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/13/va-house-panel-advances-amendments-on-abortion-rights-marriage-equality-and-voting-rights/">Va. House panel advances amendments on abortion rights, marriage equality and voting rights</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Va. House panel advances amendments on abortion rights, marriage equality and voting rights&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/13/va-house-panel-advances-amendments-on-abortion-rights-marriage-equality-and-voting-rights/embed/#?secret=SmIsD8zngc#?secret=j6PDqB758w" data-secret="j6PDqB758w" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The amendments would enshrine abortion access protections into the constitution, remove a prohibition on same-sex marriage from it, and create an automatic process for formerly incarcerated people with felony convictions to have their rights restored. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is the least-restrictive Southern state when it comes to abortion access. The matter was paramount in the 2023 state legislative elections as Democrats vowed to protect current law (and eventually enshrine it into the constitution) and many Republicans coalesced around a 15-week cap on most abortions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under current Virginia law, any abortion occurring in the third trimester requires approval from three doctors. The new amendment would reduce that threshold to one doctor, should a later stage abortion be deemed necessary to protect the life or mental health of the pregnant person or should their fetus be deemed not viable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With no national definition of fetal viability — which refers to the likelihood of a fetus being able to survive outside of the womb — doctors typically make the determination on a case-by-case basis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, people with felony convictions are all but permanently disenfranchised from various rights, even after they’ve completed prison sentences. Previous governors’ administrations had streamlined a restoration process. Then Youngkin’s administration made it petition-based with unclear criteria. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That meant that hundreds of applicants this year were rejected — and therefore </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/23/these-virginians-wont-be-able-to-vote-next-month/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unable to vote </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in presidential and congressional elections — without knowing why. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This amendment creates a process that is bound by transparent rules and criteria that will apply equally to everybody,” the bill’s sponsor Del. Elizabeth Bennett-Parker, D-Alexandria said last month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the third amendment would allow Virginia to continue recognizing same-sex marriages should federal protections be undone, as they were with abortion protections. Since a 2006 amendment, </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/constitution/article1/section15-A/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s constitution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> defines marriage between a man and a woman. Though it’s been rendered moot since a 2015 Supreme Court of the United States decision, some lawmakers and LGBTQ advocates have stressed the importance of removing the prohibition in case that precedent were to fall (as Supreme Court judge Clarence Thomas has </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/dem-lawmakers-want-to-put-same-sex-marriage-in-virginia-s-constitution/article_46aa7008-ab32-11ee-af3d-e79f1e61bf21.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expressed interest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in revisiting). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a Democrat-led panel was able to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/13/va-house-panel-advances-amendments-on-abortion-rights-marriage-equality-and-voting-rights/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all three amendments earlier this month, the marriage equality one saw bipartisan support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Placing these policies into the constitution would make them less subject to partisan shifts in the legislature or governors’ mansion — but it’s also a longer process than just passing one law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Constitutional amendments have to clear both chambers of the legislature two years in a row, with a House of Delegates election in between. From there, they can appear as ballot referendums for voters around the state to approve or reject. This means voters could weigh in by November 2026 — if the proposals pass in 2025 and earlier in 2026. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Senate District 10 special election still unclear</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Srinivasan and Singh have the chance to lock down Democratic control in each chamber, the Republican-leaning state senate seat still hasn’t had its special election set.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland’s election to Congress last month will create a vacancy in Senate District 10 — but he has not yet formally </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/25/mcguire-still-hasnt-resigned-his-state-senate-seat-weeks-after-congressional-win/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">resigned </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">from his current position. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, Senate Minority Leader Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover told The Mercury that he was confident there would also be an election to replace McGuire on Jan. 7, but did not elaborate further. As of this week, he relayed that there are no new updates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire, who was reached by phone, said to send him an email. He did not respond by the time of this publication. </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Glen Sturtevant, R-Chesterfield, has been frustrated by large investment firms purchasing homes in Virginia. Both in </span><a href="https://x.com/GlenSturtevant/status/1860751697703739745" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">posts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on social media and in a Zoom call open to the public and press on Wednesday, he outlined some policy proposals that he hopes can help with affordable housing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, he laid out his legislative efforts to reign in investment firms. After an unsuccessful </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/SB693" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">attempt </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in 2024, he said that he’s reworking his bill for the 2025 session. If passed, it would prohibit investment firms worth more than $50 million from purchasing homes.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is intended to target the big Wall Street investors, not your mom-and-pop investors who buy a home and flip it or who have a duplex under management,” he said.</span></p>

Glen Sturtevant, R-Chesterfield, in 2019. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mostly, he hopes it can help people who are struggling to afford a home, particularly first-time homebuyers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A meeting attendee named Holly Dougherty wrote in the group chat that her adult children are losing out on homebuying opportunities to investors with cash offers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There needs to be a way to keep young families in the community,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sturtevant said that anecdotally, it’s been a “nightmare” for “millennials and older Gen Zers who are coming out of school and trying to buy their first home.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He pointed to data from </span><a href="https://www.redfin.com/news/investor-home-purchases-q2-2024/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Redfin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that confirms a spike in investment firms purchasing homes. Investors bought one out of every six homes in the nation and one out of every four low-priced homes that sold in the second quarter of this year. Single-family homes made up nearly 70% of their purchases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sturtevant also pointed out how investment firms can sit on properties rather than redeveloping them or selling them, with a team of people analyzing the best moment they can sell for the highest price, despite having an advantage over individual buyers when acquiring the property in the first place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s ultimately not fair for them to be competing with regular people,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other legislation Sturtevant wants to spearhead would allow homebuyers to inherit a seller’s mortgage and its rate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An example of where people could see immediate benefit through that measure, he said, are people who were able to purchase a home or refinance their home during lower rates when the COVID-19 pandemic was surging. A new buyer could inherit that benefit if the law were to pass. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And finally, he said he is exploring ways to incentivize companies in the commonwealth to offer down payment assistance to employees. He said that the idea is to benefit both young employees who may lack the cash for down payments while also nurturing workforce development and keeping people in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while Sturtevant is still fine-tuning his proposals with Virginia’s Division of Legislative Services — legal experts that assist lawmakers in drafting legislation — he stressed that the laws are only part of broader solutions when it comes to the state’s affordable housing issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris Saxman, a former state delegate who hosted the Zoom call, noted how “everybody seems to be having housing issues these days.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing was a prominent topic in this year’s local and federal elections. Presidential candidates Kamala Harris (who </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/how-kamala-harris-new-policy-plan-could-impact-housing-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">offered </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">a downpayment assistance proposal) and President-elect Donald Trump talked about the nation’s housing needs during their campaigns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though housing is typically addressed at the local level, in Wednesday’s Zoom Saxman and Sturtevant reflected on ways state and federal governments can help with supply and affordability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saxman said that he thinks Sturtevant’s bills might be hard to vote against, especially with the House of Delegates up for election in 2025. His ideas will first need to clear the Senate before review by the House and approval from the governor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, who chairs the Housing Commission, welcomes Sturtevant’s intended work in addressing housing issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But she stressed that Republicans have not always been on board with supporting other efforts to boost affordable housing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Accessible and affordable housing has been at the forefront of the Democratic agenda for decades, (with) proposals often thwarted by our Republican colleagues,” she said. “That was never more evident than during the housing crisis in the 2009-2010 time frame and during the eviction crisis. Many voted against the budget that included funding for the Housing Trust Fund.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Locke said that she is “glad to know some finally understand this is a serious problem.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have put forward measures this year to address housing challenges in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield and Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield carried a proposal called “5,000 Families,” which would provide rental relief to certain families with school-age children to prevent displacement during academic years. Though it did not pass this year, housing groups have their </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/25/virginia-housing-groups-look-ahead-to-2025-for-legislative-funding-solutions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">eye on it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for next session. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Jeremy McPike’s Senate Bill 597 would have </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/bill-to-boost-affordable-housing-advances-to-youngkin/article_33e7b884-dd8e-11ee-96af-a7e0399a77a3.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">allowed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more local governments to utilize federal housing tax credits to encourage the development of additional affordable housing — typically associated with ranges of an area’s median income. The bill cleared both chambers before being vetoed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both proposals may resurface in the next legislative session beginning in January, and Sturtevant will try again on his investment firm bill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislature was able to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/10/these-new-housing-laws-will-take-effect-next-month/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">approve a series of housing reforms </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">this year. Some support renters, while another bill established a workgroup that can explore future </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/25/virginia-considering-future-building-code-updates-that-could-help-with-infill-development/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">building code changes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Another successful bill was aimed at protecting existing mobile home parks — a vulnerable but affordable type of housing for which residents own their homes, but not the land beneath it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Youngkin also recently issued </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/workforce-housing-directive-to-bolster-economic-development-and-new-home-construction-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a directive </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to invest up to $75 million towards localities that want to bolster housing supply tied to new job creation over the next five years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This isn’t partisan stuff,” Saxman said. </span></p>

Thanks to India reducing its tariff on frozen turkey, Virginia turkey farmers have a new market. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Virginians gather around the table for some Thanksgiving turkey, the state&#8217;s first shipment of turkey products are headed to India, thanks in part to the work of the state&#8217;s two U.S. senators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this month, Sen. Mark Warner announced that India will receive the frozen birds after reduced tariffs facilitated the first shipment</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Obviously you&#8217;ve got a big turkey industry in the Shenandoah Valley,” Warner said during a press conference on Nov. 14. “We have been fighting for some time to get the markets of India and Turkey, (the) country Turkey, open. That has now taken place.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Virginia was the country’s sixth largest producer of turkeys in 2023 with 15.5 million birds, while its North Carolina neighbor ranked second with 29 million birds. Minnesota had the most with 38.5 million birds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, Virginia’s turkey production contributed to the overall poultry industry’s economic impact of $5.8 billion directly to Virginia’s economy. John King, president of the Virginia Poultry Growers Cooperative, said in a statement that the shipment to India “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">will directly benefit our nearly 200 independent grower owners.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shipment earlier this month occurred after Ambassador Katherine Tai, the U.S. trade representative, worked with India to get the country to reduce tariffs on frozen turkey, frozen duck and fresh frozen, dried and processed blueberries and cranberries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In June 2023, before Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the United States, Warner, Sen. Tim Kaine and five other senators sent a </span><a href="https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/7/6/7638bcc5-a2eb-4c3f-93a9-462c8d258d29/905D5CD94F560DB2CD32591ADD0D8148.6.21.23-india-u.s.-turkey-letter-to-ustr-final.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Tai urging her to work to get India to reduce the tariff, which amounted to an additional 30% duty, or fee. In </span><a href="https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2023/september/united-states-announces-resolution-outstanding-wto-poultry-dispute-india" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">September</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Tai announced the tariff for turkey products dropping to 5%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Resolving this last outstanding (World Trade Organization) dispute represents an important milestone in the U.S.-India trade relationship, while reducing tariffs on certain U.S. products enhances crucial market access for American agricultural producers,” Tai said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The demand for turkey is “strong” in India, said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shana Oshinskie, a spokesperson for Warner’s office, “driven in part by their robust population growth, lack of a domestic alternative, and increasing protein need.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the World Health Organization, the population of </span><a href="https://data.who.int/countries/356" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">India</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is expected to increase to about 1.7 billion people by 2050. In 2016, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, produced a </span><a href="https://kiran.nic.in/pdf/farmers_corner/pamphlets-2016/TurkeyFarming.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> outlining ways to increase domestic turkey rearing and called the birds’ meat “the leanest among other poultry species with lower fat and cholesterol content compared to red meat.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is part of Sen. Warner’s broader push to strengthen our economic and diplomatic ties with India, one of our most key partners, and this move particularly benefits Virginia’s sizable population of poultry producers,” Oshinskie added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">King, by phone interview, said his group had sales of turkey’s at a rate of about 17.7 pounds per person when the group started 20 years ago, but that’s <a href="https://www.usda.gov/oce/commodity/wasde/wasde1024.pdf" target="_blank">dropped</a> to about 13.9 pounds per person this year due to bird illnesses, limited supply and rising costs. While Mexico “continues to be a great trading partner,” markets in China have become “not as reliable,” King said, prompting the desire to seek the populous India.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We need some help in the export markets,” King said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first shipment of frozen turkey products raised by the Virginia Poultry Growers Cooperative left the U.S. out of the Port of Virginia. They’re expected to arrive in the country in the coming weeks, Oshinskie said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers in Virginia’s Legislative Black Caucus say a dozen prisoners have harmed themselves since mid-September and want an investigation into inmates’ claims of poor living conditions and treatment in the high-security prison. Earlier this year prisoners there held </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/hunger-strike-red-onion-prison-virginia/article_be16e382-affc-11ee-8c36-437a567e5383.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hunger strikes</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to protest conditions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People who have been incarcerated at Red Onion State Prison describe being regularly subjected to racial and physical abuse from correctional officers, medical neglect including the withholding of medicine, excessive stays in solitary confinement with one report of 600 consecutive days, inedible food having been covered in maggots and officers’ spit, and violent dog attacks,” according to the release from the Black Caucus. “These repeated and tragic self-immolation attempts, and accompanying hunger strikes, reflect the psychological and physical toll that gruesome prison conditions can have on incarcerated individuals.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Wednesday statement from DOC director Chadwick Dotson confirmed that six people had burned themselves by “using improvised devices that were created by tampering with electrical outlets.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that all six were treated for their injuries and returned to Red Onion where they have been referred to the mental health staff for treatment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christian Martinez, a spokesperson for Gov. Glenn Youngkin, said that the governor was aware of the situation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dotson also had pointed words for groups making allegations against Red Onion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The recent round of stories about Red Onion are nothing more than bad-faith efforts to try to score cheap political points by advocacy groups who pursue prison abolition and policies that would make Virginians less safe,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alison Chaffin, who has a loved one in Red Onion, said that she was frustrated by Dotson’s response.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“(VBLC) asked him to investigate, and then this is his response,” she said. “He says ‘It&#8217;s not self-immolating.” But they burned themselves — I thought that was the definition.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, lawmakers in Virginia’s Black Caucus stressed their commitment to legislation, pointing to a bill to regulate the number of days an incarcerated person can spend in solitary confinement. The bill passed the legislature this year before being</span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB719" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">by Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The reality that these individuals felt there was no other avenue to have their claims taken seriously, investigated, and remedied is a grave indictment of the Commonwealth of Virginia and reminds us of the urgent need for comprehensive prison reform,” the VBLC statement said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than labeling it solitary confinement, Virginia has what it calls “</span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title53.1/chapter2/section53.1-39.2/#:~:text=5.-,An%20incarcerated%20person%20who%20has%20been%20placed%20in%20restorative%20housing,may%20include%20recreation%20in%20a" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">restorative housing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is defined as “special purpose bed assignments operated under maximum security regulations and procedures and utilized for the personal protection or custodial management of an incarcerated person.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city council is now calling on the Richmond Electoral Board to review the findings and issue a response.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Richmond City Council strives to ensure that taxpayer resources are used in an efficient and effective manner. The Richmond Office of Inspector General’s findings of the use of public resources in the Richmond Office of Elections raises serious concerns,” the council said in a joint statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond’s Inspector General James Osuna </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/16/richmond-inspector-general-investigating-citys-elections-office/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched the probe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in May after one of his investigators contacted the Department of Elections last year to seek assistance with complaints from a former employee of Balmer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to documents obtained by The Mercury earlier this year through a Freedom of Information Act request, the employee had shared unverified allegations of management issues, including “hiring family and friends,” questionable spending, and other concerns within the Richmond election office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Osuna declined to comment for this story, and Balmer did not respond to phone calls and emails. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">City officials initially believed the State Board of Elections should address the complaints due to its statewide oversight of registrars. However, state officials determined the matter was a local issue, because the allegations did not directly involve election policy or voting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claims of nepotism in the Richmond election office had surfaced publicly on another occasion. Earlier this year, the Richmond Times-Dispatch </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/richmond-registrar-keith-balmer-nepotism-accusations-brother-wife-office-of-elections/article_e0eb9052-d738-11ee-9abd-7bef8c0bbd32.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Balmer hired his brother and paid $2,300 to his wife’s company for training election workers on accommodating voters with disabilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Osuna&#8217;s investigation confirmed that Balmer violated procurement policies and misused government resources by hiring a security company between January and May without proper authorization. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Originally contracted to provide a $50-per-hour security guard for early voting, the agreement expanded to include personal protection services at $85 per hour, emergency training, and equipment purchases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In total, the company billed the city more than $200,000, depleting the Office of Elections’ budget and prompting Balmer to seek additional funding from Richmond City Council.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Osuna also found that Balmer misused public funds by hiring a private security firm to investigate alleged election interference, violating Virginia law. The registrar allegedly authorized the firm to probe claims that two former employees tried to discourage election officers from participating in future elections, costing the city more than $4,400 for services like background checks and evidence review.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Balmer falsely claimed that the city attorney had approved the investigation, but it was later determined that the latter had not been consulted. He also bypassed law enforcement and other relevant authorities, using city funds for a private investigation instead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between August and November 2023, Balmer violated procurement policies by approving a remodel of a leased building without following required bidding procedures, the investigation found. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project, which included carpet and flooring replacement, wall repairs, electrical work and a remodeled bathroom, was done using a contractor preferred by the landlord, bypassing the necessary competitive bidding process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the city’s lease agreement, which places maintenance responsibility on the landlord, Balmer approved the project without proper documentation, including quotes from multiple vendors, Osuna wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The work was divided into 21 separate purchase orders, each under the $50,000 threshold to avoid triggering a competitive bidding requirement, totaling $229,969. This strategy violated city policies governing small purchases and split purchases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The remodel was done without the landlord’s approval or building permits, and the project cost exceeded the amount allowed for non-competitive bidding. The Deputy General Registrar, who oversees the budget, was unaware of the total cost of the work, the investigation found. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On July 5, 2023, Balmer failed to report a workplace domestic violence incident involving two city employees, the probe confirmed. The incident occurred at the annual Voter Registrars Association of Virginia Conference, where one temporary employee was arrested for domestic assault against their partner, a full-time city employee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon returning from the conference, the victim was unreachable, prompting a welfare check. The Office of Elections received notice of the incident, and the Employee Relations manager reached out to Balmer for assistance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite Balmer’s awareness of the situation — which included prior reports of domestic conflict in the workplace — he did not take action, as required under the city code, Osuna found. Instead, he pressured the assaulted employee to resign, claiming safety concerns, without consulting Human Resources or the city attorney, which led to the alleged victim being denied unemployment benefits. </span></p>
<a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Report-Office-of-ELections.pdf" class="pdfemb-viewer" style="" data-width="max" data-height="max" data-toolbar="bottom" data-toolbar-fixed="off">Report Office of ELections</a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Balmer also violated city regulations by spending $7,500 to hire three Virginia Commonwealth University students to paint murals in the lobby of a city-leased facility and by purchasing more than $8,700 worth of artwork without proper authorization, according to the investigation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The murals, completed between February and December of last year, were paid for using invoice payment forms, with each student receiving $2,500. Additionally, Balmer used a government P-Card to buy 12 art pieces from a local art center, with prices ranging from $175 to $1,800. None of the purchases followed the required Department of Procurement Services (DPS) procedures for exempted artwork.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One allegation claimed that Balmer improperly purchased a Ford Explorer for the Office of Elections in February 2023 without Fleet Management authorization and removed city logos from the vehicle in violation of policy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the investigation confirmed that the purchase followed proper city procedures, and the city’s fleet manager approved the removal of the logos at the General Registrar’s request due to safety concerns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Balmer still violated city policies when he used a city vehicle for personal errands, transporting non-city personnel, and as a take-home vehicle without authorization, according to the investigation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Balmer assumed control of the Richmond election office after former registrar Kirk Showalter </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/richmond-electoral-board-votes-to-remove-citys-top-election-official-after-tense-public-hearing/article_ff22c0fd-1ceb-5e40-8458-9db8430d9605.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">was removed in 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, partly due to pressure from the Democratic Party of Virginia. While the Richmond Electoral Board is now under Republican control following Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s 2021 victory, the shift in power did not affect Balmer’s position.</span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three weeks after being elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, Virginia state Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland, has yet to resign his seat in the Virginia Senate, an unusual delay that has raised questions about the transition of power and the scheduling of a special election to fill his vacancy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire, who defeated Democrat Gloria Witt in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District earlier this month after unseating U.S. Rep. Bob Good, R-Farmville, in one of the most expensive GOP primaries nationwide this year, is slated to be sworn into Congress in January. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, his continued hold on his Senate seat, representing the 10th District, is drawing attention because most state lawmakers resign soon after winning federal office to allow for a smooth succession process. The State Board of Elections is set to certify the results of the Nov. 5 election on Dec. 2.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title24.2/chapter2/section24.2-216/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a special election date must be set within 30 days of a vacancy or notification of it, whichever occurs first. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Senate President Pro Tempore Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, is expected to set a date for a special election to fill McGuire’s seat once his resignation is official. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re still waiting for a formal resignation letter so we can go ahead and call for a special election,” JoNathan Collins, a spokesman for Lucas, told The Mercury Monday.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire did not respond to several phone calls and text messages seeking comment. Senate Minority Leader Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover, said Monday that he expects a special election to be set for Jan. 7, the day before the General Assembly convenes for its 20205 session. He did not elaborate further. </span></p>
<p>Democrats hold a slim 21-19 majority in the Senate. If McGuire’s vacant seat remains unfilled by the start of the legislative session in January, Republicans will face an additional loss in their numbers.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg, said that he doesn’t see a strategic reason for why McGuire would delay resigning his seat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m chalking this up to ‘paperwork delays’ or something like that,” Richards said. “I’m not going to pretend to know what McGuire is thinking, but this does seem to fall in line with the fairly loose way he ran his campaign, both in the primary and in the general election.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire, Richards said, often seemed to be using “a different playbook than the normal one, whether because he has his own ideas or simply is unfamiliar with what he needs to do, it wasn’t clear. My hope is that he gets up to speed once he gets to D.C. in 2025 and will figure out how to be an effective voice in Congress for the 5th District.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 10th Senate District, which spans 11 localities, stretching from Lynchburg in the west to the Richmond suburbs in the east, leans Republican. McGuire’s departure has set the stage for a hotly contested race, particularly among Republican hopefuls eager to retain the seat in the GOP column. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, District Republicans </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/elections/virginia-mcguire-senate-seat-mass-meeting-amanda-chase/article_fb3c01c6-a758-11ef-b8c4-dfc06f5ac715.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced the process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for selecting their nominee in the upcoming special election. The local GOP committee scheduled a mass meeting for Dec. 12 at 5:30 p.m. to choose the party’s candidate. Unlike a firehouse primary, the mass meeting format allows registered Republicans in attendance to vote directly. The location for the meeting has yet to be finalized.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the first of the six Republicans to announce their bids for McGuire’s seat was former state senator Amanda Chase, who had served in the body for eight years and lost her 2023 GOP primary for her Chesterfield-based seat to Sen. Glen Sturtevant. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the law requires state legislators reside in the district they represent, Chase has moved from her former home in Chesterfield County to Appomattox County. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shayne Snavely, Chase’s former aide who worked on her bid for the Republican nomination for governor three years ago, has also declared his intention to run. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so have Jean Gannon, a Powhatan County real estate appraiser and longtime Republican activist, and Duane Adams, the chairman of the Louisa County Board of Supervisors, who ran for the Republican nomination in the district in 2023 but lost to McGuire. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In more recent weeks, Luther Cifers, a businessman from Prince Edward County, and Bryan Hamlet, the chairman of the Cumberland County Board of Supervisors, have also launched their campaigns in District 10.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lone Democrat who has filed to run in the Republican-leaning district is Jack Trammel, a college professor from Louisa County who in 2014 unsuccessfully ran against Republican Dave Brat in Virginia’s 7th Congressional District. </span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce for the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of Virginians who are unhoused has been on the rise, according to various data sources. A </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/local/richmond/2024/01/08/homelessness-virginia-statistics-data-how-many" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development showed that in 2023, roughly 7.8 per 10,000 people in Virginia were experiencing homelessness. Recent point-in-time counts in the greater Richmond area showed an </span><a href="https://irp.cdn-website.com/5f4255d0/files/uploaded/_GRCoC_2024_Annual_Report_%287%29.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in unhoused citizens over the past year.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While localized data can point to particular spikes in unhoused populations it doesn’t encompass all types of housing crises people can face, or truly capture how many people experience homelessness over time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laura Dobbs, a policy analyst with Housing Opportunities Made Equal, noted that someone might technically be homeless for only a few months, as opposed to someone more permanently unhoused who lives on streets, in parks or in shelters. But their temporary status is “still traumatic,” she stressed, and can still take time to financially and emotionally recover from. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s a lot of people that whether they live in a hotel or they’re couch surfing or splitting their kids between different family members — they may only be homeless for three months, but it’s still an unstable three months,” Dobbs said. “Those people might not get captured in a point-in-time count, but they still need services to help them regain stability.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s why her organization and others support state legislation aimed at helping to reduce or prevent evictions as well as broader efforts to increase housing stock and affordability. And of course, continued funding for organizations that work directly with those who are experiencing homelessness is a continuing need, she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Solving the housing crisis is primarily local through things like zoning and planning, but the state can incentivize things,” said Homeward executive director Kelly King Horne. Her organization is part of the Greater Richmond Continuum of Care — a consortium of groups working to prevent and reduce homelessness. Various organizations around Virginia coordinate on this work as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A</span><a href="https://irp.cdn-website.com/5f4255d0/files/uploaded/_GRCoC_2024_Annual_Report_%287%29.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published last month found that Greater Richmond Continuum of Care agencies encountered over 7,500 people seeking assistance within fiscal year 2024, ranging from emergency shelter requests to needing assistance to stay in their homes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other Richmond-area efforts have been underway over the last year as well. This past June, people were able to move into Cool Lane Commons, an 86-unit supportive housing apartment in Henrico County. The project stemmed from collaboration of local governments and organizations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a new (Richmond Redevelopment and Housing Authority) policy approved by HUD, the GRCoC Coordinated Entry System can make referrals directly to projects like this,” the continuum’s latest report stated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This past October the City of Richmond also opened its Office of Homeless Services on Chamberlayne Avenue. For people who lack a phone or computer, the center is a face-to-face option for connections to various regional housing resources. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those in need of shelter, however, a mens’ and veterans’ shelter on Grace St. plans to close by the end of the year due to funding challenges. This knowledge, paired with a recent Richmond city council vote to allocate $2 million to a new animal shelter, inspired Virginia’s NAACP housing chair Tracey Hardney-Scott to </span><a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/richmond-naacp-city-council-funding-nov-18-2024" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voice concern</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can&#8217;t be saying that animals would take precedence over people,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hardney-Scott hopes to see a boost in funding that can be earmarked specifically for shelters. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Legislative proposals</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Isabel McLain with the Virginia Housing Alliance said that her organization will press lawmakers on funding for housing efforts in their next revision of the state budget. Examples include funding that can go towards rapid rehousing efforts and operational funding for organizations that work with unhoused or vulnerable residents. It will also support efforts to assist people before they experience homelessness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Housing Alliance will also be supportive of programs that can help prevent displacement, such as a proposal called “5,000 Families.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carried last year by Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield and Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield, the initiative failed to make it into the most recent state budget. If implemented, the program would provide rental relief to certain families with school-age children to prevent displacement during academic years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something Dobbs said she’ll be watching for is anti-rent gouging legislation. Earlier this year, Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax carried a bill that would allow localities to set their own provisions that would require landlords to give two months’ written notice ahead of rent increases. It would also set certain parameters of what the increases could be. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hardney-Scott said that her organization is in conversation with legislators about which specific bills may be introduced or reintroduced next year. Like McLain, a revival of Boysko’s bill is something she plans to keep watch for. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bill that could get another shot at becoming law may be one the legislature already approved: </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/bill-to-boost-affordable-housing-advances-to-youngkin/article_33e7b884-dd8e-11ee-96af-a7e0399a77a3.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 597</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Sen. Jeremy McPike, D-Prince William, would have allowed more Virginia localities to craft zoning ordinances to encourage affordable housing by using special federal tax credits. Despite House and Senate approval, Gov. Glenn Youngkin </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb597" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the bill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Hardney-Scott engages with legal and nonprofit organizations and lawmakers, she hopes to see more widespread discussion of the role housing plays in peoples’ lives and communities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re not having enough conversations about how (housing struggles) affect health and education or contribute to crime,” Hardney-Scott said. “Housing is the one thing that everybody needs.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Federal housing changes may be on the horizon</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Horne, of Homeward noted how some housing solutions may be out of any states’ hands. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Funding is always going to be number one, especially if there’s cuts at the federal level,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dobbs concurred. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s hard to predict just how much (funding is) going to be cut from HUD,” she said. “A lot of local governments rely on funding from HUD to do things that come with services and prevention efforts, and without that federal funding, we&#8217;re really going to rely on the state even more to help support localities.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though President-elect Donald Trump has shied away from the “Project 2025” playbook from conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation, he has been </span><a href="https://www.heritage.org/impact/trump-administration-embraces-heritage-foundation-policy-recommendations" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">praised by the organization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for utilizing their guidance in his previous term. Several of its authors are former Trump officials, including former HUD secretary Dr. Ben Carson. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chapter 15</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of “Project 2025” Carsonhe suggested that Congress should </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“consider a wholesale overhaul of HUD that contemplates devolving many HUD functions to states and localities with any remaining federal functions consolidated to other federal agencies.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s both unclear how long such a downsizing of the federal agency would take and if it would happen, but Virginia housing advocates stress that the state legislature continues to empower and support local governments and organizations that work with them. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">RICHMOND, Va. &#8212; Federal and state lawmakers have introduced legislation to strengthen support for and better protect sexual assault victims on college campuses, but the progress has been stagnant.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A congressional bill introduced by a Virginia senator previously died and was reintroduced, but it is still in committee.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A bill in the General Assembly recently died, with the final decision to kill it happening just months after Liberty University received the largest fine ever issued for breaking the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Act.</p>
<p dir="ltr">S.5086 &#8211; SOS Campus Act</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., reintroduced <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/5086/text" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/5086/text&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1732371896430000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1Mw-4iqJSCMDBegjgUmwnw">a proposal</a> in September after an earlier <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/4846?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%224846%22%7D&amp;s=1&amp;r=9" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/4846?q%3D%257B%2522search%2522%253A%25224846%2522%257D%26s%3D1%26r%3D9&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1732371896430000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3U3oCMyRRr7zd4Ob-Hh5QY">version</a> died in the last session of Congress. This bill amends the Higher Education Act of 1965, which, among other things, created the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Act.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The act requires higher education institutions to provide support for victims of violent crimes and to make publicly available campus crime statistics and institutional policies for campus safety, according to the Clery Center.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Kaine’s bill would require schools that receive federal funding to appoint an advocate, independent of the institution, who guides victims of sexual assault throughout the process. This would include better connection to available resources, emotional counseling and protection for the student from more harm – such as disciplinary action or penalization for reporting the incident.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bill requires the advocate to report incidents to an investigative body and submit an annual report to the learning institution with the number of victims and how each resource was used.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The SOS Campus Act was referred to the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, according to Kaine.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The inspiration for the legislation is to protect the rights of students to feel safe on campus, according to Kaine.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“That’s why I’ve worked on legislation, including the SOS Campus Act, to prevent sexual assault and support survivors,” Kaine stated. “I will keep working to garner support among my colleagues for the SOS Campus Act and work to get it passed and signed into law.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">HB 369 &#8211; Sexual Misconduct Policies and Task Force</p>
<p dir="ltr">Del. Marty Martinez, D-Loudoun, introduced <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/HB369" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/HB369&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1732371896430000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0X1b_ife_8AXjVfJigr1-j">House Bill 369</a>, which had similar objectives to Kaine’s bill, to update sexual misconduct policies and increase accountability for institutions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bill was introduced in the 2024 General Assembly session, but a Rules subcommittee continued the bill to the 2025 session. The bill was officially left in that committee on Nov. 18, effectively killing it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bill would create a task force which produced an annual climate survey, install a crisis center, establish a designated confidential adviser on all campuses and impose civil penalties for institutions that violate the proposed guidelines.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The State Council of Higher Education for Virginia would appoint the task force, whose charge would be to create a base sexual misconduct campus climate survey, according to SCHEV communications director Bob Spieldenner. This survey would be distributed to all institutions across the state, which would be a routine task for SCHEV, he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Schools could tailor the survey with campus-specific questions before sending them to students, according to the bill. The results would be shared with SCHEV and posted online within about four months for public viewing, along with the institution’s website.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bill required for-profit, private institutions to have a designated crisis center with a confidential, independent advocate to provide support to victims of sexual assault and direct them on the next steps. This is something that nonprofit, private universities are already required to do.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bill also created accountability on institutions to report alleged incidents and investigations. If an institution did not take any action “after reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing,” then they would be fined up to $150,000 (or 1% of institution’s annual operating budget, whichever is lower) for each violation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, was a co-patron of the measure. The bill was a step toward the ultimate goal of every individual to feel safe at their school, he stated.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Virginia’s students have one job &#8212; to learn,” Helmer stated. “And as legislators, it’s our job to protect them when our schools won’t.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Neither Martinez nor Helmer responded when asked if they had plans to reintroduce this bill or similar legislation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Liberty University Shows Cracks In System</p>

(Courtesy of Google) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares has joined the U.S. Department of Justice and a coalition of 38 state attorneys general in proposing sweeping remedies to dismantle Google’s unlawful monopoly over internet search engines and restore competition in the digital marketplace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The push follows </span><a href="https://www.oag.state.va.us/media-center/news-releases/2807-november-21-2024-virginia-justice-department-seek-limits-to-google-business-practices-to-end-search-engine-monopoly" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a landmark ruling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in August 2024 by a federal district court in Washington, D.C., which found that Google violated federal antitrust laws by maintaining a monopoly in online search and search advertising through anticompetitive practices. The court’s decision marked a significant win in the ongoing efforts to curb Big Tech dominance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The remedies proposed are reasonable, measured steps to restore competition and protect consumers,” Miyares said in a statement Thursday. “Virginia is proud to help produce a balanced resolution that benefits consumers and competitors alike.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_30211" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/ga-2022-4-3/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-30211" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GA-2022-4-3-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GA-2022-4-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GA-2022-4-3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GA-2022-4-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GA-2022-4-3.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Attorney General Jason Miyares (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia initially joined the fight against Google in December 2020, alleging in a lawsuit that the tech giant used illegal contracts and other conduct to suppress competition and secure its monopoly power. That case complemented a similar federal antitrust lawsuit filed by the Justice Department in October of that year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A multi-day hearing to consider the proposed remedies is scheduled for April 22, 2025, and is expected to conclude by May 2, 2025, according to a news release by the attorney general’s oOffice.The outcome of this case will likely have far-reaching implications for competition in the tech industry and consumer choice in digital services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kent Walker, Google’s chief legal officer, sharply criticized the Justice Department’s latest move, accusing the agency of pushing “a radical interventionist agenda” that would harm Americans and America’s global technology leadership. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“DOJ’s wildly overbroad proposal goes miles beyond the court’s decision. It would break a range of Google products — even beyond Search — that people love and find helpful in their everyday lives,” Walker wrote </span><a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/doj-search-remedies-nov-2024/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in a blog post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Thursday. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the legal challenge proves successful, Google would no longer be allowed to pay manufacturers, device makers, or browsers to make Google Search the default search engine. Additionally, the company would be required to share data and information obtained through its monopoly with competitors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The PFJ also calls for Google to divest Chrome, its popular browser that accounts for a substantial share of the portal’s search traffic and powers its targeted advertising to users. Furthermore, the judgment opens the door to additional divestitures, including Google’s Android operating system, if the company fails to comply with remedies or if the proposed measures prove ineffective.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The judgment further prohibits Google from leveraging its ownership of Android to stifle competition. The company specifically would be barred from mandating the use of Google Search or Google AI on Android devices, degrading the performance of rival services, or using its control over distributors to favor its products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a measure proposed solely by the states, Google would also be required to fund a public education campaign to inform consumers about the company’s anticompetitive practices, the resulting legal action, and the alternatives available to them for search engines and digital tools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The order establishes a five-member technical committee tasked with overseeing the implementation, monitoring and enforcement of these remedies over a ten-year period.</span></p>

(Courtesy of SDI Productions via Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/eo/EO-43---FINAL.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Executive Order 43 </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Thursday, which enacted a multi-pronged effort to address the impact of social media use on children’s mental health. The order established the Reclaiming Childhood Task Force to counter “addictive” social media use in youth and “create opportunities for cultural change.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The directive came months after the governor issued an executive order requiring the Department of Education to draft guidelines for cell phone-free schools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest order will mobilize state agencies to provide resources for parents, educators and healthcare providers to “combat the negative effects of excessive social media use.” It will also spur the agencies to create a toolkit with training materials and educational resources that will “offer educational and technical support” for health care providers and families to promote healthy social media use. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The scope of this challenge is going to require all of us, private sector, non-profit organizations and (the) government to support parents as they work to improve their children’s mental health,” Youngkin said in a release. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The task force will convene parents, youth, teachers, mental health experts, faith leaders, public safety officials and private sector technology experts to compile recommendations to share with Youngkin and members of the General Assembly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secretary of Health and Human Resources Janet Kelly noted the “addictive” nature of social media algorithms. The order cites Pew Research Center data showing 95% of U.S. teens use social media, and Gallup studies showing that youth use social media frequently and that 41% of high-frequency social media users report having “poor or very poor mental health,” with the percentage higher for teens who use it with low parental monitoring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Reclaiming Childhood Task Force will drive collaboration and innovation to address this mental health crisis and ensure our children grow up with the tools they need to thrive,” Kelly wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the cell phone-free guidelines for schools were being developed this past summer, academics noted the adjustment period they would require for students who have grown accustomed to frequent cell phone and social media use. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Naff, a Virginia Commonwealth University professor with a concentration in educational psychology, said in an interview at the time that he hoped the policy would help youth become more intentional about when they use their devices outside of school hours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s human nature to crave social interaction, Naff said, “whether we realize it or not” and  social media interactions are less personal than face-to-face interactions. He also noted how research points to increased device use and social media access contributes to anxiety and other mental health issues in today’s younger generations  — research also cited in Yougnkin’s order. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naff also noted still-emerging research on the effect the COVID-19 pandemic had on kids. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the virus first plagued the globe roughly four years ago and triggered  shutdowns of public life, education  pivoted to virtual learning for a time. This meant youth were on screens more than ever before while missing out on the personal interactions of in-person learning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s kind of hard to distinguish the COVID mental health impacts from the cell phone use mental health impacts, because they&#8217;re overlapping. When schools were closed, our world just moved online,” Naff said. “So then, adolescents are using devices and social media more frequently at that point. Someone could argue that the mental health impacts were related to COVID — which they were —  but you could also say ‘maybe at least a portion of the mental health impacts were that we&#8217;re just on our devices constantly, like to the point of addiction.’”</span></p>

(Wyatt Gordon/The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">S&amp;P Global Ratings has upgraded the city of Petersburg’s general obligation (GO) bond rating to AA- from A+, a move that highlights the city’s strengthened financial health and steady progress toward fiscal stability. The upgrade underscores Petersburg’s success in building reserves, improving liquidity, and achieving a secure financial position after years of turmoil.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Petersburg’s GO bonds are backed by the city’s full faith and credit pledge, affirming its reliability to meet debt obligations. The proceeds from the city’s 2024 GO bond issuance are set to fund several critical projects, including a new courthouse facility, the renovation of a police station, the construction of an animal care center and $1.3 million to refinance older bonds for net savings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">City Manager March Altman said in a statement that the upgraded bond rating reflects continued growth and economic recovery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Petersburg has a fund balance of approximately $50 million, which gives it the flexibility to move forward with needed capital projects,” Altman said. “I commend the city council and Petersburg’s Department of Finance for making decisions based on sound fiscal management and best practices.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The enhanced credit rating not only reflects Petersburg’s financial stability but also unlocks key advantages, including lower interest rates, greater borrowing capacity for vital projects, expanded economic development opportunities, and increased appeal to potential investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It further signals to investors that the city’s creditworthiness has improved, potentially reducing borrowing costs for future projects. It also highlights the city’s steady recovery from a financial crisis that left it on the brink of insolvency less than a decade ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Petersburg’s financial woes reached a breaking point in 2016, when the city faced a staggering $7.7 million deficit, unpaid bills piling up to $18 million, and critical services at risk of interruption. Poor fiscal oversight, structural deficits and mismanagement led to the crisis, which garnered statewide attention. At the time, the city teetered on the verge of state intervention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To address the dire situation, Petersburg implemented aggressive reforms, including staff reductions, tighter spending controls and measures to increase revenue. The city also partnered with outside financial advisors to help restore fiscal discipline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By 2019, Petersburg reported a budget surplus for the first time in years and began rebuilding its financial reserves. The turnaround has since been bolstered by sustained economic growth, improved tax collection efforts, and successful community partnerships.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mayor Sam Parham said that the city’s goal is to achieve a firm AAA rating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With the growth of the Pharmaceutical Campus, the recent approval of the Destination Resort Casino, and the many other economic development and tourism projects, the city is positioned to continue to grow its tax base and fund balance while addressing much-needed capital projects,” Parham said. </span></p>

(Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former President Donald Trump’s return to the White House following the Nov. 5 election is already sending ripples through Virginia politics and setting the stage for an intense 2025 election cycle in the commonwealth. With control of the governorship and the House of Delegates on the line, both parties are strategizing to leverage the shifting political landscape to their advantage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think we’re in a crucial moment in Virginia’s history, this is a moment where every single vote, every election and every voice can make a lasting difference, especially after the election of Donald Trump,” Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, said on a video call with reporters on Friday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2017 elections in Virginia offer a compelling precedent. That year — Trump’s first in office —  galvanized the Democratic base, leading to a stunning 15-seat gain in the House and leaving the Republicans with a razor-thin 50–49 advantage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suburban districts that had long been Republican strongholds, including in the Richmond area and in Northern Virginia, flipped blue as many moderate voters reacted against the president’s divisive rhetoric and policies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, Democrat Ralph Northam’s decisive victory in the gubernatorial race — he defeated Republican Ed Gillespie by a 9-point margin (54-45%) — underscored the state’s shift toward progressive politics, fueled by high turnout among women, young voters, and minorities united by their dislike for an incumbent president whom Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, had defeated in the commonwealth with 49.75-44.43%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two years later, in 2019, Democrats picked up six more seats in the House, marking the first time that the party held control of both legislative and executive branches in Virginia since 1993.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following Trump’s recent win, Virginia Democrats are hoping for a similar wave in 2025, betting that the Republican’s polarizing presidency will once again energize their coalition. With abortion rights, climate policy, and education likely to be central issues, Democrats believe they can maintain their control of the legislature and win back the Executive Mansion by appealing to suburban and urban voters alarmed by Trump’s policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the things about Virginia is that you can never really predict what will happen, because Virginia voters are so in tune and aware of what’s going on. They don’t go for a lot of BS, which is why Virginia rejected Donald Trump three times,” Scott said, referring also to the presidential elections in 2020 and 2024, which Trump lost in the commonwealth. </span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginians, Scott said, pay “very close attention to what happens in DC right now,” and they will take note if Trump keeps his promise to abolish the U.S. Department of Education or eliminate federal jobs in Northern Virginia — actions that could fire up the Democratic party’s base.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans, on the other hand, are hoping for a reverse dynamic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump’s successful third White House bid has emboldened Virginia conservatives, particularly in rural areas where his support remains robust, and the GOP campaigns of next year are likely to focus on economic issues and a law-and-order message to woo suburban voters who have drifted toward Democrats in recent cycles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Republican Party of Virginia and Trump very handily carried a number of Virginia House of Delegates districts that either Republicans lost by a small amount last year or won by a small amount,” Rich Anderson, the chairman of the Virginia GOP, said in a recent phone interview. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So it’s going to be vital for us next year to take those Republicans who showed up for President Trump and to get them out in the 2025 election cycle. We will work hard in doing that because next year is a crucial year for us in the House of Delegates elections, and the Democrats only have a one seat margin. If we work hard, then we can flip it back, and that, of course, helps our nominees for governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg, said that the current Democratic majorities in the House of Delegates (51-49) and the state Senate (21-19) are too close for either party to relax. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If Virginia acts like 2021, where it voted against the party in power in Washington, then the GOP will have an uphill climb,” Richards said. “The question is how far along Trump’s agenda will be by the fall of 2025. If things are going well, the GOP could draft on that success, but if things are chaotic, then that will be a problem.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deputy House Minority Leader Israel O’Quinn, R-Washington, said that Republicans plan to seize on a lagging enthusiasm among Democratic voters this year in order to flip the House in 2025. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These races are going on a race-by-race and a candidate-by-candidate basis, that’s why you have to put the work into the recruitment of quality candidates and make sure that you’re competitive in these really tight 50-50 House districts,” O’Quinn said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, Democrat Joe Biden won 60 out of 100 House of Delegates seats, and in the following year Democrats were able to capitalize on 51 of those, O’Quinn added. “I think Kamala Harris won 59 this year, so they’re going to have to run the table on all 51 to be able to continue to hold on to the majority, and I think we’re going to be very competitive there.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And less than one year before Virginia’s 2025 gubernatorial election and more than six months before the party primaries, the contest is effectively set, with two high-profile candidates leading the major-party tickets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the Democratic side, U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Prince William, was the first </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/spanberger-virginia-governor-candidacy-c19ade683ab0dfaef67051b36791d30a" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to announce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> her bid in November of last year, positioning herself as a centrist with a focus on pragmatic leadership. Outgoing Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney, followed suit one month later, but in April he opted to pursue the lieutenant governor’s seat instead, streamlining Spanberger’s path to the nomination.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_36863" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=36863" rel="attachment wp-att-36863"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-36863" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSCF6603-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSCF6603-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSCF6603-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSCF6603-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSCF6603-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSCF6603-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  U.S. Rep.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Republicans, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears emerged as the party’s standard-bearer after Attorney General Jason Miyares </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/18/miyares-to-seek-second-term-as-virginia-attorney-general/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declared on Monday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> he would seek reelection rather than enter the governor’s race. Earle-Sears, who </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/06/lt-gov-winsome-earle-sears-announces-run-for-virginia-governor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched her campaign</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in September, is set to carry the GOP banner unopposed, benefiting from Miyares’ decision to focus on being reelected into his current role.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But despite her re-embrace of Trump as the Republican presidential nominee, the lieutenant governor’s campaign may still be haunted by her remarks from November 2022, when she publicly urged Americans to move on from the former president.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A true leader understands when they have become a liability. A true leader understands that it’s time to step off the stage. And the voters have given us that very clear message,” Earle-Sears </span><a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/politics/virginia-lt-gov-earle-sears-time-to-move-on-from-trump/3205900/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said in a TV interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richards, the political science professor, said that he expects the damning remarks to be brought up by political action committees aligned with Spanberger during the gubernatorial election cycle as a way to undermine Earle-Sears with Republicans.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She will need to make up quickly with Trump. Had Trump lost she would have been able to brush off her previous comments, but now she will need his support,” Richards said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I suspect she will try to make nice. Her bigger hurdle will be convincing independent voters in Virginia she is not too extreme. Virginia is a purple state, and when it votes for the GOP it likes moderate-facing candidates, which is why Youngkin was careful to present himself that way in 2021.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokesman for Earle-Sears’ campaign declined to provide comment for this story. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_30208" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/05/25/virginia-lg-scheduled-to-speak-at-nra-fundraising-event-in-texas-this-week/ga-2022-4-4/" rel="attachment wp-att-30208"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-30208" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GA-2022-4-4-300x200.jpg" alt="Lt.

Gov. Winsome Sears presides over the Senate. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is little doubt that the match-up between Spanberger and Earle-Sears promises to be a defining battle of contrasting visions for Virginia’s future. Spanberger’s track record as a moderate in Congress and Earle-Sears’ bold embrace of conservative policies ensure the race will draw national attention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger’s “2025 campaign will continue to be laser-focused on the priorities that all Virginians share — stronger schools, safer communities, and lower costs,” campaign spokesman Connor Joseph said “And following the election of former President Trump, she also knows that Virginia must have a governor who is committed to protecting the rights and fundamental freedoms of all Virginians.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ernest McGowen, an associate professor at the Department of Political Science at the University of Richmond, said that Earle-Sears will likely face an uphill battle in a state that has increasingly voted for Democrats in statewide elections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Earle-Sears may be a little too far right. If you look at Tim Kane and the kind of people that he had to run against, I think it may be kind of a similar situation,” McGowen said, referring to the Democratic U.S. senator from Virginia who has won his two reelection bids by fending of challenges from Republican nominees whose far-right positions have helped their primary campaigns but hurt their chances of winning a general election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Also, Spanberger is more of a known commodity,” McGowen said. “If the Democrats in their election postmortem decide that their current ideological median isn’t isn&#8217;t where they thought it should be, I could see them actually really get behind Spanberger as not the new face of the party, but as someone to show the diversity of thought in the party.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2025 race for Virginia’s attorney general is also starting to take form, with three candidates having officially declared their bids. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After securing Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s </span><a href="https://x.com/glennyoungkin/status/1858574435449446657?s=46&amp;t=uQxq3EX7p3bygcqVfUnstg" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">endorsement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> just moments after his announcement Monday, Miyares is unlikely to face a challenger for his party’s nomination. If reelected, the incumbent has vowed to focus on public safety and his record combating fentanyl and violent crime during a second term.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Democrats, the field features a competitive primary between former Del. Jay Jones, who previously ran in 2021, and Henrico County Commonwealth’s Attorney Shannon Taylor. Jones has criticized Miyares for what he calls a “partisan agenda,” while Taylor has emphasized her decades of experience as a prosecutor dedicated to justice and public safety.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lieutenant governor’s contest, however, remains wide open almost one year out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">James City County business consultant and U.S. Navy veteran John Curran — who </span><a href="https://www.dailypress.com/2023/09/23/majority-of-jcc-supervisor-seats-up-for-grabs/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ran unsuccessfully for the Board of Supervisors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2023 — is the only Republican </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2024/09/27/james-city-county-business-consultant-to-run-for-lieutenant-governor-as-republican/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">who has filed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> his paperwork to date, but the Democratic field is more crowded. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides Stoney, three additional candidates are vying for their party’s nomination: state Sens. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield, and Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach; and Babur Lateef, the former chairman of the Prince William County School Board. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But officials from both parties agree on one thing — the 2025 elections will likely serve as a referendum on Trump’s second term and provide a key barometer for the 2026 midterms and beyond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It goes without saying that the Democrats will definitely be energized, because they have an intense dislike for President Trump,” said Anderson, the RPV chair. “The challenge for Republicans next year is being smarter and better equipped in 2025 than maybe we were in 2017, when we lost all those seats in the House of Delegates.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And House Speaker Scott expressed confidence in his party’s ability to harness its base’s enthusiasm and channel it into meaningful action.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We will stand up and we will fight, and I think the majority of Virginians will stand with us and push back against this administration,” Scott said. “I think that next year’s election will be that type of referendum on Donald Trump’s administration.” </span></p>

<p dir="ltr">WASHINGTON — Former TV personality and onetime U.S. Senate candidate Mehmet Oz could become the next administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, an expansive government agency that is responsible for large swaths of the country’s health care.</p>
<p dir="ltr">President-elect Donald Trump announced his intent to nominate Oz on Tuesday, writing in a statement “there may be no Physician more qualified and capable than Dr. Oz to Make America Healthy Again.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Oz won the Republican primary in the 2022 Pennsylvania U.S. Senate race but was <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/briefs/oz-concedes-to-fetterman-in-pa-s-u-s-senate-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defeated during the general election</a> by Democratic Sen. John Fetterman.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump wrote that Oz would “work closely” with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-taps-vaccine-skeptic-rfk-jr-lead-department-health-and-human-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will be nominated for Health and Human Services secretary</a>, “to take on the illness industrial complex, and all the horrible chronic diseases left in its wake.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“He will also cut waste and fraud within our Country’s most expensive Government Agency, which is a third of our Nation’s Healthcare spend, and a quarter of our entire National Budget,” Trump wrote in the announcement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services manages the country’s largest health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, and the health insurance marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are 67.7 million people enrolled in Medicare, with nearly 90% of those enrollees over the age of 65. The program also provides health care coverage for younger people with severe illnesses or disabilities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Medicaid, a state-federal program that provides health coverage for low-income people, has about 72.4 million enrollees.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are 7.1 million CHIP program participants.</p>
<p dir="ltr">And 21.3 million people purchased health insurance through the ACA marketplace during the 2024 open enrollment period.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When added together, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services provides health care coverage to 1 in 4 Americans, according to its latest <a href="https://www.cms.gov/files/document/cms-financial-report-fiscal-year-2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financial report</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The agency spent about $1.516 trillion during the last fiscal year and has more than 6,700 federal employees as well as contractors to handle the workload.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“CMS and its contractors process over one billion Medicare claims annually, monitor quality of care, provide the states with matching funds for Medicaid benefits, and develop policies and procedures designed to give the best possible service to beneficiaries,” according to the report.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“CMS also assures the safety and quality of medical facilities, provides</p>
<p dir="ltr">health insurance protection to workers changing jobs, and maintains</p>
<p dir="ltr">the largest collection of healthcare data in the United States.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Oz received his undergraduate degree from Harvard University before earning a joint M.D. and MBA from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and Wharton Business School.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He starred in the daytime show “Dr. Oz,” which ran from 2009 until 2022.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Oz’s nomination is subject to Senate confirmation and is under the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee, currently led by Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden and Idaho Republican Sen. Mike Crapo.</p>
<p>Oz’s confirmation hearing won’t be the first time he’s testified before a Senate committee. More than 10 years ago, <a href="https://apnews.com/united-states-congress-united-states-government-television-ab2b321bd7bf40ebb4c80e49bb19d284" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he testified in front of a Senate panel </a>that his comments on his TV show about certain weight loss supplements were “flowery.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 22,000 residents across the counties Carroll, Grayson, Scott, Smyth, Tazewell, Washington, Wise and Wythe are likely able to claim the benefit, according to a recent USDA release announcing the special SNAP eligibility. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The United States Department of Agriculture makes D-SNAP benefits available in the aftermath of disasters to people who may not be eligible for SNAP in normal circumstances. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“USDA is committed to making sure that families, farmers and communities impacted by recent hurricanes get the support they need, including help with grocery expenses as people grapple with significant disruption to their lives,”Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in the release. “The Biden-Harris Administration, including USDA, will do everything in our power to help you respond, recover and rebuild – no matter how long it takes.”</span></p>

The release also outlined that SNAP households in Wise County may “request supplemental benefits from their state SNAP agency.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monday’s D-SNAP announcement follows previous federal assistance and state-level efforts in Virginia and other affected states.

Charlotte Rene Woods/ Virginia Mercury</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares announced Monday that he will seek reelection in 2025, putting to rest speculation that he might enter the Republican primary for governor. His decision effectively clears the way for Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears to secure her party’s nomination for the state’s top job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I serve as the people’s protector,” Miyares said of his role as the state’s top lawyer in an </span><a href="https://x.com/JasonMiyaresVA/status/1858570888251404777" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">X post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announcing his reelection campaign. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Highlighting his aspirations for another four years as attorney general, Miyares pointed to key public safety initiatives he has championed, including the “One Pill Can Kill” campaign to raise awareness about fentanyl overdoses and his office’s work with “Ceasefire Virginia,” a program that combines prosecution efforts with community engagement to combat crime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, Miyares </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/article_2b71d3a4-e6d7-11ee-8831-93f7ac7b8121.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">celebrated crime reductions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> associated with the initiative. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares’ campaign launch comes roughly a week after Democratic candidate </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/12/former-virginia-delegate-jay-jones-launches-second-bid-for-attorney-general/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jay Jones announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> his latest bid for the position. Jones lost a Democratic primary to former Attorney General Mark Herring in 2021, who later went on to lose to Miyares later that year in the general election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Miyares hadn’t officially announced yet, Jones took a jab at Miyares last week — accusing him of using his office to “attack Virginians’ freedoms, pander to the fringes of his own party and side with corporate price gougers and polluters” at the cost of Virginia families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moments after Miyares’ announcement, Gov. Glenn Youngkin also turned to X to endorse the attorney general and Earle-Sears for next year’s Republican ticket. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As attorney general, Jason vigorously defends the laws of the commonwealth, stands with law enforcement every single day while leading our shared fight to end the free flow of opioids and fentanyl into our communities, and has been a constant advocate for victims of human trafficking and domestic violence,” Youngkin wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He has never backed down when it comes to standing up for Virginians. He is an exceptional attorney general.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin also hailed Earle-Sears — a U.S. Marine Corps veteran who </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/06/lt-gov-winsome-earle-sears-announces-run-for-virginia-governor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declared her bid</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the state’s highest office in September and would likely face U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger — as “an outstanding” lieutenant governor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She will be a great governor. She has been an outspoken advocate for commonsense conservative principles and policies, a passionate voice for our military and veterans, and a relentless advocate for educational freedom and economic opportunity. She brings the fighting spirit of a Marine to the office every single day.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earle-Sears said in a statement that she was “deeply honored” to receive Youngkin’s endorsement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Together with our outstanding attorney general, Jason Miyares, we will continue championing common-sense safety and security policies that keep Virginia the ‘Number 1 Best State for Business,’” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Miyares is so far the only Republican candidate vying for the seat, Jones will face Henrico Commonwealth Attorney Shannon Taylor in a primary. Miyares took aim at both on social media last week after Jones announced his bid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Both of the announced (democratic) candidates for Attorney General are far-left, anti-police, criminal rights progressives who will make Virginia less safe. They will support the same criminal first, victim last policies that lead to a surge in violent crime,” Miyares wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He reiterated similar messaging in his re-election campaign launch video Monday, and said that in a second term he will continue to press for more tough-on-crime policies. Also during his time in office, Miyares has signed onto legal briefs with other Republican attorneys general </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/03/virginia-attorney-general-joins-efforts-to-fight-back-against-title-ix-changes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">challenging</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> President Joe Biden administration’s </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2024/08/01/biden-titleix-courts-gender-identity-discrimination/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Title IX rules</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> meant to protect LGBTQ+ students from discrimination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her pushback to Miyares, Taylor noted her over 25 years of experience as a prosecutor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every day of every one of those years has been spent working with law enforcement to keep people safe and seeking justice for victims of crime and their families,” </span><a href="https://x.com/ShannonTaylorVA/status/1856481762563465512" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">she wrote on X</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a repost of Miyares’ post. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Democratic Party of Virginia Chair Susan Swecker in a statement called Miyares “a MAGA mouthpiece in pushing an extreme agenda,” referring to President-elect Donald Trump’s Make America Great Again campaign motto. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginians deserve an attorney general who will stand up for their rights and freedoms, not someone who is constantly trying to take them away,” Swecker said. “It is clear that, if re-elected, Miyares would use his office as a partisan tool to serve the interests of the Trump administration, rather than the needs of hard-working Virginians.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington, said it was “a smart move” by Miyares to put his gubernatorial ambitions on hold and run for reelection next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There was no guarantee that he would prevail in a contest with the lieutenant governor. He can run for reelection now and legitimately claim the right to be first in line in 2029 for the party&#8217;s gubernatorial nomination,” Farnsworth said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Republican attorneys general end up running for governor consistently and sometimes have been able to prevail over Republican lieutenant governors because they are more explicitly conservative, that is not the case this time, Farnsworth said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The current lieutenant governor is not an ideological moderate the way some Republican lieutenant governors have been in the past,” he said of Earle-Sears. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats would likely have preferred a competition for the GOP’s gubernatorial nomination among the two Republican statewide office holders, Farnsworth added.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If nothing else, a fight between Miyares and Winsome Earle-Sears would have put a lot of Republican money into the primary that otherwise would have been spent on a general election.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connor Joseph, a spokesman for Spanberger’s campaign, said that no matter who her eventual opponent is, the Democrat’s vision for Virginia remains the same. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Her 2025 campaign will continue to be focused on the priorities that all Virginians share — stronger schools, safer communities, and lower costs,” Joseph said. “Additionally, Abigail knows that Virginia must have a governor who is committed to protecting the rights and fundamental freedoms of all Virginians.”</span></p>

A shortage of new homes is driving continued high housing costs, casting doubt on Virginia's future growth. (Parker Michels-Boyce/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Virginia will help fund housing construction near major business developments, Gov. Glenn Younkgin announced this week.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new executive order, on the heels of an announcement about a major manufacturing development near Danville, sets a goal of investing $75 million towards localities that want to bolster housing supply tied to new job creation over the next five years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The private sector is ready to step in and meet the needs of our growing workforce with much needed workforce housing,” Youngkin said in a release announcing his order. “(This) announcement advances these efforts by accelerating workforce housing development and requiring local governments to support the housing growth that Virginia needs.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How the funding will fuel housing supply</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a shortage of about 200,000 affordable housing units and a housing demand of about 4 million units overall, according to a </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/landing-2021-affordable-housing-in-virginia.asp" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and state government </span><a href="https://virginiabusiness.com/byline/department-of-housing-and-community-development/#:~:text=Virginia%20has%20a%20housing%20supply,according%20to%20the%20executive%20order." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the new investments aim to help foster construction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin anticipates his new order can help create about 5,000 units. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/eo/EO---42---Catalyzing-Housing-Development-for-Critical-Workforce-and-Economic-Development-Needs-with-Interagency-Collaboration.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Executive Order 42</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Workforce Housing Investment Program will consist of loans, subsidies and grants for localities and nonprofits to develop new housing near new employers in regions of the state. It also states that localities planning to tap into the Virginia Business Ready Sites Program will need to provide housing plans to demonstrate how they can accommodate job growth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One such example could be near the Berry Hill megasite in Pittsylvania County, which spans over 3,500 acres near Danville and has emerged as a development-ready site that could attract companies to the area. Ahead of Youngkin’s workforce housing announcement, Tennessee-based Microporous </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/11/14/how-big-is-the-microporous-announcement-here-are-11-ways/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced plans </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">for a battery plant at the location that is slated to provide over 2,000 jobs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Danny Marshall, R-Danville, said in an interview this summer that he anticipated the area could be ripe for tapping into various funding opportunities to address the conflation of job growth and housing strains. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Macaulay Porter, a deputy communications director for the governor, noted that while the funding is going to be available statewide, “localities with the highest imbalance of job growth to housing” stand to benefit the most. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysis from the state’s housing department has indicated that feature typically applies to areas in Southwest Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the Virginia Tobacco Region Revitalization Commission had also announced a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/workforce-housing-pilot-launches-to-support-southern-and-southwestern-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">workforce housing funding program </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">over the summer. That pilot program has about $2 million in its coffers to disperse to applicants on a rolling basis.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Virginia Housing and Community Development study from 2022 noted how the state’s </span><a href="https://dmz1.dhcd.virginia.gov/HB854/pdf/hb854-full-report-print.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fastest growing regions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the previous decade were  Northern Virginia, the Northern Shenandoah Valley and central Virginia’s Richmond. Conversely, rural areas of the state saw job losses. Those numbers could change in future census data as economic developments in rural areas attract or retain populations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some of her district entails urban areas, Sen. Lashresce Aird, D-Petersburg, previously told The Mercury that she anticipates rural portions of her district could benefit from workforce and housing development. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Housing continues to be a big strain on how we’re going to get workers to come here,” she said. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the 2025 legislative session on the horizon, lawmakers will continue to work on </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/10/these-new-housing-laws-will-take-effect-next-month/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">various other housing proposals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — ranging from preserving existing affordable housing to rental assistance or protections, to support for ways localities can tap into federal housing development funds. </span></strong></p>

(Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Democratic-led House of Delegates panel on Wednesday advanced three proposed constitutional amendments, including a revised measure seeking to enshrine abortion rights in the state’s highest law. The new proposal would also require third-trimester abortions to be approved by one doctor instead of three, as the law currently mandates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 22-member House Privileges and Elections Committee further backed amendments to extend constitutional protections to marriage equality and the automatic restoration of voting rights for felons who have served their time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The right to love, the right to vote, the right to bodily autonomy and privacy, these are the very rights and freedoms that are crucial to the foundation of this commonwealth and this nation,” committee chair Del. Marcia Price, D-Newport News, said in a brief news conference Wednesday afternoon. “We showed up today to do our jobs and to do everything within our power to protect these rights and freedoms for all Virginians.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The revised abortion amendment language in </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/HJ1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HJ1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shocked the committee’s Republican members, who only saw the changes after the meeting was already underway. Price called a  five-minute recess to allow lawmakers to review the new language before deliberations and voting proceeded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think we’re still trying to figure out what happened today,” a visibly frustrated House Minority Leader Del. Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, said after the three-hour hearing. “Something this important and impactful — literally life-and-death decisions — I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything pushed through this fast where we didn’t get a chance to see it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gilbert warned that Price’s decision to not allow the committee more time to review the revised legislation would set a precedent for the way the House conducts its business in the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were literally given five minutes to huddle and look at it before we had to decide what we were grappling with, and I think we still don’t know, other than it’s pretty clear that this is a pretty extreme version of efforts to protect abortion that goes well beyond what has been done in other states,” Gilbert said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price, however, defended her decision to move forward with taking a vote on the proposal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have an entire legislative process just like any other committee, and [the resolution] will go to the floor where (Republicans) will also have a chance to either put forward amendments or have their voice heard as well,” she said at the news conference.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amending the state Constitution takes several years in Virginia. The proposed amendment must be approved by the legislature in two separate years, with a General Assembly election occurring in between. Only then can the amendment proceed to a statewide referendum for voters to decide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the next election in Virginia is in November 2025, the earliest the three amendments that the committee advanced Wednesday could be put on the ballot is November 2026 — if the measures pass in the 2025 and 2026 legislative sessions. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The abortion rights amendment</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under current Virginia law, third-trimester abortions require approval from three doctors. The new amendment would reduce this requirement to just one doctor when a late-term abortion is deemed necessary to protect the life of the pregnant individual, or their physical or mental health, or when a physician determines the fetus is not viable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Wednesday’s hearing, dozens of abortion opponents lined up to speak against the proposal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among them was Olivia Turner, president of the Virginia Society for Human Life, who told the panel that her group opposed both the original amendment and its substitute. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don’t know what’s going on with this new version, and how it will impact our ability as the people of Virginia to pass rational and reasonable protective laws in the future,” Turner said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Gilbert, the House Minority Leader, said that the amendment capsized Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court case that established abortion as a constitutional right and that was repealed in 2022. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Roe v. Wade has within it a compelling state interest in protecting the life of the unborn at a certain point in the pregnancy. This amendment doesn’t contain that protection at all, it leans in the other direction,” Gilbert said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The legislation we just saw, which was dropped on us literally today without any ability to look at it, reflect on it, think about it, compare notes, talk to experts, only leans into the protection of the patient, which is the mother. And so there is no more protection for the unborn, which was envisioned and embodied in Roe (v.) Wade.”</span></p>

(Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But House Majority Leader Charniele Herring, D-Alexandria, the sponsor of HJ1, said that in her amendment both the state interest in protecting the unborn and life of the mother are considered. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The parameters are set out so if there is a live fetus, there are protections. But if there is a miscarriage, then the physician and the mother will be able to make a decision to abort and to complete a miscarriage. So they do coexist,” Herring said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abortion rights advocates urged the committee to vote in favor of the amendment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This amendment will protect Virginians’ rights to make their own reproductive health care decisions, including access to abortion, contraception, fertility treatment and miscarriage care,” said Jamie Lockhart, executive director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right now, with no state or federal protections in place, Virginians face the constant risk that anti-abortion politicians could restrict or ban essential care. No one is more qualified than an individual and their health care provider to make these complex personal decisions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After defeating a Republican motion to kill the proposed amendment, the committee moved to advance the measure by a 12-9 party-line vote.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Restoration of rights amendment </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/HJ2" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HJ2</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sponsored by Del. Elizabeth Bennett-Parker, D-Alexandria, seeks to automate the process of restoring voting rights to people convicted of felony crimes who have served their sentences. The proposal comes in response to a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/03/23/youngkin-administration-now-requires-felons-to-apply-to-get-their-voting-rights-back/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2023 policy change</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> implemented by Gov. Glenn Youngkin that requires people with felony convictions to proactively apply to regain their voting rights upon release from prison and is not automatically restoring rights for any group of offenders — a shift from Virginia’s three previous governors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bennett-Parker told reporters Wednesday that her amendment proposes automatic restoration of voting rights for individuals who have been released from incarceration, which she said would foster “a more just and bare” society.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The disenfranchisement of people with all convictions is a relic of Virginia’s Jim Crow past and was intentionally inserted into the 1902 Virginia Constitution to disenfranchise as many Black voters as possible,” Bennett-Parker said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She added that the right to vote is fundamental and the amendment ensures that if a person has served their time they deserve to have their rights to participate in democracy restored.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia is the only state to permanently disenfranchise all individuals with felony convictions unless they individually petition the governor for rights restoration. The current system has no transparency and changes every four years, so no one knows what steps to take to get their rights restored. This amendment creates a process that is bound by transparent rules and criteria that will apply equally to everybody.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee backed HJ2 with a 12-9 party-line vote.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Marriage equality amendment</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the U.S. Supreme Court granted same-sex couples the right to marry in the Obergefell v. Hodges ruling in 2014, the state Constitution still includes the 2006 Marshall-Newman Amendment, which defines marriage as solely between one man and one woman and bans recognition of any legal status that approximates “the design, qualities, significance, or effects of marriage.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because it could become law again should the Supreme Court overturn its 2014 ruling one day, Del. Mark Sickles, D-Arlington, sponsored </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/HJ9" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HJ9</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in an effort to repeal the current constitutional provision and enshrine marriage as a “fundamental right inherent in the liberty of persons,” unrestricted by factors like sex, gender or race. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeff Caruso, executive director of the Virginia Catholic Conference, told the committee that his group has opposed efforts to repeal the Marshall-Newman Amendment for more than 16 years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We affirm the dignity of every person, we also affirm that marriage has an original design and purpose, which predates any nation, any religion and any law, and we urge you to uphold that principle today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Narissa Rahaman, executive director of Equality Virginia, pushed back against that notion and reminded the panel that today there are more than 20,000 same-sex couples in Virginia who have more similarities than differences with couples in traditional marriages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Here in Virginia we have seen how a state has evolved in its thinking about same-sex couples, and LGTBQ people overall. Now it’s time for our state to fully complete our evolution and finish the job in protecting marriage equality for all,” Rahaman said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee advanced the amendment on a bipartisan 16-5 vote, with four Republicans joining Democrats. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think our straightforward amendment will be welcomed by Virginia citizens and I’m really appreciative of the vote today in the committee,” Sickles said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All three amendments are now set to be voted on by the General Assembly during its 2025 session, which begins in January. </span></p>

Walker Memorial Plaza in Richmond Tuesday. (Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jay Jones, a Democratic former state delegate from Norfolk, on Tuesday announced his bid for Virginia attorney general at two separate events in Norfolk and Richmond. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Jones, who represented the 89th District in the House of Delegates from 2019 to 2021, it marks his second run for his party’s nomination for attorney general. In 2021, he lost the Democratic primary to then-incumbent Mark Herring, despite an endorsement from former Gov. Ralph Northam.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Last week we awoke to an uncertain future and a president-elect who openly flouts the rule of law,” Jones said before a small crowd of supporters that had gathered at Maggie L. Walker Memorial Plaza in Richmond Tuesday afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With an incoming administration, families now face the threat of higher healthcare costs as (Donald) Trump seeks to kick tens of thousands of working Virginians off Medicaid and end the protections of the Affordable Care Act,” Jones said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also accused Attorney General Jason Miyares, the Republican incumbent and his potential opponent, of using his office “to attack Virginians’ freedoms, pander to the fringes of his own party and side with corporate price gougers and polluters” at the cost of Virginia families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He’s used his office to advance his own radical, personal, partisan-political agenda,” Jones said of Miyares. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, Jones is one of two declared candidates in the 2025 attorney general’s race, alongside Henrico County Commonwealth’s Attorney Shannon Taylor. Miyares responded to Jones’ announcement Tuesday by calling out his potential opponents on social media. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Both of the announced Democrat candidates for attorney general are far-left, anti-police, criminal rights progressives who will make Virginia less safe,” Miyares wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “They will support the same criminal first, victim last policies that lead to a surge in violent crime.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares has yet to declare whether he will run for reelection or seek his party’s nomination for governor.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his Richmond appearance, Jones declined to comment on the attorney general’s response to his announcement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You have to ask him why he said that,” he said. “We’re focused on this campaign, whatever he says and whatever he tweets out, that’s him, and his campaign’s business.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jones’s pre-legislature career includes a stint at Goldman Sachs in New York, where he specialized in risk management and credit advisory for natural resources and tech companies. After two years, he returned to Virginia, earning his law degree from the University of Virginia School of Law in 2015. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While in law school, Jones interned for Del. Algie Howell, who represented the 90th House District from 2004 until 2014. Jones was elected to the body himself in 2017 after winning a competitive Democratic primary and defeating Libertarian candidate Terry Hurst in the general election, succeeding then-Del. Daun Hester, D-Norfolk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jones said on Tuesday that he is running because Virginians need an attorney general who is focused on keeping the commonwealth safe instead of following a partisan agenda. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As your attorney general, I will protect Virginia’s families, our children, and our most vulnerable,” he said. “We will crack down on those who would do our kids harm by working with law enforcement to get illegal guns off our streets, shut down drug traffickers and hold to account the gun manufacturers whose weapons of war are used to commit mass shootings and crimes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jones vowed to “go after the criminals that prey on children and our families and put them where they belong — behind bars,” and he promised to take on social media companies “fueling a mental health crisis among our young people” and corporations that pollute air and water. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And if the Trump administration again tries to raise the health care cost by taking apart the Affordable Care Act, I’ll be the first to take him to court to stop it,” Jones said, adding that he would always fight back against “any attempt to undermine abortion rights in Virginia” and use “the full weight of the office” to protect women and medical professionals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House Privileges and Elections Committee is set to meet Wednesday to consider several proposed constitutional amendments, including one to guarantee access to abortion in Virginia and another to remove outdated language defining marriage solely as a union between a man and a woman. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I will join the fight to enshrine these rights in our Constitution today,” Jones said. </span></p>

Glenn Youngkin on Monday unveiled the Virginia Veterans Network (VVN), a new comprehensive </span><a href="https://vesa.dvs.virginia.gov/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online resource</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> designed to support the state’s veterans, transitioning service members and their families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking at the Hampton Roads Council of Veterans Organizations’ (HRCVO) annual Veterans Day Luncheon in Virginia Beach, Youngkin praised the military community and highlighted the commonwealth’s commitment to being a leader in veteran support services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“On Veterans Day and every day, we celebrate the service and sacrifice of all the men and women who have served our Nation,” Youngkin said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia is the proud home of nearly 700,000 military veterans. We go to work every day to ensure that Virginia is the best state in America for veterans, military service members, and their families to live, work, and raise a family.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The VVN platform consolidates hundreds of organizations and services into a single portal, providing veterans with streamlined access to disability benefits, job opportunities, medical and legal services, education and training, and peer support. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also designed to make it easier for veterans and their families to schedule appointments with the Department of Veterans Services, access free federal, state, and local benefits, and find tailored support at every stage of life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new platform was built by veterans for veterans, Youngkin said. “VVN is truly the gold standard of service for Virginia veterans and delivers on our promise to give Virginia veterans the best available resources.”</span></p>

(Office of Gov. Glenn Youngkin)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chuck Zingler, commissioner of the Virginia Department of Veterans Services (DVS), noted that the platform was developed in response to veterans’ requests for a simplified way to access diverse resources. “The goal for VVN is to make life easier for our veterans, military service members, and their families,” Zingler said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Veterans asked for a simple solution for finding a variety of resources in the Commonwealth and beyond, and we made it happen. VVN offers real solutions in real time, connecting the right people to the right resources at the right time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Virginia Secretary of Veterans and Defense Affairs Craig Crenshaw called the online portal “another example of how Virginia is committed to providing an excellent quality of life for veterans and their families.” </span></p>

Virginia is one of several states that had property tax measures on the ballot this year. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)</p><p>Voters in half a dozen states approved ballot issues aimed at lowering property taxes, but a measure in North Dakota that would have completely repealed the property tax proved to be a bridge too far.</p>
<p>Ballot measures to cut taxes for some or all property owners passed in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, New Mexico, Virginia and Wyoming.</p>
<p>But in North Dakota, a coalition made up of police, firefighters, teachers, real estate brokers and many other groups who rely on funding from local governments successfully persuaded voters that scrapping property taxes would cripple local services. The <a href="https://northdakotamonitor.com/2024/11/05/north-dakota-voters-reject-property-tax-ballot-measure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">measure failed</a>.</p>
<p>“North Dakotans are frustrated about property taxes, but Measure 4 was not the way to accomplish reform,” Chad Oban, chair of the Keep It Local coalition, said in a statement. “The coalition’s 113 members were successful in informing North Dakota voters about the dangers of Measure 4. Local officials will continue to work with their constituents to make thoughtful decisions regarding funding and what is best for their communities.”</p>
<p>He suggested the state legislature should take up property tax reform in January.</p>
<p>The proposed constitutional amendment would have prohibited state and local governments from taxing property’s assessed value and required the state legislature to replace the roughly $1.3 billion per year in lost revenue. If it had passed, North Dakota would have become the only state without property taxes, according to the conservative Tax Foundation.</p>
<p>Supporters of the measure had argued that it would restrain government spending and that the legislature had other pots of money to replace the lost revenue.</p>
<p>Former Republican state Rep. Rick Becker, a leader of the referendum drive, told Stateline earlier this year that many residents in his state hate property taxes.</p>

<h4 class="editorialSubhed">Property taxes</h4>
<p>States that approved reducing some property taxes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arizona</li>
<li>Florida</li>
<li>Georgia</li>
<li>New Mexico</li>

<li>Wyoming</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></div>

	</span></p>
<p>“Do you really own your property if the government can take it away?” he said, referring to cases in which people who don’t pay their taxes might face foreclosure on their homes.</p>
<p>Property tax increases across the country have been driven by the increase in home and commercial real estate values, due to inflation and shrinking stock. And experts say because those taxes often arrive in a large lump a couple or so times a year — as opposed to income taxes or sales taxes, which come in dribbles — they tend to leave a bigger impression on taxpayers.</p>
<p>Two proposed property tax initiatives in Colorado — to cut property taxes and to cap the annual growth of the revenue they generate for the state — were withdrawn from the ballot after the legislature, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis and the groups behind the initiatives agreed on compromise legislation. That law reduces property taxes in the next two years by a smaller amount.</p>
<p>In Arizona, the issue was intertwined with homelessness and vagrancy problems. Voters <a href="https://azmirror.com/briefs/ballot-prop-roundup-what-passed-what-failed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approved</a> a measure to allow property owners to apply for a property tax refund if their municipality does not enforce laws against illegal camping, loitering, panhandling, public urination, public consumption of alcohol and possession of illegal substances.</p>
<p>Republican supporters argue the measure will force local governments to enforce those bans. But cities objected to the measure, saying it will put them in a difficult legal and fiscal position as they deal with homelessness.</p>
<p>Florida voters backed a measure to give homeowners a bigger tax break as the cost of living increases. It will institute an annual inflation adjustment to the amount of a home’s assessed value eligible for a homestead exemption from the property tax.</p>
<p>Similarly, Georgia voters approved a ballot measure that aims to limit property tax increases when home values rise. It will allow for a statewide homestead exemption that will cap increases in the assessed value of homes, though it allows localities to opt out of the exemption.</p>
<p>New Mexico and Virginia voters overwhelmingly approved ballot measures to extend more property tax breaks to veterans and their surviving spouses.</p>
<p>Wyoming voters passed a measure to set up a new class of property for taxation, allowing the legislature to put owner-occupied primary residences in a separate category from rental property.</p>

Glenn Youngkin's proposal to invest another $290 million for school construction needs during the upcoming legislative session which begins in January. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following Tuesday’s general election, in which Virginians sent two state senators to Congress, the commonwealth is preparing for special elections to fill the seats vacated by John McGuire, R-Goochland, and Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire, who is set to succeed U.S. Rep Bob Good, R-Farmville, in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District, and Subramanyam, who was elected in the 10th Congressional District, have left a void in the Virginia Senate that each party will urgently work to fill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These vacancies could have a significant impact on the state’s legislative balance, where Democrats currently hold a narrow 21-19 majority. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the governor calls special elections in Virginia during recess of the legislature, Christian Martinez, a spokesman for Gov. Glenn Youngkin, said in a text message that because the General Assembly remains in special session from last May, the authority to call special elections rests with the leaders of each respective chamber — which in the case of the Senate is Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, the body’s President Pro Tempore. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The governor strongly believes all Virginians should be represented during the legislative session and trusts that Democratic leadership will call those elections in time to ensure all Virginians are represented,” Martinez said. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title24.2/chapter2/section24.2-216/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">State law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requires that a date for a special election to fill a vacancy  be set within 30 days of the vacancy or receipt of notification of the latter, whichever comes first. If the vacancy occurs between Dec. 10 and March 1, “the writ shall order the special election to be held no more than 30 days from the date of such vacancy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Senate District 10, which includes 11 localities and extends from Lynchburg in the west to the Richmond suburbs in the east, former state senator Amanda Chase, who had served in the body for eight years and lost her 2023 GOP primary in her Chesterfield-based seat to Sen. Glen Sturtevant, has already announced her bid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the law requires state legislators reside in the district they represent, Chase has moved from her former home in Chesterfield County to Appomattox County. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shayne Snavely, Chase’s former aide who worked on her bid for the Republican nomination for governor three years ago, has also declared his intention to run. And so have Jean Gannon, a Powhatan County real estate appraiser and longtime Republican activist, and Duane Adams, the chairman of the Louisa County Board of Supervisors, who ran for the Republican nomination in the district in 2023 but lost to McGuire. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg, said that Chase may be the top contender among the Republican candidates in the 10th District.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Chase has made waves, but local GOP officials say she is no longer in the party, which would really complicate things,” Richards said, referring to an </span><a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/government-politics/is-amanda-chase-still-in-the-gop-intraparty-feud-risks-her-state-senate-ambitions/article_e36769a4-7f54-11ef-87ee-57ebfcd982f3.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">intra-party controversy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over allegations that the former senator had violated state party rules. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No Democrat has announced a bid in the Republican-leaning district to date. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 32nd District, Del. Kannan Srinivasan, D-Loudoun, formally announced his bid on Wednesday, along with Hurunnessa Fariad, the director of outreach at Multi-Faith Neighbors Network (MFNN) and the secretary of the board of directors at the Virginia Interfaith Center for Public Policy. Buta Biberaj, a former commonwealth’s attorney for Loudoun County, has also announced her bid for the seat, as well as Ibraheem Samirah, a former state delegate, also from Loudoun. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other Democratic candidates include Sree NagiReddi, an Ashburn-based IT professional and small business owner, and Puja Khanna, a Loudoun County mental health advocate who ran unsuccessfully for the county’s board of supervisors in 2023.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The name I see mentioned most often is Srinivasan, which would then involve a special election in House District 26 later on,” Richards said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lots of other Democrats are emerging in this blue district,” he added, “but I expect some Republicans to throw their names in after the relatively good showing of the GOP statewide last Tuesday. The GOP might be looking for a pickup here, not sure they will get it.”</span></p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: Ommair Butt, a Republican, announced his candidacy for the 32nd District state Senate seat on TV news station <a href="https://www.wjla.com/news/local/2024-special-elections-virginia-senate-district-32-lodoun-county-former-commonwealths-attorney-buta-biberaj-race-senator-suhas-subramanyam-delegate-kannan-srinivasan-republican-democrat-ibraheem-samirah-puja-khanna-sreedhar-nagireddi-governor-youngkin" target="_blank">WJLA</a> on the evening of Nov. 7, after the above story was reported.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JLARC, which conducted the study the report is based on, and VDH commissioner Dr. Karen Shelton attributed some of the departments’ issues to the COVID-19 pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020 and 2021, before Shelton joined VDH, the department had to place much of its focus on the state’s response to the global pandemic. Additional contractor staff were brought on board to help with things like contact tracing and vaccine rollout. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flash forward to 2024, and JLARC identified that the department was over-reliant on contractors in lieu of permanent staff positions, with contract employees making up over a third of the department’s workforce.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surveys also found that staff felt inadequately trained. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid staffing turnover, the report also outlined a “protracted and inefficient process of prolonged hiring, leading to unfilled vacancies,” said JLARC analyst Drew Dickinson. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Anne Ferrell Tata, R-Virginia Beach, asked if the overall healthcare industry workforce shortages that have been affecting Virginia were a factor in the vacancy issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dickinson said VDH is still actively posting jobs but the process is “just taking too long and it’s causing these issues.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, the average duration for hiring lasted about 100 days (roughly a third of a year), so over 400 qualified applicants had moved onto other job opportunities, according to Dickinson. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that a third of staff surveyed felt there was little accountability for people’s job performances. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lack of accountability is contributing to low morale and high turnover,” Dickinson said.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond staffing, the department’s challenges include  financial management, a process VDH relies on to secure numerous federal grants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After repeated issues procuring one from the Environmental Protection Agency, for example, the federal agency decided to no longer dispense it up front to Virginia’s health department. Now the department has to front the cash for related expenses and then seek reimbursement from the EPA in lieu of a traditional grant funding format. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report also noted numerous incidents of delayed and duplicate payments to vendors, and that VDH has struggled to pay its bills promptly. This has created backlogs for other state agencies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tata called the report “sobering” while Del. Charniele Herring, D-Alexandria, referred to it as “shocking” and “disturbing.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The JLARC study went on to outline over 30 recommendations for how VDH can better function. Suggestions include the state legislature funding recruitment positions that can help scout and hire permanent staff in the department, and establishing a requirement that the commissioner report on progress of implementing recommendations semi-annually to the Joint Subcommittee on Health and Human Resources Oversight through December 2026. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dickinson agreed, and said VDH’s issues “warrant attention from the state legislature, at least temporarily.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another suggestion is for Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s office to direct the Office of the State Inspector General to assign waste, fraud and abuse hotline investigations relating to VDH to its own staff, rather than VDH’s internal audit staff. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokesperson for Youngkin did not answer when asked if the governor would take the OSIG recommendation but did stress the efforts that have already been underway to help resolve VDH’s issues. One such example was the appointment of VDH’s chief operating officer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Through proper management review and oversight, the VDH team has already made significant progress to address many issues within the JLARC report,” press secretary Christian Martinez said in a text Thursday afternoon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commissioner Shelton presented an optimistic follow up to the JLARC report, confirming actions the department has already taken to course correct.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After starting as commissioner in the summer of 2023, Shelton  noted that she oversaw the creation of regional health director roles to “increase communication and accountability across health districts.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shelton explained that VDH is placing emphasis on filling vacancies in financial and human resources divisions as well as the internal audit team. Shelton also created the Office of Grants Management specifically to take point on the grants VDH relies on. Additionally, a reshuffling in the department assigned a chief financial officer to oversee finances. She added that Chief Operation Officer Christopher Lindsey has been leading frequent operating reviews since joining the agency in late 2022. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are rebuilding a culture of accountability,” Shelton said. </span></p>

(Ian Stewart/For The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday afternoon, standing next to outgoing Mayor Levar Stoney in front of City Hall, Dr. Danny Avula laid out his vision for Richmond and his administration, after emerging as the leading candidate in the city’s mayoral race. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avula racked up </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">44,832 votes, or </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">46%, the most of any candidate, and won in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 7th districts, according to unofficial results from the Department of Elections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avula, the former director of the Richmond and Henrico Health Districts, said he plans to assemble his transition team and, once in office, start a search to hire a new chief administrative officer. He added that he is looking forward to working with current elected officials as well as Richmond’s newly-elected city council and school board members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Almost everybody I&#8217;ve talked to in the last 24 hours have expressed such an amazing willingness to work together, to do whatever they absolutely can to protect the rights and freedoms of Richmonders,” he said. “I&#8217;m very, very excited to work with those bodies moving forward for the good of our city.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He referenced Tuesday’s presidential election, which resulted in Republican Donald Trump winning a second term in the White House, and how it may impact Richmond. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think many of us are concerned justifiably about what that means for our city moving forward,” Avula said. “Members of our LGBTQ plus community, our Black and Brown and immigrant families, for working families, there&#8217;s a lot of concerns about what the shifts at the national level mean for us.”</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="SZTgN9VpPD"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/06/avula-is-likely-to-be-richmonds-next-mayor/">Avula likely to be Richmond’s next mayor</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concerning his planned national search for someone to replace current Chief Administrative Officer Lincoln Saunders, Avula said he’s looking for a person who understands complex administrations and can navigate possible issues with federal funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think the reality of what&#8217;s happening at the federal level will mean changes in the funding that may be coming to us,” he said. “It will mean us needing to work more closely than ever with the state and with our federal partners to make sure that we&#8217;re drawing resources into the city.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avula faced off against four other candidates. Michelle Mosby, who finished the race as his closest contender with 25.4% of votes, conceded and congratulated Avula Wednesday morning. Harrison Roday, who earned 13.03%, also conceded Wednesday morning. Candidates Adreas Addison and Maurice Neblett garnered 11.92% and 2.94%, respectively. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Elections has not finished certifying Tuesday’s election, and is still in the process of counting provisional ballots, according to their </span><a href="https://enr.elections.virginia.gov/results/public/richmond-city/elections/2024NovemberGeneral" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican officials in Virginia celebrated the former president’s national victory, hailing it as a mandate for their party’s agenda. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The American people have spoken overwhelmingly to return common sense, strength, and leadership back to the White House. Through the Trump presidency, we will pave the way for an economic revival, a secure border, and a stronger America on the world stage,” Gov. Glenn Youngkin said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin did not comment on </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/05/harris-triumphs-over-trump-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris’s victory in Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Democrat defeated Trump by a 5-point margin, winning 51.8% to Trump’s 46.5%, a spread of nearly 225,000 votes from a total of about 4.3 million cast, according to unofficial data from the Virginia Department of Elections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump claimed victory nationwide by securing 292 electoral votes to Harris’s 224, also winning the popular vote by a 4.8 million margin — the first Republican nominee to do so since President George W. Bush won reelection in 2004.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Democrats, on the other hand, remained largely silent in the immediate aftermath of Tuesday’s election.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Oyna2sSBD2"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/05/harris-triumphs-over-trump-in-virginia/">Harris triumphs over Trump in Virginia</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the few party leaders to address Virginians directly within hours after the Associated Press </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/06/dc/ap-former-president-donald-trump-wins-second-term/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">called the race</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for Trump was Virginia House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, who despite the Democrats’ defeat in the race for the White House and the U.S. Senate expressed optimism about his state and how Democrats and Republicans can work together at the state level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All politics are local, and I think we&#8217;ve begun to see that here in Virginia,” Scott told reporters outside the state capital in Richmond on Wednesday afternoon. “I think Virginians expect us to do everything that we can to protect their freedoms, and then to work where we can, with the governor and with the federal government.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in reference to some voter demographics and polarizing factors about Trump as a candidate, he said “I think we learned some lessons about what’s acceptable and unacceptable for whole lot of American people.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats and activists have continually stressed concern over Trump’s rhetoric that often disparages people of color, immigrants and women. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think the country made a bet on Donald Trump that some of the things that he has said he didn’t mean, and they’re going to trust him,” Scott said. “I hope they’re right, because we want him to be successful, because it’s good for the entire country.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The economy was “a huge issue” during the 2024 election cycle, Scott added as a reason some Virginia voters turned to Trump. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think inflation is real. There are people who still feel some pain around inflation. Even though inflation is down, prices are down, we’re back moving in the right direction… I think that that message didn’t resonate with voters, and I think that ended up hurting us at some point,” he said. </span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., whose seat was not up for reelection this year, said that he was committed to “working with President-elect Trump to get things done for Virginians, just as I did during his first term.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Americans made their choice on Tuesday, and while it wasn’t my favored candidate, I respect the democratic process and the outcome of this election,” Warner said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Democratic leaders had anticipated a strong showing for Harris in the state, but her smaller-than-expected margin of victory reflects a shift in Virginia’s political landscape, particularly in rural areas that saw increased GOP turnout, political analysts say. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Virginia and nationally, red areas became more red and blue areas became less blue nearly everywhere,” said Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump’s obvious liabilities — his felony convictions, his chaotic administration and rhetoric driven by his white-hot anger — didn’t seem to matter to voters who were in a mood to reject the status quo, Farnsworth said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the commonwealth, where abortion was protected by existing state law, the abortion issue was less relevant. In a number of states where abortion was on the ballot, abortion measures were far more popular than the Democratic candidates who supported them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And voters were clearly unhappy with the Biden administration&#8217;s record, particularly as it related to economic anxiety, the border and racial and cultural politics, Farnsworth added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The national dimensions of this frustration were seen in all areas — nearly everywhere we saw that Harris won by less or lost by more than Biden did four years ago.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Republicans hailed Trump’s victory as a win for the commonwealth while remaining silent on the former president’s defeat in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Minority Leader Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, said in a statement that Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, will return to Washington with “a clear mandate” from the American people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Across Virginia, and indeed the entire nation, voters shifted to the right in record numbers. Working class Americans stood up and said they&#8217;re tired of being told the economy is fine, and that they should just buy off brand peanut butter to deal with inflation,” Gilbert said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Groups long “taken for granted by the left” rejected claims that their schools are fine and their children are safe in their communities, he added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Tens of millions of Americans decided they’d had enough of being called Nazis for simply having a different political opinion. Americans will no longer ignore what they can see right in front of them, no matter how much Democrats insist that reality is wrong.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rich Anderson, the chairman of the Republican Party, said that he was pleased with the results both nationally and in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re obviously pleased with the national race, the American people have spoken and President Trump has been reelected to a second term,” Anderson said in a phone interview Wednesday. “Here in Virginia, he did not carry it, but we worked very hard and took the 10.1% lead that Biden had in 2020 and shaved it down to just under 6% this year. I feel very good about that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">None of the “swings of the party pendulums” happen in a revolutionary way, Anderson added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s usually evolutionary, and we’re now in the process of trying to take that pendulum and swing it as far and as fast as possible back toward the right.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most Republicans, however, limited their post-election commentary to social media, offering a mix of reflection and Monday-morning quarterbacking with a hint of ridicule. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It looks like over 300 electoral votes, the popular vote, taking the Senate and keeping the House, and gosh, who could have predicted that calling over half of the country a bunch of bigoted misogynists if they didn’t vote for your candidate wasn’t a good campaign strategy? Who could have predicted that?” Del. Nick Freitas, R-Culpeper, a social media influencer, told his 1.3 million Instagram followers <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DCCJJQ7uY4z/?igsh=MWN3MnV3MjQyZWFkbw==" target="_blank">in a video</a> he posted Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, state Sen. Glen Sturtevant, R-Chesterfield, asked for suggestions for “some of the action items for Virginia as we move forward” from the 2024 election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Identify the 200k Virginia Biden voters who didn’t show up for Harris. Figure out what’s going on with some of the pollsters that appear to have been completely divorced from reality,” Sturtevant listed among his own action items. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Susan Swecker, the chairwoman of the Democratic Party of Virginia, declined to comment Wednesday, stating that she was waiting for Harris to address the American people later on Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But DPVA spokeswoman Kelsey Carolan said that Virginia Democrats fared well in the presidential election compared to other eastern states — despite Republican gains across the board. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carolan cited election data from Connecticut, where Trump gained 8.9% of voters compared to 2020, New York (10.6%), New Jersey (10.9%) and Maryland (10.3%).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Virginia, Trump currently has a gain of 4.8%” Carolan said. “That is the most apples-to-apples analysis, because all of these states are states where neither campaign spent money on TV ads. This was a wave election and we’ve held our own.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few Democratic lawmakers  took their post-election sorrows to social media. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a </span><a href="https://x.com/jackie4norfolk/status/1854158831162454269" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lengthy thread</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on X, Del. Jackie Glass, D-Norfolk, said that Tuesday evening reminded her of the night when Trump was first elected eight years ago. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">She recalled how her then 10-year-old son asked her if his Latino and Hispanic classmates in school might be &#8220;taken away.&#8221; She added that she had once again woken up with a &#8220;familiar sense of dread.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Glass still left her fellow Democrats with a message of hope and optimism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Grab your pen, your pocketbook, your protest sign, your petition, and above all, your purpose. Remember, we are Lovers — no matter who we love, where we’ve been, or how we’ve lived. And if there’s one thing I know as a woman and a mother, it’s this: Lovers make the best fighters. Let’s fight for Virginia. Let’s go.”</span></p>

(Photos courtesy of candidates' campaigns)</p><p><em>Updated Nov. 6 at 11:20 a.m.</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The voters of the 7th Congressional district proved just how tight the contest is, by keeping the race between Eugene Vindman and Derrick Anderson too close to call.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 99% of votes had been counted, with Vindman and Anderson earning about 51% and 49% of the vote, respectively, but by 10 a.m. Wednesday,  the Associated Press had still not confirmed a winner. </span></p>
<p>“In my 25 years of military service, and when we were jumping out of airplanes, it didn’t matter to me the color creed, background, race, or party affiliation of the person next to me,&#8221; said Vindman in a statement declaring victory, despite the uncertainty of the outcome. &#8220;What mattered was getting the mission done. That’s the type of service I am going to take to Washington as the next Congressman from Virginia’s 7th Congressional District.”</p>
<p>“We knew this was going to be a tight race, folks,” Anderson said in a video <a href="https://x.com/DerrickforVA/status/1854006484184551766" target="_blank">posted</a> on his X account at 10:42 p.m., before later <a href="https://x.com/DerrickforVA/status/1854016079905124787" target="_blank">posting</a> the race was &#8220;too close to call.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to keep looking, we&#8217;re going to keep watching,&#8221; Anderson said. &#8220;I just ask y&#8217;all give us a little more time and we&#8217;re going to get through this thing.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seat went up for grabs after incumbent Abigail Spanberger, a Democrat, announced she would run for governor. In 2021, the year before voters in the 7th elected Spanberger, more of the district voted for Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin than his Democratic opponent former Gov. Terry McAuliffe.</span></p>
<p>Spanberger, in a statement Tuesday, congratulated Vindman on a &#8220;well-earned victory,&#8221; adding he will, &#8220;bring the values, work ethic, and commitment to public service that the Seventh District deserves.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the men hold similar backgrounds through their military service, the race between Vindman and Anderson largely focused on their policy differences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman voiced strong support for protecting reproductive health rights, easing Virginians’ economic pain by continuing to lower medication costs, and strengthening the nation’s borders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson supported reducing taxes and immigration reform in his campaign, and said abortion rights are best left up to states. He mirrored several of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s policy stances.</span></p>
<p>We will update this story with the race outcome as soon as it is confirmed.</p>

<p><em>Updated Nov. 6, 6:15 p.m.</em></p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, staved off Democratic challenger Missy Cotter Smasal to win a second term representing Virginia&#8217;s 2nd Congressional District.</p>
<p>With a 4-point sustained lead by nearly 6 p.m on Wednesday, the Associated Press called the race for Kiggans almost 24 hours after polls closed on Election Day.</p>
<p>In a post to X earlier in the day before the race had officially been called in her favor, Kiggans posted that she was grateful her district has &#8220;once again chosen commonsense conservatism.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Together we will get our country back on the right track and secure America’s success,&#8221; she added.</p>
<div>
<p>The Virginia Beach-anchored district has oscillated between political parties in congressional representation in recent years, with former Democratic  Rep. Elaine Luria ousting Republican Rep. Scott Taylor in 2018, followed by Kiggans ousting Luria in 2022. Smasal had hoped to flip the red district back to blue this year.</p>
<p>In addition to Virginia Beach, the district includes Chesapeake, Suffolk, Isle of Wight and Virginia’s Eastern Shore. Though a primary role of congressional representatives includes securing federal funding for local and state government to use, candidates’ plans to address national issues also featured prominently in the election this year, <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/02/kiggans-and-smasal-face-off-in-highly-competitive-2nd-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/02/kiggans-and-smasal-face-off-in-highly-competitive-2nd-district/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1730958278931000&amp;usg=AOvVaw17jleutQiIn5Gup30WVwfH">such as reducing inflation and reproductive rights.</a></p>
<p>A swingy district, the seat was seen as crucial for determining partisan control of the U.S. House of Delegates. Smasal had the <a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/virginia-congress-smasal-kiggans-hakeem-jeffries/article_955a0eac-d5bc-11ee-99ea-4f07936040ca.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsement of House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-New York</a> — likely the next House Speaker should Democrats flip the chamber. Meanwhile, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana came to Virginia to boost Kiggans and she had appeared at a <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/28/trump-rallies-in-chesapeake-backed-by-virginia-governor-gop-leaders/">rally for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump</a> over the summer.</p>
<p>In a statement Wednesday night, Smasal conceded the race and thanked supporters.</p>
<p>&#8220;To our voters, I’m sorry that we did not win the day, but I’m so thankful for your hard work and support.  I carry your stories and experiences with me every day, and I am grateful for your trust and teamwork throughout this journey,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The countless doors we knocked on, the phone calls we made, and our unwavering commitment to truth and justice in the face of extremism are evidence of our resolve and patriotism.&#8221;</p>

Tim Kaine, D-Va., defeated Republican Hung Cao on Nov. 5, winning a third term. (Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., on Tuesday secured a decisive victory over his Republican challenger Hung Cao that earned him a third term on Capitol Hill. Kaine defeated Cao, a retired U.S. Navy captain, with 53-47% of the votes, according to unofficial numbers from the Virginia Department of Elections. The Associated Press called the race at roughly 11:20 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his re-election campaign, Kaine consistently championed the policies of President Joe Biden, aligning himself with key legislative achievements that he argued were vital for Virginia’s growth and prosperity, including the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, a $1.2 trillion package that has been heralded as a major win for modernizing America’s transportation and infrastructure systems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine also is an avid supporter of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which he has repeatedly hailed as a crucial step toward addressing economic and environmental concerns. The act aims to reduce the deficit, tackle rising inflation and lower healthcare costs, while also making historic investments in clean energy and climate change mitigation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the year, Kaine emphasized how these measures would benefit Virginians, from creating jobs in infrastructure to supporting the state’s transition to renewable energy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think ‘make, build, grow’ is the right message. We make it here, we build it here, we grow it here,” Kaine told The Mercury in a recent interview. “That takes advantage of the bills that we passed, but it also is a reflection of the fact that manufacturing jobs are up, we are doing infrastructure in a major way, so why not lean into what is actually happening on the ground?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pre-election polls had consistently shown Kaine, a Harvard-educated lawyer, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/harris-kaine-ahead-in-virginia-by-comfortable-margins-new-poll-says/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">leading</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by double-digit points, reflecting his enduring popularity in the commonwealth, where he previously served as governor, lieutenant governor and Richmond’s mayor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cao, who won his party’s nomination during a five-way primary election on June 18, ran a spirited campaign that focused on conservative values like curbing government spending and bolstering national defense. Cao also supported former President Donald Trump’s sweeping proposal to deport all undocumented immigrants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While his background as a Vietnamese immigrant and military veteran brought a unique perspective to the race, despite Trump’s endorsement Cao struggled to overcome Kaine’s strong name recognition and deep ties to Virginia’s electorate — and, at times, his own rhetorical fumbles on the stump. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cao’s campaign marked the Republican’s second attempt at running for public office. In 2022, he unsuccessfully challenged U.S. Rep. Jennifer Wexton, D-Loudoun County, in Virginia’s 10th Congressional District, losing by 53-47%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even before seizing the Republican nomination for one of Virginia’s two seats in the U.S. Senate, Cao often found himself stumbling over his own remarks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a conservative podcast in May, Cao pushed back against allegations in a story published by the Staunton News Leader that the political action committee he had launched to support Republican candidates in 2023 mostly benefited his own Senate bid, </span><a href="https://www.newsleader.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/05/22/cao-says-he-didnt-promise-super-pac-money-to-virginia-2023-candidates/73792102007/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">calling the allegations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “a hit job” and referring to the News Leader as a “podunk local newspaper.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cao also suggested that it was “ridonkulous” to drive from his home in Purcellville to Abingdon for a campaign forum, and also appeared to grapple with Virginia geography </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/07/19/senate-candidate-cao-says-that-anything-south-of-loudon-and-fairfax-is-southern-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">when he told</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Brian Kilmeade of Fox News in July that “anything south of Loudoun and Fairfax is Southern Virginia.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And at their sole </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/07/kaine-faces-off-against-gop-challenger-cao-in-high-stakes-u-s-senate-race/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">candidates debate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Norfolk State University, Cao’s attempts at articulating his policy platform were overshadowed by his remarks suggesting that the Navy uses drag queens as recruitment tools and his stereotyping of Asians as being good with math. </span></p>

John McGuire, shown here campaigning with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene in Louisa County in May, won his first election in Virginia's 5th Congressional District earlier this month. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland, on Tuesday prevailed in his bid to become the next congressman to represent Virginia’s 5th Congressional District after defeating Democrat Gloria Witt in a contentious race marked by internal Republican turmoil. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the infighting that erupted after McGuire unseated incumbent Rep. Bob Good, R-Farmville, in the June 18 primary election, McGuire managed to unite enough of the party’s base to win Tuesday’s general election with 56-43.5% of the votes, according to unofficial numbers by the Virginia Department of elections</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Associated Press called the race at 10:58 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire, a former U.S. Navy SEAL who announced his bid for the Republican nomination in the 5th District just one week after winning his seat in the 10th state Senate District — a move that angered many of his fellow Republicans in the district — overcame months of tension between his supporters and loyalists of Good, who had held the seat since 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A staunch conservative with deep backing from religious and hardline right-wing groups, Good lost the GOP nomination to McGuire in a heated primary that was one of the most expensive and most watched nomination contests nationwide this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The loss led to a fractured Republican base, with some of Good’s supporters initially refusing to back McGuire and vowing to write in the incumbent, who became nationally known for his role in ousting former Speaker Kevin McCarthy and as the chairman of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, McGuire’s strong conservative platform on issues like gun rights, economic growth and national security — and his endorsement by former President Donald Trump, who disavowed Good after the congressman openly backed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ presidential bid — resonated with voters in the 5th District, Virginia’s largest. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But McGuire’s victory over Witt was by a much smaller margin than Good’s 56-42% win against Democrat Josh Throneburg two years ago — a fact that the ousted incumbent will likely seize on if he decides to seek the Republican nomination again in 2026. </span></p>

Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, on Tuesday easily won reelection in Virginia’s 9th Congressional District, which he has represented since 2011. The Republican incumbent fended off a challenge by Democratic Karen Baker in a race that centered on health care access and representation in the largely rural, mountainous region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Associated Press called the race at 9:17 p.m. as Griffith led Baker with 73.5%-26.5% of the votes, ensuring his eighth term in Congress. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griffith’s victory solidifies his stronghold in the conservative-leaning district, which stretches across Southwest Virginia, an area known for its rural communities and economic challenges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout her campaign, Baker, a healthcare advocate and former administrative law judge for the Social Security Administration, focused on expanding access to health care services in the district, particularly in its remote areas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also criticized Griffith for not doing enough to address the health care needs of his constituents, arguing that the region’s residents have been underserved. Baker also claimed that Griffith had failed to show up for the people of the 9th District, asserting that his focus had drifted away from the issues impacting local communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People sometimes go, who’s that? And generally, I would say 80 to 90% of the time, people say, ‘he doesn’t do anything for us,&#8217;” Baker </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/27/in-the-fightin-ninth-baker-seeks-to-end-griffiths-13-year-tenure/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said of her opponent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in an interview with The Mercury in September. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griffith, however, defended his record, emphasizing his efforts to bring jobs and federal resources to the district. He also highlighted his work on energy and coal industry issues, which remain central to the district’s economy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m a big supporter of the telehealth concepts, of our federally qualified health centers, and of trying to make sure that we continue to pay our health care providers enough that they can make it,” Griffith told The Mercury in an interview. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The race underscored the ongoing divide in Southwest Virginia between conservative and progressive approaches to policy, particularly on issues like health care, jobs, and government spending. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Griffith’s win signals continued Republican dominance in the 9th District, Baker ran a more efficient campaign than Democrat Taysha DeVaughan, who two years ago lost her bid to oust the Republican incumbent by 26.5-73%.  </span></p>

    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Pulled fire alarm at Arlington, Va. precinct didn’t disrupt voting, Beals says</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following issues with some ballots in Richmond and Chesterfield earlier in the day, in a 9 p.m. update Tuesday evening Virginia’s top election officials reported just one other hiccup: a pulled fire alarm that prompted the evacuation of an Arlington County polling location, but didn’t prevent anyone from voting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 6 p.m. hour, the alarm was pulled at  Arlington Precinct 150, the Crystal Plaza polling place,  Virginia Elections Commissioner Susan Beals told reporters in the third and final press briefing of the day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They evacuated the building and they continued voting outside,” Beals said. “Their voters continued voting through 7 o’clock, and then they closed the polls.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some colleges and universities, Beals said, faced longer lines, but “we have checked with all of those registrars, and they have indicated to us that all of those students have been served. There currently are no lines, (or) anyone else waiting to be served in those areas.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia did not receive any bomb threats, Beals said, following a news </span><a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/fbi-statement-on-bomb-threats-to-polling-locations" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">release</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Federal Bureau of Investigation stating several states had received them. The origins of those threats were traced back to Russian email domains, the release said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As results continued to trickle in Tuesday evening, Beals also laid out the next steps in the counting process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wednesday morning, officials will double check the results from machines and begin reviewing provisional ballots from </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/05/va-college-voting-bloc-utilizes-same-day-registration-shares-top-policy-issues/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">same day registrations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which were counted at 15,000 to 17,000, as of Tuesday morning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After provisional ballots are cast, identification of the voters must be validated by 10 a.m. on Friday. Local electoral boards will be meeting next week to finalize whether all their provisional ballots will be counted or not, Beals said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Localities have until Friday, Nov. 15 to report their results to the state Board of Election, which will then determine on Monday, Nov. 18 which congressional race will receive an audit, a procedure to make sure votes were counted accurately. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re going to have two post election auditions during the week of Nov. 18,” said Beals. “One, the U.S. Senate race will receive a risk-limiting audit that every locality across the state is going to participate in. And then two, one congressional district is going to be chosen at random to also have a risk-limiting audit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dec. 17 is when Virginia will convene its electoral college, when electors will meet and vote for the president and vice president, Beals continued. Their certificates will be sent to Congress and  counted on Jan. 6, and the president will be inaugurated on Jan. 20, Beals said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals also expressed gratitude to poll workers statewide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would like to reiterate my thanks to the hundreds of poll workers across Virginia who helped their fellow Virginians vote today,” Beals said. “We could not have done it without you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A couple of snags were detected in Richmond and Chesterfield early in the day, though both were resolved quickly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Richmond, 11 people at an East End precinct had been given ballots that only included federal elections rather than both federal and local contests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unfortunately,” Richmond registrar Keith Balmer said, those voters won’t be able to weigh in on local contests. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Balmer said the city’s electoral board held an emergency meeting to vote to remove the precinct chief. A member of his staff oversaw voting for the rest of the day and no other issues have been reported. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal-only ballots were intended for military and overseas voters who can vote in federal elections, but can’t vote in local jurisdictions because they don’t live there and aren’t part of the local tax base, Balmer explained. These ballots are typically used for absentee voting, but Balmer said that a small number are still on hand at local polling places because that voter demographic does sometimes show up to vote in person. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was those ballots that were mistakenly handed to people when Precinct 310 opened at 6 a.m. Balmer said that because those people have already voted, there’s nothing that can be done to change that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Once we put their ballot in the machine — even though it’s clear as day that they were given the wrong ballot — there’s no do-overs unfortunately,” Balmer said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Chesterfield County briefly experienced jammed ballot scanners at “a handful of precincts,” registrar Missy Vera said in a release. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scanners are used to accept printed ballots and she attributed the issue to “ink levels </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">of a specific batch of ballots that were printed by a state-affiliated vendor.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To resolve the matter, poll workers were instructed to not use the specific batch of blank ballots that had been identified as the source of the issue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She added that the jamming issues “are not slowing the voting process” and that the unused ballots that had been the source of the jamming issue wouldn’t  be used going forward.</span></p>
<p><b>5:25 p.m.:</b></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Richmond precinct chief dismissed after handing out the wrong ballots</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A precinct chief in Richmond’s Precinct 310 was dismissed and replaced on Tuesday after an error resulted in 11 voters receiving the wrong ballots, according to Virginia Elections Commissioner Susan Beals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals informed reporters during a second Election Day briefing Tuesday afternoon that Richmond’s City Electoral Board met and chose to replace the precinct chief responsible. The error meant that the affected voters were unable to cast ballots for local races, as they were given special ballots meant exclusively for federal races.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My understanding is that they cast only federal ballots which included only the office of President of the United States,” Beals explained, adding that these specific ballots are usually reserved for voters who are about to move. “Those ballots, to my understanding, did not include the local races,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The error highlights the challenges election officials face in ensuring each voter receives the correct ballot, especially during high-turnout elections. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Number of provisional ballots cast unclear, but same-day registrations are up</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals also said at the briefing Tuesday that the number of provisional ballots cast throughout Election Day remained unclear by 4 p.m. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right now we don’t have anything statewide other than what we knew of this morning, which is we had between 15,000 and 17,000 statewide,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals added that several localities with universities and colleges reported an </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/05/va-college-voting-bloc-utilizes-same-day-registration-shares-top-policy-issues/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">uptick in same-day voter registrations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have heard that there are long lines in some localities that have universities and colleges, as a lot of those students have been encouraged to same-day register today,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Department of Elections officials have remained in touch with these localities and, when needed, deployed more officers of elections and supplies to those universities and the precincts on their campuses, Beals said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we encourage everyone to do is to please make sure you stay in line, even if the 7 p.m. hour passes. They will process you and they do want you to vote, so please do not get out of line.”</span></p>
<p><strong>5:10 p.m.:</strong></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">At the polls, Northern Virginia voters weigh views on abortion, cost of living</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, campaign signs were spread across Northern Virginia at intersections, street corners, and even posted on a bridge over Interstate 66, urging Virginians to support local, state and presidential candidates in this year’s general election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In areas such as Arlington, Falls Church, and Fairfax City, some voters have already cast their ballots early, leaving little foot traffic at precincts on Election Day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to David Bjerke, general registrar for the City of Falls Church, the city recorded a voter turnout of 80.1% by 5 p.m. In Fairfax County, one of the larger jurisdictions in the commonwealth, election officials said total turnout was at 67.9% as of 3:30 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While 2,305,439 Virginians had already cast their ballots through early voting as of Tuesday morning, the number of early voting ballots cast has dipped by about 525,000 compared to the last 2020 presidential election, according to data collected by the Virginia Public Access Project (VPAP).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some Election Day voters in close proximity to the federal government offices in Washington D.C., said they preferred to keep their names and who they voted for private due to their jobs, others were not shy to share their views.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think we need a change in this country,” said Elizabeth Green, a city of Fairfax voter who is concerned about the cost of living and voted early for former President Donald Trump. Green said she thinks Trump is the best presidential candidate to tackle the rising costs of food and housing she’s seen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other residents in Northern Virginia said they voted in person for convenience and to experience the voting atmosphere firsthand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mealod Khashei, in the city of Falls Church, said he voted on Election Day because doing so gives him more confidence his vote will be counted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s our civic duty, right,” Khashei said. “We [have] a few responsibilities that we’ve got to do, and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing.”</span></p>
<p><strong>4:07 p.m.:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re getting slammed with provisional ballots,” city of Richmond registrar Keith Balmer said in a phone call around 3:30 p.m. It’s mostly same-day voter registration.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris Davis, an election poll worker at Main Street Station polling place, estimated Tuesday afternoon that about 10% of ballots cast by early afternoon were provisional ballots — in part, he surmised,</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/05/va-college-voting-bloc-utilizes-same-day-registration-shares-top-policy-issues/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">from populations of college students</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that live and study in the area. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Same-day registration and provisional ballots are used in instances where someone forgot to bring their ID card or another form of identification when they vote. They can register at the polling place, vote, and then follow up with their local election officials to provide identification. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also an</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/think-you-might-have-been-mistakenly-purged-from-virginias-voter-rolls-heres-what-to-do/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">option</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the roughly 1,600 people who were</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/30/u-s-supreme-court-grants-stay-in-challenge-to-youngkins-voter-purge-order-allowing-removal-of-thousands-from-rolls/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">purged from voter rolls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this year over questions of citizenship status on Department of Motor Vehicles paperwork. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike regular ballots, provisional ballots undergo more scrutiny before they are counted, Balmer said. Officials research voters to determine factors like their identity, citizenship status, or residency in the district they voted in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My staff is going to have to research the eligibility of all of these voters and make a determination if their ballot should count or if it should not,” he explained. “Then the electoral board will ultimately make the final decision.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Basically, all of next week, we&#8217;re going to be adjudicating hundreds, if not thousands, of provisional ballots,” Balmer said. </span></p>
<p><strong>3:48 p.m.:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside the Virginia Commonwealth University polling location on the second floor of the Student Commons, several students shared their same-day voter registration experiences and the top policy issues driving their choice between presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Reproductive rights, housing and economic policy were among the young voters’ chief concerns. <strong><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/05/va-college-voting-bloc-utilizes-same-day-registration-shares-top-policy-issues/">Read more.</a></strong></span></p>
<p><strong>2:15 p.m.: </strong></p>
<p>Chris Davis, a poll worker at Main Street Station, said that about 10% of votes cast had been through same-day registration. He suspects that’s due to the amount of Virginia Commonwealth University and other university and college students that live in the area.</p>
<p><b>1 p.m.:</b></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virginia early voter turnout data and mail-in voting</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Elections Commissioner Susan Beals said at a media briefing on Election Day morning that as of Nov. 1, a record 6,374,437 Virginians had registered to vote. As of Tuesday morning, 2,305,439 Virginians had already cast their ballots through early voting, of which 1,861,938 were cast in person and 443,501 were returned by mail. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the mail ballots that are still outstanding, a total of 126,266 mail ballots have yet to be returned. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Those who are voting absentee by mail must have those ballots postmarked on or before today Nov. 5, and they must be received in the mail by noon Friday, Nov. 8, in order to be counted,” Beals said.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While same-day registrations data was not yet available for Tuesday around 10 a.m., Beals said that the state had filed a total of 16,557 same-day registrations leading up to Election day, “but we are obviously expecting more today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In September, Beals had </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/05/virginias-top-elections-official-warns-of-possible-delays-in-mail-in-voting-this-year/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expressed concerns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about potential delays with the U.S. Postal Service affecting timely processing of mail-in ballots ahead of the election. However, on Tuesday she reported that these issues have not materialized so far, and ballots are being processed on schedule.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think a lot of folks have chosen to do a drop off at a dropbox at their registrar’s office, we have seen an increase in that method of return,” Beals told reporters. ” We have not heard specific examples of people having delays in getting their mail back.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals added most voters are being very diligent about ensuring that their ballot has been received, which they can check online and see that it’s been received by their local registrar’s staff once they mail it back. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have seen an overall decrease in the number of people who have requested absentee by mail-in ballot this year as compared to 2020, but you can&#8217;t necessarily attribute that to just this issue, because 2020 was a very different time and a lot of people requested mail-in ballots because they just didn’t know what to expect on Election Day that year with the pandemic. So it’s hard to even make a case there.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Election integrity and and security concerns addressed early</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals reiterated that elections in Virginia are secure and reliable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Virginia, we have some of the most experienced election officials in the country. They have already conducted two statewide elections this year and have provided 138 days of early election day voting for Virginia voters as of today,” she said. Because Virginia has elections each year, Beals said, “our election officials have a great depth of experience in handling issues that come up for voters at the polls.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals added that election officials in the commonwealth have worked throughout the year to ensure that the elections are safe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In terms of security concerns, we have been meeting for many months with our state and federal law enforcement partners to plan for today,” she said. “We’ve had several meetings where we’ve run through various scenarios to make plans.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals couldn’t speak to the specifics of those plans but asserted again  “we’re very confident that we’re going to have a safe and secure election in Virginia day.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Department of Justice officials are </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/u-s-justice-department-to-monitor-polling-places-in-27-states-including-six-virginia-localities/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">monitoring six localities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Virginia Tuesday to ensure compliance with federal voting laws, but Beals said that her department would have no information to share on that. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Election Day snags</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals reported that the Department of Elections had been made aware of an incident at Precinct 310 in Richmond Tuesday morning, where election workers handed out federal-only ballots to at least 11 voters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That issue has still since been resolved. My understanding is that the officers of election gave out the incorrect ballot to the voters that had only a presidential race on the ballot,” she said. </span></p>

(Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Elections Commissioner Susan Beals confirmed Tuesday that no voters have been removed from the state’s voter rolls under Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/eo/EO-35-Comprehensive-Election-Security-Ensuring-Legal-Voters-and-Accurate-Counting---vF---8.7.24.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executive order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> since Oct. 15 — the deadline for Virginians to register to vote online or apply for absentee ballots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think the figure that has been out there is the figure that stands, there has not been any additional work done on that,” Beals said at an Election Day news conference at Richmond’s Capitol Square, referring to 1,600 individuals purged under Youngkin’s directive since August. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The last time that records were sent to registrars was October 14th, which is the close of books, and … that’s normally when we close out our maintenance practices,” Beals said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pause in removals comes amid a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/14/voter-purge-lawsuits-add-to-disenfranchisement-allegations-against-youngkin-administration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">high-profile legal battle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the state’s efforts to manage its voter rolls. The U.S. Supreme Court </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/30/u-s-supreme-court-grants-stay-in-challenge-to-youngkins-voter-purge-order-allowing-removal-of-thousands-from-rolls/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">granted a stay</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last week on a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/22/youngkin-blasts-doj-lawsuit-that-trust-virginias-voter-roll-removals-into-national-spotlight/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lower court’s ruling </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that would have required the commonwealth to restore the voting rights of the 1,600 removed Virginians. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares had already acknowledged the end of a voter purge in a court filing from Oct. 22,  without providing a date for the cut-off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The defendants have already ceased their allegedly unlawful removal process, as they always planned to do, which means there is no ongoing alleged violation,” the filing said.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the Youngkin administration has not said publicly that they were no longer removing individuals from the rolls — even after last week’s Supreme Court ruling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s order had instructed the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to send records of people thought to be non-citizens to local election registrars for potential removal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the order’s timeline became a point of contention, with critics arguing it led to eligible voters being mistakenly removed too close to Election Day, a  violation of the so-called 90-day quiet period before an election, which is mandated by the </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/national-voter-registration-act-1993-nvra" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Voter Registration Act of 1993</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals on Tuesday pushed back against allegations that Youngkin’s order prevented some citizens from exercising their right to vote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“First, in Virginia, we want every eligible voter to vote in this election,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals underscored that the removal process has been in place since 2006, when the law was signed by then-Gov. Tim Kaine, a Democrat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It has been managed and processed the exact same way by every administration since 2006 when the law was enacted. Nothing has changed in the way that that process is managed by the department,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Beals, the DMV sends information to the Department of Elections, where it is checked against the department’s list of registered voters. For any voters who marked on their DMV paperwork that they are not U.S. citizens, their information is forwarded to local registrars, who then send notifications by mail to these individuals, informing them they may be at risk of removal from the voter rolls, unless they provide proof of citizenship within 14 days. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If they return the form, nothing happens to the voter, (but) if they fail to return the form after 14 days, they are sent an additional notice where they are advised that they are being canceled because of non-citizenships status,” Beals said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Anyone who is canceled for non-citizenship status and feels as though it is in error can go to their polling location today on election day and same-day-register to vote and cast a ballot in this election.” </span></p>

Glenn Youngkin's political action committee. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One day before the presidential election, early voting turnout in Virginia is falling short of the historic highs seen in 2020, the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of Sunday, more than 2.29 million Virginians have already cast their ballots — a 525,000 decrease from the unprecedented 2.82 million early votes cast by Nov. 3, 2020, during the last presidential election, </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/elections/early-voting/2024-november-general-election/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Virginia Public Access Project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In-person was the most popular option for early voters this year. On Saturday alone — the last day for early in-person voting during this election cycle — 139,376 cast their ballot. In total, 1.856 million  early voters did so in person, with just 437,173 voting by mail.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite an initial wave of early voting in the southern and western parts of the state, the pattern of early ballot casting is about the same as some elections in more recent years, said David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads seem to have had higher percentage rates of early voting, but there were some interesting things as urban areas, cities, and towns seemed to often, but not always, have higher turnout rates,” Richards said. That could reflect that it’s easier to mobilize people if you have a denser population base to organize, he added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Overall rates are down compared to 2020, but that was the pandemic election, so the early voting rate is actually pretty decent. Most precincts have rates above 10%, many in the mid-40s, and at least a couple hit 50%, which is pretty impressive.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Democrats celebrate early voting turnout, Republicans see state in play amid mixed messaging from Trump</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As early voting numbers in Virginia show strong turnout from both Democrats and Republicans, both parties remain optimistic heading into Election Day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the state’s nonpartisan voter registration system keeps early vote totals from revealing party affiliation — adding an element of suspense for both sides as they each express confidence in their momentum — Republicans have remained vocal in their belief that the state remains in play, despite </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/01/harris-expands-her-lead-over-trump-to-10-points-in-virginia-new-roanoke-college-poll-says/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">consistent polling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showing Vice President Kamala Harris with a comfortable lead over former President Donald Trump.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richards, the political scientist, noted how early voting in Virginia’s 9th Congressional District in far Southwest Virginia, a GOP stronghold where Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, faces Democratic challenger Karen Baker, was particularly noteworthy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That district came out blazing hot but has settled down. They are closest to the 2020 turnout compared to other house districts, but in the previous election, they had the lowest turnout for early voting, so perhaps the bar was set low,” Richards said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, this development might also reflect the GOP’s effort to turn out the vote in an area of the state where Gov. Glenn Youngkin stressed the need for Republicans to vote early, Richards said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It seems like they responded. I think the Democrats may have taken a more leisurely approach, which is why we see Northern Virginia surging later in the early voting period.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because voters in Virginia don’t register by party affiliation, early-voting data offers little certainty about which way the election will go, but also looking at numbers in more partisan localities might offer hints. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Susan Swecker, the chair of the Democratic Party of Virginia, said in a statement that with over 2.3 million early votes cast — led by Democratic strongholds — Virginians have already made their voices heard that they choose the Harris ticket over Trump’s. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Late-deciding voters are breaking toward Vice President Harris by double digits, especially among independent women and seniors who are done with Trump. Kamala Harris and Tim Walz will resoundingly win Virginia’s 13 electoral votes,” Swecker said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Republican voters, previously hesitant to vote early, have shown increased participation in recent weeks, possibly due to GOP-led efforts highlighting the convenience and security of early voting — and despite or maybe because of Trump’s mixed messaging on the benefits of early voting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/23/trump-youngkin-urge-early-voting-during-tele-rally/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">telephone rally</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hosted by Youngkin in September, the Republican nominee urged his supporters to use “every appropriate tool to beat the radical left Democrats” and to not wait until Election Day to cast their ballots. “You’ve heard a lot about voting by mail, but that’s what we have right now.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But only hours later, at a rally in Indiana, Penn., Trump </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/23/trump-tells-supporters-to-vote-early-even-as-he-still-criticizes-the-practice-00180650" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reversed course</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, calling early voting “stupid.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia GOP Chairman Rich Anderson still pushed back against the assumption that Republicans are still weary of early voting — despite the former president’s flip-flopping on this issue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve worked really hard to increase turnout and to encourage people to show up and vote early. Obviously, the Democrats started that much earlier than we did, they are further along, but I&#8217;m very pleased, and I know that the governor is, too, that we’ve been able to make progress on that and change our culture,” Anderson said in a phone interview Monday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So the early voting looks very good, and I’m glad to hear there are banked votes, but we’re also working very hard to turn out voters tomorrow to make a winning difference and we&#8217;ll see how it comes out tomorrow night.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a larger early turnout might seem advantageous for Democratic candidates, Republican strategists argue that their base traditionally turns out in higher numbers on Election Day itself, meaning they still anticipate strong performance as the final ballots are cast. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results may ultimately depend on whether early voting enthusiasm from Democrats translates to similar turnout on Election Day, said Richards, the political scientist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Just under 4.5 million people voted in 2020, again during the pandemic. I would expect to see higher vote totals this year despite somewhat lower early voting rates, as more people will feel comfortable voting in person on Tuesday,” he said.</span></p>

(Jonathan Ernst/Scott Olson/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the presidential race, Vice President Kamala Harris holds a 10-point lead over former President Donald Trump (51-41%) in Virginia, according to </span><a href="https://www.roanoke.edu/news/rc_poll_politics_election_2024" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a new poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> released Friday by the Institute for Policy and Opinion Research at Roanoke College. Independent Cornel West and Libertarian Chase Oliver both poll at 2%, and Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate, takes 1% of the vote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the U.S. Senate race, Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine leads his Republican challenger Hung Cao, a retired U.S. Navy captain, with 51-40%, the poll found.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friday’s survey marks a significant expansion of Harris’ advantage compared to a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/20/harris-holds-slim-lead-over-trump-in-virginia-roanoke-college-poll-says/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">previous Roanoke College poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Aug. 20, when the Democratic nominee edged her Republican opponent by just three points (47-44%) in a head-to-head matchup in Virginia. Kaine’s 11-point lead over Cao lead remains unchanged. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new poll isn’t good news for the Trump campaign, which is set to hold a high-stakes rally </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saturday at the Civic Center in Salem, where the Republican nominee plans to make his case to Virginians for the last time before Tuesday’s election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent weeks, some leading Republicans have claimed that because of a fired up base and a tightening of the poll numbers, Virginia </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/01/trump-plans-rally-in-salem-saturday-despite-polls-showing-harris-on-top-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">could be in play for Trump</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who lost in the commonwealth in both 2016 and 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But according to Friday’s survey, only 2% of likely voters say they are still undecided four days before the election, and another 2% say they will vote for someone other than the five candidates on the ballot. Just less than half (47%) say they are almost certain to vote, while 40% report they have already voted. Almost one-fourth (24%) still plan to vote prior to Election Day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kamala Harris has increased the slim lead she held in the August Roanoke College Poll,” said Harry Wilson, senior political analyst for IPOR and Professor Emeritus of Political Science at Roanoke College. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She is claiming 95% of Democrats and leads 49%-36% among independents. Trump is supported by 90% of Republicans, but that might not be enough for him to win in Virginia.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With so few undecided voters, it’s a “tough uphill climb for Trump,” Wilson said. “Democrats continue to take advantage of early voting. Republicans are catching up, but they need massive turnout on Election Day.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The poll also found that a large majority (85%) of those who have not yet voted are very certain of their vote choice, and another 9% are somewhat certain. Two-thirds (66%) said they are very enthusiastic about voting, and another 17% are somewhat enthusiastic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The economy was named as the most important issue by 43% of respondents. Abortion (20%) and immigration (12%) were cited as most important more frequently than foreign affairs (8%) and crime (3%). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey further says that likely voters trust Harris to do a better job on abortion (57%, compared to 36% for Trump), but the candidates are viewed about equally on other issues (tied at 48% on immigration; Harris favored 49-45% on both crime and foreign policy; and Trump seen as doing a better job on the economy 49%-46%).    </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked if the candidate understands and cares about people like them, only 37% think that Trump understands and cares compared to 46% for Harris. Respondents are closely divided regarding the impact of the federal government, with 44% thinking the government makes their life worse and 40% thinking it makes their life better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results of the Roanoke College poll are consistent with an </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/harris-kaine-ahead-in-virginia-by-comfortable-margins-new-poll-says/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oct. 7 poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Wason Center for Civic Leadership at Christopher Newport University that had Harris leading Trump by 11 points (52-41%) among Virginia likely voters. The survey found that 4% of voters remained undecided four weeks before the election, while 3% said they will vote for someone else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For its survey, the Institute for Policy and Opinion Research interviewed 851 likely registered </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">voters in Virginia between Oct. 25 and Oct. 29, 2024.The survey has a margin of error of 4.6%. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The event will mark a nostalgic moment for Rich Anderson, chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia, who attended a gathering with President Richard Nixon at the same venue over half a century ago. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A little tidbit for you,” Anderson shared in a phone interview Thursday, “when I was a little kid, and I remember it like yesterday, I went to the rally in 1969 where President Nixon came to the same Civic Center and campaigned for (former Virginia Gov.) Linwood Holton, who was elected governor that year.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nixon’s visit 55 years ago, Anderson said, reverberated through the Roanoke Valley at the time, and he — and other high profile Republicans — hope that Trump’s event will have a similar effect. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Polls vs. perception</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/10/26/harris-trump-virginia-voters-poll/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington Post-Shar survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> released Saturday — one of the most recent presidential polls available for Virginia — Harris holds a six-point edge over Trump, similar to her eight-point advantage in a previous poll from September.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.roanoke.edu/news/rc_poll_politics_election_2024" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> released Friday by the Institute for Policy and Opinion Research at Roanoke College shows Harris with a 10-point lead over former President Donald Trump (51%-41%). Independent Cornel West and Libertarian Chase Oliver both poll at 2%, and Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate, takes 1% of the vote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And an </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/harris-kaine-ahead-in-virginia-by-comfortable-margins-new-poll-says/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">earlier poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Oct. 7 by the Wason Center for Civic Leadership at Christopher Newport University had the Vice President up by 11 points (52-41%) among likely Virginia voters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Republicans insist that a victory remains within reach in the commonwealth, where no GOP candidate has won a presidential race since George W. Bush in 2004 and where Trump lost in both 2016 and 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia, I believe, is in play,” said Anderson. “While the polling generally has Harris up, a lot of it is within the margin of error.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What I’ve told people is, don’t get fixated on these polls, regardless (of) where they are. If it shows Trump in a comfortable position, then the danger is that people start relaxing on our side. And if it&#8217;s not good news for us, then people get demoralized,” Anderson said. “Just work like we’re 10 points down and that’s the surest path to victory.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeff Ryer, a spokesman for the Trump campaign in Virginia, cited a Republican-leaning poll from Monday, which has Harris at 48% and Trump at 46% and is within the margin of error. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whether you’re looking at polling showing a margin-of-error race or Republicans’ strong showing in early voting, it’s clear that Virginia is a battleground,” Ryer said. “President Trump is holding a rally in Virginia because Virginia is in play.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Democrats have pushed back against the notion that the presidential race in Virginia has become more competitive in recent weeks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Donald Trump has been soundly defeated every time he’s run in Virginia, and while he’s welcome to waste his time campaigning here, Virginians are going to once again reject his extreme plans to roll back our rights and freedoms, wreck our economy, and raise taxes by nearly $4,000 for hardworking families,” said Aaron Fritschner, a spokesman for the Harris campaign. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Susan Swecker, the chair of the Democratic Party of Virginia, in a text message suggested that Trump’s choice to visit the commonwealth this close before the election might reflect his campaign’s dwindling options for large rallies, especially in competitive states where his standing is uncertain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The planned Salem rally, Swecker said, was “another tired Trump gimmick to counter that his show has grown stale in the core battlegrounds, as his crowd sizes have plummeted and exhausted people walk out of his rallies.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump is looking for “fresh crowds” in New Mexico and Virginia to “rant and rave about conspiracies like Youngkin’s false conspiracy theories about voting,” Swecker added. “Trump has done the same last-minute stunts in places like New Mexico in 2016 and Minnesota in 2020, only to get crushed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Trump has never shied away from campaigning in Democratic-leaning areas — as his recent visits to Monterey, California, and New York City have demonstrated — political analysts are also skeptical, noting that Trump lost Virginia in two previous elections and that the state has become more solidly Democratic in recent years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some suggest Trump’s visit could be an attempt to create the appearance of momentum in the commonwealth, while others speculate it might serve as a rallying cry for his base in case he contests the results after a potential defeat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As recently as last week Trump said on the Joe Rogan Show that he </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/us/politics/trump-joe-rogan-podcast.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">doesn’t trust the polls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but I cannot imagine his campaign thinks that Virginia is in play, especially since the most recent polls I have seen show Harris with a small, but outside-the-margin lead in the commonwealth,” said John Aughenbaugh, an associate political science professor at Virginia Commonwealth University. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have to wonder if there are other reasons why he would spend valuable campaign time in Salem, when he could be visiting the truly competitive battleground states Pennsylvania, Wisconsin or Michigan.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Aughenbaugh said, in 2016 most experts stated that Trump did not have a chance in either Pennsylvania or Wisconsin, yet he ended up winning there in part because his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton stopped campaigning in those states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aughenbaugh added that the Trump campaign also may be seizing on the heightened tensions over Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s recent executive order, which led to the removal of thousands of Virginians from the voter rolls and sparked legal challenges and national scrutiny. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The controversy culminated Wednesday, when the U.S. Supreme Court </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/103024zr_f2ah.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">granted a temporary stay</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the ongoing legal dispute over the governor’s order — a ruling in the Republicans’ favor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Political forecaster Larry Sabato, the director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, said that with Trump’s rally in Salem — a Republican stronghold — the former president might not have a rational purpose and that he was simply playing to his base by projecting strength through crowd size. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Trump is in part a creation of TV and ‘The Apprentice,’” Sabato said, referring to NBC’s reality television series which Trump hosted for 14 seasons. “He knows that actual reality can be shaped by the projection of his preferred version of reality. His version right now is, ‘We’re going to win in a landslide and that includes Virginia.’ His MAGA troops will certainly buy it, and it will whip them up even more than they already are.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while Salem is a four-hour drive from Washington, D.C., it is close enough to the networks so that coverage will be extensive on the final weekend, Sabato said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Rural areas are Trump’s greatest strength, far more than urban-suburban territory. But Virginia is not competitive. If it was, we’d be flooded with TV ads and boasts from the campaigns.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Anderson, the RPV chair, said he suspected that the Trump campaign may be trying to win Virginia by replicating Youngkin’s strategy during the 2021 gubernatorial election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“President Trump has not been to Southwest Virginia, which is obviously a major Republican enclave that must be turned out in order to offset the blue areas of the state, principally the urban crescent that runs from Fairfax all the way down to Richmond and then turns east toward Norfolk,” Anderson said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, Youngkin successfully aimed at losing Northern Virginia by fewer voters than some Republicans before him while focusing on increasing GOP turnout in Southwest Virginia, Southside and other Republican areas, Anderson said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Youngkin — who during his gubernatorial bid managed to flip the commonwealth red by skillfully balancing his stance on a former president who remained highly unpopular with a significant portion of Virginia voters — has now become one of Trump’s biggest cheerleaders, willing to reiterate the campaign’s message that the state is in play.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia is far more competitive than any of the pundits would believe,” Youngkin told Fox News’s Bret Baier on Wednesday, vowing to attend the Salem rally. </span></p>

Glenn Youngkin’s executive order that resulted in the removal of over 6,000 Virginians from the state’s voter rolls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stay pauses a lower court’s ruling that would have required the state to restore 1,600 voters to the rolls, allowing Youngkin’s directive to remain in effect and voter removals to continue as the case proceeds. The high court’s decision drew praise from Youngkin and laments from the voter rights groups suing him and the state.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court’s six conservative justices supported the stay, with the three liberals dissenting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin in a statement hailed the court’s decision as “a victory for commonsense and election fairness.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am grateful for the work of Attorney General Jason Miyares on this critical fight to protect the fundamental rights of U.S. citizens. Clean voter rolls are one important part of a comprehensive approach we are taking to ensure the fairness of our elections,” Youngkin said, adding that the ruling would ensure a secure election on Nov. 5.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginians can cast their ballots on Election Day knowing that Virginia’s elections are fair, secure, and free from politically-motivated interference,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The order comes after the Virginia Republican Party filed </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/29/virginia-gop-calls-on-u-s-supreme-court-to-reinstate-youngkins-voter-purge-order/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an amicus brief</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tuesday supporting Youngkin’s efforts, arguing that removing noncitizens from the voter rolls should not be delayed due to the federally mandated “quiet period” — a buffer period around elections meant to avoid disruptions to voter records. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Republican brief argues that the governor’s order was based on data from the Department of Motor Vehicles and focused on noncitizens, and thus does not constitute a “systematic” voter purge restricted by the quiet period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opposition to the order has come from various groups, including former GOP lawmakers such as Barbara Comstock, Denver Riggleman, and Adam Kinzinger, who filed </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A407/330589/20241029151116178_333985%20Amicus%20on%20Application.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a separate brief </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">urging the Supreme Court to deny the stay. They argue that hastily removing voters could lead to eligible citizens losing their rights, citing concerns over the potential exclusion of legitimate voters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares and Youngkin’s administration maintain that the executive order is a necessary step for election security. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement released Wednesday, Miyares called the Supreme Court ruling a win for election integrity and the rule of law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While I am gratified the court moved so quickly, I remain deeply concerned and alarmed that the Biden-Harris administration chose to execute this maneuver just 25 days before an election,” he said of </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/14/voter-purge-lawsuits-add-to-disenfranchisement-allegations-against-youngkin-administration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filed earlier this month by the Justice Department that challenges Youngkin’s executive order. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Critics, however — including the Virginia Center for Immigrant Rights and the League of Women Voters’s Virginia chapter, who are suing Youngkin and the state — argue that the purge risks disenfranchising Virginians and disproportionately impacts minority voters, calling the move part of a larger trend of restrictive voting policies. Representatives of the groups and their lawyers said they were “disappointed” with the Supreme Court’s decision in a virtual press conference held Wednesday afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryan Snow, counsel with the Lawyers Committee For Civil Rights Under Law, called the decision by the nation’s highest court an “abuse of power.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bert Bayou with African Communities Together said that the state’s and high court’s actions </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are &#8220;sending a disturbing message that (immigrant’s) voices are not valued, not wanted, and not American.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are living in a political climate that is fanning the flames of xenophobia,” he added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orion Danjuma, counsel with Protect Democracy, noted how a similar situation was also recently settled in Alabama. A federal judge </span><a href="https://alabamareflector.com/2024/10/16/federal-judge-blocks-alabama-secretary-of-states-voter-removal-plan/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blocked </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alabama’s voter roll purge program after the Department of Justice had filed a similar suit last month as it did to Virginia. When Virginia requested its stay to the U.S. Supreme Court, Alabama’s Attorney General </span><a href="https://www.alabamaag.gov/alabama-joins-25-state-coalition-urging-u-s-supreme-court-to-grant-emergency-motion-so-virginia-is-not-forced-to-add-noncitizens-to-its-voter-rolls/#:~:text=(Montgomery%2C%20Ala)%20%E2%80%93%20Alabama,rolls%20for%20the%20upcoming%20election." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">signed onto an amicus brief</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in support of the request. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Danjuma stressed that the programs “disenfranchise eligible voters” and that organizations like his will continue to challenge them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While this is a serious setback to voters for this election, we want to make clear that we will be continuing to expose problems with the state&#8217;s program so that they can be corrected in the future,” he said. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">State lawmakers react</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s statehouse leaders shared a variety of responses to the news on Wednesday, reflecting both support for SCOTUS’ decision and dismay due to it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, who has been outspoken in his opposition to Youngkin’s executive order, posted to X that the stay SCOTUS granted “does not equal a win.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unfortunately, The Governor&#8217;s scheme to block legal eligible (Virginia) voters has temporarily worked. It&#8217;s a sad day for the Commonwealth and the country,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, state Sen. John McGuire, a member of the body’s Privileges and Elections subcommittee and a candidate for Virginia’s 5th Congressional District seat, commended the Youngkin administration for &#8220;leading the charge to keep our elections secure.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “This is simple: noncitizens shouldn’t be able to vote, and I’m glad the Supreme Court agrees,&#8221; McGuire stated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As chair of the Senate Privileges and Elections Committee, Sen. Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach had written a letter to Commissioner of Elections Susan Beals on Sep. 27, seeking more information on how the removals were handled under Youngkin’s Aug. 7 executive order and whether non-citizens were facing prosecution for attempting to register.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his letter Rouse referenced a Fox News </span><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6360067628112" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Youngkin did the day of his executive order where he claimed that his order would lead to “immediate” removal of people and subsequent prosecution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rouse asked Beals if registrars were referring people to commonwealth&#8217;s attorneys. In her Oct. 8 response to Rouse, Beals did not answer whether registrars had referred non-citizens to local prosecutors.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="DoFiHerc2c"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/over-1600-people-removed-from-voter-rolls-under-youngkin-order-groups-seek-court-injunction/">Over 1,600 people removed from voter rolls under Youngkin order; groups seek court injunction</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Over 1,600 people removed from voter rolls under Youngkin order; groups seek court injunction&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/over-1600-people-removed-from-voter-rolls-under-youngkin-order-groups-seek-court-injunction/embed/#?secret=eOvHIIJRpF#?secret=DoFiHerc2c" data-secret="DoFiHerc2c" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plaintiffs in the case against the state argue there has been no evidence of people being prosecuted for attempting to vote illegally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have tried to get straight answers from this Administration,” Rouse said Wednesday. “It took the U.S. Department of Justice filing suit and a federal judge forcing the Youngkin administration to disclose the names of those removed and confirm what we feared: that in fact eligible Virginia voters have been stripped from the rolls.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that he and members of his committee will “work to ensure that these disenfranchised voters are educated as to the procedures for casting a valid provisional ballot.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What the situation could mean for Virginia voters, on Election Day and beyond</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the stay in place, the case is likely to continue drawing national attention as the election nears, spotlighting debates over voting rights, citizenship and electoral integrity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It could also lead to confusion at the polls next Tuesday, because it remains unclear what information voters who have been purged would need to show for same-day registration, said Henry Chambers, a professor for constitutional law at the University of Richmond School of Law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The administration is claiming that there is sufficient evidence to knock someone off the rolls. If that’s true, and if a registrar has said this person shouldn’t be on the roll, I’m not sure what kind of information would convince the registrar that the person should be on the rolls and should have their provisional ballot counted. And that’s a tricky issue.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chambers added that it also remains unclear what the Supreme Court ruling means for the federal </span><a href="https://www.lwv.org/newsroom/press-releases/lawsuit-challenges-recent-voter-roll-purges-virginia-preventing-eligible-us" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">suit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filed by the Virginia Coalition for Immigrant Rights and the League of Women Voters of Virginia earlier this month which alleges that the process used to purge the rolls violates the 90-day quiet period and therefore disenfranchises eligible voters while raising concerns over transparency and accuracy in the state’s voter registration system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In theory, the case goes back to the drawing board and you need to run it as a sort of a regular merits case as opposed to just an injunction case. But the problem with that is that the point of the case is that the 90-day quiet period is going to be over once election day is done,” Chambers said. “Then the question becomes, is the purge program in and of itself unlawful in general?’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some state lawmakers have signaled they are ready to tackle that question, and </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/30/should-legislators-tweak-virginias-2006-voter-roll-law-for-more-clarity/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that undergirds it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Sen. Travis Hackworth, R-Tazewell County, said in a phone interview Wednesday that in the 2025 legislative session, he would “be open to looking at anything” in the 2006 law that would limit potential confusion at the polls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The bottom line is, if you are a U.S. citizen, we want you to vote, it’s your right and duty to vote,” said Hackworth, a member of the Senate Privileges &amp; Election who was “very disheartened” when the lower court ruled to halt Youngkin’s order.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If any among the affected 1,600 Virginians believe they have been removed from the voter rolls in error, Hackworth urged them to still cast a provisional ballot bringing documentation proving their citizenship status and let the local electoral board “figure that out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think that maybe we are kind of overcomplicating this process, because anybody still has the right on the day of to say, ‘I have been purged from the voter rolls, I am a citizen of the United States, and I want to vote.’ If you have that much conviction to go to the polls and vote provisional, you will bring something that’s going to back up your claim that you are a citizen.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The situation has raised questions on whether state lawmakers should consider amending that law for additional clarity and to avoid future legal disputes over how Virginia confirms voter registration shortly before elections. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The 2006 law</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin has said repeatedly that his executive order was built on a 2006 state law for voter roll cleanups, which directs the Department of Motor Vehicles to send data to the State Board of Elections of people who failed to indicate U.S. citizenship in paperwork. There’s a process of notification and then purging of voters who fail to prove their citizenship, and in previous years, the process was done on a monthly basis. Youngkin’s order directed DMV and Elections Department officials to perform it daily.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuits the state and Youngkin face say Youngkin’s order ran afoul of the National Voter Registration Act, which institutes a “quiet period” on such actions 90 days before an election. Several state lawmakers have signaled they agree with that allegation, including House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, who </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/14/voter-purge-lawsuits-add-to-disenfranchisement-allegations-against-youngkin-administration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">previously told</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Mercury “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason that we have this 90-day rule is that we don’t want citizens to be accidentally removed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Privileges and Elections Committee chair Sen. Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach, called Youngkin’s order “reckless” and alleged that it’s being used to “fire up the (Republican) base.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you actually look at the issue of the matter, it’s the 90-day quiet period,” Rouse said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The courts will decide the matter concerning the legal challenges, John Aughenbaugh, a political science professor at Virginia Commonwealth University, said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But he added that the Youngkin administration “brought this on themselves” by issuing the order so close to the 90-day federal threshold.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Aughenbaugh said, “I can understand why <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/22/youngkin-blasts-doj-lawsuit-that-trust-virginias-voter-roll-removals-into-national-spotlight/">Youngkin told Fox News</a> ‘we didn’t think we were doing anything wrong,’” in citing the 2006 law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That measure was carried by former republican state Sen. Ken Cucinelli and signed by former Democratic Gov. Tim Kaine. At that time, Republican President George Bush’s Department of Justice had issued a memo that it didn’t object to the law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the time since, no one has challenged it, until the two suits against Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An argument in Attorney General Jason </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A407/330363/20241027231346621_Application%20for%20Stay%20SCOTUS%20vpf.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares’ Supreme Court filing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> notes confusion on when the federal 90-day law should overpower the 2006 state law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The current confusion surrounding the NVRA makes the rules anything but clear,” Miyares’ petition reads. “States are unaware of when, or whether, they can remove noncitizens from the voter rolls. They need to know with certainty whether they can remove noncitizens at any point, only outside of the Quiet Period, or never.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, the Republican National Committee and Republican Party of Virginia also </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/29/virginia-gop-calls-on-u-s-supreme-court-to-reinstate-youngkins-voter-purge-order/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filed a brief</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in support of the state’s SCOTUS request.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="PT197hFPSU"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/29/virginia-gop-calls-on-u-s-supreme-court-to-reinstate-youngkins-voter-purge-order/">Virginia GOP calls on U.S. Supreme Court to reinstate Youngkin’s voter purge order</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia GOP calls on U.S. Supreme Court to reinstate Youngkin’s voter purge order&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/29/virginia-gop-calls-on-u-s-supreme-court-to-reinstate-youngkins-voter-purge-order/embed/#?secret=Qu8rSVbz84#?secret=PT197hFPSU" data-secret="PT197hFPSU" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rouse said there hasn’t yet been talk between himself and other members of the Privileges and Elections Committee about tweaking the 2006 law to spell out the 90-day threshold of the NVRA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We haven&#8217;t had those conversations,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As to resolving any confusion, Sen. Bill Stanley, R-Franklin County, said that the state legislature broadly is always looking at ways past laws might need to be amended. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This might be one of those times,” he said. “The question then becomes ‘is there a bipartisan solution?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It might also come down to the question of how to prevent governors from overstepping or skirting federal law, as well as how to prevent presidential administrations from wading into state law, Aughenbaugh suspects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The debacle playing out on the national stage might prompt Virginia legislators to ask, “Did the Youngkin administration too broadly interpret the law? Do we want to rein-in gubernatorial administrations in the future?” Aughenbaugh posited. “Meanwhile, how do you revise the law so that future presidential administrations don’t single out a state for lawsuits two weeks before Election Day?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rouse said there’s valid reasons for those types of deliberations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s more of a bigger picture with Governor Youngkin in terms of inciting fear and undermining our elections,” Rouse said of conversations he’s having with his fellow lawmakers. “We understand that this administration has been known to make mistakes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rouse pointed to how the administration pulled out of ERIC, a multi-state data-sharing coalition meant to maintain voter roll accuracy — and how he </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/11/youngkin-blocks-democratic-bills-dealing-with-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> legislation prompting Virginia’s return to it this year, along with other voting-related bills. The administration also mistakenly canceled over </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/01/voting-rights-advocates-blast-youngkin-admin-over-error-affecting-3400/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3,000 people’s registrations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year, Rouse said. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Can same-day voter registration and provisional ballots fix it?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless of whether eligible voters were caught up in the recent purge or run into other election-access issues, registrars have said that use of same-day registration and provisional ballots </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/think-you-might-have-been-mistakenly-purged-from-virginias-voter-rolls-heres-what-to-do/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are an option</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would allow them to vote on Election Day. Provisional ballots require follow-up after voting to verify a person’s address, citizenship status or other factors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s an argument Republican national and state leadership is making as a reason Youngkin’s order and the subsequent voter purges should stand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even if a person entitled to vote were erroneously removed from the voter rolls and unable to respond to the Commonwealth’s outreach, they may still take advantage of same-day registration and cast a ballot,” the state’s request to the Supreme Court stated.  “No legal voters could or would be disenfranchised.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aughenbaugh doubts the nation’s highest court will grant Virginia’s request so close to the elections and  suspects people who have been purged may not have to resort to provisional ballots this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t think there are enough (Supreme Court) justices that have the appetite to wade into that dispute less than a week before elections,” he said. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A407/330552/20241029131746854_24A407%20Beals_SCOTUS_Amicus_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">its filing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the state GOP argues that the removal of illegally registered non-citizens from Virginia’s voter rolls should not be restricted by the “quiet period,” a federally mandated time frame close to an election during which systematic changes to the voter rolls are limited. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in a </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A407/330589/20241029151116178_333985%20Amicus%20on%20Application.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">separate amicus brief</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also filed on Tuesday, a group of prominent Republicans who formerly served in Congress and are outspoken critics of the GOP’s presidential nominee Donald Trump – including Denver Riggleman, Barbara Comstock and Adam Kinzinger — are urging the Supreme Court to deny Virginia’s request for an emergency stay and uphold the lower court’s ruling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In their filing, the former lawmakers argue that while the </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/national-voter-registration-act-1993-nvra" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> authorizes “truly individualized removals” of voters from the rolls at any time, the law specifically seeks to prevent sweeping purges that could disenfranchise eligible voters rather than targeted removals of ineligible individuals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To protect the right to vote from the inherent errors, vagaries, and bureaucratic swamp of last-minute systematic removals, Congress imposed the quiet period provision to protect voters in the immediate run-up to elections — at which point it might be impossible or impractical to correct a wrongfully terminated registration status,” the brief said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “daily systematic removal program” recently undertaken by Virginia is precisely what the NVRA’s quiet period provision forbids, the filing continues.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is not a close case; it is instead a paradigmatic violation of Congress’s design. The fact that this last-minute systematic program has in fact disenfranchised eligible Virginia voters only confirms the wisdom of the NVRA’s plan and the illegality of this scheme. To hold otherwise would thwart the bipartisan congressional consensus underlying the NVRA.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Republicans argue in their own filing from Tuesday that even if the NVRA applies to efforts to remove illegally registered noncitizens from the voter rolls, Virginia’s process is “sufficiently individualized” and that it does not constitute the kind of “systematic” effort to remove individuals from the voter rolls prohibited during the “quiet period.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GOP filing claims that the Virginia Department of Elections’ practice of comparing voter rolls with data from the Department of Motor Vehicles to identify non-citizens is selective enough to sidestep the restrictions imposed by the quiet period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Courts have correctly interpreted ‘systematically remove’ to mean programs that make decisions about voters’ eligibility based on mass information collected by third parties rather than individualized information or investigation,” the brief said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, the Republicans contend that allowing the lower court’s ruling to stand would cause “irreparable harm” as the Nov. 5 election nears. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The consequence of that order is that non-citizens — who all agree cannot legally vote — will be added back on the voter rolls at the last minute, diluting legitimate votes and exposing those non-citizens to a substantial risk of criminal prosecution should they misunderstand the lower courts’ order as a greenlight for them to vote unlawfully,” the filing said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GOP also asserts that there is no risk of harm to eligible voters if the executive order remains in effect. Virginia law allows same-day registration, providing an alternative for those erroneously removed to cast a ballot on Election Day. According to the amicus brief, “no legal voters could or would be disenfranchised” if the executive order is upheld.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares filed the commonwealth’s appeal to Chief Justice John G. Roberts, seeking a stay on federal Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles’ Oct. 25 order requiring the reinstatement of individuals removed from Virginia’s voter rolls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giles had ruled that Youngkin’s order, issued in August, may have inadvertently included eligible voters. The order directed the Department of Motor Vehicles to send daily lists of individuals identified as noncitizens to the State Board of Elections for immediate removal from voter rolls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the 2006 state law on which Youngkin’s directive is based calls for this process to occur on a monthly basis.</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce for the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 1,600 voters have been removed from the rolls since an Aug. 7 executive order by Gov. Glenn Youngkin, plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the governor said Wednesday on a press call. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seventy-five voter registrations were denied in the same time period, said Ryan Snow, counsel with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against Virginia for </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/14/voter-purge-lawsuits-add-to-disenfranchisement-allegations-against-youngkin-administration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">removing voters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from rolls within 90 days of this year’s elections. Virginia’s League of Women Voters and the Virginia Coalition for Immigrants Rights had previously filed a similar suit. Earlier this week a federal judge ordered the Youngkin administration to </span><a href="https://www.wvtf.org/news/2024-10-21/federal-judge-orders-release-of-names-impacted-by-voter-rolls-purge" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">release</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the names of affected voters as part of discovery in the League of Women Voters case and officials had to comply by Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snow confirmed to The Mercury that the numbers came from a list provided to the plaintiffs. The Mercury also has a pending Freedom of Information Act request seeking numbers of people flagged for removal and how many may have been reinstated or not removed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The case will have a hearing in Alexandria Thursday morning where plaintiffs hope for an injunction of Youngkin’s order.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ahead of the hearing, immigration advocates and other groups joined a press call Wednesday to lay out their case to the public.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The DOJ suit argues that voter removals may have disproportionately affected minority communities and could have wrongfully removed eligible voters without adequate notice or due process less than 90 days before the presidential election. Both cases allege this violates the federal National Voter Registration Act. That act imposes a 90-day quiet period on systematic voter roll purges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People in immigrant communities are hard workers — many of them working seven days a week,” said Beatriz Amberman, chair of the Virginia Coalition of Latino Organizations.  “There was not enough time assigned to inform the community and to have them get time off from work to go to the registrar&#8217;s office.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amberman said the administration could have partnered with Virginia’s Latino and Asian advisory boards “to help get the word out” for people to check their statuses as soon as possible in order for there to be time to cure any paperwork mistakes. She also said the administration could have utilized its communications staff to host press conferences with public service announcements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If voter records need to be reviewed or updated, the review should be done well in advance. This would ensure that voters have enough time to correct any issues on their voter registrations,” she said. “Our government has more resources to do this right than the average citizen.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In defending his executive order, Youngkin has stressed to national media that it is based on precedent of a 2006 </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+sum+SB313" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">  — carried by a Republican who went on to work for former president Donald Trump, and signed by democratic then-Gov. Tim Kaine — and that the process is “individualized.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It starts with a basic premise that when someone walks into one of our DMV&#8217;s and self-identifies as a noncitizen, and then they end up on the voter rolls, either purposely or by accident, that we go through a process individualized, not systematic, an individualized process based on that person’s self-identification as a noncitizen, to give them 14 days to affirm they are a citizen and if they don’t, they come off the voter rolls,” Youngkin told Fox News’ Shannon Bream.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2006 law directs DMV to send monthly lists of people who failed to identify as citizens to the state Board of Elections to be further forwarded to local registrars. Youngkin’s Aug. 7 </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/eo/EO-35-Comprehensive-Election-Security-Ensuring-Legal-Voters-and-Accurate-Counting---vF---8.7.24.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executive order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> called for daily purges based on DMV data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares has filed opposition to the plaintiffs’ motion that </span><a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.561386/gov.uscourts.vaed.561386.92.0.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">supports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Youngkin’s individualized argument. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The filing focuses on the individual nature of self-reporting as a non-citizen, which suggests that factor evades the “systematic” qualifier in the National Voter Registration Act’s 90-day quiet period. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snow argues that daily purges reduce the opportunity to catch mistakes before initiating a purge and could point to a systematic rather than individualized handling of the process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We know there are voters who registered decades ago and have updated their driver’s license many times, and if they check a box incorrectly, now they’re subject for removal,” Snow said. “We believe that under normal circumstances (with) information submitted from DMV data, there may be some system in place, at least, that would catch this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The daily removals “are a big part” of the case, he added because it “allows zero opportunity for anyone at any step in the process to verify that the basis for removal is accurate.”</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce/For the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Five Waynesboro voters have filed a lawsuit to prevent the majority of the Waynesboro Board of Elections from following through on their controversial pledge to refuse certification of the November 2024 election results, a move they argue would violate Virginia state law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plaintiffs — Jennifer Lewis, Ann Criser-Shedd, Greg Fife, Chris Graham and Andrea Jackson — are seeking a court order to compel the election officials to certify the city’s votes.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://advancementproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024.10.21-Waynesboro-Complaint-File-Stamped.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, filed in Waynesboro Circuit Court on Oct. 21, comes after two GOP officials from Waynesboro  filed </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/15/waynesboro-gop-officials-sue-over-va-s-voting-system-threaten-to-block-election-certification/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">their own lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> challenging Virginia’s voting system ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election while threatening to not certify the results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In their complaint, Curtis Lilly, the chairman of the Waynesboro Electoral Board, and Scott Mares, the board’s vice chair, expressed their concerns over the reliability of electronic voting systems, which they argue are prone to inaccuracies. Instead, they demanded that all ballots be counted by hand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, state law does not currently require a mandatory hand-count unless irregularities are proven, and all paper ballots are required to be counted by optical scanning machines, which help speed up the counting process and reduce the risk of human error. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before each election, the scanners undergo rigorous testing using a predetermined sample of votes to ensure accurate tallying before any real votes are counted. Additionally, it is illegal to connect ballot scanning machines to the Internet at any point, further safeguarding the integrity of the voting process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of the scanners used in Virginia’s elections are certified to meet both state and federal standards and are handled under a strict chain of custody to ensure security and accuracy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In their counter-suit, the five Waynesboro voters ask the court to require the election officials to certify the election results unless they prevail in their own suit. The plaintiffs further argue that the election officials’ stance violates the Virginia Constitution, which mandates that election results be certified in accordance with established procedures, including the use of legally authorized voting equipment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The chairman and vice chairman should do their job; instead they are purposely misinterpreting what they are charged to do. I cast my vote and have every right to expect that it will be counted on Election Day,” said Lewis, one of the plaintiffs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackson, another plaintiff, said that voting in the 2024 election was “very important” to her. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am frustrated that the election officials are not doing what they take an oath to do, which is to make sure the election runs smoothly and every vote counts. Instead they are distracting us from our local elections by filing nonsensical court cases,” Jackson said. </span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Santia Nance and Gin Carter said they haven’t washed a single dish since their partners were released from prison. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As both loathe the household chore, Nance’s husband Quadaire Patterson and Carter’s husband Taj Mahon-Haft have been more than happy to take it on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Carter is in her fourth year of veterinarian school, Mahon-Haft said doing the dishes is just one more way to support her after she emotionally supported him through his incarceration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The couples were part of a multi-group effort to change state law expanding pathways for early release of  incarcerated people who meet certain criteria. They also made friends along the way as people were released this past July through expansions to Earned Sentence Credits — a way that people with good behavior and who participate in educational advancements can trim some of their prison sentences. Despite initial opposition to its expansions in 2022, Gov. Glenn Youngkin </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/16/earned-sentence-credit-expansions-new-parole-board-operations-to-take-effect-this-year/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">allowed its implementation this year.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid navigating these new chapters in their lives, some have petitioned for a chance to vote in this year’s elections. Several of them say they have little hope they will be able to. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Constitutionally disenfranchised</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/constitution/article2/section1/#:~:text=Virginia%20Law,-Constitution&amp;text=No%20person%20who%20has%20been,his%20competency%20has%20been%20reestablished." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s Constitution,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> people with felony convictions are all but permanently disenfranchised unless a governor pardons them or restores their rights. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell, along with former democratic Govs. Terry McAuliffe and Ralph Northam, had streamlined the process and eventually made people </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210408122644/https://www.restore.virginia.gov/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">automatically eligible for rights restoration if their sentence was complete</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Then Youngkin </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/surovell-spruill-ask-if-youngkin-has-changed-rights-restoration-process/article_dd1232ba-c4fb-11ed-8b57-3723c72fb438.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">quietly adjusted the process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, requiring individuals to submit petitions to regain their rights, resulting in lower </span><a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/local/virginia/virginians-whose-rights-have-been-restored-drops-in-second-year-of-youngkin-administration-reports-show/291-fbe59fc9-c488-4449-be3e-ad4c0ba1c374" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">restoration numbers </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">compared to previous administrations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exact criteria the governor considers when granting or rejecting applications remains unclear. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s chapter of the NAACP took Youngkin’s administration to court last year to get answers but </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/judge-finds-for-youngkin-administration-in-naacps-foia-case/article_210d11ec-9936-11ee-a87e-138606562546.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a judge ruled that most details are exempt from being shared </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">through a provision in the Freedom of Information Act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what was shared in the administration’s FOIA response indicated that people who have completed probation and paid any due fines might be more likely to get a “yes” from him. An applicant disclosed in the FOIA who was classified “ineligible at this time” was still on probation and paying fines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then-spokeswoman for the governor, Macaulay Porter, told media at the time that the administration had acted “in good faith” in disclosing the information that it did provide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, applicants aren’t fully aware of what exact criteria they’d need to meet in order to be restored. In interviews with The Mercury, formerly incarcerated people shared their lingering </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">questions about whether their rights will be restored — including if their offense type matters as a disqualifier, if probation and fines are indeed a component, or if their potential good standing and public service to their community might be a factor in their favor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some also wonder if the “individual basis” petition review system the administration has reiterated over the past year is actually happening.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Copy-and-paste rejections</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the partially-filled FOIA, a “reentry resource packet” people are given when they leave prison includes a paper informing them to apply for their rights to be restored. Though there’s no indication of the time it would take in that packet, other materials in the FOIA show it can take two to three months as various state agencies are involved in the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About three months after applying for restoration, Newport News resident Justin Brown received an email with a rejection letter addressed “Dear applicant,” which didn’t describe why he was rejected. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The message was part of a mass email response the Youngkin administration sent to several hundred people who had applied for rights restoration; all of their email addresses were visible to everyone who’d gotten the message. The applicants began to chat in the email thread, revealing a series of concerns and questions about their access to the ballot box.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe each and every one of us has a right to know why we were denied,” said one of the respondents. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several speculated they were denied because of this year’s high profile federal elections. Some posited that the process isn’t handled on an individual basis, since they were all mass emailed with the same generic rejection letter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some respondents noted that like the governor, they are Republicans too.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One such would-be Republican voter called it an “insult to injury” to not be able to vote while, as a former felon, he also struggles to find work that would put the medic training he gained during his military service to use. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Once I started talking with everyone else and seeing that this is a pattern of this administration, I wanted to raise some alarm bells,” Brown said in an interview with The Mercury. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He reached out to his state lawmaker, Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, who said she contacted the Secretary of the Commonwealth, Kelly Gee. Price told The Mercury that she had a conversation with Gee wherein the secretary apologized for the email error and stressed that while the alert to Brown and others had been done in mass, the restorations are handled on an individual basis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown said that he filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Justice (which is also </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/14/voter-purge-lawsuits-add-to-disenfranchisement-allegations-against-youngkin-administration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">currently suing Virginia over a purge of voter registrations too close to Election Day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). He hopes the DOJ could investigate the restoration process to ensure that it’s indeed being handled on a case-by-case basis, which the mass email put into question for him.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Unclear criteria</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several other people with felony records told The Mercury they don’t recall getting mail or emails about their rejections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mahon-Haft, who has applied twice, discovered his latest rejection through checking an online portal. He doesn’t know why he was rejected, but he is still on probation. Patterson, who is also still on probation, hasn’t applied yet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our constitution has this antiquated language for a governor to determine your destiny,” Patterson said. “We’ve finished our sentences, but there’s this extra sentence that carries on.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jared Rose, a Roanoke resident who works for a </span><a href="https://www.vacares.org/subcontractors--caas.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state-funded nonprofit organization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.roanokeva.gov/2677/Gun-Violence-Prevention-Commission" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">serves on the city’s Gun Violence Prevention Commission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wonders if his probation status might result in a rejection. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He hopes to become a peer recovery specialist to help people overcome substance abuse disorders and plans to start a nonprofit to pair formerly incarcerated people as mentors with at-risk youth. When he checked his restoration status on the portal, he said there was no information, despite applying earlier in the year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I did a crime. I broke the law, you know, this is what I’ve got to deal with,” Rose said. “But somewhere along the line, there’s just so much red tape.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Looking forward</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mahon-Haft can’t vote for lawmakers yet, but he will frequent Virginia’s Capitol in the next legislative session to support their work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He and Carter had previously co-founded an organization called The Humanization Project, an advocacy group that also participates in educational programming. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40495" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:200px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/23/these-virginians-wont-be-able-to-vote-next-month/tandg/" rel="attachment wp-att-40495"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-40495" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/TandG-200x300.jpeg" alt="" width="200" height="300" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/TandG-200x300.jpeg 200w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/TandG.jpeg 562w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Taj Mahon-Haft (left) and Gin Carter (right) on their wedding day in August 2024. Image courtesy Mahon-Haft.</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s easy to hate a conviction, but it’s not very easy to hate somebody when you know seven layers of them,” Mahon-Haft said. “You might have one thing you don&#8217;t agree with, but you can see them as a human being. When you see people as human beings, you have more humane policy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’s grateful that Youngkin reversed his course on the Earned Sentence Credit law, for example. When announcing </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/youngkin-announces-efforts-to-support-formerly-incarcerated-people/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">his own efforts to support formerly incarcerated people with re-entry </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">this summer, Youngkin indicated that reversal was more about being in alignment with the state’s Supreme Court — which had ruled in favor of a man whose incarceration had been extended despite his earned credits that should have allowed him earlier release. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Supreme Court this past year was very clear on the current sentence credits, and so we’re fully complying,” Youngkin said at the time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as Mahon-Haft and Carter’s relationship helped spark an organization, Nance co-founded </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sistas In Prison Reform with other women whose loved ones were or are still incarcerated. And while she and Patterson are still planning a wedding to celebrate their union, they went ahead and eloped earlier this month. Mahon-Haft and Carter wed over the summer in Southwest Virginia, with some of their recently-released friends also part of the celebration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The couples plan to continue public engagement around the lived experiences of incarcerated people and their families, as well as advocate for laws that help people better reintegrate into society after time spent in prison.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mahon-Haft also plans to keep applying for restoration until he gets a &#8220;yes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And if Democrats in Virginia’s state legislature get their wish, automatic restoration for completed sentences could be enshrined in the state’s constitution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To do so, a constitutional amendment will need to pass the state legislature two years in a row, with an election in the House of Delegates in between, before appearing on statewide ballots for everyone else to weigh in on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Democrats plan to kickstart that process next year, with the potential for it to appear on statewide ballots by 2026. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown, the Newport News resident, is already excited about the prospect and plans to visit Virginia’s Capitol to engage with lawmakers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until then and beyond, Mahon-Haft will continue to wash his wife’s dishes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At some point years ago, when he was still locked up, I had a pile of dishes in my sink, and I joked ‘You never pull your weight in this relationship — why don&#8217;t you ever do the dishes?’” Carter recalled. She remembered that Mahon-Haft told her if she stuck by him through the end of his sentence, he’d do her dishes the rest of her life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He&#8217;s made good on that so far!” she said. </span></p>

(Photo by Tierney L. Cross/Getty Images)</p><p>The U.S. Department of Labor released a list of artificial intelligence best practices for developers and employers this week, aiming to help employers benefit from potential time and cost savings of AI, while protecting workers from discrimination and job displacement.</p>
<p>The voluntary guidelines come about a year after President Joe Biden signed <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank">an executive order</a> to assess the innovative potential and risks of AI across government and private sectors. The order directed the creation of the White House AI Council, the creation of a framework for federal agencies to follow relating to privacy protection and a list of guidelines for securing AI talent, for navigating the effects on the labor market and for ensuring equity in AI use, among others.</p>
<p>“Harnessing AI for good and realizing its myriad benefits requires mitigating its substantial risks,” Biden said of the executive order last year. “This endeavor demands a society-wide effort that includes government, the private sector, academia and civil society.”</p>
<p>The DOL’s guide, “<a href="https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/general/ai/AI-Principles-Best-Practices.pdf" target="_blank">Artificial Intelligence and Worker Well-being: Principles and Best Practices for Developers and Employers</a>” was developed with input from public listening sessions and from workers, unions, researchers, academics, employers and developers. It aims to mitigate risks of discrimination, data breaches and job replacement by AI, while embracing possible innovation and production.</p>
<p>“Whether AI in the workplace creates harm for workers and deepens inequality or supports workers and unleashes expansive opportunity depends (in large part) on the decisions we make,” DOL Acting Secretary Julie Su said. “The stakes are high.”</p>
<p>The report shares eight principles and best practices, with a “north star” of centering workers. The guide says workers, especially from underserved communities, should understand and have input in the design, development, testing, training, use and oversight of the AI systems used in their workplaces. This will improve job quality and allow businesses to deliver on their outcomes. Unions should bargain in good faith on the use of AI and electronic monitoring in the workplace, it said.</p>
<p>Other best practices include ethically developing AI, with training that protects and takes feedback from workers. Organizations should also have a clear governance system to evaluate AI used in the workplace, and they should be transparent about the AI systems they’re using, the DOL said.</p>
<p>AI systems cannot violate or undermine workers’ rights to organize, or obstruct their health, safety, wage, anti-discrimination and anti-retaliation protections, the department said. Therefore, prior to deployment, employers should audit their AI systems for potential <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/ai-takes-helm-decision-making-signs-perpetuating-historic-biases-emerge" target="_blank">impacts of discrimination</a> on the basis of “race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability, age, genetic information and other protected bases,” and should make those results public.</p>
<p>The report also outlines how employers can and should help workers with AI. Before implementing an AI tool, employers should consider the impact it will have on job opportunities, and they should be clear about the specific tasks it will perform. Employers that experience productivity gains or increased profits, should consider sharing the benefits with their workers, like through increased wages, improved benefits or training, the DOL said.</p>
<p>The implementation of AI systems has the potential to displace workers, Su said in her summary. To mitigate this, employers should appropriately train their employees to use these systems, and reallocate workers who are displaced by AI to other jobs within their organization when feasible. Employers should reach out to state and local workforce programs for education and upskilling so their workforce can learn new skills, not be phased out by technology.</p>
<p>And lastly, employers using AI that collect workers’ data should safeguard that data, should not collect more data than is absolutely necessary and should not share that data outside the business without workers’ freely given consent.</p>
<p>The guidelines outlined by the DOL are not meant to be “a substitute for existing or future federal or state laws and regulations,” it said, rather a “guiding framework for businesses” that can be customized with feedback from their workers.</p>
<p>“We should think of AI as a potentially powerful technology for worker well-being, and we should harness our collective human talents to design and use AI with workers as its beneficiaries, not as obstacles to innovation,” Su said.</p>

Glenn Youngkin speaks to reporters outside the Capitol near the end of the 2024 General Assembly session. (Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s executive order to remove more than 6,000 Virginians from the voter rolls has come under intense national scrutiny after the Department of Justice (DOJ) </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/14/voter-purge-lawsuits-add-to-disenfranchisement-allegations-against-youngkin-administration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filed a lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> challenging its legality. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With just weeks until the Nov. 5 election, the suit has amplified concerns over voter disenfranchisement and the integrity of the state’s election process mirrored in other states leading up to the presidential contest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Fox News Sunday, Youngkin defended his move, arguing that it was based on a law signed in 2006 by then-Gov. Tim Kaine, a Democrat.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To be clear, this is not a purge,” he told host Shannon Bream. “To describe this as something that’s a purge is completely inaccurate, it’s wholly consistent with the U.S. Constitution, the Virginia Constitution and Virginia law.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, a federal judge in Alexandria </span><a href="https://www.wvtf.org/news/2024-10-21/federal-judge-orders-release-of-names-impacted-by-voter-rolls-purge" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ordered</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Virginia Department of Elections to disclose the names of individuals removed from the state’s voter rolls by the Youngkin administration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ruling came in response to </span><a href="https://www.lwv.org/newsroom/press-releases/lawsuit-challenges-recent-voter-roll-purges-virginia-preventing-eligible-us" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an earlier lawsuit </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">from the League of Women Voters and the Virginia Coalition of Immigrant Rights, which challenged Youngkin’s </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/eo/EO-35-Comprehensive-Election-Security-Ensuring-Legal-Voters-and-Accurate-Counting---vF---8.7.24.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Executive Order 35</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> signed in August, authorizing “daily” updates to Virginia’s voter rolls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These updates involved comparing the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles’ list of individuals identified as non-citizens to the list of registered voters. Local registrars were then required to notify voters whose citizenship status was challenged, informing them that their registration would be canceled unless they confirmed their citizenship within 14 days. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The governor’s response to the DOJ lawsuit</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The DOJ’s lawsuit argues that the voter removals disproportionately affected minority communities and may have wrongfully removed eligible voters without adequate notice or due process less than 90 days before a presidential election — placing Youngkin’s executive order at the center of a growing national debate about voting rights and election security. On Sunday, Youngkin sought to clarify how his administration handled the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It starts with a basic premise that when someone walks into one of our DMV’s and self-identifies as a noncitizen, and then they end up on the voter rolls, either purposely or by accident, that we go through a process individualized, not systematic, an individualized process based on that person&#8217;s self-identification as a noncitizen, to give them 14 days to affirm they are a citizen and if they don&#8217;t, they come off the voter rolls,” Youngkin told Fox News’ Shannon Bream.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, Youngkin also talked with CNN anchor Jake Tapper, who </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/14/politics/video/the-lead-immigration-misinformation-border-voter-registration-2024-jake-tapper" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pointed out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the issue with the executive order wasn’t the program itself but approving it within 90 days of the election — the so-called quiet period — which the DOJ suit argues is prohibited under federal law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why is it that anyone could argue that a process that removes non-citizens off of our voter rolls is anything other than common sense and constitutional?” Youngkin asked, adding that he was “frustrated” with the department’s decision to sue 25 days before the presidential election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They could have started it a long time ago, we would have sorted this out, because I firmly believe they are wrong. But this seems far more political than otherwise, simply because of the fact that this has been going on since 2006, according to law, and they chose 25 days before an election in Virginia in order to assert something which really is inconsistent with the process that we are doing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tapper’s interview with Youngkin further caused a stir because of their heated exchange over  </span><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4931778-donald-trump-national-guard-military-enemy-from-within/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent comments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that former President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, made about the U.S. military.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a Fox News appearance, Trump suggested deploying the National Guard or military on Election Day to prevent potential unrest, citing the threat of “the enemy from within,” which he described as “radical-left lunatics.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tapper asked Youngkin, “Is that something you support?” In response, the governor </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/15/politics/video/glenn-youngkin-jake-tapper-interview-trump-digvid" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shifted the focus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to border issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What former President Trump is referring to are the individuals crossing the border who are committing crimes, bringing drugs, trafficking humans, and turning every state into a border state.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin emphasized that, although Virginia is not a border state, it still feels the effects of “10 million people illegally crossing the border every single day.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tapper countered that while the problems at the border are real, that’s not what Trump was referring to. “He was talking about sick people, radical-left lunatics who should be handled by the National Guard or the military.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later on in that same speech, Trump said that one of “the lunatics” he addressed was U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Ca., Tapper added. “That’s who he was talking about using the National Guard and military against, radical-left lunatics, the enemy from within, people like Adam Schiff.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, Youngkin said he “can’t speak” for Trump. Instead, he said he believed the CNN anchor misinterpreted the former president’s rhetoric and was “misrepresenting his thoughts.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington, said that the legal fallout over Youngkin’s executive order and the subsequent debate in the national media  will likely benefit the governor’s desire to remain in the public discourse. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think Governor Youngkin is available to the national media because he wants to keep Republicans thinking about Glenn Youngkin. With the one consecutive term limit, Youngkin’s political fortunes may be improved with greater national media visibility.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the courts will ultimately rule on the governor’s actions, Youngkin’s continued participation in the national discourse is a win-win, according to Farnsworth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If he wins, it boosts his popularity with Republicans, and if he loses, he can still gain favor with the GOP base. The worst thing for a Virginia governor with national ambitions is to be ignored,” Farnsworth noted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a divided legislature likely to cause gridlock in the coming year and a gubernatorial election to pick Youngkin’s successor, Farnsworth added that, regardless of the presidential election outcome, there is “little downside in being combative” with the legislature.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Voter removal challenges elsewhere</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the fallout from the DOJ and League of Women Voters lawsuits continues, other states are also addressing concerns about voters being removed from rolls within the “quiet period.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A federal court order temporarily halted the Alabama Secretary of State’s “plan to ‘inactivate’ people the office suspected of not being U.S. citizens,” the Alabama Reflector </span><a href="https://alabamareflector.com/briefs/alabama-secretary-of-states-office-posts-news-release-required-by-court-order/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Oct. 21. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another legal battle may be on the horizon in Ohio. Several voting rights groups, led by the American Civil Liberties Union, on Oct. 3 </span><a href="https://www.acluohio.org/sites/default/files/oh_nvra_notice_letter_2024.10.03.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sent a letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, raising concerns about mass voter removals in several counties. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The groups argue that the removals did not comply with the requirements of the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) and have warned they are prepared to take legal action if corrective measures are not implemented within 20 days.</span></p>

(Courtesy of the Mehta and Wittman campaigns)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Longtime incumbent U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Westmoreland, has served the 1st Congressional District since 2007. But this year’s Democratic challenger, Leslie Mehta, might make him work harder to win. She thinks she can flip the seat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The thing with Rob Wittman is that he’s never had a real challenge,” said Chaz Nuttycombe, founder of the State Navigate and CNalysis political forecasting organizations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Wittman has had challengers each time he’s run to hold onto his seat representing Virginia’s 1st Congressional District, he’s typically </span><a href="https://historical.elections.virginia.gov/candidates/view/Robert-Joseph-Wittman" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">won re-election with large margins</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between himself and his usually-democratic challengers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a redrawing of the congressional maps in 2021 incorporated some Richmond-area suburbs into the district — which tend to lean Democrat — previous challenger Herb Jones lost by 13%. Wittman’s margins have typically ranged between 20 and nearly 50%. In 2018 — fresh off 2017&#8217;s &#8220;Blue Wave&#8221; in the state legislature — Democrat Lavangelene Aereka Williams lost by 10.5%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Whitman now faces Mehta, a lawyer and healthcare advocate, Nuttycombe suspects that margin could be further reduced to single-digits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can see Wittman having a single-digit reelection, which would be the first time that’s ever happened, because the district is getting bluer,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The district, which is anchored by Virginia’s peninsula and some coastal areas, also wraps around Richmond in Chesterfield and Henrico counties before sprawling south towards Petersburg. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And though CNalysis and the Virginia Public Access Project both rate it as leaning Republican, Mehta’s campaign might be making Wittman and Republicans work a little harder this year to keep him in Congress. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mehta — who received the endorsement of Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Prince William, early on in the election cycle and over Jones, who’d run again but lost to Metha in their primary — believes she might be able to win. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger is one of the </span><a href="https://www.thelugarcenter.org/ourwork-Bipartisan-Index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most bipartisan members</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Congress, and Mehta plans to legislate in that fashion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger, who is vying for the Democratic nomination for governor next year, backed Mehta after they had connected over a congressional effort to secure more medical research funding in an appropriations bill. The fight was personal for Mehta, whose oldest daughter suffered a rare genetic disorder before her death. Mehta has since gone on to be appointed by Republican Gov. Glenn Younkgin to serve on Virginia’s Rare Disease Council. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mehta’s goal of bipartisanship and her passion for healthcare policy is why she believes she can appeal to voters. Healthcare affordability and access are issues she said she hears from canvassing and campaign events around the district. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In some of the rural parts of the district it can take 45 minutes to get to a maternal ward, or the fact that some doctors and other health care providers are just not providing or don’t have enough availability for Medicaid and Medicare patients because the reimbursements are so low,” she said. “People have to find other care providers, or it might take a long time to get into their preferred health care provider — that’s not really access.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mehta has been supportive of Democratic legislation to help with healthcare affordability and access like the Affordable Care Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, but she said there is still “more work to do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In contrast, Wittman has supported repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, also dubbed &#8220;Obamacare.&#8221; Though he has </span><a href="https://wittman.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1188" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">not always supported his party’s proposals that could do so</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2022420" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">he has voted against</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Inflation Reduction Act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps another boon for her candidacy, Mehta suspects, is her promise to help codify abortion and other reproductive health protections into federal law. This contrasts with Wittman having voted to restrict federal funding for Planned Parenthood and having </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1011/cosponsors" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">co-sponsored a Life At Conception Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Congress. Mehta pointed to how the legislation had no mention of exceptions for abortions in instances where someone was a victim of rape or incest, their life was threatened by the pregnancy, or severe fetal anomalies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We know that (abortion access) is not just a concern for Democrats,” she said. “But there are lots of Republicans in the district who are very concerned about his extreme stance.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wittman’s campaign did not respond to interview requests. His congressional </span><a href="https://wittman.house.gov/issues/issue/?IssueID=128025" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mentions him being “pro-life,” and having a “role to protect the lives of the unborn,” without alluding to  the word “abortion.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a bipartisan fashion, some Republican-leaning states have protected access to the procedure in the years since federal protections were overturned. Democratic congressional candidates promise to restore federal protections, while many Republicans have backed off pushing for federal bans or limits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On other healthcare matters, Wittman’s </span><a href="https://robwittman.com/issues/#healthcare" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">campaign website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> underscores his past experience working in the Virginia Department of Health before going into politics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a hallmark of the Inflation Reduction Act has involved ongoing efforts to reduce prescription drug costs — a goal of Wittman’s — he defended opposing that particular legislation overall. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We cannot tax and spend our way out of inflation, which remains the top problem our nation is facing,” he wrote in a statement from 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite some </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/offices/us-representative-1/district/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">metrics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showing support for Wittman’s re-election, other factors point to efforts to shore up his support, just in case. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His fundraising from this year is double that of Mehta’s, and the Young Republican Federation of Virginia has included Wittman in a </span><a href="https://linktr.ee/yrfvdeployments2024" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">series of canvassing events</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this month that include Derrick Anderson, the Republican nominee in the 7th District, and Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, the incumbent in the 2nd District </span></p>
<p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/02/kiggans-and-smasal-face-off-in-highly-competitive-2nd-district/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiggans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/10/tight-race-in-virginias-7th-congressional-district-as-derrick-anderson-eugene-vindman-face-off/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are each running in more competitive congressional districts that could help determine which party will control the U.S. House of Representatives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfws7HDF-u1kQUZKKlAJ5hvexhz42xxQR9s_DpH78SNgRYHaA/viewform" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">canvas event for Wittman </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">will take place in Henrico County. Wrapping  around Richmond’s west, east and north sides, the locality has been trending bluer in recent years, </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/localities/henrico-county-va/election-results-map/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">backing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Democrat Terry McAuliffe for governor in 2021, and </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/henrico-chesterfield-boards-politics-republican-democratic-glenn-youngkin-blue-red-purple/article_d2abe3e6-84e2-11ee-9b7b-bbd3e10bce60.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats have gained majorities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the local government last year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nuttycombe, of CNalysis, also suspects a strong base will turn out for Vice President Kamala Harris in York County and will likely to also vote for Mehta. Still, a large portion of the district includes Virginia’s peninsula — an area with Democratic pockets but that is overall broadly Republican-leaning. </span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morgan Slaven runs a sheep farm in Augusta County, where her family has been across different operations for seven generations, now with her nieces pitching in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, Slaven was grateful because of her “off farm job” to generate income after drought conditions, presenting back to back years of challenges ahead of this year’s harvest season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What if I lost my job?” said Slaven, who works with Shenandoah Valley Electric Cooperative. “The only reason I have this place right now is because I have an off-the-farm income.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Record drought hit Virginia this past summer, impacting profits in the largest economic sector in the state, even though programs are available at the federal level to offset losses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, agriculture contributes about $82.3 billion annually to the </span><a href="https://www.vdacs.virginia.gov/markets-and-finance-agriculture-facts-and-figures.shtml" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">economy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with more than 381,800 jobs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But temperatures reaching 99 degrees twice at the end of June in the Lynchburg area, with no rain and strong winds, pinched farmers’ pockets putting an emphasis on assistance programs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have a lot of claims,” said Danielle Bappert, regional crop agent for Virginia Farm Bureau Crop Insurance</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Yeah, it’s definitely tough this year.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The drought </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality manages dry spells through the Drought Monitoring Task Force, a collection of other state agencies, which issued advisories that got put in place, expanded, lifted and put in place again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On June 24, the task force placed a warning, which indicated that “a significant drought is imminent,” impacting 12 counties, mainly in Northern Virginia and the Northern Shenandoah Valley. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less than a month later, the warning expanded to 60 counties.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40470" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:285px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=40470" rel="attachment wp-att-40470"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-40470 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/unnamed.gif" alt="" width="285" height="199" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A map of drought advisories in Virginia. (Courtesy of Department of Environmental Quality)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conditions persisted until tropical Storm </span><a href="https://www.weather.gov/akq/Aug082024_Debby" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Debby</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hit the area in early August with about 7-10 inches over a few days. The task force then lifted 76 of the drought warnings, and watches, which is a less severe advisory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But then in September, more severe warnings were issued  for the northern Shenandoah Valley. Following Hurricane Helene, which hit the region at the end of September, the task force moved the warnings to less severe watches. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to what is being seen on a planetary level, these trends were hamstrung by dry conditions at the start, said Weeden Cloe, manager of the office of water supply at the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were hoping that there would be a very wet winter, with significant recharge for the groundwater, but it wasn’t really enough to bring groundwater levels to a point where they were able to be normal for this year,” said Cloe. “They were almost operating right off the bat in a deficit. This year, they dropped down very fast. In the Shenandoah Valley, they really haven’t popped back up until now.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Dry conditions</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The drought this year hurt sheep farmers, and the corn and bean commodities Virginia is known for. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slaven, on her 68 acres, has about 55 ewes, or female sheep, for breeding that she fully rotates around her pastures every four to six weeks so they don’t nibble too far down on the grass where parasites are, and so the grass can recover.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40463" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=40463" rel="attachment wp-att-40463"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-40463 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4275-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4275-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4275-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4275-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4275-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4275-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4275-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Morgan Slaven&#8217;s farm in Augusta County. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, Slaven managed her father’s cattle and split the profits, which are supposed to be about 60 cents per pound the gain. The rate is supposed to be 2 pounds every day, but hers only gained about 15 pounds over 90 days. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, she went into a partnership with another farmer to take 40% of a hay crop to ensure feeding.  But she skipped the first, early season harvesting with hopes to take the second and third cuts. The drought caused those to never come, and she had to spend between $150 and $200 a week on feed at the store to make up for food.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It feels like why am I doing this, because the mortgage payment is still the same,” Slaven said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The effects of the dry spells can be felt with commodities, according to the United States Department of Agriculture National Ag Statistics, which said in </span><a href="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Statistics_by_State/Virginia/Publications/Current_News_Release/2024/OctCrop24_VA.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">October</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that corn yields were estimated to be 36.1 million bushels, down 38% from the 2023 level. Soybeans are forecast to be up 22% from last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whereas beans “idle” throughout the season, Robert Harper, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">grain marketing specialist at the Virginia Farm Bureau,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said that corn is “like a running back in the NFL, it’s explosive, it&#8217;s strong, and quick and fast.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40468" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=40468" rel="attachment wp-att-40468"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40468" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4334-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4334-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4334-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4334-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4334-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4334-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4334-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A corn field in Augusta County. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In June, the lack of moisture and the warm night time temperatures not getting below 85 degrees meant the corn never pollinated or “silked” to produce its ear.  When the rain came in July, the crop had already missed its chance to grow an ear, Harper said. Downpours came that did some damage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a half a crop at best, and it’s highly damaged,” said Harper. “It’s a year of extremes. It seems like we’re just getting these cyclical weather patterns, and we get stuck in them.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Programs for help</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assistance is there for the taking, but some may be reluctant to use it, and it may only allow farmers to break even.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to get help, the USDA issued </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a primary natural disaster designation for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">15 </span><a href="https://www.vdacs.virginia.gov/press-releases-240730-localities-eligible-usda-emergency-loans.shtml" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">counties</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which allows for emergency loans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slaven tapped into disaster assistance, because she was paying the expenses out of pocket for feed instead of relying on naturally growing grass.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People have a lot of pride, they don’t want to take donations, but it’s there, because your tax dollars are paying for it,” Slaven said. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40467" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=40467" rel="attachment wp-att-40467"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-40467 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4323-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4323-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4323-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4323-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4323-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4323-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4323-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Bales of hay in Augusta County. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is also farmers insurance, which is similar to a health policy by having farmers pay into it then get compensated by the government, Bappert said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A “vast majority,” of clients will be filing a claim this year, Bappert said, adding that insurance and meeting environmental standards is a prerequisite to become eligible for Emergency Relief Program payments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Michael Webert, R-Fauquier, a farmer who faced similar feed shortages for his livestock, which forced him to buy 100 bales at $50 a piece in July, said the insurance can help producers break even.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you do that correctly, you don’t lose money,” Webert said. “You don’t make money, but you don’t lose money.”</span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia lawmakers plan to introduce a “momnibus bill” in each chamber next year to help enhance maternal healthcare access, reduce mortality rates and address racial and unconscious bias. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A play on the term, “omnibus,” the forthcoming legislation will be able to address a series of factors that contribute to negative maternal health outcomes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Too many mothers, especially Black mothers, are facing preventable risk in childbirth,” said Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth. “We must invest in comprehensive maternal care that ensures every woman, regardless of race or income, receives the quality health care she deserves.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucas and House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, had assembled the Black Maternal Health Summit to bring together a coalition of lawmakers from various states, healthcare professionals and maternal healthcare advocates. After an initial gathering in the morning, people split off into breakout groups for roundtable discussions through the afternoon. Lawmakers from other states like Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas were present, who will also press for related policy in their home states. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“​​We’re facing this issue in 2024 because of a lack of implementing policy,” said Georgia state Senator Tonya Anderson. “The system was designed for failure, for a ‘superior’ and an ‘inferior’ class — we’re changing it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among Virginia’s omnibus packages will be an effort to require </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/virginia-black-maternal-health-carroll-foy-youngkin/article_4608fd84-d1ae-11ee-8379-138efdfc34c7.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unconscious bias training</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for nursing license renewals. The bipartisan bills cleared the state legislature earlier this year before </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/20/youngkin-vetoes-bills-on-contraception-access-skill-games-confederate-heritage-rollbacks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed them</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers say that more targeted training will be an important piece of the puzzle when it comes to preventable deaths or complications from childbirth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that Black women are </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/maternal-mortality/2021/maternal-mortality-rates-2021.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more likely to die </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">from pregnancy complications than white women. Studies have also shown that women of color are more likely to have negative health outcomes, in part, </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7384760" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">from racial bias by healthcare providers.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Being Black is not a risk factor — racism is,” Noelene Kimiko Jeffers, a certified nurse-midwife and professor at John Hopkins School of Nursing, said during a discussion panel earlier in the day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than the unconscious bias training, advocates and lawmakers view the omnibus package as another chance to revive other maternal health bills that either failed to advance last year or were vetoed by the governor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, House Majority Leader Charniele Herring’s bill to reestablish a maternal mortality data task force was </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/27/youngkin-to-reestablish-maternal-health-data-task-force-after-vetoing-bill-that-would-have-done-so/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed by Youngkin </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in May before he announced the formation of his own version of a force a month later.  Other maternal and fetal health-related bills were continued to next year and could become part of the omnibus package. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Youngkin has supported expanding </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/04/17/petersburg-maternal-hub-opening-reignites-discussion-over-commercial-doula-benefits/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">maternal health hubs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as part of targeted economic and public health initiatives in the Petersburg area, and this year he </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/youngkin-doulas-black-maternal-health-general-assembly/article_34a9f222-f379-11ee-8dc9-e36a8194fce6.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">signed a bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to require health insurance coverage for doulas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a panel at the start of the day, Birth in Color founder Kenda Sutton-El stressed how state legislatures can support community-based organizations. This is because existing organizations like hers — which provides doula care for clients and has a policy advocacy wing that engages the state legislature — already have built-in trust with different communities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certified nurse-midwife Nichole Wardlaw also noted how lawmakers can support this type of healthcare worker with access to hospitals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Help us get credentialed,” she said, as not every midwife has ease of access to clinics and hospitals around the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wardlaw explained how some patients that may have wanted a home birth find that they need to go to a hospital for an epidural to manage pain, but “I can’t always go with them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/17/virginias-state-budget-will-fund-ob-gyn-medical-residencies-amid-obstetrics-closures/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">closures of obstetrics units</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at hospitals in rural areas of the state, midwives and doulas have played a role in bolstering maternal healthcare and patient advocacy. Certified nurse-midwives — who specialize in pregnancy, childbirth and postpartum care — have helped fill gaps in areas where there are shortages of other healthcare professionals with these specialties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A survey commissioned by Virginai’s Department of Medical Services revealed this past summer that </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/state-survey-shows-barriers-to-prenatal-care-access-for-medicaid-patients/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">long enrollment periods</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for new Medicaid patients pushes them further into their pregnancies before they can get routine care and a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/18/virginias-rural-healthcare-committee-considers-unique-challenges-possible-solutions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rural health committee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been convening around the state to compile a list of legislative recommendations — to include maternal healthcare issues — ahead of next year’s General Assembly session. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On what’s to come from Friday’s summit, Del. Candi Mundon King, D-Prince William, said some of the bills lawmakers want to reintroduce will come back as standalones or in the omnibus package, and that more policy will stem from coordination and brainstorming across states. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are working across the South with different legislators to look at bills to go even further than we have,” she said.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin speaks to reporters outside the Capitol near the end of the 2024 General Assembly session. (Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By now, you probably know who will get your vote for mayor, for your congressional seat, for the U.S. Senate and for president. But do you know whether you’re still an eligible voter?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will you arrive at your neighborhood precinct on Nov. 5 and discover that you have been excised from the registered voter rolls weeks before election day without notice and with limited recourse?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voting used to be one of the easiest and most essential privileges we exercise as Americans. As it should be. But nothing in electoral politics is as simple or easy as it used to be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Americans once could take for granted now requires more vigilance and self-education by the voter and more work than ever by election officials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Voter ID laws in the commonwealth have swung like a pendulum over the last decade,” said Nikki Sheridan, who was a top official overseeing Virginia elections under Republican former Gov. Bob McDonnell. “Responsible administrations spent significant amounts of time and money for outreach and education about voter identification legislative changes, and citizens are saturated — with messages that swing as wildly and frequently as the law changed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This fall, in the stretch run of the bitterly contested election, there’s a new wrinkle: Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s 11th-hour order to have elections officials scour Virginia’s voter rolls hunting for noncitizens, an action that the U.S. Department of Justice filed a</span> <a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/media/1373371/dl" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Oct. 14 to halt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Voter Registration Act forbids removing voters within 90 days of federal elections, a time known as the “</span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-virginia-violating-federal-laws-prohibition-systematic-efforts" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quiet Period</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” Youngkin issued</span> <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/eo/EO-35-Comprehensive-Election-Security-Ensuring-Legal-Voters-and-Accurate-Counting---vF---8.7.24.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Executive Order 35</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> commencing the process on Aug. 7, exactly 90 days before the election.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s order, in large part, restates ongoing and uncontroversial best practices and statutory requirements for safeguarding the security of ballots and those casting them. That includes the universal use of paper ballots to provide a lasting record of a voter’s intent, a strict chain of custody of early ballots and ensuring that computerized counting machines are not linked to the internet to avoid the possibility of remote hacking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then the order directs extraordinary efforts to bar noncitizens from voting, a step an ambitious Republican politico like Youngkin would take as a matter of course to stoke a favored paranoia among his party’s base.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor has boasted of removing 6,303 people from Virginia’s voter rolls since he took office. On its face, that’s a good thing. Cleansing the voter rolls of noncitizens is required by a 2006 state law signed by then-Gov. Tim Kaine, a Democrat. Evidently, the law works.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/10/09/youngkin-noncitizen-voters-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Washington Post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, no noncitizen has attempted to vote in Virginia since Youngkin became governor. The Post also reports that only three people have been prosecuted in the commonwealth for illegal voting of any kind from January of 2022 through July of this year. That’s hardly massive election fraud.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enforcing laws that reserve voting in U.S. elections exclusively to U.S. citizens has been a year-round pursuit, according to Chris Piper, who was Virginia’s commissioner of elections from 2018 to 2022 and is now executive director of the Virginia Public Access Project, a nonprofit and nonpartisan data source about state politics and government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia was among the states whose election legislation required Justice Department preclearance under the</span> <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/voting-rights-act" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voting Rights Act of 1965</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> until 2013 when it was ended by a</span> <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/court-cases/shelby-county-v-holder" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Supreme Court decision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Congress passed the law during the Civil Rights Era to prevent state and local governments, mostly in the South, from erecting barriers to Black Americans’ right to vote. Piper said the Justice Department approved Virginia’s 2006 statute with the unwritten understanding that it would not apply during the Quiet Period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s order echoes the persistent drumbeat of former President and Republican nominee Donald Trump’s pre-emptive and baseless election fraud assertions. They’re rooted in his</span> <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/big-lie-trump-stolen-election-inside-creation" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big Lie</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and subsequent legal challenges based on it that got bounced out of courthouse after courthouse —</span><a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jan/08/joe-biden/joe-biden-right-more-60-trumps-election-lawsuits-l/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">63 in all</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — following his re-election defeat four years ago. But it remains a battle cry among Trump’s deluded disciples.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most vexing consequence of Youngkin’s order, which its critics call a “purge,” is that it’s much more likely to harm legitimate voters, regardless of party, through paperwork errors and bureaucratic snafus than it is to block illicit interlopers from voting. All it takes is for a bona fide citizen to fail to check the right box on a Department of Motor Vehicles form to trigger their removal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once that error is in the system, as Markus Schmidt and Charlotte Renee Woods of The</span> <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/14/voter-purge-lawsuits-add-to-disenfranchisement-allegations-against-youngkin-administration/?emci=5a2745fb-738a-ef11-8474-6045bda8aae9&amp;emdi=a352fb9f-e48a-ef11-8473-0022483029fa&amp;ceid=338091"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mercury reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there is no obligation by either the State Department of Elections or local elections officers to vet and validate the information before a voter’s registration is terminated. Often, a voter isn’t aware of it until she or he tries to cast a ballot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By then, the remedy is to re-register (which, thankfully, is possible up to Election Day) and cast a</span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/casting-a-ballot/in-person-voting/#provisional-ballot" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">provisional ballot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that is subject to scrutiny and perhaps a challenge after the polls close, said Piper and Sheridan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond that, Sheridan noted, is the increasingly rancorous process of counting (and sometimes </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">re</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">counting) the results. What used to be a dispassionate mathematical exercise  has become snarled in partisan gamesmanship and bizarre conspiracy fantasies, a product of Trump’s toxic and unrelenting election denialism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Prince William County, for instance, a prosecution led by Virginia’s GOP-led attorney general’s office against the county registrar over alleged 2020 election improprieties disintegrated once it reached local courts and was dismissed. Yesterday, the former registrar, a professional election administrator named Michele White,</span> <a href="https://protectdemocracy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sued Attorney General Jason Miyares</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and others in his office in U.S. District Court alleging malicious prosecution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A major shift apparent to me is a lack of civility, often accompanied by an operating assumption that our election officials lack integrity or credibility,” said Sheridan, now a fulltime mom to 5-year-old twins and a volunteer for civic causes in Fluvanna County. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Numerous recent recounts affirm that election results in Virginia are accurate and rarely change the outcome of an election. Infrequent mistakes are human, and allowances must be made. A new registrar, or a seasoned registrar adjusting to a legislative change, is neither a conspiracy participant nor the devil,” Sheridan said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To illustrate her point, she contrasted two recounts in which she was involved, both in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District. One, in 2008, affirmed Democrat Tom Perriello’s thin general election victory over Republican incumbent Virgil Goode. The other was this June’s vicious GOP primary battle in which Trump-supported challenger John McGuire ousted House Freedom Caucus leader Bob Good by 366 votes out of 62,802 cast.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an observer in the 2008 recount, Sheridan eventually struck up a friendship with a Democrat who was part of Perriello’s team, she said. In this summer’s recount, she was the target of withering vituperation from fellow Republicans that included a cyberbullying effort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is unfortunate, but I observed the process primarily to defend it mightily against those who may deny the outcome because they do not like it,” she said. “That is not how electoral democracy works.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even so, Virginia elections are clean, fair and secure. </span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/registration/view-your-info/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check your registration status</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before you head to your polling place.

But whatever you do, exercise your right as a citizen: vote.</span></p>

John McGuire, R-Goochland, and Democrat Gloria Witt at the 5th Congressional District candidates debate at Hampden-Sydney College in Farmville on Oct. 17, 2024. (Courtesy of ABC13/WSET) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Gloria Witt and her Republican opponent, state Sen. John McGuire, faced off in a respectful but spirited debate Thursday for the first and only time, offering sharply contrasting visions for Virginia’s 5th Congressional District as the race enters its final stretch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 45-minute discussion, hosted by WSET Lynchburg at Hampden-Sydney College in Farmville, provided a stark contrast between both candidates as they sparred over topics like immigration, education, foreign policy, political polarization and their faith in the electoral system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With just 18 days until the Nov. 5 election, McGuire defended his presence at the Stop the Steal rally at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, as his constitutional right. On that day, a group of rioters stormed the Capitol in an attempt to halt the certification of the election that Republican Donald Trump lost to Democrat Joe Biden. At least </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/donald-trump-says-absolutely-pardon-jan-6-rioters-rcna164565" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">140 police officers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were injured in the violent event and over 1,400 people have been criminally charged in connection to it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s nothing wrong with that,” McGuire said of his right to protest. “The Democrats have weaponized that for political purposes, and it&#8217;s just a terrible thing about the division in our country.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire also did not provide a clear response to the question by moderator Richard Pantele if he would accept the outcome of the presidential contest between Vice President Kamala Harris and Trump.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let’s see what the elections are, and if it’s fair, it’s fair, and I’ll totally support that,” McGuire said, after defending Trump’s attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election, which  Biden won by more than seven million votes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Over the years, even people remember Hillary Clinton challenged her election,” he said of the former Democratic presidential nominee, who conceded to Trump one day after losing the 2016 election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is nothing wrong with challenging irregularities until you are satisfied. And you think about this, we had this pandemic, some people called it the ‘Plandemic,’” McGuire said — referring to a trilogy of conspiracy theory films that promoted misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic — earning him groans from the audience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Under the guise of the ‘Plandemic’ or the pandemic, they came up with election season in Virginia, not Election Day, but 45 days,” McGuire said, an apparent reference to the state’s early voting period. “In one state, California, they said, if you want to have a voter ID, you should be arrested for that. So they changed the rules and if they were only for the pandemic, then after the pandemic, they should change it back, and they didn’t.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire, a former U.S. Navy SEAL and state delegate from Goochland County who announced his congressional bid just one week after being elected to represent the 10th state Senate District last year, faced his own election challenge after the June 18 GOP primary, in which he defeated U.S. Rep. Bob Good, R-Farmville, by a razor-thin 0.6% margin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the election, Good asked for a recount, which eventually confirmed that McGuire had won the nomination contest by 366 votes out of more than 62,000 cast. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But internal divisions remained after some of the district’s conservative hardliners refused to accept McGuire as their nominee, vowing to instead write in Good on Nov. 5. The divide has led to fractures among local Republicans, with concerns that internal disagreements could weaken party unity ahead of the general election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Witt, who for the first time </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/16/democrat-gloria-witt-surpasses-5th-district-gop-rival-john-mcguire-in-latest-fundraising/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has outraised</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> her opponent during the third quarter according to the latest fundraising data, has seized on the district GOP’s intra-party feud. At Thursday’s debate, she made the Nov. 5 election a referendum on the preservation of democracy and individual liberties. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most of the GOP still cannot accept the fact that Donald Trump lost the election,” Witt said. “We’re at a serious point, so when you go to vote, it&#8217;s not about Republicans and Democrats and independents. It’s a test of your belief in the Constitution.  We are fighting for the Constitution of America.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Witt secured the Democratic nomination in the June 18 primary after defeating two opponents: Gary Terry, a Kentucky native and West Point graduate, and Paul Riley, a U.S. Army veteran and intelligence analyst.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since announcing her candidacy in the spring, she has been crisscrossing the district that spans 11,000-square-miles and encompasses the majority of Southside, including Danville, and the cities of Charlottesville and Lynchburg. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve used this campaign to let folks know I’m a country girl,” Witt said. “I grew up without running water, we processed all our meats, we grew all our vegetables, we preserved them, pretty much lived off the land. You all would think of it as being organic right now, but we call it living. My values are faith, family, justice and community.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the debate, Witt positioned herself as a voice for change, accusing McGuire of being out of touch with the needs of everyday people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you care about having affordable healthcare, social security, affordable childcare, you want to think about voting for me,” Witt said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I want to be your voice in Congress because I am District 5, because I understand corporate and business, and I understand rural America. So I want you to leave here thinking because this is the pivotal election, this is not about Democrats and Republicans. We’re testing our belief in the Constitution and our rights and freedoms.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The candidates shared contrasting views on immigration and foreign policy. McGuire promoted Trump’s plan to deport all undocumented immigrants while building a wall at the southern border instead of funding Ukraine’s defense against Russia’s invasion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m not sure what the best solution is, but I do know that four years ago we didn’t have the problems in Ethiopia, Ukraine and Israel,” McGuire said. “These things were not going on, and statistics just came out that </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/investigations/13000-immigrants-convicted-homicide-living-freely-us-ice-data-rcna173125" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">13 to 15,000 murderers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had been released into our country with this open border. It’s crazy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Witt countered that Republicans have used immigration as a “political pawn” by rejecting the bipartisan Secure the Border Act of 2023, which would have allocated more resources for border protection and the construction of a wall. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For me, it&#8217;s about fixing the problem with resources, with technology; you evaluate, you assess, and you get (the immigrants) working so that they can be tax-paying people for those who qualify when it comes to the asylum question,” Witt said. “Let’s get them in and process them quickly and get them out if they don’t qualify.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most contentious moments of the debate came when Pantele, the moderator, asked both candidates about their views on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), which is a policy framework for promoting fairness and full participation for all people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I support equity as a goal,” Witt said. “You know, we got to where we are as a people, African American people of color, because of civil rights and the efforts to create equality after starting from a handicap of enslavement. Without diversity, equity and inclusion you end up with our power broker in charge.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire said that while he believed in equal opportunity for all Americans, he does not agree with an equal outcome. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m against that, it should be meritocracy,” McGuire said, calling DEI a “marxist idea.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If a plane goes down in the jungle and there’s one direction you go to save your whole team, do you want someone who’s never been in the jungle or do you want a Navy SEAL who is an expert on survival to keep the team alive? It should be based on merit and I don’t care if you’re pink or blue.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But both candidates found some common ground when they vowed to work with their colleagues from across the aisle, if elected. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would want to work bipartisan to move the country forward, it’s one of the reasons I decided to run for this role,” Witt said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire touted his record of passing bipartisan legislation in both the Virginia House of Delegates and the state Senate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If we treat each other with respect and work as a team, we can turn a no into a yes, we can turn the impossible to a possible,” he said. </span></p>

Find more details on the decision <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/30/u-s-supreme-court-grants-stay-in-challenge-to-youngkins-voter-purge-order-allowing-removal-of-thousands-from-rolls/">here</a>, and read below to find out how you can still vote if you were wrongly removed from Virginia voter rolls.</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though state law allows people who didn’t indicate citizenship status when filling out forms at the Department of Motor Vehicles to be removed from voter rolls, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/14/voter-purge-lawsuits-add-to-disenfranchisement-allegations-against-youngkin-administration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two lawsuits have alleged that Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration is violating federal law </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">by continuing removals within 90 days of Election Day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For anyone who became a citizen since their last DMV visit, or who suspects they made an error filing out their paperwork that would have booted them from voter lists, there are still ways to cast a ballot in next month’s elections. </span></p>
<p>Registrars and election workers won&#8217;t turn eligible voters away from polls if they wish to utilize same-day registration or a provisional ballot, according to Henrico County Registrar Mark Coakley.</p>
<p>“So if they were canceled or not registered, provisional ballots are a fail-safe method.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provisional ballots, most often used in same-day voter registration, are also used when people run into paperwork or registration issues that might need to be resolved. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a provisional ballot, voters will still need to follow up with their local registrar office to provide additional documents that can help verify their identity or other facts, like if they are residents of Virginia and the city or county they voted in, and whether they are U.S. citizens or have had their voting rights restored after a previous felony conviction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can research to make sure they are citizens or became citizens or had their rights restored,” Coakley explained. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coakley said that when using a provisional ballot, voters are also given instructions to help with the follow-up procedures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They&#8217;ll get a letter attached to their provisional ballot, giving them all the information of ‘This is the reason why (you may have this ballot)’ and ‘Here&#8217;s the ways to get hold of us to present evidence if you choose to do so,’” he said.  </span></p>
<p>Chesterfield County Registrar Missy Vera stressed that same-day registration can happen at any early voting location as well as on Election Day, which is Nov. 5.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coakley also suggested that anyone who might be concerned they could have been mistakenly caught up in the recent voter roll purges check Virginia Department of Elections’ </span><a href="https://vote.elections.virginia.gov/VoterInformation" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online citizen portal </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to see their voter status. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrea Gaines, a communications manager at the Department of Elections, also said that people “can always reach out to their local registrar if they have questions about their registration status.”</span></p>
<p>Vera, from Chesterfield County, concurred.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyone may call our office to inquire about their registration or inquire as to their options,&#8221; Vera said. &#8220;We are happy to help.&#8221;</p>

John McGuire. (Photos courtesy of respective congressional campaigns) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a significant fundraising boost, Democrat Gloria Witt for the first time has outpaced her Republican opponent, state Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland, in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District, with only weeks until the Nov. 5 election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Witt’s campaign reported having pulled in $218,627 in the third quarter ending Sept. 30, as opposed to McGuire, who raised $198,577 during the same time, according to the latest finance disclosure data released by the Federal Elections Commission Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In total, Witt has raised $276,755 since launching her campaign in March. McGuire, who was engulfed in a vicious primary battle with U.S. Rep. Bob Good, R-Farmville, for much of the year, has raised $1.15 million during this election cycle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But after McGuire’s expensive recount following the June 18 primary, where he narrowly defeated Good by just 366 votes out of 62,792 cast, his campaign funds have dwindled to $121,562. For the first time, Witt has surpassed him, reporting $163,905 in cash on hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic Party of Virginia Chairwoman Susan Swecker said in a statement Wednesday that while “Republicans are in disarray” in the 5th District, Witt is “laser-focused on running a winning” campaign. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Her impressive surge in fundraising is proof that Virginians in the 5th District know that she will stand up for them. There’s a reason John McGuire isn’t raising money — he still doesn’t have the support of his own party.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokesman for McGuire’s campaign did not respond to a text message seeking comment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fifth District Republicans have been grappling with </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/30/four-top-5th-district-gop-officials-ousted-for-not-supporting-mcguire/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">internal divisions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as infighting intensifies ahead of the upcoming election. The close primary race, followed by the recount in August, has deepened rifts within the party, with factions backing either McGuire or Good’s hardline conservative platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These internal struggles have raised concerns about the GOP&#8217;s ability to present a united front against Witt, leading to anxiety among some party insiders that the lingering tensions could weaken McGuire’s campaign and give Democrats an opening in a district which Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, won with 53% of the votes in 2016 and 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg, said that Democrats have been raising “a lot of cash” statewide during the 2024 election cycle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Witt seems to have benefitted from this, possibly also the fact that her odds, although long, seem better in the 5th than Karen Baker’s do in the 9th District,” Richards said, referring to the Democratic nominee who is </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/27/in-the-fightin-ninth-baker-seeks-to-end-griffiths-13-year-tenure/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seeking to unseat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, who has represented the district since 2011.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lack of national money being directed at McGuire “is not surprising,” since the 5th District is seen as a safe GOP seat, Richards added. “But if the GOP is fractured enough in the 5th, Witt may squeak in. I’m still not betting rent money she does win, but her odds are better than before.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite running a strong ground game in the neighboring 9th District, Baker has been struggling to catch up to the Republican incumbent in the money race. According to the latest FEC filings, she  raised $93,503 in the third quarter, and a total of $174,419 during this election cycle, with just $78,727 cash on hand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griffith, however, raised $164,299 between July and September, bringing in a total of $907,204, mostly from corporate donors. His campaign currently has $559,895 cash on hand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats, however, have kept their cash advantage in other competitive House districts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/10/tight-race-in-virginias-7th-congressional-district-as-derrick-anderson-eugene-vindman-face-off/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">7th District</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Democrat Eugene Vindman has significantly out-raised Republican Derrick Anderson during the third quarter, bringing in $6.4 million compared to Anderson&#8217;s $781,321. Overall, Vindman has raised $13.8 million for his campaign and holds nearly $3 million in cash on hand, while Anderson has raised a total of $1.9 million, with just over $1 million in cash reserves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And in the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/30/northern-virginias-10th-congressional-district-race-pits-clancy-against-subramanyam/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">10th District</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, state Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, out-raised Republican nominee Mike Clancy between July and September, bringing in $1.1 million compared to Clancy&#8217;s $205,219. Subramanyam has raised a total of $2.4 million for his congressional campaign, with $674,396 in cash on hand. Clancy, meanwhile, has raised $793,748 this election cycle and holds $563,699 in cash reserves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/07/kaine-faces-off-against-gop-challenger-cao-in-high-stakes-u-s-senate-race/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia&#8217;s U.S. Senate election</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Republican nominee Hung Cao out-raised incumbent democratic U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine in the third quarter with $3.3 million compared to Kaine’s $3 million, despite trailing the senator </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/harris-kaine-ahead-in-virginia-by-comfortable-margins-new-poll-says/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">by double digits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the polls. However, Kaine still leads in overall fundraising, with a total of $13.1 million raised this election cycle and more than $7 million cash on hand. In contrast, Cao has raised $6.2 million in total, with $2.2 million available.</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce for the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two GOP officials from Waynesboro have filed a lawsuit challenging Virginia&#8217;s voting system ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election while threatening to not certify the results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In their complaint, Curtis Lilly, the chairman of the Waynesboro Electoral Board, and Scott Mares, the board’s vice chair, are raising concerns about the validity of future results while echoing unmerited claims that the 2020 election, in which Democrat Joe Biden defeated then-President Donald Trump with more than 7 million votes, was stolen.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Filed on Oct. 4 at the Waynesboro Circuit Court against Virginia Department of Elections Commissioner Susan Beals and State Board of Elections Chairman John O’Bannon, the suit alleges that the voting machines used in the state are unverifiable and could potentially be manipulated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plaintiffs further claim the machines may be connected to the internet, allowing for external tampering, though this is illegal under state law and no evidence has been provided to support this allegation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When reached by phone Tuesday, Lilly declined to be interviewed for this story. Mares did not respond to several calls seeking comment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lilly and Mares argue that under the current legal regime, local electoral board members are unable to personally review and verify that the voting machine program being used to count the ballots “is keeping and recording a true and accurate count,” and that the device’s record tape accurately represents the ballots cast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Consequently, the plaintiffs believe that the voting machine is counting the votes in secret, because neither the program counting the votes recorded on the ballots nor the ballots themselves can be examined,” the complaint says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lilly further stated in an affidavit attached to the complaint that he “cannot ensure that the machines do not connect to the internet, allowing for vote counting algorithm manipulation, nor can I ensure with any certainty that the electronic ballot scanners are presenting results which are consistent with the contents of the ballot box.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Henry Chambers, a professor for constitutional law at the University of Richmond School of Law, said in a phone interview Tuesday that the lawsuit appears to be based on long debunked conspiracy theories circulating after the 2020 presidential election that claimed vote counting machines had been programmed to get votes wrong and to flip votes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s not really a serious thing, but some people have bought into it and it sounds like these folks have bought into it, too,” Chambers said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Their notion is that vote counting that is done by a machine is done in secret, and therefore you have to hand-count the votes, presumably in public, in order to have a real tally of the actual vote count,” Chamber continued. “That would suggest that voting that is not done by hand and in public qualifies as counting in secret, which in theory would violate the state Constitution.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, voters cast paper ballots, which are then counted by optical scanning machines — as required </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title24.2/chapter6/section24.2-626/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">by state law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — to expedite the process and avoid human error. Ballot scanning machines are certified to meet both state and federal standards and are maintained under a controlled chain of custody.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before every election, the scanners are tested using a predetermined sample of votes to ensure they are tallied accurately before any actual votes are cast, and it is against the law to connect a ballot scanning machine to the Internet at any point. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals, who was appointed as Virginia’s top elections official in March 2022, did not respond to text messages seeking comment Tuesday, and a spokeswoman for the Department of the Elections said in an email that the department does not comment on pending litigation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/08/08/virginias-top-elections-official-says-shes-confident-about-the-accuracy-of-results/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in July, Beals said that hacking the scanning machines was impossible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Period. They cannot be,” she said, adding that after the testing of the devices ahead of the election and on Election Day, officials also conduct risk-eliminating audits, which she called the back-end check.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So we have three different checks throughout the system just to make sure that the machines are reporting accurately.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chambers, the UR professor, called the plaintiffs’ argument that the machine counting of ballots happened in secrecy “an odd thing,” because the machine itself is doing the counting in a public space, supervised by election officials. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The problem with counting being done in public is that one can’t necessarily explicitly see what’s going on. But the fact is, we have lots of things that count things and we just agree that it’s being counted correctly, like ATM machines,” Chambers said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No one would say that the ATM machine is spitting out money in secret, but it’s spitting out money in response to a request. Here, a voting machine is counting votes in response to a ballot being fed through a machine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By asking for ballots to be hand-counted instead of being tabulated by machines, the plaintiffs could really be asking for a slow-down of the count, Chambers added, which “can introduce additional problems with a valid count — and that is the whole point of feeding the ballots through during the day and having a continuous count is so that you can have results in a reasonable and fair time. Hand counting is used only when necessary when you&#8217;re talking about things like absentee ballots or ballots that can’t be read by the machine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also remains unclear why the GOP election officials who filed the suit would threaten to not certify the presidential election, in a county that leans Republican and where Trump won with 51-46% in 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rich Anderson, the chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia, underscored that the lawsuit was a lone effort by a small group of GOP officials from one locality. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As far as I know it’s only happening in this one jurisdiction out of 133, but it’s all going to get settled in the courts anyway,” Anderson said in a phone interview. “What they’re asking is the court to render its opinion, which it will do, and the opinion will likely be on the side of Virginia law, which says that ballots are counted through the optical scanners, not by hand.”</span></p>

Enrollment in the program has more than doubled since Medicaid expansion, leading to rising demand for mental health services. (Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 35,000 Virginians are still waiting to find out if they remain eligible for Medicaid, as Virginia’s Department of Medical Services projects it will use its $95 million reserve fund to cover delayed payments for fiscal year 2025, according to a presentation agency leaders made to the state Senate Finance Committee Tuesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This also means that until it’s sorted out, the state is paying capitation fees, fixed amounts of money to healthcare providers, in order to cover healthcare for those patients. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medicaid is a state and federal program that provides insurance coverage to low-income people or people with disabilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pending redeterminations are part of ongoing national efforts to sort out who should stay on Medicaid and who is no longer eligible. Typically eligibility determinations are made annually, but they’d been on pause nationwide amid the pandemic due to federal policy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s changed over the past year in what’s colloquially referred to as “Medicaid Unwinding,” as provisions of federal law have expired. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A top reason for unenrolling people from Medicaid is that they no longer meet the financial requirements to be eligible — such as income at or below 80% of federal poverty levels. While the ineligibility data could signal higher incomes, which can be a good thing for people, policy analysts at The Commonwealth Institute cautioned over the summer that this is not always the case when it comes to health insurance coverage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, someone could hold a combination of part time jobs that contribute to their overall income — which wouldn’t entail employer-sponsored insurance.  Others might have a temporary spike in income through seasonal work that kicks them off eligibility for Medicaid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, more than 2 million Virginians have been redetermined, according to DMAS director Cheryl Roberts, and over the next year the remaining 35,000 people will be sorted out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process is not always swift, said DMAS chief financial officer Chris Gordon.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the Tuesday</span><a href="https://sfac.virginia.gov/pdf/committee_meeting_presentations/2024%20Interim/October/No5_DMAS_MedicaidYE_101524.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> presentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, he told members of the Virginia Senate Finance Committee that “some of those folks are easier to be redetermined and decide if they qualify to remain on Medicaid” but that other demographics take more time, such as people in nursing facilities or who are in home-care. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Those people take longer because it&#8217;s a paper application,” he said. “It&#8217;s 14 pages, and we have to determine if their assets and resources allow them to continue to be members in our Medicaid population.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that the Centers For Medicaid and Medicare Services have indicated the unwinding process should be completed by the end of next year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though total enrollment trended higher than DMAS had forecast for much of the year, it is now lower, totaling 1.97 million people as of Oct. 1.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DMAS receives quarterly pharmacy rebates from drug manufacturers to offset the overall cost of prescription drugs in the Medicaid program. DMAS then returns those rebates to federal and state-share accounts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, Gordon said, after the previous fiscal year closed and DMAS received details from Virginia’s pharmacy benefit manager, “we learned that $41 million out of the $60 million we applied in the state actually should have been applied — instead of being dropped into the state general fund — should have been applied to the coverage assessment fund.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said that meant DMAS didn’t have enough money at the end of the fiscal year to resolve it in that year, which ended June 30.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We only ended with $22 million in state general funds, at the lowest this agency has ever had in state general funds ever in the history of this agency,” Gordon said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said that DMAS needs to correct overpayment to the general fund and underpayment to coverage assessment and federal accounts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The department may also have some funding aid from $88.5 million earmarked specifically as a “Medicaid Contingency,” </span><a href="https://www.finance.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/secretary-of-finance/pdf/Aug-JMC-w-appendix-08.14.FINAL.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to a presentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to both the Senate and House finance committees this past August. The overall presentation reviewed 2024’s fiscal year revenues and the financial condition of the state. Gov. Glenn Youngkin has until mid-December to present any amendments to the 2024-2026 budget to both committees. </span></p>

Thanks to the Electoral College, that has happened <a href="https://history.house.gov/Institution/Electoral-College/Electoral-College/" target="_blank">five times</a> in the country’s history. The most recent examples are from 2000, when Al Gore won the popular vote but George W.

<p>The Founding Fathers <a href="https://theconversation.com/who-invented-the-electoral-college-147083" target="_blank">did not invent</a> the idea of an electoral college. Rather, they <a href="https://www.archives.gov/boston/featured-documents/kennedy-1960.html" target="_blank">borrowed the concept from Europe</a>, where it had been used to pick emperors for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>As a <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vXXZBEkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao" target="_blank">scholar of presidential democracies</a> around the world, I have studied how countries have used electoral colleges. None have been satisfied with the results. And except for the U.S., all have found other ways to choose their leaders.</p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The origins of the U.S. Electoral College</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dhm.de/archiv/ausstellungen/heiliges-roemisches-reich/index_3.html" target="_blank">Holy Roman Empire</a> was a loose <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/confederation-politics" target="_blank">confederation</a> of territories that existed in central Europe from 962 to 1806. The emperor was not chosen by heredity, like most other monarchies. Instead, <a href="https://www.holyromanempireassociation.com/list-of-holy-roman-emperors.html" target="_blank">emperors</a> were chosen by electors, who represented both secular and religious interests.</p>
<p>As of <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/memory-world/golden-bull-all-seven-originals-and-king-wenceslaus-luxury-manuscript-copy-osterreichische" target="_blank">1356</a>, there were <a href="https://brill.com/display/title/18769?language=en" target="_blank">seven electors</a>: Four were hereditary nobles and three were chosen by the Catholic Church. By <a href="https://www.holyromanempireassociation.com/reichstag-of-the-holy-roman-empire.html" target="_blank">1803</a>, the total number of electors had increased to 10. Three years later, <a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/70699377" target="_blank">the empire fell</a>.</p>
<p>When the <a href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/founding-fathers" target="_blank">Founding Fathers</a> were drafting the U.S. Constitution in 1787, the <a href="https://www.senate.gov/civics/common/generic/Virginia_Plan_item.htm" target="_blank">initial draft proposal</a> called for the “National Executive,” which we now call the president, to be elected by the “National Legislature,” which we now call Congress. However, Virginia delegate <a href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/founding-fathers-virginia#mason" target="_blank">George Mason</a> viewed “<a href="https://www.consource.org/document/james-madisons-notes-of-the-constitutional-convention-1787-6-2/" target="_blank">making the Executive the mere creature of the Legislature</a> as a violation of the fundamental principle of good Government,” and so the idea was rejected.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania delegate <a href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/founding-fathers-pennsylvania#wilson" target="_blank">James Wilson</a> proposed <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/10714/plain-honest-men-by-richard-beeman/" target="_blank">that the president be elected by popular vote</a>. However, many other delegates were adamant that there be an <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-electoral-college-system-isnt-one-person-one-vote-150342" target="_blank">indirect way of electing the president</a> to provide a buffer against what Thomas Jefferson called “<a href="https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-06-02-0174" target="_blank">well-meaning, but uninformed people</a>.” Mason, for instance, suggested that allowing voters to pick the president would be akin to “<a href="https://www.consource.org/document/james-madisons-notes-of-the-constitutional-convention-1787-7-17/" target="_blank">refer(ring) a trial of colours to a blind man</a>.”</p>
<p>For 21 days, the founders debated how to elect the president, and they held more than 30 separate votes on the topic – <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/706046/tyranny-of-the-minority-by-steven-levitsky-and-daniel-ziblatt/" target="_blank">more than for any other issue</a> they discussed. Eventually, the complicated solution that they agreed to was an early version of the electoral college system that exists today, a method where neither Congress nor the people directly elect the president. Instead, each state gets a number of electoral votes corresponding to the number of members of the U.S. House and Senate it is apportioned. When the states’ electoral votes are tallied, the candidate with the majority wins.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/founding-fathers-virginia#madison" target="_blank">James Madison</a>, who <a href="https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed19.asp" target="_blank">was not fond of</a> the Holy Roman Empire’s <a href="https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/debates_725.asp" target="_blank">use of an electoral college</a>, later recalled that the final decision on how to elect a U.S. president “<a href="https://bcuassets.blob.core.windows.net/docs/BJALS-Issue-2.pdf" target="_blank">was produced by fatigue and impatience</a>.”</p>
<p>After <a href="https://prologue.blogs.archives.gov/2020/10/27/amending-the-electoral-college-the-12th-amendment/" target="_blank">just two elections</a>, in 1796 and 1800, problems with this system had become obvious. Chief among them was that electoral votes were cast only for president. The person who got the most electoral votes became president, and the person who came in second place – usually their leading opponent – became vice president. The current process of <a href="https://constitution.findlaw.com/amendment12.html" target="_blank">electing the president and vice president on a single ticket</a> but with separate electoral votes was adopted in 1804 with the passage of the <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-12/" target="_blank">12th Amendment</a>.</p>
<p>Some other questions about how the electoral college system should work were clarified by federal laws through the years, <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/RL/RL32717/12" target="_blank">including in 1887 and 1948</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://theconversation.com/pro-trump-rioters-storm-u-s-capitol-as-his-election-tantrum-leads-to-violence-149142" target="_blank">After the 2020 presidential election</a> exposed additional <a href="https://theconversation.com/an-unseen-problem-with-the-electoral-college-it-tells-bad-guys-where-to-target-their-efforts-236470" target="_blank">flaws with the system</a>, Congress further tweaked the process by passing <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/4573/text" target="_blank">legislation</a> that <a href="https://theconversation.com/congress-passes-legislation-that-will-close-off-presidential-election-mischief-and-help-avoid-another-jan-6-196204" target="_blank">sought to clarify how electoral votes are counted</a>.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Other electoral colleges</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>After the U.S. Constitution went into effect, the idea of using an electoral college to indirectly elect a president <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/706046/tyranny-of-the-minority-by-steven-levitsky-and-daniel-ziblatt/" target="_blank">spread</a> to other <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/republic" target="_blank">republics</a>.</p>
<p>For example, in the Americas, <a href="https://constitutionnet.org/sites/default/files/1821-grancolombiana.pdf" target="_blank">Colombia</a> adopted an electoral college in 1821. <a href="https://ciaotest.cc.columbia.edu/wps/klg/0028440/f_0028440_23119.pdf" target="_blank">Chile</a> adopted one in 1828. <a href="https://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Argentina/arg1853.html" target="_blank">Argentina</a> adopted one in 1853.</p>
<p>In Europe, <a href="https://www.presidentti.fi/en/presidency/election-of-the-president/" target="_blank">Finland</a> adopted an electoral college to elect its president in 1925, and <a href="https://www.elysee.fr/en/french-presidency/electing-presidents-of-the-french-republic" target="_blank">France</a> adopted an electoral college in 1958.</p>
<p>Over time, however, these countries changed their minds. All of them abandoned their electoral colleges and switched to directly electing their presidents by votes of the people. Colombia did so in 1910, Chile in 1925, France in 1965, Finland in 1994, and Argentina in 1995.</p>
<p>The U.S. is the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1057/9780230522749" target="_blank">only democratic presidential system</a> left that still uses an electoral college.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" id="iSxqP" class="tc-infographic-datawrapper" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/iSxqP/1/" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A &#8216;popular&#8217; alternative?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>There is an effort underway in the U.S. to <a href="https://theconversation.com/what-could-replace-the-electoral-college-138769" target="_blank">replace the Electoral College</a>. It may not even require amending the Constitution.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nationalpopularvote.com/written-explanation" target="_blank">National Popular Vote Interstate Compact</a>, currently agreed to by 17 U.S. states, including small states such as Delaware and big ones such as California, as well as the District of Columbia, is an agreement to award all of their electoral votes to whichever presidential candidate gets the most votes nationwide. It would take effect once enough states sign on that they would represent the 270-vote majority of electoral votes. The current list reaches 209 electoral votes.</p>
<p>A key problem with the interstate compact is that in races with more than two candidates, it could lead to situations where the winner of the election did not get a majority of the popular vote, but rather more than half of all voters chose someone else.</p>
<p>When Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Finland and France got rid of their electoral colleges, they did not replace them with a direct popular vote in which <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/plurality-system" target="_blank">the person with the most votes wins</a>. Instead, they all adopted <a href="https://theconversation.com/a-brief-history-of-georgias-runoff-voting-and-how-this-years-contest-between-two-black-men-is-a-sign-of-progress-194775" target="_blank">a version</a> of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0217650" target="_blank">runoff voting</a>. In those systems, winners are declared only when they receive support from more than half of those who cast ballots.</p>
<p>Notably, neither the U.S. Electoral College nor the interstate compact that seeks to replace it are systems that ensure that presidents are <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0262026" target="_blank">supported by a majority</a> of voters.</p>

(Brodie Greene, VCU Capitol News Service)</p><p dir="ltr"><em><strong>By Brodie Greene/Capital News Service</strong></em></p>
<p dir="ltr">RICHMOND, Va. &#8212; College students from nine Virginia universities spent a recent weekend at the State Capitol to learn about the legislative process through a government simulation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Students elected leadership positions within their respective parties, with roles that included majority and minority leader, as well as majority and minority whip. They had a bill book and used the same parliamentary rules followed by state lawmakers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This was the inaugural <a href="https://idpce.vcu.edu/va-government-simulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://idpce.vcu.edu/va-government-simulation/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1728760207726000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2rRNjTkjykvKzuVRnBD7JF">Virginia Government Simulation</a>, inspired by similar college programs in Tennessee and Illinois. <a href="https://idpce.vcu.edu/va-government-simulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://idpce.vcu.edu/va-government-simulation/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1728760207726000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2rRNjTkjykvKzuVRnBD7JF">The three-day event, starting Oct. 3, was</a> an initiative of the Institute for Democracy, Pluralism, and Community Empowerment at Virginia Commonwealth University.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Amanda Wintersieck is an associate professor of political science at VCU and the IDPCE director. She helped organize the simulation. Faculty from Bridgewater College and Radford University contributed to the creation of the event, and served as advisers on the executive board.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Students debated 15 bills in the House chamber from the <a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=lnk&amp;val=73" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses%3D241%26typ%3Dlnk%26val%3D73&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1728760207726000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2zr4tz-dzBiKrc8caS4CLX">2024</a> legislative session. Bills covered topics such as artificial intelligence, cannabis advertising and single-use plastics.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bridgewater junior Jory Cardoza was surprised to be elected majority leader, but said it was easy to step into the role once the simulation started. Cardoza also acted as House speaker for the simulation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I think people have really cool ideas about what they want to see in government,” Cardoza said. “So just like facilitating … was really cool, trying to allow everybody time to speak their mind.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Data shows Americans generally do not have a solid understanding of how their state legislatures work, Wintersieck said. About half of the respondents to a <a href="https://hub.jhu.edu/2018/12/14/americans-dont-understand-state-government/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://hub.jhu.edu/2018/12/14/americans-dont-understand-state-government/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1728760207726000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3bBEWuHLEdWG72abLg4ULg">survey</a> conducted by John Hopkins University did not know if their state had a one or two-chamber legislature, and that one-third were unable to name their state’s governor.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This is pretty discouraging, because I know while national politics are sexy and they get all the money and all the advertisements and all the news attention, the reality is the laws that impact us every single day are the laws of our states,” Wintersieck said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“High impact” experiences allow students to retain information better than if they had learned about the project in a government class, according to Wintersieck.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“In three, five, 10 years they&#8217;re going to have retained more of that information because they engaged in it in a more realistic setting,” Wintersieck said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Jackson Mallory attends VCU, and helped organize the event as part of a work study position. He hopes to work in politics one day.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The government simulation provides students with networking and career development opportunities, in addition to learning about the legislative process firsthand, according to Mallory.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It&#8217;s not just about debating,” Mallory said. “It&#8217;s about decorum. It&#8217;s about respect for the participants in the chamber. It&#8217;s about respect for yourself.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Students were randomly assigned political parties prior to the event. They researched the viewpoints and arguments of political parties they may not be aligned with, which helps build critical thinking.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It really forces them to engage with thinking about how somebody from a different political persuasion thinks about things,” Wintersieck said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Jarrett Lilly is a sophomore at Bridgewater College who described himself as a moderate conservative. He was assigned to act as a Democrat.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In order to get into the mindset of someone from the opposite party, it is crucial to understand why someone believes a certain way, according to Lilly.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Maybe I don&#8217;t agree with it but at the same time, I can understand where this person is coming from and they really do want to make a difference,” Lilly said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After debate and amendments, the delegates passed 14 bills. Elected officials could take notice of the efficiency from their younger counterparts &#8212; state lawmakers this past session passed 45% of the bills introduced.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A 2022 <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/08/09/as-partisan-hostility-grows-signs-of-frustration-with-the-two-party-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/08/09/as-partisan-hostility-grows-signs-of-frustration-with-the-two-party-system/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1728760207726000&amp;usg=AOvVaw14aNNPL8UNix12j6YBHwbN">study</a> done by Pew Research Center found that around 69% of Republican respondents regarded Democrats as closed-minded, while 83% of Democrats said the same about Republicans. Those percentages had double-digit increases from 2016. Each party increasingly views the people in the other party, not just the party itself, in a negative light, according to the study.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The success rate of these temporary legislators may have to do with their age and partisan flexibility, according to Lilly.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I feel like previous generations are very much so set in their beliefs,” Lilly said. “I feel like a lot of us are more open to being able to have a conversation.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Summer Neil is a VCU sophomore pursuing a major in social work studies, and a minor in political science. She was initially disappointed to be selected as a Republican for the simulation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The experience was more fun than anticipated, and she was surprised to find she supported some of the bills introduced by Republicans.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I think it’ll help me remove all of my bias and be a little more willing to really read into how things are, rather than how I perceive them to be,” Neil said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The participants compromised across their political ideology and party, which Wintersieck applauded.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It&#8217;s really clear that young Democrats and young Republicans can agree on things that previously could not be agreed upon between these two parties, and I think that’s encouraging in some ways,” Wintersieck said.</p>

Betsy Carr, D-Richmond, delivers a speech to students attending the Virginia Government Simulation. (Amanda Wintersieck/VCU Capital News Service)</p></figure>
<p dir="ltr">Organizers hope to expand the legislative simulation to include the Senate, and also make other elements more robust. The organizers envision the opportunity to participate as part of the press corps or as lobbyists. There could also be judiciary and executive branch roles that add to the simulation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Such future models could see 400-700 students in attendance, and involve other disciplines of study, according to Wintersieck.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Del. Betsy Carr, D-Richmond, closed out the session with a speech on the value of public service and encouraged students to remain engaged and committed to making a difference.</p>

Glenn Youngkin speaking with reporters outside the Capitol Building on March 7, 2024. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long before becoming a lawyer, state lawmaker and Virginia’s first Black House Speaker, Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, was, for years, unable to vote. After a previous felony conviction, it wasn’t until former Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell restored his rights that Scott could participate in democracy again — eventually paving the way for his own run for office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Justice Department on Friday filed a lawsuit against Virginia, alleging that a state program aimed at removing people from the voter rolls, which Gov. Glenn Youngkin touted in an </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/eo/EO-35-Comprehensive-Election-Security-Ensuring-Legal-Voters-and-Accurate-Counting---vF---8.7.24.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executive order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in August, was implemented too close to the Nov. 5 elections and wrongfully included eligible voters. Scott said it’s another example of Youngkin’s administration restricting voting access. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would not be where I am today if I had to depend on somebody like Glenn Youngkin to help me get my rights restored,” Scott said in an interview Monday. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_37471" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/img_4042/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-37471" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_4042-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_4042-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_4042-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_4042-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_4042-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_4042-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth (left), with former Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell, who restored his voting rights after a felony conviction, at the state Capitol in January. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a memo in response to the suit obtained by The Mercury over the weekend, Richard Cullen, a counselor to Youngkin, wrote that Virginia’s process for removing noncitizens from the voting rolls has taken place under both Democratic and Republican governors. It also outlines how Youngkin believes he is not violating a federal policy to have purged rolls by a set time that would allow a buffer to resolve any errors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Federal law does not prohibit the removal of noncitizens from the voting rolls,” the memo said, adding that the 90-day “quiet period” under the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) is “not relevant to this process since Virginia conducts an individualized — not systematic — review per Virginia law in order to correct registration records.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin on Friday called the lawsuit “unprecedented,” underscoring that his executive order simply was “appropriately enforcing a 2006 law” signed by then-Gov. Tim Kaine, a Democrat, which requires Virginia to remove noncitizens from the voter rolls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With the support of our attorney general, we will defend these common sense steps that we are legally required to take, with every resource available to us,” Youngkin said in a statement. “Virginia’s election will be secure and fair, and I will not stand idly by as this politically motivated action tries to interfere in our elections, period.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Scott commended the Justice Department for taking action (it also recently filed a similar </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/09/27/justice-department-alabama-lawsuit-voting/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">suit against Alabama)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The reason that we have this 90-day rule is that we don’t want citizens to be accidentally removed,” Scott said. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Related lawsuit stresses potential effect on naturalized citizens</h4>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The DOJ suit also isn’t the only litigation that Youngkin faces over his Executive Order 35. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A federal </span><a href="https://www.lwv.org/newsroom/press-releases/lawsuit-challenges-recent-voter-roll-purges-virginia-preventing-eligible-us" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">suit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filed by the Virginia Coalition for Immigrant Rights and the League of Women Voters of Virginia earlier this month alleges that the process used to purge the rolls violates the </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/national-voter-registration-act-1993-nvra" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Voter Registration Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, disenfranchising eligible voters while raising concerns over transparency and accuracy in the state’s voter registration system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legal action by the two nonprofits came after reports surfaced that Virginians were being removed from the voter rolls due to alleged inaccuracies and outdated information. Many of these removals, the suit argues, were done without proper notification or investigation, leaving eligible voters unaware that they could no longer cast their ballots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit also claims that the purges disproportionately affect minority communities, low-income voters, and those who may not have easy access to the internet to check their voter status. It further asserts that the Youngkin administration has failed to adequately confirm whether a voter is ineligible, potentially silencing their voice in the democratic process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Naturalized citizens serve in our armed forces, pay taxes, and show their patriotism daily with their acts and contributions to our society,” Monica Sarmiento, executive director of the Virginia Coalition for Immigrant Rights, said in a statement earlier this month.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Forcing new American communities to carry undue burden that no other community is required to comply with is discrimination, and does not represent the values that our commonwealth stands for,” Sarmiento said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Youngkin’s executive order, the Virginia Department of Elections is now required to send just one notice to individuals at risk of being removed from the voter rolls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This notice is based on information from the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), but there is no requirement for the accuracy of that information to be verified by either the Department of Elections or local election officials before action is taken. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Sen. Bill Stanley, R-Franklin County, said Monday that the law referenced in Youngkin’s executive order relates to persons who self-identify as “non-citizens” on DMV forms that are turned over to the State Board of Elections, which then checks the information against the voter rolls and notifies those persons of pending removal from the state’s voter registration list, giving them 14 days notice of removal and the right to challenge.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And there are failsafe measures to this,” Stanley said. “Even if they are subsequently removed from the rolls, let’s say, in error, those persons can still register to vote on Election Day under our ‘same day’ registration law. So I fail to see why the federal government is doing this but for no other reason but to try to upset our otherwise sound voter registration process here in Virginia for political purposes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Rich Anderson, the chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia, said in a phone interview Monday afternoon that Youngkin’s executive order “brought together a lot of operating practices and standards that may have been scattered over a number of other places, put it together in one document and demonstrated to the commonwealth that the governor took this seriously and was exercising his responsibilities as the chief executive.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the responsibilities of the executive branch, working with the legislative branch, is to “ensure confidence in our electoral processes and systems, and that was the whole intent of this, I think,” Anderson said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Elections Commissioner Susan Beals, whom Youngkin appointed as Virginia’s top elections official just weeks after assuming office in early 2021, said </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/08/08/virginias-top-elections-official-says-shes-confident-about-the-accuracy-of-results/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in an interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> one week before the governor issued his executive order that a process to prohibit non-citizens from voting was already in place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Anybody who comes to the DMV and shows documents that indicate they are a non-citizen — whether it is a visa or residency — their name is sent to the Department of Elections on a monthly basis so we can double check to make sure that they did not make their way on our voter rolls. If we find them on the rolls, we cancel them,” Beals said in the interview. </span></p>

In October 2023, more than 3,000 people had been mistakenly </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/01/voting-rights-advocates-blast-youngkin-admin-over-error-affecting-3400/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">removed from voter rolls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Earlier that year, the administration also quietly adjusted its </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/surovell-spruill-ask-if-youngkin-has-changed-rights-restoration-process/article_dd1232ba-c4fb-11ed-8b57-3723c72fb438.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">restoration of voting rights process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s Constitution permanently disenfranchises people with felony convictions unless a governor pardons them or restores their rights. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McDonnell, the Republican governor who restored Scott’s rights, along with democratic Govs. Terry McAuliffe and Ralph Northam, had streamlined the process and eventually made it automatic. Now a petition-based process, Youngkin’s </span><a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/local/virginia/virginians-whose-rights-have-been-restored-drops-in-second-year-of-youngkin-administration-reports-show/291-fbe59fc9-c488-4449-be3e-ad4c0ba1c374" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">restoration numbers have dropped</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> compared to his predecessors’ and little criteria has been made available to explain conditions for a restoration petition to be granted.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia chapter of the NAACP took Youngkin to court last year to get answers but a </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/judge-finds-for-youngkin-administration-in-naacps-foia-case/article_210d11ec-9936-11ee-a87e-138606562546.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">judge ruled that most details are exempt from being shared</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through a provision in the Freedom of Information Act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Youngkin’s changes to the process aren’t going against the law, Democratic lawmakers feel it’s being used as a way to limit who can vote. The latest executive order falls amid </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/12/nx-s1-5147789/voting-election-2024-noncitizen-fact-check-trump" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">continued allegations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump that illegal immigrants are trying to vote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a recent </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/23/trump-youngkin-urge-early-voting-during-tele-rally/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">telephone rally</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with Trump, Youngkin touted the purge of over 6,000 people as noncitizens. But a Washington Post review of records and interviews with election officials </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/10/09/youngkin-noncitizen-voters-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">found that most of the purge stemmed from paperwork errors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, like people forgetting to check a citizenship box. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also noted that of Virginia’s three illegal voting prosecutions to occur since 2022, none involved a question of citizenship.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The race is dominated by four men and one woman. According to </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/local/richmond/2024/03/27/richmond-mayor-candidates-whos-running-2024" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Axios</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Richmond hasn&#8217;t had a non-Black mayor since now-U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine held the office more than 20 years ago. And the city has also never had a Black woman mayor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re unsure what precinct or district you’re in, the city offers </span><a href="https://www.rva.gov/elections/precincts" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">downloadable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> precinct, voter and election district voting maps. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you haven’t voted since the last major election back in 2020, there aren’t many changes in the process of voting, said Keith Balmer, General Registrar for the City of Richmond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In regards to this election, the thing is that there wasn&#8217;t really a whole lot of movement as far as new legislation with the General Assembly, so there&#8217;s no new laws that really impact it,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters who haven’t voted in the last few years should also check what district they’re in, said Balmer, who added that his department has already sent out mailers to voters who were moved into a new city council district because of redistricting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Balmer is being </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/13/after-hr-probe-richmond-officials-suggest-restructuring-of-election-office/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">investigated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/registrar-balmer-city-credit-card-investigation-elections-office/article_6be2d0e8-146b-11ef-971d-1f0b4090e555.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Richmond Inspector General’s Office</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for allegations of nepotism and improper spending in the city’s elections office, which Balmer has led since 2021.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Mayoral Priorities </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are common threads that nearly every potential mayor is pulling on to tie their campaign together with how they’d run the city. Although many have the same priorities, they have different approaches and some offer more context than others about their plans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All five candidates — Andreas Addison, Danny Avula, Michelle Mosby, Maurice Neblett and Harrison Roday — list reforming City Hall</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">as a priority issue on their campaign websites. Some, like </span><a href="https://dannyformayor.com/priorities/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avula</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, have detailed lists about how they want to do that, while others, such as Neblett, have only one sentence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the past several months, Richmond’s City Hall has experienced major issues concerning </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2024-04-19/meals-tax-auditor-review-richmond-restaurants" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">meals taxes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://newsvirginian.com/news/state-regional/purchasing-cards-credit-policy-richmond-spending/article_61f0df4a-cab0-561f-b0e6-ab78df18919d.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">overdue balances </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">on credit card spending, and a lack of </span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/local-news/richmond/facing-transparency-criticism-stoney-defends-his-administration-and-city-credit-card-program/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">transparency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, so it’s not surprising that the mayoral candidates have set their sights on fixing the issues there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing is the next common thread in each candidate’s campaign, and they all lay out their plans to improve how the city can better serve renters and homeowners on their websites – except for Neblett, who doesn’t mention any housing goals on his site. The rest mention expanding the city’s land trust portfolios, such as the </span><a href="https://www.richmondlandbank.com/about-mwclt" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maggie Walker Community Land Trust,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help stave off evictions and people experiencing homelessness. Each of these candidates have other ideas as well, such as</span><a href="https://rodayforrichmond.com/housing/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Roday’s plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">  to invest $100 million in housing in the next four years. The money would go toward preventing evictions and into building more affordable housing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The candidates’ other priorities include:</span></p>
<p><b>Safe Neighborhoods:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> All the candidates say they want to create safer neighborhoods. Generally, they highlight fixing crumbling sidewalks, building better biking and walking infrastructure, and expanding public transportation. Mosby plans to tackle crime by trying to recruit more police officers and get funding for community based response teams to address mental health emergencies. </span><a href="https://www.mauriceneblett.com/issues/#jump3" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neblett</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s website mentions creating trust between residents and police as a route to safer communities. </span></p>
<p><b>Education</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Roday, Avula, Mosby, and Neblett all plan to work closer with Richmond Public Schools to improve school buildings and want more funding for schools. Addison is </span><a href="https://www.andreasaddison.com/education" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to build a workforce development center in Southside for students and adults to learn trade skills. </span></p>
<p><b>Reproductive Rights:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Addison, Avula and Roday have listed access to reproductive services, such as those provided by Planned Parenthood, as a priority.</span></p>
<p><b>LGBTQ+ Issues</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Addison and Avula list supporting the LGBTQ+ community as a priority. </span><a href="https://dannyformayor.com/priorities/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avula</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> says he’ll push back against any state or federal attempts to reduce protections and rights, while </span><a href="https://www.andreasaddison.com/inclusion-and-belonging" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addison</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wants to create an Office of LGBTQ Affairs that will help connect the community to services and support small businesses, among other goals. </span></p>
<p><b>Climate Issues</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Avula is the only candidate that mentions climate change on his campaign website, stating that he wants to fully fund the city’s Office of Sustainability to realize the goals defined in the </span><a href="https://www.rvagreen2050.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RVAgreen 2050 plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which lays out a plan to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 in the city in part by creating climate-neutral buildings and by increasing tree coverage.</span></p>
<p><strong>Housing:</strong> Last month, we asked the candidates about their plans to ease affordable housing challenges in the city; <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/16/richmond-mayor-candidates-ideas-on-housing-and-how-the-state-can-help-the-city/">here&#8217;s what they told us</a>.</p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Richmond mayoral candidate profiles</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Mercury gleaned information about each candidates’ policy views from our own reporting, and by reviewing their campaign websites, their comments in other media and at mayoral forums being held around the city. We also asked each candidate one question:</span><strong><i> The city’s  demographics have changed since the last election; how will you be mayor for the entire city?</i></strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.andreasaddison.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addison</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has represented Richmond&#8217;s 1st District since 2017. He is the owner of Pure Fitness RVA in Scott’s Addition, as well as working as an adjunct professor at the University of Virginia&#8217;s School of Public Policy. Prior to his time on city council, he worked in City Hall. Addison’s campaign had raised $128,497 as of Aug. 31, according to the Virginia Public Access Project, a nonprofit, nonpartisan website that tracks campaign spending and donations, releases data on elections and displays election results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On how he will govern the whole city, Addison said though the city’s form of governing was based upon creating a racially diverse opportunity for residents to have representation on the city council and in who they elect as mayor, it has not been done in an equitable way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The only way to make sure that you actually have a good sense of what the voice for the people is, and the job you have as a public servant, is to make sure that you have a diverse voice, a voice of all people from all over the city and all backgrounds and all racial diversities and social income levels,” Addison said.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://dannyformayor.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Avula</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s background includes working for the Richmond and Henrico Health Districts for 12 years, with half of that time as director. Former Gov. Ralph Northam appointed him to head up the state’s COVID-19 vaccination program. It’s his first time running for office. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of campaign fundraising, in the past few weeks, Avula money levels have surged and  currently stands at $827,698. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avula did not respond to the Virginia Mercury’s request for comment. But in a response to a question posed by </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/elections/2024-09-24/richmond-black-reparations-addison-avula-mosby-neblett-roday" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next City and VPM News</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> asking how would a candidate for mayor support Black reparations, Avula said he has a long record of addressing racial inequity through his work in public health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But in leading any ‘reparation’s effort in Richmond, I commit to listening and empowering those who have been working on reparations specifically much longer than I,” he said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to The Mercury’s question about governing the whole city, Mosby wrote in an email:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Throughout my career, both in and out of public service, I have made it a point to work across racial and economic lines. Since I began this campaign, engaging diverse communities has been a core principle,” she wrote. “I will prioritize equitable policies that address systemic </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">inequalities and promote economic opportunities for all.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Where are you allocating the money in the budget? Where are you prioritizing physically economic development opportunities? Are you putting in structures in economic development transactions that the city is involved in that reflect not only the needs of workers who are focused on those projects, but reflect the needs of residents?” he asked.</span></p>

(Photos courtesy of candidates' campaigns)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The election in Virginia’s 7th Congressional District is shaping up to be a tight contest, with two political newcomers vying for the support of swayable voters in one of the state’s most competitive districts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Eugene Vindman is taking on Republican Derrick Anderson in a race to succeed U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Prince William, who announced last year that she is not seeking reelection in favor of a 2025 gubernatorial bid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The district, anchored in Prince William County and stretching west to Madison County and south to Caroline County, has a history of narrow victories in past elections. With this being Vindman’s inaugural run for office and Anderson’s second foray into the 7th District race, both are working hard to connect with undecided voters who may swing the election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to their shared ambition to represent the district in the U.S. Congress, both candidates bring a strong record of military service to the table — a key theme in their respective campaigns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel and attorney, has emphasized his commitment to defending democracy and advocating for national security. Anderson, also a veteran, served as a Green Beret in the Army Special Forces and has focused his campaign on conservative values, including strengthening national defense and supporting law enforcement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was a troop leader paratrooper in the 82nd, and when we jumped out of airplanes, it didn&#8217;t matter who was to the left or right of us, who was Democrat, Republican or independent, or whether you’re Black, Hispanic, what part of the country you came from,” Vindman told The Mercury in a recent interview. “We’re focused on the mission, and that’s my mindset in everything that I do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson did not respond to repeated interview requests for this article. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Republican has aligned himself with former President Donald Trump’s Make America Great Again agenda and has expressed his support for at least some proposals in the conservative policy roadmap known as Project 2025, which outlines plans to reshape government and policy under a future Republican administration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Energy policy has also emerged as a significant point of debate between the two candidates, with each offering contrasting visions for the future of Virginia’s energy sector.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, both have taken clear stances on abortion and immigration. Vindman has emphasized the need to protect reproductive rights and seek comprehensive immigration reform, while Anderson has focused on more restrictive immigration policies and has voiced support for overturning federal protections for abortion.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Candidates’ backgrounds </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman’s family immigrated to the United States from Ukraine in 1979 when he was 3. He joined the Army’s 82nd Airborne division as a paratrooper before rising to lieutenant colonel and Judge Advocate General,,the highest-ranking uniformed lawyer in the military. He later joined the White House’s National Security Team. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman’s twin brother, Alex Vindman, became nationally known as a whistleblower who leaked details about a phone conversation betweenTrump and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine during his presidency, which led to Trump’s impeachment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman was </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/07/politics/alex-vindman-donald-trump-impeachment/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fired</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">by Trump in 2020. He was investigating war crimes in Ukraine when Spanberger announced her gubernatorial bid last year. Vindman dominated the Democratic nomination contest, garnering more than 50% of the vote in a seven-way </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/18/subramanyam-vindman-win-democratic-primaries-to-succeed-wexton-spanberger/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">primary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I thought to myself, I really care about which direction this country is going in,” Vindman explained as his primary reason for running.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson, who traces his beginnings to working at his mother’s restaurant, served in the Middle East in Afghanistan, Bahrain, Jordan, Israel, and Lebanon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He went on to work at the White House’s Office of National Drug Control Policy during the Trump administration and became a lawyer, before witnessing the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, which he said was “botched.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was upset with the lack of accountability for this administration,” Anderson said during an Oct. 2 candidates </span><a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?538743-1/virginia-7th-congressional-district-debate" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">debate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with Vindman at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">District profile</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger has represented the 7th District since 2019, after ousting U.S. Rep. Dave Brat, D-Henrico, by 50.3%-48.4%</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent Cook Report </span><a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/analysis/house/house-overview/house-rating-changes-close-races-nj-07-and-va-07-shift-toward" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has moved the district from “lean Democrat” to “toss up.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By June, Vindman had raised $7.4 million — over five times as much as Anderson, who raised $1.4 million. The Democratic National Committee recently backed Vindman’s effort with another $50,000. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The national support for candidates in the 7th District underscores the race’s significance in the broader political landscape. With Republicans holding a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives — 220 to 211 over Democrats — the outcome of this race could have far-reaching implications. Control of Congress will be pivotal in advancing or obstructing the agenda of the next president, whether it’s Trump or Harris.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The economy</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A September Pew Research </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/09/09/issues-and-the-2024-election/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> revealed that the economy is the top issue on voters&#8217; minds this election season, and both candidates offer contrasting approaches to addressing economic concerns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman has expressed worries about Trump’s policies and the potential impact of Project 2025 on the district’s workforce, which includes nearly </span><a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47716" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">60,000 federal employees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In contrast, Anderson has focused his campaign on energy policy, emphasizing the need for a strong energy sector to bolster the economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump’s own policy plan, Agenda 47, would remove about 100,000 of those jobs. George Mason University professor Terry Clower </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/30/trump-government-cuts-could-cost-house-republicans-majority-.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">estimated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the eliminated positions would equal a $27-28 billion loss from Virginia’s economy annually.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson, like Trump, publicly denies supporting Project 2025, which calls for major overhauls of the federal government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Folks, I did not know what Project 2025 was until this individual kept talking about it over and over again. But I can tell you that it’s not my plan,” Anderson </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtWw7ZqEkTI" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at a recent candidate’s forum at a Manassas middle school, referring to his opponent   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman has said he opposes Project 2025 because he doesn’t want to see it replace about 50,0000 “Schedule F” non-partisan federal employees with loyalists to whichever political party is in power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eliminating those jobs would literally devastate the economy in this area. It’s profoundly unfair, and it’s also damaging to national security,” Vindman said. “These are people that have spent decades in government, understanding threats, understanding Russia, China, or law enforcement, and (Project 2025 calls for) replacing them with partisan political hacks.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help people’s pocketbooks, Vindman suggested building off the work of Democratic President Joe Biden to cap medication prices, including insulin, by placing limits on a broader range of medications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Anderson, who said he understands that “there is climate change,” underscored that businesses have named electricity bills as their top expense, and that the economy could get back on track by prioritizing domestic production of energy. Anderson falsely claimed about 35 minutes into the UMW </span><a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?538743-1/virginia-7th-congressional-district-debate" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">debate</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that the country is a “net importer rather than a net exporter of oil.” According to the Energy Information Agency, a federal government tracker of energy trends, the U.S. in 2023 imported about 8.51 million barrels per day of oil from 86 countries, </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=727&amp;t=6" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">compared</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to exporting about 10.15 million barrels per day of oil.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Abortion</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abortion rights are another major issue for voters nationwide, and the candidates in the 7th District reflect opposing views. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman has called for restoring Roe v. Wade, advocating for federal protections for abortion rights. Anderson, on the other hand, has stated that while he does not support a national ban on abortion, he believes the decision should be left to individual states, allowing them to determine their own abortion laws.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are two fundamental questions in this race: Will you restore women’s right to reproductive health care, as it was under Roe v. Wade?” Vindman asked. “And will you stand against a national abortion ban? I will restore Roe v. Wade, and I will stand against the national abortion ban.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson, in the UMW debate, denied supporting a federal abortion ban, or taking away reproductive rights to in vitro fertilization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson also said he would support over the counter contraceptives, but in a previous </span><a href="https://starexponent.com/news/local/government-politics/elections/article_a5197e3e-7609-11ef-8e03-2bb78dfa980f.html#tncms-source=login" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">forum </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">for both the 7th and 10th congressional districts, he stopped short of saying if he would support a woman’s right to choose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I support the states to be able to make those decisions that best fits those states,” Anderson said at the time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson has falsely stated that former Gov. Ralph Northam supported infanticide, which is illegal in all 50 states. Northam was talking about </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/13/virginia-democrats-do-not-support-infanticide-but-heres-why-trump-keeps-saying-they-do/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">palliative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> care for babies born with complications during a 2019 interview that has been widely misquoted in every election cycle since.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Immigration</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On immigration, both candidates acknowledge issues at the U.S. southern border, but their approaches differ.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman has proposed reviving the Border Act of 2024, a federal measure aiming to address border security and immigration reform that nearly passed before </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/border-immigration-senate-vote-924f48912eecf1dc544dc648d757c3fe" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">being blocked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by congressional Republicans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In contrast, Anderson has emphasized the need for strong immigration and foreign policies to enhance community safety, but he has not offered a specific plan or proposal to address the issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with several other measures, the Senate proposal would have given the Department of Homeland Security emergency authority to shut down the border if daily migrant encounters reached 4,000 over a one-week span. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If those crossings rose to over 5,000 on average per day in a given week, DHS would be required to close the border to migrants crossing through ports of entry. Some migrants could stay if they proved they were escaping torture or prosecution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman said he would have supported the bill, which “would have been the toughest bill in decades, and we&#8217;re badly in need of comprehensive immigration reform.” </span></p>

(Photo courtesy of DBHDS)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia ranks number 12 in the nation of most challenging states to access mental healthcare in a new </span><a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/644144/americans-perceive-gaps-mental-physical-healthcare.aspx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forbes Advisor analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and a </span><a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/644144/americans-perceive-gaps-mental-physical-healthcare.aspx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gallup survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from earlier in the year found that about 38% of Americans think mental health isn’t treated as well as physical health issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, much of the data Forbes used in its analysis was from 2020 or 2021, and in recent years Virginia’s legislature has passed several laws bolstering access to care. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is in the second year of a three-year plan called </span><a href="https://www.hhr.virginia.gov/12-14-2022-Two-Page-BH-Plan-Summary.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right Help, Right Now </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">— which entails budget proposals and goals from Gov. Glenn Youngkin and legislative actions by state lawmakers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, when the national mental health emergency hotline transitioned to the easier-to-remember 988 system, Virginia </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+ful+CHAP0248" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> funded expanded call centers and listed deployment of mobile crisis units and community care teams as part of their responsibilities. Use of 988 has </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/local/richmond/2024/09/25/virginia-988-hotline-mental-health-crisis" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">been on the rise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Virginia. </span></p>
<p>This week, Youngkin announced several million in grants to community service boards around the state that will be used to help with crisis response.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Governor Youngkin is committed to building on ongoing efforts to develop innovative solutions that address the challenges within our behavioral health care system and ensure that Virginians in crisis receive the appropriate care and support they need,” said Youngkin spokesman Christian Martinez. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some building on those efforts occurred this past legislative session when the governor signed </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb601" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bipartisan bills</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to require insurance coverage for mental health services provided through mobile crisis units, crisis receiving centers and crisis stabilization units. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the hallmarks of the 2024 session was </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title37.2/chapter8/section37.2-808/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Irvo’s Law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which allows families members or guardians to be present to provide support and decision-making when someone in a mental health crisis is being considered for temporary detention orders. The legislation stemmed from the 2023 death of Irvo Otineo, who was </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/18/scathing-report-calls-for-a-ban-of-prone-restraint-tactics/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">killed while restrained by sheriff&#8217;s deputies and workers in a state-run psychiatric hospital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. His mother, Carolina Ouko, had been denied the ability to see him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our families are part of our mental health and we need them beside us in those tough times,” Ouko </span><a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/virginia-governor-signs-mental-health-bills-irvo-otien-june-15-2024" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said earlier this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as Youngkin signed the law named for her son. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previous law to stem from mental health related tragedies is the </span><a href="https://dbhds.virginia.gov/human-resource-development-and-management/health-equity/mdpa/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marcus Alert</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, named for Marcus-David Peters, who was killed by police in 2018. The alert, which has so far only been implemented by a handful of localities in Virginia, creates coordination between 911 and regional call centers to triage best response from law enforcement and trained clinicians when handling mental health situations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://bhc.virginia.gov/documents/BHC%20Staff%20-%20ABLEO.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent Behavioral Health Commission presentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> noted that arrests of people in mental health crises have a “devastating impact” on people in crisis and “stress local and state resources.” Despite Virginia having a prevalence of crisis intervention-trained law enforcement officers, the report stated that crisis response should include or be led by clinicians. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instances where someone assaults an officer who responds to their crisis are more common the longer people are held waiting in hospital emergency rooms under temporary detention orders, BHC policy analyst Claire Pickard Mairead told lawmakers at the meeting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mairead’s presentation noted how law enforcement leaders and research literature found that CIT has improved officers’ confidence in handling mental health crises, but there is little evidence of such officers being able to reduce arrests of people in crisis or injuries that might arise to the affected individuals or the officer if interactions turn forceful. The study did find that officers in Virginia expressed interest in CIT “refreshers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislation from 2020 directed the Department of Criminal Justice Services to develop a CIT training program that includes recertification and advanced training. Those new standards await approval from Youngkin’s office. From there, they can be open to public comment and go through final regulatory stages, the report read. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a desire for co-responder models, the report stated, as “effective ways to include clinicians when safety risks exist.” However, lack of funding and mental health workforce shortages have limited implementation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while lawmakers continue to explore how to improve mental health crisis response and law enforcement’s role in those, Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville, said “our focus needs to be on keeping people out of crisis.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After losing his son, Gus, to a mental health crisis a decade ago, Deeds has been </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/11/18/virginia-creigh-deeds-mental-health/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a leader in reforming mental health access</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the state and chairs the Behavioral Health Commission, which conducts studies and explores legislative proposals each year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On future goals, Deeds said that continued support for community service boards — a public health resource — can help, but that the state should explore how private sectors can become more robust too. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We also have to be looking at the private sector providers to find out what kind of barriers we have to building the workforce, and what kind of barriers are out there that prevent effective mental health care in every part of the commonwealth,” Deeds added</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help address some of the workforce shortages, Sen. Tara Durant, R-Stafford, carried a </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB403" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that will help create pathways for people with community college degrees to enter mental health professions as technicians and technician assistants. Del. Rodney Willett, D-Henrico, introduced </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB1499" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that can make it easier for people with master’s degrees in psychology to practice independently. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harrison Hayes, the director of the Virginia Health Workforce Development Authority, also pointed to a </span><a href="https://www.vhcf.org/boost200/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> funded by the state government and the Virginia Health Care Foundation that’s aimed at helping accelerate the licensure of social workers and counselors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite Virginia’s various efforts to better fund mental health resources in recent years, Deeds said there’s still more work to do. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The reality is, we’ve chronically underfunded mental health over such a long period of time,” he said. “It’s going to take a lot of years to get this right.”</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin speaks in the Patrick Henry Building Tuesday. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recovery efforts in Southwest Virginia following Hurricane Helene remain a priority for Gov. Glenn Youngkin as government resources continue to aid states affected by the storm’s devastation, including North Carolina, and soon Florida, where an extremely dangerous category 5 hurricane is predicted to make landfall Wednesday night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking to reporters in Richmond on Tuesday, Youngkin highlighted the progress made in restoring services in Virginia’s hardest-hit areas, especially in the mountainous regions in the western part of the commonwealth. He noted that power had been restored to all but less than 200 customers in remote areas, with full service expected soon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, all cell phone towers in the region have been repaired, ensuring communication abilities are back online.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boil water advisories for drinking water are down from 35 systems to 19 in the areas hardest hit by Helene, as water can still be used for other purposes. Test kits for well users are available at a disaster recovery </span><a href="https://www.vaemergency.gov/recover/hurricane-helene" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including one at the Damascus Shopping Mall in Washington County.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two primary roads and 16 secondary roads remain impassable, Youngkin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State officials and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are concerned about debris and chemicals in Claytor Lake in Pulaski County, and South Holston Lake in Washington County, as the bodies of water are used for hydroelectric power generation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe this will be a 10 to 12-day period of just assessing and getting cleanup personnel on site,” Youngkin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medical crews remain in the area, but Virginia does “not have a shortage,” of fluid </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2024-10-07/intravenous-fluids-shortage-baxter-international-marion-north-carolina" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">IV</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> supplies, Youngkin said. Health systems, however, are still determining if elective procedures can be delayed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Employment Commission is helping with job losses, Youngkin added, and the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services is working with the </span><a href="https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2024/10/04/usda-offers-resources-adds-flexibilities-disaster-assistance" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">United States Department of Agriculture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to assist with the potential “hundreds of millions of dollars of lost income from our agricultural community.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Individual assistance has been </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/10/05/list-of-localities-declared-under-a-major-disaster-grows-to-nine-in-southwest-virginia/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expanded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the counties of Montgomery and Pulaski, as public assistance for local governments, has been expanded to Lee County. Most of those who have sought assistance have primarily used the </span><a href="https://www.fema.gov/assistance/individual" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FEMA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> app, Youngkin said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And less than two weeks after Helene hit the United States Southeast, claiming the lives of two in Virginia and over 227 people around the </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-death-toll-asheville-north-carolina-34d1226bb31f79dfb2ff6827e40587fc" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">region</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Hurricane Milton is forecast to slam into the western coast of Florida.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Milton is expected to head across the state into the Atlantic Ocean without an impact to Virginia, unless there’s an unexpected turn, which Youngkin said on Tuesday gave him confidence to deploy search and rescue and emergency management teams to support North Carolina. a He also sent the Helicopter Aquatic Rescue Team, a partnership with Virginia National Guard and Chesterfield County firefighter and EMS crews, to Florida in preparation for Milton’s arrival.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked by the Virginia Mercury about protections for Southwest Virginia in the event of future flood events since the hurricane </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/24/health-department-urges-preparedness-ahead-of-peak-storm-season/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">season</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lasts until Nov. 30, Youngkin said that “protections are hard.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As much as we’d like to build a giant wall, in addition to the wall we should build at the southern border, we have to be prepared,” Youngkin said, renewing his request from last week to not get “</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/04/youngkin-shares-update-on-helene-damage-in-virginia-urges-to-not-be-distracted-by-climate-change/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">distracted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” by discussions about climate change. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have great capabilities in order to make sure that loss of life is protected against, but, on top of that, we also know that our response capabilities are extraordinary as well,” Youngkin said.</span></p>

It&#8217;s an especially bad moment to be spreading misinformation online. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems Rooz Dadabhoy has a poor sense of timing. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dadabhoy is the president of Rally Virginia, an organization that describes itself as “the home of the modern Republican woman,” a tech company CEO and a </span><a href="https://bov.vcu.edu/members/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VCU Board of Visitors member</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> appointed by Gov.

Glenn Youngkin, posted this tweet containing misinformation about FEMA funds on Oct. 5, 2024. The post was later deleted. (Screenshot)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“FEMA has spent hundreds of millions on its ‘Shelter and Services Program’ for ILLEGAL migrants this year—and it’s right there on FEMA’s own website. WHAT ABOUT HELPING OUR OWN CITIZENS???? Shame on HARRIS-BIDEN!!!” Dadabhoy’s now-deleted Oct. 5 tweet read. The post included a photo that appeared to show a teary-eyed, wet-haired little girl sitting on a boat, wearing a life jacket and clutching an equally-soaked puppy as another boat floats down a river in the background. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most people who saw it, including me, immediately connected the picture to the water-logged Southeast now recovering from Hurricane Helene. Over 100 people died in the storm, and entire communities in </span><a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2024/10/08/fact-check-debunking-misinformation-surrounding-helene/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hardest-hit North Carolina</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were washed away. There’s been significant flooding in Southwest Virginia, as The Mercury has </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/04/youngkin-shares-update-on-helene-damage-in-virginia-urges-to-not-be-distracted-by-climate-change/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with at least 519 homes damaged or destroyed; two people have perished. That’s reality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The photo in Dadabhoy’s tweet, however, is not. It’s an AI-generated image, which I was able to confirm in less than 15 minutes by running the photo through </span><a href="https://sightengine.com/detect-ai-generated-images" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">three</span></a> <a href="https://aiimagedetector.org/result#google_vignette" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">different</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> free AI detection tools online. She could have easily done the same — and should have —  before sharing this fake photo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dadabhoy’s words are also not rooted in reality. The tweet implies that FEMA funds are being routed to undocumented migrants instead of American-born natural disaster victims, a false claim parroted by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and repeatedly debunked by FEMA in recent days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No money is being diverted from disaster response needs. FEMA’s disaster response efforts and individual assistance is funded through the Disaster Relief Fund, which is a dedicated fund for disaster efforts. Disaster Relief Fund money has not been diverted to other, non-disaster related efforts,” FEMA posted Oct. 3 on a page of its website especially dedicated to setting the record straight (that they felt compelled to do that is sad, in and of itself).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only is the misinformation Trump, Dadabhoy and countless others are pushing irresponsible, it’s downright dangerous. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is reducing the likelihood that survivors will come to FEMA with a trusted way to register for assistance,” Keith Turi, acting associate administrator for response and recovery at FEMA, told </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/07/nx-s1-5144159/fema-funding-migrants-disaster-relief-fund" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NPR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing all this, I asked Dadabhoy two questions: Were you aware when you made that tweet that FEMA has repeatedly debunked the false claim that disaster relief funds are being used to support undocumented immigrants? What did you hope to accomplish by tweeting that? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dadabhoy replied that “I never implied that money is being diverted away from Hurricane Helene victims and being siphoned to illegal immigrants. I did not imply that. I did not even intend to imply that.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t believe that, and neither do the dozens of people who replied angrily to her tweet, some calling for her removal from VCU’s BOV. One person, unfortunately, replied by asking after the welfare of the AI child in the fake photo, showing the problem with spreading digital misinformation, even unintentionally: somebody will believe it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginians in positions of public influence, and who have our governor&#8217;s support, should be dispelling Trumped-up, unproven claims — especially in the aftermath of a major natural disaster, when so many people still need help — not adding fuel to the rumor wildfires.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40341" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:979px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/08/no-fema-helene-funds-arent-going-to-undocumented-immigrants-despite-youngkin-appointees-tweet/picture3_0/" rel="attachment wp-att-40341"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-40341 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Picture3_0.jpg" alt="" width="979" height="651" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Picture3_0.jpg 979w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Picture3_0-300x199.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Picture3_0-768x511.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 979px) 100vw, 979px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  From FEMA: &#8220;Crews working to restore utilities and infrastructure damaged by Helene (in Washington County, Va.). (Nicholas Monteleone/ FEMA)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a press gaggle Youngkin convened Tuesday morning to give updates on Hurricane Helene recovery efforts in Virginia, a reporter asked him what his administration was doing to counter misinformation concerning the storm and FEMA’s response, and referenced Dadabhoy’s tweet as an example of the problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are using, I think, the best process, which is to put people on the ground, answer questions directly, and speak to you all frequently, so that you can help us get out the word how to apply for help where it&#8217;s available, and most importantly, that we care and that we&#8217;re there, and there will be a better day tomorrow,” the governor replied, in part. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin is wise to lean into working with the media to spread the facts; it is an essential part of our role. And you, dear reader, can do your part to identify and stop the spread of misinformation, too. Here are a few tools, tailored to our concurrent election and hurricane seasons:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Perhaps ironically in the context of this column, VCU Libraries is offering an excellent information literacy campaign called </span><a href="https://www.library.vcu.edu/about/news/2024-news/as-a-beacon-in-todays-information-fog-vcu-libraries-launches-campaign-to-encourage-people-to-vetyoursources.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">#VetYourSources</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including a lecture by author and info literacy expert Mike Caulfield, “Rumors of Theft: Navigating election integrity discourse online” on Oct. 15.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> As mentioned above, FEMA’s </span><a href="https://www.fema.gov/disaster/current/hurricane-helene/rumor-response?utm_campaign=Emergency%20response%202024&amp;utm_content=310511761&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;hss_channel=tw-14074515" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hurricane Helene: Rumor Response&#8221;</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> page offers just-the-fact-ma’am breakdowns of what’s real and what&#8217;s not when it comes to the agency’s response to Helene cleanup efforts, and answers questions about its funding for future emergencies. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law&#8217;s </span><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/how-detect-and-guard-against-deceptive-ai-generated-election-information" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">primer on fact-checking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a great resource to help you learn “how to detect and guard against deceptive AI-generated election information.”</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Poynter Institute’s </span><a href="https://www.politifact.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PolitiFact</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a verifiable fact-checking machine, a nonpartisan platform with a robust process of analyzing claims by politicians and media “to give citizens the information they need to govern themselves in a democracy,” writes Angie Drobnic Holan, Politifact’s former editor-in-chief. They&#8217;ve got a special section focused on debunking misinformation, too.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s always a good day to stop the spread of dubious digital distortions. Tweet, post, read and share responsibly out there, folks. </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A review of the Virginia Military Survivors and Dependents Education Program (VMSDEP) by the Joint Legislative Audit &amp; Review Commission found no evidence that participation in the program has peaked or will decline anytime soon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, the study, which was presented to the commission at its meeting in Richmond Monday, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">found that the initiative, which offers tuition waivers to the spouses and children of military members who were killed or permanently disabled due to their service, has seen significant growth over the past five years. The findings echo earlier research from JLARC that found VMSDEP has grown by nearly </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/10/at-task-force-meeting-military-families-rip-ugly-side-of-virginias-government/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">350% </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">since 2019, from about 1,400 students that year to 6,400 in 2023. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the veterans population in the United States has seen a decline from 22 million to 18 million in the past decade according to Veterans Affairs Annual Benefits reports, the number of veterans with a 100% disability rating — the highest rating a veteran can receive for service-connected disabilities — has grown from from 400,000 in 2014 to 1.3 million in 2023, the review found.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“On the one hand, the number of veterans has been declining and is declining. So if you look at it just in terms of that, you can make the case that maybe this program is going to start trending down and maybe we’re seeing a peak,” Justin Brown, JLARC’s senior associate director, told the panel. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40327" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/07/jlarc-review-of-vmsdep-no-evidence-of-peak-or-decline-in-participation-levels/screenshot-2024-10-07-at-3-43-00-pm/" rel="attachment wp-att-40327"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-40327" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-07-at-3.43.00 PM-300x205.png" alt="Nationally, veteran population and disabled veteran population have been trending in opposite directions.

(Courtesy of Joint Legislative Audit &amp; Review Commission)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a “more powerful factor”  may be the rise in veterans with a higher disability rating, Brown said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You don’t know which of these trends is going to prevail, but clearly there’s upward pressure on the disability side, while the big number of veterans is going down. So that complicates how you think about what might happen to the program in the future.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some lawmakers have expressed concern that the program is financially unsustainable, prompting them to implement eligibility changes during the 2024 General Assembly session. However, those changes were repealed in July, and in response, a Senate work group, a governor’s task force, and a study were established to review the program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The JLARC review found that the number of relatives eligible to receive benefits has grown substantially since 2019, when the legislature approved a change that added added dependents of veterans whose death or disability due to military service in general — not just combat-related — to those who qualify.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown said that until these more recent changes to VMSDEP, the program enrollment was small enough “that it just didn’t represent really anything in the general fund budget, and it wasn’t really on the institutions’ radar from the financial perspective, because it was pretty small.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of 2022-23, undergraduate students accounted for about 89% of all VMSDEP participants.  Graduate students, though, have been increasing over time as a proportion of students benefiting from the program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2023-24 alone, VMSDEP enrollment in four-year colleges and universities has grown by 32%, JLARC data shows. In two-year colleges, it has increased by 47% during the same period. About half of total VMSDEP enrollment at four-year institutions is at Old Dominion University (20.6%), Virginia Commonwealth University (16.7%) and George Mason University (14.9%). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data also found that 82% of beneficiaries are biological children of veterans, with 15% of them being spouses and 3% adopted children. Nearly all (96%) receive benefits because of a veteran’s disability — only 1% are related to a veteran who was killed or missing in action or was declared a prisoner of war. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With beneficiaries essentially receiving a free college education, some Virginia universities have raised concerns about the increasing costs of enrolling more students under the program without tuition payments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let’s go back to Fiscal Year 2023, this was the year prior to when you started the process of providing general funds,” Brown told the committee. “In that year, it becomes a pretty large percentage of total revenue, and it’s just revenue that they&#8217;re not collecting due the waiver.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The JLARC review found that several institutions are using various means to compensate for forgone revenue, mostly by raising tuition and fees for other students, reducing or controlling operational spending, tapping into their general funds or institutional revenue. But quantifying the impact of VMSDEP on tuition remains “extremely difficult.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To offset some of the forgone revenue impact on public colleges and universities, the General Assembly earlier this year appropriated $20 million in general funds for fiscal year 2025 and 2026, with an additional $45 million each year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The State Council of Higher Education for Virginia (SCHEV), the commonwealth’s coordinating agency for higher education, began allocating new general funds to institutions in August, Brown said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, when CNU reported that the forgone revenue caused by the program was 3.5% of the university’s total revenue, SCHEV filled that shortfall by providing available general funds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving forward, the JLARC study recommends that the General Assembly appropriate “sufficient general funds to cover 100% of institutions’ forgone revenue.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternatively, the program could be maintained at its current general fund level and the legislature could either distribute funds to institutions proportionally according to their percentage of total VMSDEP enrollment or according to institutions’ relative ability to absorb the forgone revenue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There will be winners and losers in that, I guarantee it, but that’s another way to do it. And we can help you think through that if you would like,” Brown said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers could also follow a model from Texas and create a new fund with a combination of one-time and ongoing appropriations and apportion funds to institutions. In recent years, the fund in the Lone Star State has covered about 15% of its program cost, leaving the institutions on the hook for the remaining costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown warned lawmakers that when contemplating changes to the funding of the program, they would be advised to consider that many future participants in VMSDEP have already been certified eligible and several thousand are already certified, but not yet using the benefit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Depending on what you do, if you do anything, you’ll need to think about when something is effective,” Brown said. “I also think that there’s some minor changes in here that we’re going to give you as options that you could maybe do a little bit more quickly, bigger changes you might want to give some more lead time. But that’s just critically important for this particular program.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kayla Owens, co-founder of Friends of VMSDEP, called Monday’s JLARC presentation “disappointing, yet somewhat expected.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Owens asked for the JLARC data to be made publicly accessible, and for the group submit to an audit of its research process. She also challenged the state to commit to an independent study of VMSDEP.</span></p>
<p>Mitch Rubenstein, commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars Department of Virginia, said in a text message Monday that the VFW is reviewing the JLARC report.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The VFW urges all involved to put aside partisan politics and create a long term, sustainable path forward for this important program,” Rubenstein said.</span></p>

(Jonathan Ernst/Scott Olson/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, leads Republican Donald Trump by 11 points (52-41%) among Virginia likely voters, according to </span><a href="https://cnu.edu/wasoncenter/surveys/archive/2024-10-07.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a new poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> released Monday by the Wason Center for Civic Leadership at Christopher Newport University. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey found that 4% of voters remain undecided four weeks before the Nov. 5 election, while 3% say they will vote for someone else. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the U.S. Senate race, Democrat Tim Kaine leads Republican Hung Cao by 20 points, or 55% to 35%, with 8% saying they are undecided and 2% saying they will vote for someone else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Top-of-mind issues for Virginia likely voters include inflation and the economy (29%), threats to democracy (18%), immigration (11%), followed by abortion (10%). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the survey, voters think Harris would do a better job than Trump handling an array of policy issues, with a narrow lead on inflation and the economy (49% to 48%), a moderate advantage on threats to democracy (54-40%) and a large advantage on abortion (60-32%), racial inequality (61-31%) and climate change (61-29%). Trump has a narrow advantage over Harris on handling immigration (49-48%). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, Harris has a +9 favorability rating (51-42%) in Virginia, with 8% indicating they have no opinion or don’t know. Trump is underwater with a -22 favorability rating (36-58%); 6% say no opinion or don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, has a +12 favorability rating (47-35%), with 19% indicating no opinion or don’t know. Ohio Sen. JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, has a –16 favorability rating at 34 to 50%, with 16% indicating no opinion or don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine has a +23 favorability rating (53-30%) with 17% saying they have no opinion or don’t know. Cao has an even favorability rating (23-23%); however, he is less well known, with a majority of likely voters indicating no opinion or don’t know (54%). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With early voting underway in Virginia since Sept. 20, likely voters are “fairly enthusiastic” to vote in the elections, with 82% indicating they are either very enthusiastic (64%) or somewhat enthusiastic (18%). Democratic voters have an enthusiasm advantage with 75% indicating they are very enthusiastic compared to 68% of Republicans and 46% of Independents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While most Virginia likely voters surveyed have yet to cast their ballots, a higher percentage of Democrats say they have voted when compared to Republicans and Independents (22-11-9%). In past elections Democrats have been more likely to vote early than Republicans, though Gov. Glenn Youngkin made a push in the 2022 General Assembly elections for Republicans to vote early and has </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/20/as-early-voting-starts-in-virginia-political-parties-rally-their-bases/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advocated for early voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the current election cycle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results of the Wason poll are based on 800 interviews with registered Virginia voters who are likely general election voters, including 211 on landline and 589 on cell phone, conducted Sept. 28 to Oct. 4, 2024. The margin of error for the whole survey is +/-4.4%</span></p>

Tim Kaine, D-Va., at an interview in Richmond (Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury) and Hung Cao (courtesy of Hung Cao campaign)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The morning of Monday, April 16, 2007, is forever etched in Virginia Democratic U.S. Rep. Tim Kaine&#8217;s memory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On that tragic day, Seung-Hui Cho, an undergraduate student at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, killed 32 people and wounded 17 others in a mass shooting before taking his own life. The incident, carried out with two semi-automatic pistols, remains one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I still have a lot of almost PTSD kind of scar tissue about that,” said Kaine in a recent interview. At the time, he was in the second year of his four-year term as Virginia’s governor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, 17 years later, Kaine is seeking a third term in the U.S. Senate. The Democrat faces a challenge from Republican Hung Cao, a retired Navy captain and political newcomer. With </span><a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2024/virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">polling data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showing Kaine holding a comfortable lead, both candidates are ramping up their campaigns as they approach the final stretch.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="A3R7TVJDVd"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/02/kaine-and-cao-clash-on-immigration-the-economy-in-heated-debate-at-norfolk-state-university/">Kaine and Cao clash on immigration, the economy in heated debate at Norfolk State University</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Kaine and Cao clash on immigration, the economy in heated debate at Norfolk State University&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/02/kaine-and-cao-clash-on-immigration-the-economy-in-heated-debate-at-norfolk-state-university/embed/#?secret=VJiTIC8JOO#?secret=A3R7TVJDVd" data-secret="A3R7TVJDVd" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the Minnesota-born, Harvard-educated lawyer, who began his career in public service as a civil rights attorney before moving into politics, sensible gun regulations are one of the key issues defining Kaine’s campaign and setting him apart from his opponent. If reelected, it’s an area that he wants to continue to work on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We haven’t done enough yet to reduce gun violence,” Kaine said in the interview. “I had a teacher tell me not long ago, ‘when we do that moment of silence at the beginning of every day, I know every adult in the building is thinking, let today not be that day.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s children, parents, and teachers shouldn’t have to worry every day, Kaine added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So I do feel like there is more that can be done. Virginia has done some good things, and with the NRA headquarters here, we ought to be able to pass some of these gun safety laws in Congress,” he said, referring to universal background checks, closing loopholes in gun sales, and banning assault weapons, measures he has advocated for in his time on Capitol Hill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout his 12-year tenure in the Senate, Kaine has been a steadfast advocate for progressive policies, focusing on healthcare, education, and climate change. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His bipartisan efforts relating to military issues — such his role in sponsoring the War Powers Consultation Act, which seeks to clarify the role of Congress in war decisions, and his support of the expansion of the GI Bill and improving mental health services for military personnel — have also helped solidify his reputation in a state with a significant military presence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine’s incumbency gives him a distinct advantage, not only due to name recognition but also thanks to his deep ties across the commonwealth. As the husband of Anne Holton — the daughter of former Republican Gov. Lindwood Holton — he has positioned himself as a champion of Virginia’s diverse demography, from residents of urban centers like Northern Virginia to the rural regions of the Shenandoah Valley and the Blue Ridge Mountains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Showing up is part of the job, and I tell people if somebody won’t show up for it, they’re never gonna stand up for you,” Kaine said about his strategy for remaining a popular contender in Virginia, a state that has leaned Democratic in more recent times, but that still remains open to electing Republicans, as Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s 2021 victory has shown.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I want people to know that I will stand up for them and you do that by being everywhere. Plus I enjoy it. I mean, I love the job, but more than the 36 weeks a year I’m in D.C., I love the 16 weeks when I’m in Virginia, and figuring out ways I can help with whatever challenges or aspirations people have.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine’s opponent Cao, who immigrated to the U.S. as a child after fleeing communist Vietnam, presents a sharp contrast to the Democratic incumbent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a platform closely aligned with former President Donald Trump — who endorsed him earlier this year — the Loudoun County resident has focused heavily on issues like immigration and national security, echoing Trump&#8217;s “America First” rhetoric. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cao declined to be interviewed for this story, but he has openly supported Trump’s plan to deport all undocumented immigrants that are currently in the country. Cao also supports the former president’s effort to build a border wall, which he began during his first term in the White House.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We will build the wall, we will secure the border through advanced technology, we will support the Border Patrol and border states, and we will repel this invasion,” Cao said on </span><a href="https://www.hungforva.com/border/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">his website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Republican has also echoed Trump’s calls for imposing more tariffs for imports from countries like China, which </span><a href="https://www.hungforva.com/economy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">he called </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">“an existential threat” to the United States. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is no excuse for American exports to be taxed at a higher rate than Chinese imports,” Cao said on his website. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a former Navy special operations officer who has served in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Somalia, Cao has lamented the drop in the U.S. military’s recruitment numbers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2013, male enlistments have decreased by 35%, going from 58,000 men enlisting in 2013 to 37,700 in 2023, according to the </span><a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/06/14/armys-recruiting-problem-male.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">service data.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Meanwhile, female recruitment has hovered around 10,000 recruits each year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our military must have the resources it needs to face growing instability around the world. Right now, we face abysmal recruiting numbers and deficits in overall readiness. This is a leadership problem first and foremost and our active duty servicemembers deserve better,” Cao said on his website. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead to the Nov. 5 election, Kaine conceded in the interview that at least the presidential contest will be close, in part because Democrats have failed to communicate what he called the economic victories of President Joe Biden’s administration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among these accomplishments, Kaine named the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which authorized $1.2 trillion for transportation and infrastructure spending with $550 billion of that figure going toward new investments and programs, such as the Green New Deal, and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I do blame Democrats’ messaging, because if you ask people, ‘If you see a Republican ad on TV, what are they talking about?’ Maybe inflation, something about the economy,” Kaine said. “When they see a Democrat on TV, what Democrats talk about is access to abortions, a really important issue, but you often don’t see Dems really leaning into the economy. That’s why our first ad, which is up on TV, is an economy ad.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine said that his positions on the economy contrast sharply with those of Cao, his Republican opponent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He opposes the infrastructure bill, and he opposed the inflation Reduction Act, including all these clean energy investments,” Kaine said. “I mean, we’re going to have a vote on reauthorizing the infrastructure bill in 2026. I’ll vote, yes, he’d vote no. For those who care about infrastructure investments, like roads, rail, bridges, ports, broadband, you know, electric transmission, offshore wind, I’m going to keep these.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At their only </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/02/kaine-and-cao-clash-on-immigration-the-economy-in-heated-debate-at-norfolk-state-university/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">televised debate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Norfolk State University last week, the two candidates clashed over a variety of positions, including abortion rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Kaine said that he has introduced legislation that would codify Roe v. Wade in order to statutorily protect women’s access to abortion, Cao accused his opponent of supporting “unlimited abortion” up to and including after birth.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What he wants to do is take it out of the hands of voters,” Cao said at the debate. “I want to keep it back in the hands of voters because I don’t want a senator from California or a congressman from Idaho making decisions for Virginians.”</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;They don’t like abortion, but Kaine’s GOP challengers say they won’t seek a federal ban&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/17/they-dont-like-abortion-but-kaines-gop-challengers-say-they-wont-seek-a-federal-ban/embed/#?secret=zKPQ5Q9lBa#?secret=606MQASWXl" data-secret="606MQASWXl" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cao also said that Kaine has had a 99% failure rate in passing legislation, claiming that only three out of the 220 bills Kaine has introduced during his time in the Senate have been successful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Kaine challenged the accuracy of this claim, Cao responded with a remark that drew a reaction from the audience: “There are two truths in the world — never walk into a Target store wearing a red shirt, and never go against an Asian when it comes to math.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Larry Sabato, the director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, said that although Virginia’s Senate race “isn’t even vaguely competitive,” Kaine has shown no fear of running tough races. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“His first for the city council in Richmond wasn’t easy. Same for lieutenant governor in 2001, and governor in 2005. Kaine’s first race for the Senate was against a former governor and senator — George Allen — who had barely been ousted in 2006. He won them all,” Sabato said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine’s contest against Cao is more like 2018, when Kaine defeated Corey Stewart, his Republican challenger, with 57-41% of the votes, Sabato added, “though 2024 isn’t as Democratic a year as 2018 was.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cao could only have a chance if he were running a “vigorous first-rate campaign” while Trump was winning Virginia, Sabato said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Neither precondition applies. Even Republicans complain that Cao hasn’t been seen enough on the trail. And despite a questionable poll or two, Trump isn’t winning Virginia.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Kaine could be considered lucky given these circumstances, in politics and other parts of life, “you still make your own luck to a great degree,” Sabato said. “Kaine is smart, hard-working, and reflects the state’s values and partisan lean. That’s why he’s on his way to a third term.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine also has a significant fundraising advantage, having raised almost $16 million for his reelection bid, as opposed to Cao, who has raised just a little over $3 million, </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/elections/us-senate/?year_and_type=2024regular" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Virginia Public Access Project, a nonprofit tracking candidates and campaign money in Virginia politics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Cao vowed at the NSU debate to certify the presidential election if Harris won on Nov. 5 — “If she won, then she won,” he said — Kaine warned the  audience that his opponent had affirmed in a recent </span><a href="https://virginiaconservatives.net/candidate-survey-2022#results_anchor" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Constitutional Conservatives survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that if elected, he would sponsor legislation to release and seek compensation for the offenders jailed for their role in the violent riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have experienced January 6th, I’ll never forget this, I&#8217;ll never forget,” Kaine told The Mercury. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I never want it to be repeated, whether I’m in the Senate or not, it should never be repeated. But we certainly saw it, and we could see it again. I do not expect Donald Trump to lose this race and do anything other than raise hell. If we win, I still think he’ss going to raise hell and pretend that he won. So we have to be prepared for that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine said that with the 250th anniversary of the United States around the corner, there is also a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">forward looking aspect to the debate around the events of Jan. 6. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every generation has to carry the mantle of putting the torch of a functioning democracy in the hands of the next generation,” Kaine said. And by stepping aside, Biden had done just that, he added. “The president made a patriotic decision, and those of us who are in leadership positions now, we have to be able to put the torch of democracy in the hands of the next generation.”</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin, in blue jeans, assesses storm damage caused by Hurricane Helene in Grayson County on Sept. 29, 2024. (Courtesy of Christian Martinez, Office of Governor Glenn Youngkin)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Restoration efforts in Southwest Virginia continue after Hurricane Helene’s deadly impact, as Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin asserted that blaming the intense storm and the future unpredictability of weather on climate change was a distraction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While giving an update on damage assessments from the storm that made landfall in Florida last week and dumped several inches of rain, with two confirmed tornados, in the mountainous regions of Virginia, Youngkin urged people to call 1-800-621-3362, go to FEMA.gov or use a FEMA app download to seek help and start documenting the application process for federal recovery funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Also, there are regional centers that are being established by FEMA and (partner)with the Virginia Department of Emergency Management in the area,” Youngkin said, adding people are going door-to-door to help people fill out forms as part of the Major Disaster Declaration the state </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/02/post-helene-virginia-granted-major-disaster-declaration-access-to-federal-funding-for-recovery/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">received</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a really important process,” Youngkin said. “Many people don’t know how to fill out these forms. Getting them the help that they need is critically important.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the update from federal, state and local officials at the Virginia Department of Emergency Management Emergency Operations Center in North Chesterfield Friday morning, VDEM spokesman John Elmore reported that 519 homes had been counted as damaged so far, with 44 destroyed, and 475 damaged or affected. The total number of impacted businesses, ranging from small ones to large manufacturers, had climbed to 83. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These counts, which don’t include damages to local government buildings, are expected to go up. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two people died in the immediate wake of the storm, and Youngkin said that everybody has been accounted for. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 13,700 people are still without power in the region, Youngkin said, after about 96% of outages had been restored. Crews are using helicopters to deliver telephone poles to the hard to reach areas that remain. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Out of the 287 cell-phone service towers that were knocked out, 14 still needed to be fixed, the governor added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, 28 water systems are under a boil advisory, and Youngkin urged everyone in the region to flush systems and seek replacement pumps, particularly for well users that comprise a vast majority of residents in the area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schools in “many counties” remained closed Friday, while others were having delays, Youngkin said. Waivers have been requested by the federal government so meal services for disadvantaged families could be extended to all school children. About 40,000 meals had been given out, in addition to grassroots efforts, as a medical reserve corps of professionals from other regions in the states have trekked to the impacted area to help with medication, oxygen tanks and wheelchairs that “have been just washed away.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two primary roads remain impassible, and 52 secondary rods are closed, and U.S. Route 58 has about a 1.5 mile stretch that is “absolutely impossible,” Youngkin added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is going to be a long restoration rebuild process, but I am confident that if we can just keep focus, and not allow the standard ‘it’s been two weeks now and we’re moving on to the next issue’ to settle in, because I will not allow that to happen,” Youngkin said, adding that Southwest Virginia will rebuild “stronger than it was before.”</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin speaks to the staff at the Virginia Department of Emergency Management. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While taking questions from reporters, Youngkin declined to share his thoughts about climate change’s influence when a Virginia Mercury reporter asked about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nobody get distracted by that question,” said Youngkin, who in 2022 acknowledged climate change was a “</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-virginia-utilities-nuclear-power-generation-df7fa2571b5d875ac1fe9af1e0b52c35" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">threat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” in an interview about his energy plan, which called for a re-evaluation of the state’s Virginia Clean Economy Act. The landmark 2020 VCEA seeks to decarbonize the grid by mid-century to halt human-caused </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/06/12/as-smoke-from-canada-enters-virginia-research-links-climate-change-with-more-frequent-wildfires/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">climate change</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are right now in a moment of providing people a pathway back to hope,” Youngkin continued, before talking about the gratitude he received for his visits, including an afternoon visit by U.S. Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, the Republican vice presidential nominee, on Thursday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yesterday, when Senator Vance was there and everyone was saying ‘thank you for coming,’ this is a region of Virginia and America that has historically been forgotten,” Youngkin said. “I just have no time for folks who are trying to politicize this moment.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell said on the CBS news program </span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/deanne-criswell-fema-administrator-face-the-nation-transcript-09-29-2024/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Face the Nation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Sunday that  “In the past, when we would look at damage from hurricanes, it was primarily wind damage, with some water damage.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But now we’re seeing so much more water damage, and I think that is a result of the warm waters, which is a result of climate change,” Criswell said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After FEMA had denied relief requests from residents in the region in 2022 and 2021, the state dipped into $830 million in revenues from a carbon-market that requires electricity producers to purchase allowances for carbon emissions as another attempt to halt climate change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state directed $29 million of the funds, which were initially intended to increase flood protections and make homes energy efficient, to provide relief to residents. Youngkin pulled Virginia out of the market — the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative — calling it a “hidden tax,” since utilities can recover the costs of allowances from </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/05/regulators-approve-request-from-dominion-to-drop-rggi-fee-on-customer-bills/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ratepayers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislators used a budget amendment to appropriate any unused funds, which amounted to about $40 million at the start of the year, according to a </span><a href="https://www.wvtf.org/news/2024-10-03/youngkin-virginia-legislators-mull-legislative-steps-in-helene-recovery" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">by Radio IQ. A special session would be needed to pass a similar budget amendment or legislation to support the region ahead of the regular session scheduled to start in January.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve got to assess what we need,” Youngkin said when asked if he would call one.</span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><em>Editor&#8217;s note:</em> <em>The Virginia Mercury is not using the last names of the women in this article to protect their privacy and safety. The accounts of all three women have been verified with medical records and by a medical professional with knowledge of their experiences.</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nisa knew her third pregnancy was a non-starter. She didn’t know that she would fear death for 18 days while trying to get an abortion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I felt like I had a ticking time bomb inside of me,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is because Nisa has Von Willebrand Disease, a genetic blood disorder that prevents clotting. It puts her at higher risk for bleeding to death during things like injuries, surgeries, or if she were to have a miscarriage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her first two pregnancies had been challenging and once she had been diagnosed with the blood disorder, she’d decided not to have more children for fear of complications or passing the disease onto others. By the time she became unexpectedly pregnant last summer, she was also in the throes of Stage 4 endometriosis symptoms — a diagnosis that would later lead to her having a hysterectomy. She&#8217;d also had an endometrial ablation to treat endometriosis symptoms before finding out she was pregnant last summer — placing her in a more at-risk pregnancy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under 10 weeks of gestation at the time, Nisa said she otherwise would have been able to take abortion medication. With her disease, she couldn’t. Surgical abortions also posed challenges because she needed to have specific medications and extra blood on standby. The procedure was denied by her local providers in coastal Virginia, she said, and the local Planned Parenthood facilities didn’t have the resources. A hospital was her best bet for completing the procedure, but it took 18 days to sort out an abortion at VCU Health in Richmond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite Virginia’s status as the least-restrictive Southern state for abortion access, Nisa wonders how many others may be falling through health care gaps as she did. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia is not safe. We think we’re safe, but we’re not,” she said. “How do you treat a person who isn’t the standard in this post-Roe world?”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virginia’s barriers</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade two and a half years ago, states around the country have shored up their protections or enacted various bans and restrictions. And though Virginia is the least restrictive Southern state — and a bastion for out-of-state patients — a </span><a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA3324-2.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioslocal_richmond&amp;stream=top" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> indicates some hurdles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, abortion is </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title18.2/chapter4/article9/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legal for any reason until around 26 weeks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with limited exceptions for later abortions. In those cases, three physicians must attest that someone’s physical or mental health would be “irremediably impaired” if a pregnancy were to continue. Conversely, surrounding states have </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/florida-abortion-ban-six-weeks-virginia-susan-swecker/article_e5c13ac8-0708-11ef-9bfa-831eade60f7b.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">near-total bans or limits as low as 6 weeks on the procedure.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key findings from the RAND Corporation report noted how abortion law is currently housed in Virginia’s criminal code (a Class 4 felony for unlawfully conducted abortions), the three-physician threshold for some abortions, and lack of clarity on the “ability to provide second-trimester abortions in non-hospital settings.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. William Fitzhugh, who runs clinics in Richmond, Newport News and Roanoke, said he’s seen a flux of out-of-state patients over the past two years. But sometimes, he’s had to refer patients elsewhere. For example, by the time a Tennessee patient had made it to one of his clinics, she was 28 weeks along, he said, so he referred her to Maryland where there are no gestation limits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I worry for other women in gray areas like mine,” Nisa said. “I had family that could help watch my kids and I didn’t have to travel far, but I still had to travel in my own state. There are women who can’t take time off work or have childcare.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">North Carolina resident Kishia ended up having to take time off work and her children had to miss school for a few days so they could travel to Fitzhugh&#8217;s Richmond clinic for her 14-year-old daughter to get an abortion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She called the experience “H-E-double-L.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More important, Kishia said, is the fact that her daughter Myasia has been in pain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At 19-weeks of gestation, she couldn’t legally obtain an abortion in North Carolina and being further into gestation means a more invasive abortion procedure. In these cases, small rods are typically placed in the cervix to prepare it for an abortion to occur the next day. Kishia said the family would have sought an abortion sooner if they could have. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Myasia has had regular menstrual cycles, her mother said, and with </span><a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/22044-bleeding-during-pregnancy" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bleeding in early gestation common in 15% to 25% of pregnancies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Myasia hadn’t realized right away that she was pregnant. By the time she did and told her mother, when they visited a clinic in Charlotte they were told she was too far along for the state&#8217;s 12-week limit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People get abortions for different reasons,” Kishia stressed as she noted that people can have medical issues, or be young and not emotionally or financially ready to care for an unplanned child. In Myasia’s case, she is still technically a child herself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a smile, Kishia said that she is grateful her family was able to connect with an abortion fund to offset travel costs. She said she doesn’t plan on having to go through their ordeal again. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kishia said she’s somewhat tuned in to state, congressional, presidential and gubernatorial elections. As her chance to vote in North Carolina this fall approaches, she’ll be thinking about abortion access and other reproductive rights. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t think this should ever be banned,” she said. </span></p>
	<div class="newsroomSidebarContainer ">
	<div class="newsroomSidebar"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abortion laws had been a flashpoint in Virginia’s state legislative elections last year as Democrats promised to place protections in the state’s constitution and many Republicans proposed capping most abortions at 15 weeks of gestation. Their idea, approved by Gov. Glenn Youngkin, noted exceptions for rape, incest and life-threatening situations for the pregnant person but </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/two-women-two-pregnancies-two-agonizing-decisions/article_24e5d5fc-742d-11ee-984d-6befc702d5d0.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lacked provisions for severe fetal anomalies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (which are often detected at or after 15 weeks). Ultimately, Democrats retained control of the Senate and gained control of the House of Delegates.</span></div>

Conversely, Alexandria passed an </span><a href="https://www.alxnow.com/2023/04/13/zoning-change-that-makes-abortion-clinics-easier-to-open-in-alexandria-draws-ire-of-local-catholic-leadership/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioslocal_richmond&amp;stream=top" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ordinance to make it easier for clinics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to open and Richmond recently </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2024-07-23/planned-parenthood-richmond-clinic-city-council-land-transfer" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">transferred land for cheap to Planned Parenthood to set up another clinic in town.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the state level, democratic  lawmakers still plan to strengthen Virginia’s abortion access laws. In 2025, they plan to introduce a proposed constitutional amendment. It will need to pass two years in a row with a House of Delegates election in between before appearing on statewide ballots for voters to approve or reject. Placing protections in the constitution would make them less susceptible to partisan shifts in the legislature over time. Even Republican-leaning states have approved similar ballot measures in recent years, showing that it is not a totally partisan issue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wouldn’t be the first time Virignia has tried to enshrine abortion access in its constitution. </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/house-panel-votes-down-abortion-rights-amendment-extradition-bill/article_aad3cc5a-af07-11ed-8954-a369717bdbc1.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar proposals have failed </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the two previous legislative sessions. A sticking point had been language that GOP lawmakers alleged was too broad and would go further than Roe’s legal framework.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The language, much like language in other states’ passed </span><a href="https://legislature.vermont.gov/Documents/2022/Docs/BILLS/PR0005/PR0005%20As%20adopted%20by%20the%20Senate%20and%20the%20House%20Official.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">amendments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, would declare people have a right to abortion unless there is a “compelling state interest.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where Roe balanced the right to obtain an abortion and health of the pregnant person with the potential life of a fetus, constitutionally protecting access within a state would operate similarly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s unclear what the language of the next attempted abortion amendment  would be but Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield — who plans to co-sponsor it again — said there will be more to discuss later this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are still working on the language to ensure that our constitutional amendment effectively protects safe and legal access to abortion in Virginia.”</span></p>

(Bill Hinton/Getty Images)</p><p>Many state chief information and security officers say they don’t have the budget, resources, staff or expertise to feel fully confident in their ability to guard their government networks against cyber attacks, according to the new Deloitte-NASCIO Cybersecurity Study of officials in all 50 states and D.C.</p>
<p>“The attack surface is expanding as state leaders’ reliance on information becomes increasingly central to the operation of government itself,” said Srini Subramanian, principal of Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP and the company’s global government and public services consulting leader. “And CISOs have an increasingly challenging mission to make the technology infrastructure resilient against ever-increasing cyberthreats.”</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/public-sector/2024-deloitte-nascio-cybersecurity-study.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biennial cybersecurity report,</a> released Monday, outlined where new threats are coming from, and what vulnerabilities these teams have.</p>
<p>Governments are relying more on servers to store information, or transmit it through the Internet of Things, or connected sensor devices. Infrastructure for systems like transit and power is also heavily reliant on technology, and all of the connected online systems create more opportunities for attack.</p>
<p>The emergence of AI is also creating new ways for bad actors to exploit vulnerabilities, as it makes phishing scams and audio and visual deepfakes easier.</p>
<p>Deloitte found encouraging data that showed the role of state chief information and security officer has been prioritized in every state’s government tech team, and that statutes and legislation have been introduced in some states that give CISOs more authority.</p>
<p>In recent years, CISOs have taken on the vast majority of security management and operations, strategy, governance, risk management and incident response for their state, the report said.</p>
<p>But despite the growing weight on these roles, some of the CISOs surveyed said they do not have the resources needed to feel confident in their team’s ability to handle old and new cybersecurity threats.</p>
<p>Nearly 40% said they don’t have enough funds for projects that comply with regulatory or legal requirements, and nearly half said they don’t know what percent of their state’s IT budget is for cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Talent was another issue, with about half of CISOs saying they lacked cybersecurity staffing, and 31% saying there was an “inadequate availability” of professionals to complete these jobs. The survey does show that CISOs reported better staff competencies in 2024 compared with 2020, though.</p>
<p>Staffing of CISOs themselves, due to burnout, has been an increasing issue since the pandemic, the report found. Since the 2022 survey, Deloitte noted that nearly half of all states have had turnover in their chief security officers, and the median tenure is now 23 months, down from 30 months in the last survey.</p>
<p>When it came to generative AI, CISOs seemed to see both the opportunities and risks. Respondents listed generative AI as one of the newest threats to cybersecurity, with 71% saying they believe it poses a “high” threat; 41% of respondents said they don’t have confidence in their team to be able to handle them.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="xXD7wyowWU"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/23/states-strike-out-on-their-own-on-ai-privacy-regulation/">States strike out on their own on AI, privacy regulation</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While they believe AI is a threat, many teams also reported using the technology to improve their security operations. Twenty one states are already using some form of AI, and 22 states will likely begin using it in the next year. <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/states-strike-out-their-own-ai-privacy-regulation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As with state legislation around AI</a>, it’s being looked at on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>One CISO said in the report their team is “in discovery phase with an executive order to study the impact of gen AI on security in our state”; another said they have “established a committee that is reviewing use cases, policies, procedures, and best practices for gen AI.”</p>
<p>CISOs face these budgetary and talent restrictions while they aim to take on new threats and secure aging technology systems that leave them vulnerable.</p>
<p>The report laid out some tactics tech departments could use to navigate these challenges, including leaning on government partners, working creatively to boost budgets, diversifying their talent pipeline, continuing the AI policy conversations and promoting the CISOs role in digital transformation of government operations.</p>

Tim Kaine, D-Va., and his Republican challenger Hung Cao, a retired Navy captain, drew stark contrasts in a debate that underscored their divergent views on the economy, immigration, green energy and the role of government in education. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lively, one-hour debate at the historically Black university marked the first and only televised encounter between the two candidates less than five weeks ahead of the Nov. 5 election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cao was the first to dodge a question when co-moderator Deanna Allbrittin of Richmond TV news station WRIC asked him what kind of deal he would try and broker with members of the International Longshoremen’s Association (ILA) who went on strike Tuesday, leaving cargo in limbo at East and Gulf Coast ports, including at the Port of Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The economy is hitting us all the same way, that’s exactly why the ILA is doing the boycott right now and going on strike,” Cao said. “The only people better off today than ever four years ago are illegal aliens, criminals, and senators like Tim Kaine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cao said that the U.S. is spending “billions of dollars a day to house and feed illegal aliens” — money that he believes would be better spent supporting local economies and benefitting American workers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Again, they’re hurting because of the immense inflation that is going on right now,” Cao said of the longshoremen when pressed again by Allbrittin about what “a good deal” between the ILA and the the United States Maritime Alliance would look like.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Ciy6cUgvR6"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/cargo-delays-expected-as-workers-strike-at-east-gulf-coast-ports-including-port-of-virginia/">Cargo delays expected as workers strike at East, Gulf Coast ports, including Port of Virginia</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Cargo delays expected as workers strike at East, Gulf Coast ports, including Port of Virginia&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/cargo-delays-expected-as-workers-strike-at-east-gulf-coast-ports-including-port-of-virginia/embed/#?secret=vk2nT5aeD3#?secret=Ciy6cUgvR6" data-secret="Ciy6cUgvR6" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Just like with the hurricane that&#8217;s going on right now, where&#8217;s the leadership? Joe Biden is on the beach, Kamala Harris is with a bunch of billionaires doing a fundraiser, and Tim Kane is at a pig roast. If it has to do with Ukraine, or if it’s about illegal aliens, they’re all over it. But if you’re an American, you’re on your own.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Responding to Allbrittin’s question, Kaine said that the longshoremen haven’t had a new contract in six years, and that they were entitled to better treatment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s what I would be urging if I was in the room,” he said, adding that he was on the phone earlier on Wednesday with acting U.S. Secretary of Labor Julie Sue. “If you’re in the room, what you’re doing is you&#8217;re trying to get the sides to come closer, and that&#8217;s what they’re doing. We are narrowing the differences, and I think we’re gonna find a deal.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine, who is seeking a third term in the U.S. Senate, has previously served as the mayor of Richmond from 1998 to 2001, lieutenant governor from 2002 to 2006, and governor of Virginia from 2006 to 2010. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Senate, Kaine has focused on issues such as national security, education, and healthcare — a background that he touted repeatedly at Wednesday’s debate and used to position himself as the best choice for continued leadership in the Senate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The choice is pretty clear for Virginians: do you want results or you want extremism?” Kaine said. “When I was governor, we were the best state for business, the best educated and best managed state. In the Senate, I’ve worked on powerful legislation so that we are building again with infrastructure, we’re making again with manufacturing, and we’re innovating.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In return, Cao, a former special operations officer in the Navy who served in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Somalia before his first unsuccessful run for political office challenging U.S. Rep. Jennifer Wexton, D-Loudoun, in 2022, used his background as an immigrant to proclaim his patriotism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When Vietnam fell, we had nowhere to run to. But this great country called the United States took us in and gave us an opportunity and gave us life,” Cao said. “But this country has taken a dark turn and the Democrats are turning this country into whatever I ran away from.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both candidates presented different visions for how to improve economic conditions in a country still struggling with inflation, price gouging and a cost of living that remains higher than at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic more than four years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Cao, the answer lies in American energy independence, which he called “the crux of everything.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats under the administration of President Joe Biden have made the United States dependent on oil “from countries that hate us, you know, Iran and Venezuela and the Middle East,” Cao said. “We need to be energy independent in this country, and that means unleashing all the energy we can get in order to bring forth American power.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cao also said that he would support former President Donald Trump’s plan for slapping new tariffs — basically important taxes — on foreign goods entering the United States, which he said would create more factory jobs, shrink the federal deficit and lower food prices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we need to do is not tax our industries here, what we need to do is tax other countries bringing in goods, because our people are getting tax here and when they bring abroad as well,” Cao said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine countered that under the Biden administration, the United States is producing more domestic energy than at any time in the nation’s history. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The good news is the production is nuclear, which I support, natural gas, which I support, but also wind and solar, and that is making a huge difference in the economy right here in Hampton Roads, with the Chesapeake announcement of GreenLink building a manufacturing facility here,” Kaine said, referring to the plans by a subsidiary of South Korea-based LS Cable &amp; System to spend over $680 million to build a submarine cable manufacturing facility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine added that the U.S. economy has rebounded faster than any other nation after the pandemic, which he said was owed, in part, to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act signed by Biden in 2021 and 2022. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Fed just dropped rates and they are signaling that they’re gonna do it again,” Kaine said. “What would I do? Let’s continue to invest in clean energy that’s affordable.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine and Cao both clashed on their views of immigration, when the Republican nominee skirted a question by co-moderator Tom Schaad of WAVY-TV whether he supports a plan proposed by former president Trump to mass-deport all undocumented immigrants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you come here illegally, then you need to leave, especially if you’re a violent crime person,” Cao said, adding that Immigration and Customs Enforcement data recently provided to Congress showed that more 13,000 immigrants convicted of homicide are living outside of ICE detention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine responded that he had supported “strong immigration policies” since he was first elected to the Senate, including a proposal that included $45 billion in border security investment which was blocked by Senate Republicans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In 2018, I cobbled together a bill with $25 billion for border security in exchange for protection for Dreamers. President Trump said that he would support it, but when the Senate introduced the bill in a bipartisan fashion, he told them to kill it,” Kaine said. “As soon as we can get Republicans to work for common sense immigration reform, we can keep folks from coming here illegally and we can also have the workforce that America needs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Schaad asked both candidates whether they supported “some form” of reparations for the descendants of enslaved Americans, Kaine and Cao agreed in a rare moment of bipartisanship that the best way to try and eliminate persistent inequalities is to focus on education. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have been a proud backer of funding for HBCUs like Norfolk State, helping this university to get funding for STEM careers for students, helping HBCUs start medical schools, and training the next generation of classroom teachers,” Kaine said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cao concurred, calling education the “only equalizer out here.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our country needs to heal, and we cannot heal if we continue picking at the scabs. That’s why I want to make sure that all Americans have the ability to go to school,” he said. </span></p>

Jen Kiggans faces Democratic challenger Missy Cotter Smasal this year in Virginia’s 2nd Congressional District. Both Navy veterans have been involved in their local communities for years – Kiggans as a former state senator and Smasal as a member of the Chesapeake Bay Commission. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While both women share some priorities, like reducing inflation and the costs of living, their divergence on abortion policy is something Smasal and Democrats are hoping can help flip the district. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Kiggans and Republicans hope that maintaining control of the House of Representatives can put America closer to completing former president Donald Trump’s proposal of building a wall along the U.S. &#8211; Mexico border. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smasal has the </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/virginia-congress-smasal-kiggans-hakeem-jeffries/article_955a0eac-d5bc-11ee-99ea-4f07936040ca.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">endorsement of democratic New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the likely next Speaker of the House should Democrats gain the majority there, while Kiggans </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/28/trump-rallies-in-chesapeake-backed-by-virginia-governor-gop-leaders/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">appeared at a rally in Chesapeake this summer for Trump</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Gov. Glenn Youngkin</span><a href="https://x.com/GlennYoungkin/status/1837129505871184158" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> boosted her during a Fox News segment </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in Virginia Beach on the first day of early voting. They’ve also both had helping hands from </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/27/national-dems-to-ship-2-5m-to-state-parties-aiming-beyond-presidential-battlegrounds/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">national political groups</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virginia’s 2nd Congressional District: Republican lean, pockets of Democratic support</h4>

	</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_39960" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:1490px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/va02-map_supreme-court-of-virginia/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-39960 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VA02-map_Supreme-Court-of-Virginia.png" alt="" width="1490" height="1008" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VA02-map_Supreme-Court-of-Virginia.png 1490w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VA02-map_Supreme-Court-of-Virginia-300x203.png 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VA02-map_Supreme-Court-of-Virginia-1024x693.png 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VA02-map_Supreme-Court-of-Virginia-768x520.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1490px) 100vw, 1490px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Virginia Congressional District 2 (courtesy Supreme Court of Virginia)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A drive along Route 13 on the Eastern Shore shows Kiggans signs sprinkled along much of the highway, signaling the district’s Republican lean. But pockets in Northampton and Accomack went for Kiggan’s Democratic opponent Elaine Luria in 2022, as did portions of Chesapeake, Suffolk and Isle of Wight on Virginia’s mainland. Much of Virginia Beach, which anchors the district, is also Republican territory, but 51% of the area </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/localities/virginia-beach-city-va/election-results-map/?electype=general&amp;election=10135" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">showed up for President Joe Biden in 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Despite the GOP lean, the district has oscillated between the parties over the years and is among several competitive ones in Virginia and around the nation to help determine partisan control of the U.S. House of Representatives. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Candidates’ local impact</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smasal said constituent services is something that most excites her about potentially becoming a congresswoman. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That&#8217;s one of the most interesting parts,” she said. “And when I go across the district and (people) have stories for me … they remember when somebody in Elaine Luria’s congressional office helped them out.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiggans, whose campaign did not follow through on organizing an interview with The Mercury, has kicked it local with some of her advertising. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent digital advertisements featured the refrain “</span><a href="https://x.com/JenKiggans/status/1834947865824612859" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">that’s Jen Kiggans!</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” as people noted some of her voting records to include supporting veteran health care. Home to the largest naval base in America, veterans and active duty service members make up a sizable portion of the 2nd District. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, she supported the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/8580" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” which includes funding for VA health care programs and benefits. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Reproductive health</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As they prepare for an upcoming debate next month, a poll from Christopher Newport University released on Sept. 13 showed Kiggans with a </span><a href="https://cnu.edu/news/2024/09/13-cnu-wason/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">five point lead</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over Smasal. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also showed that surveyed voters trust Kiggans more with veterans’ concerns while Smasal is more trusted to handle reproductive rights issues like abortion access.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pew Research Center shows 55% of Virginians believe abortion should be </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religious-landscape-study/database/state/virginia/views-about-abortion/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in all or most cases. A top issue for Smasal, she hopes it’s key to unseating Kiggans so that she can help restore federal protections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People are talking to me constantly about protecting reproductive rights,” Smasal said. “It&#8217;s really the number one thing that I&#8217;m hearing from people they&#8217;re concerned about.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smasal took issue with Kiggans last year over how the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act played out when it passed the House and failed to progress in the Senate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill was part of a hullabaloo between parties with President Joe Biden’s administration </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/H.R.-8580-%E2%80%94-Military-Construction-and-Veterans-Affairs-and-Related-Agencies-Appropriations-Act-2025-SAP.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">opposing it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in part, for a provision that would revoke veteran access to funding should they need to travel out of state for an abortion if the location of their duty assignment bans the procedure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over in the U.S. Senate Alabama Republican Tommy Tuberville </span><a href="https://alabamareflector.com/2023/12/05/tuberville-relents-on-months-long-blockade-of-most-military-nominees-blaming-democrats/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">held up military promotions in protest over the Biden administration’s VA  abortion travel policy.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> At the time, Kiggans told the media that she didn’t agree with his method but supported his reasons.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Taxpayers should not be funding elective procedures,” she </span><a href="https://www.wavy.com/news/politics/local-lawmakers-react-to-block-of-hundreds-of-military-promotions-by-alabama-senator-over-abortion-policy" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told an NBC affiliate in Hampton Roads </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">last summer. “If I wanted to get a Hollywood nose job in California, I do not expect the Navy to pay for my travel expenses to get there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Smasal stressed the complexities of why someone may want or medically need an abortion and how the national patchwork of state laws is creating various additional barriers for people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don&#8217;t know how any female veteran could do that to other service women,” Smasal told Virginia Mercury in a recent interview.  &#8220;She went to Congress and voted to restrict reproductive rights, so she&#8217;s chosen to be more extreme.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>But Kiggans took aim at Smasal in a <a href="https://x.com/JenKiggans/status/1839824215807078560" target="_blank">recent video on her social media</a> and asserted that Smasal is lying when referring to Kiggans as someone who is &#8220;extreme.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the video, Kiggans cited her status as the 19th most bipartisan member of congress from a <a href="https://www.thelugarcenter.org/ourwork-Bipartisan-Index.html" target="_blank">Lugar Center and Georgetown University ranking report</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe it is an issue that should be legislated at the state level,&#8221; Kiggans added to clarify her abortion policy preferences. &#8220;I&#8217;ve always been an advocate for women to choose life, allowing for exceptions in the cases of rape, incest and the life of the mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no mention of <a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/two-women-two-pregnancies-two-agonizing-decisions/article_24e5d5fc-742d-11ee-984d-6befc702d5d0.html" target="_blank">fetal anomalies</a>, many of which are detected at or after 15 weeks of gestation.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while Kiggans supports abortion laws being up to individual states, she has also </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/13/virginia-democrats-do-not-support-infanticide-but-heres-why-trump-keeps-saying-they-do/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">echoed a false claim</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Democrats support it to “</span><a href="https://jenforcongress.com/issues/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the moment of birth.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span></p>
<p>On other reproductive health laws, both women have expressed support for protecting contraception access and family planning procedures like in vitro fertilization. As<span style="font-weight: 400;"> the incumbent, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiggans has </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/4626/cosponsors" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voted for expanded contraception access</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://mace.house.gov/media/press-releases/protecting-fertility-rights-urgent-legislation-addressing-deepening-concerns" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cosponsored a resolution to protect IVF</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Immigration views</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Immigration policy has featured prominently in both presidential and congressional campaigns this year. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans and Democrats tend to diverge on solutions when it comes to concerns about immigration. Republicans have favored ramping up deportations of people who enter America illegally while Democrats have proposed enhancing pathways to U.S. citizenship. This year, Democrats in congress worked with Republicans on </span><a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2024/05/24/bipartisan-border-bill-loses-support-fails-procedural-vote-in-u-s-senate/#:~:text=By%3A%20Ariana%20Figueroa%20%2D%20May%2024%2C%202024%207%3A15%20am&amp;text=The%20Senate%20bill%20failed%20to,aid%20package%20earlier%20this%20year." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">boosting funding for border security, but the efforts failed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nobody&#8217;s done enough to fix things,” Smasal said. “Both Democrats and Republicans have failed on this issue.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, she was glad to see Democrats coming to the table with Republicans on the bipartisan border deal that was toppled earlier this year. It’s something she would have supported and something Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris has </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/09/10/harris-slams-trump-for-killing-border-bill-in-debate-here-are-the-facts/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said she would support</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“(Republicans in Congress and Trump) wanted the political issue (for this election) as opposed to doing something substantial to actually help address the border,” Smasal said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She stressed how supporting border security efforts can help detect drugs like fentanyl entering the country and combat human trafficking. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I firmly believe we need to be security minded,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On related legislation, Kiggans has co-sponsored the “</span><a href="https://chavez-deremer.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/chavez-deremer.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/Summary%20-%20Defending%20Borders,%20Defending%20Democracies%20Act.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defending Borders, Defending Democracies Act.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” The </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7372/cosponsors%5C" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which has not progressed past introduction, would suspend entry of some immigrants at the U.S. border and require asylum seekers to “remain in Mexico” during adjudication of their immigration status. </span></p>
<p>She also voted for the &#8220;<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/2/all-actions" target="_blank">Secure The Border Act</a>&#8221; which would expedite construction of border barriers. It passed the House but did not clear the Senate.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On her website, Kiggans called the rise in border crossings a “self-inflicted crisis” that is “threatening the safety of Americans and emboldening cartels, which are making massive profits off of drug trafficking and exploiting vulnerable migrants.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Addressing inflation</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a local-yet-national issue, both candidates have stressed how they want to curb inflation and rising costs of living. Kiggans’ campaign website points to her support of the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3746/summary/00#:~:text=This%20bill%20increases%20the%20federal,work%20requirements%20for%20federal%20programs." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which passed congress and was signed into law by the president. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smasal </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">said that addressing affordable housing is a key part of addressing the cost of living. If elected, she aims to start by championing federal legislation to prevent large corporations from purchasing housing stock and raising prices or creating more short-term rentals in places like Virginia Beach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If everything is turned into an Airbnb, where are our teachers and our firefighters and our police officers going to find their housing?” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both women are also supportive of ways to help </span><a href="https://kiggans.house.gov/posts/kiggans-supports-bipartisan-bill-to-address-childcare-workforce-shortage" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">alleviate the nation’s growing childcare cost and access issues</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiggans called it an “unfortunate reality” that some parents are feeling forced to leave the workforce, take on debt or tap into their savings as a result of the growing issue. </span></p>

John McGuire, shown here campaigning with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene in Louisa County in May, won his first election in Virginia's 5th Congressional District earlier this month. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a sign of deepening divisions among Republicans in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District, at least four members of the district’s 37-member GOP Committee, including the vice chair, were ousted over the weekend, and another resigned after refusing to sign renewed loyalty pledges for state Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland, the party’s nominee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The four purged members and the resignee were among 25 Republican officials who in early June signed </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/06/06/top-gop-leaders-in-the-5th-district-urge-trump-to-reconsider-mcguire-endorsement/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an open letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> urging former President Donald Trump to reconsider his endorsement of McGuire, advocating instead for Trump’s support of U.S. Rep. Bob Good, R-Farmville, the incumbent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jim Herring, who has served as the committee’s vice chair for two years and the former chair of the Goochland County GOP, told members in an email Sunday that the Republican Party of Virginia’s decision to demand the renewed pledges was “unwarranted, unprecedented and unauthorized.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After consulting with Chris Marston, the RPV’s official legal counsel, other attorneys and past Republican officials, his belief was confirmed, Herring wrote in the email, which was obtained by The Mercury.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In fact, it is very similar to the actions of prosecutors against Donald Trump. They make up allegations, find a politically weaponized judge, and then convict him knowing that all of this will probably be overturned on appeal,” Herring wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire has been a source of contention within the party since he announced his bid for Congress just one week after winning his seat in the 10th state Senate District last year — particularly among those backing Good, who went on to lose to McGuire in the June 18 primary election by a mere 366 votes out of more than 62,000 cast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even after McGuire’s narrow victory was confirmed by a recount, which Good requested, and an </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/28/outcome-of-5th-district-gop-primary-unchanged-after-further-review-of-ballots/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the results, some Republican hardliners in the district have refused to accept the former Navy SEAL as their party’s nominee, instead turning to social media to launch </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/03/a-growing-number-of-5th-district-republicans-vow-to-write-in-good-on-nov-5/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a write-in campaign</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on behalf of Good, who has not publicly supported this effort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a Sept. 14 meeting of the executive committee of the RPV’s State Central Committee, the party’s 80-member governing body in Virginia, Jeff Ryer, chairman of the 1st Congressional District Committee and the spokesman for the Trump campaign in Virginia, expressed concern that McGuire lacked “fulsome support” in the 5th District, RPV Chair Rich Anderson said in a phone interview Monday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consequently, Ryer made a motion for the committee to require a renewed loyalty pledge from the 25 party officials who had signed the letter to Trump.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s an affirmation statement, I don’t call it a loyalty statement,” Anderson said. “It just reaffirms that they will support the eventual nominees that would come out of these contests, whether they are a primary or a party run process. And with all the contention down in the 5th District because of a hotly contested race, a number of our congressional district committee chairs were concerned that perhaps not all were going to support McGuire.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in his email to committee members, Herring, the former vice chair, alleged that top party officials decided to “dictate to the 5th District Committee” members who had signed the Trump letter that they would have to “sign a loyalty oath or get kicked out” of the Republican Party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This decision was NOT brought to the (whole) State Central Committee for review or approval, and most were not even aware of this action,” Herring wrote, adding that the committee then agreed to “send a letter to those affected” and set a deadline by which they had to return their signed pledges for Sept. 27 at 5 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The form they sent in their letter was similar to the loyalty oaths they had required before, with the exception of one part … the naming of specific candidates you pledge to support. To my knowledge, this action has not been done before, at least in the over four decades that I have been involved,” Herring wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryer said Monday that he made the motion to ask for the renewed pledges because based on several news accounts it had become apparent that what he believed to be “a false narrative was developing that leaders in the party were not fully supportive of our nominees.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryer pushed back against allegations that the loyalty pledges had been used to force 5th District Republicans on the record in an effort to get them removed from the party as a punishment for asking Trump to reconsider his endorsement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was my hope — and the hope of the executive committee — that all who had signed the June 6 letter would fulfill their previously professed pledge to support all our nominees, as required by the party plan,” Ryer said, adding that he had made his motion solely in the capacity of his role as the 1st District chair and a longtime member of the State Central Committee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Rick Buchanan, the chairman of the 5th District GOP Committee, in an email to Anderson and State Central Committee leadership sent after the deadline had passed on Friday afternoon pointed out that members had already signed similar pledges of support earlier this year, as a requirement under the RPV’s party plan to attend mass meetings and conventions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although he “immediately” forwarded the request for the renewed affirmations to the entire committee, Buchanan also said that no member of the State Central Committee had reached out to him directly or any of the district’s 24 unit chairs “to inquire about the necessity of this action as a remedy,” suggesting that the distrust between the two fractions was based on miscommunication.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hearsay and assumption lead directly to dysfunction. The truth can only be found by going straight to the source, and the SCC and RPV have yet to reach out to develop an understanding. Mr. Chairman, this is not the way to work together as brothers in our political fight against our common enemies,” Buchanan wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Singling out Republican officials from the 5th District for supporting the candidate “we felt was the best candidate in a primary is more than an overreach,” Buchanan said in the email. “This action is pay-back for sending the letter to President Trump. Though some question the veracity of the letter, we firmly stand behind everything the letter says.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buchanan declined to comment for this story Monday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In their letter to Trump, the district’s top GOP officials had hailed Good, the chairman of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, as a champion of America First policies “by introducing legislation to codify policies defunding chain migration and requiring that immigrants are self-sufficient.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his time in Congress, Good also offered multiple bills that would build upon Trump’s regulatory relief for businesses across the country, the party officials wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We the undersigned leaders of the 5th District Republican Congressional Committee strongly urge President Donald Trump to reconsider his endorsement of Congressman Bob Good’s opponent in the Republican Primary,” they concluded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After receiving the request for his renewed loyalty pledge, at least one 5th District Committee member — Glenn Mozingo of Cumberland County — handed in his resignation on Thursday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am writing to advise that I will not sign the pledge form that was enclosed with your letter dated September 16, 2024, and I am resigning as a member of the Cumberland County Republican Committee with immediate effect. I understand that my membership on the 5th District Congressional Committee will lapse as well,” Mozingo wrote in an email to RPV Executive Director Ken Nunnenkamp which was obtained by The Mercury. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mozingo wrote that he wasn’t aware of any reservations among 5th District Committee members regarding their loyalties to Trump or Hung Cao, the Republican nominee for U.S. Senate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Consequently, it is apparent that this is a transparent attempt to coerce each committee member to publicly go on record in support of John McGuire, which I will not do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although he signed the pledge, James Hankins, another 5th District vice chair, also lashed out against RPV leadership. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“On a personal leave I feel insulted by being asked to sign this,” Hankins wrote in an email to Anderson. “I am signing this form this one time. If I am ever asked to do this again, I will resign from all posts I hold with the Republican Party and I will never raise another dollar for the 5th.”</span></p>

Though he has not formally outlined specific proposals, the report noted previous comments from Trump and his vice presidential pick U.S. Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, and previous actions he took when president — such as his </span><a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/55195" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FY2020 budget proposal that would have cut federal support for health care</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of Trump’s other actions as president illustrate his opposition to a long-debated topic between Republicans and Democrats: the Affordable Care Act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often referred to as “Obamacare” by its opponents, the ACA was a hallmark of former democratic president Barack Obama’s administration. The act established a public insurance marketplace and prevented insurance companies from denying coverage based on preexisting conditions.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Trump’s first day as president in 2017, he issued an </span><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/24/2017-01799/minimizing-the-economic-burden-of-the-patient-protection-and-affordable-care-act-pending-repeal" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executive order to prompt its repeal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He also </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-gop-leaders-take-victory-lap-after-house-passes-trumpcare-n754896" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">celebrated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a repeal effort that passed the House before it failed in the Senate. In 2020 he also </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/politics/obamacare-trump-administration-supreme-court.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">supported a lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before the U.S. Supreme Court that sought to tear down ACA. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, over 20 million people </span><a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/marketplace-2024-open-enrollment-period-report-final-national-snapshot" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">utilize it </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">nationwide and nearly 400,000 Virginians could  pay more for their health insurance if the ACA were repealed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an example of what could be lost, the Harris campaign’s Virginia-based team used a Kaiser Family Foundation </span><a href="https://www.kff.org/interactive/subsidy-calculator/#state=va&amp;zip=23450&amp;income-type=percent&amp;income=325&amp;employer-coverage=0&amp;people=4&amp;alternate-plan-family=&amp;adult-count=2&amp;adults%5B0%5D%5Bage%5D=45&amp;adults%5B0%5D%5Btobacco%5D=0&amp;adults%5B1%5D%5Bage%5D=45&amp;adults%5B1%5D%5Btobacco%5D=0&amp;child-count=2&amp;children%5B0%5D%5Bage%5D=10&amp;children%5B0%5D%5Btobacco%5D=0&amp;children%5B1%5D%5Bage%5D=8&amp;children%5B1%5D%5Btobacco%5D=0" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">calculator tool</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to show how a middle class family based in Virginia Beach is currently eligible for about $9,000 per year as a premium tax credit to offset their coverage costs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his debate with Harris in early September, Trump said that he has “concepts of a plan” when it comes to health care policy if re-elected. He added that there are “concepts and options” for a cheaper system that he will outline in the “not-too-distant future.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report also takes aim at Trump’s “concepts” quote and the fact that he’s yet to fully articulate what his plans are. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“(Trump and Vance) may not want Americans to see the details of their plan, but Vice President Harris and Governor Walz won’t let them get away with hiding its effects,” Harris campaign senior policy advisor Brian Nelson said in a release. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But formal outlines should be on the horizon, Trump’s team said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As President Trump said, he will release more details, but his overall position on health care remains the same: bring down costs and increase the quality of care by improving competition in the marketplace,” Trump’s national campaign secretary Karolina Leavitt said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report was released ahead of a vice presidential debate on Tuesday where Harris’ running-mate Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minnesota, will face off against Vance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When pressed about their healthcare proposals on a recent episode of “Meet the Press,” </span><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/4880616-jd-vance-donald-trump-health-care/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vance said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “a lot of it comes down… to deregulating the insurance market so that people can choose a plan that actually makes sense for them.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a recent event in North Carolina, Vance also suggested a plan to </span><a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2024/09/18/vance-targets-inflation-immigration-at-raleigh-event/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">separate patients into different health insurance pools based on individual risks.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leavitt, of Trump’s campaign, accused Harris of showing “support for a socialist government takeover of our healthcare system that would force people off their private plans and result in lower quality care.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The accusation stems from Harris’ previous co-sponsorship of a “Medicare For All” bill when still a U.S. Senator as well as her </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/kamala-harris-wants-end-private-health-insurance-new-democratic-litmus-n964241?_nlid=QjzdJemnN7&amp;_nhids=PolxhrO3Xn" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">embrace of it </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">during her 2019 bid for president. </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/19/medicare-for-all-harris-progressives-2024-elections-00174447" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">She has since moved away from that stance </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">which has been popular with the more progressive wings of the Democratic party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris’ recent health care proposals have included protecting the ACA and continuing price negotiations on medications that started as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, a measure for which she cast the tie-breaking vote to proceed. A price </span><a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/4829873-trump-biden-insulin-price-cap/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cap on insulin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has emerged as a debate within a debate for Trump, as his administration had implemented a temporary cap on the drug while the Inflation Reduction Act made the cap law unless it is repealed by future congressional action. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Harris-Walz campaign infers that Trump and Vance’s “message to America is: ‘you’re on your own.’”</span></p>

But for the last 13 years, Republican Morgan Griffith has held the seat with little opposition, solidifying his status as the incumbent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That could change this election cycle as Democrat Karen Baker hopes to unseat the lawmaker from Salem. A native midwesterner who moved to Floyd County from South Carolina in 2014, she has spent the last seven months traveling thousands of miles criss-crossing the deeply rural and mountainous district. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39967" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:1476px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/va09_supreme-court-of-virginia/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-39967 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VA09_Supreme-Court-of-Virginia.png" alt="" width="1476" height="1000" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VA09_Supreme-Court-of-Virginia.png 1476w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VA09_Supreme-Court-of-Virginia-300x203.png 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VA09_Supreme-Court-of-Virginia-1024x694.png 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VA09_Supreme-Court-of-Virginia-768x520.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1476px) 100vw, 1476px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  (courtesy Supreme Court of Virginia)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baker’s campaign centers on a nonpartisan message focused on improving access to health care — an issue critical to the region’s residents, which is why she believes she can appeal to voters across the political spectrum and break Griffith’s long-standing hold on the seat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Baker takes pride in her decades-long record as a public servant — first as a trial lawyer for the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and as an administrative law judge for the Social Security Administration — she has never run for public office before, “except for treasurer in 11th grade, which I won,” she told The Mercury in a recent interview.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baker decided to challenge Griffith in Virginia’s most Republican district after being approached by “some concerned Democrats who felt it was important to have a credible candidate on the ballot. And so I said, well, if not me, then who?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 9th District, Virginia’s second largest, is a mostly sprawling and rugged region in the southwestern part of the state covering a large swath of rural and mountainous terrain, including the Appalachian region, stretching from Lee County in the west all the way to Bedford County in the east. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Known for its deep-rooted cultural ties to coal mining, agriculture, and manufacturing, the 9th has historically been a battleground for political power. But in recent years, it has leaned solidly Republican since Griffith flipped it in 2010, defeating Democratic U.S. Rep. Rick Boucher after 28 years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This district is a fascinating place, because it was the last stronghold for Southern Democrats and did not fall to the GOP until that year,” said David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People there respond to in-person retail politics, they want to see and speak to their candidates,” Richards added. “I think Baker can capitalize on this and she has the right idea by campaigning hard on the ground. But because Griffith has regularly won with over 60% of the vote, it will be a very steep climb for her.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By campaigning on access to health care, Baker brings her own experience in the field to the table. After her law career, she went to nursing school at Greenville Technical College in South Carolina. She became a registered nurse in 2011 and spent several years at a small rural hospital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There were rural hospitals before that may have been struggling in terms of their budgets, but now those hospitals either are closed, or they’ve become urgent cares, so we have maternity deserts where people have to drive hours over twisting mountains and secondary roads to get care,” Baker said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many residents in the district are unsatisfied by the services provided by </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/25/after-appalachian-hospitals-merged-into-a-monopoly-their-ers-slowed-to-a-crawl/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ballad Health</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a chain of hospitals that has a monopoly on medical care in Southwest Virginia, Baker said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People are upset about the quality of care because Ballad underpays its staff. It’s been a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/sen-warner-hopes-to-boost-funding-to-rural-hospitals-amid-obstetrics-closures/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">revolving door</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in terms of professionals coming fresh out of medical school, getting a couple of years under their belt and leaving for greener pastures.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To address this problem, Baker proposes scaling up the Program of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE), a Medicare and Medicaid program that provides health care services for adults 55 and older with chronic health conditions or disabilities. In addition, she wants to utilize the community health care centers in the district. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The majority of people in the district are already on Medicaid, so we have a template for creating better conditions with fairly simple enabling legislation to spread these two programs throughout,” Baker said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other issues on Baker’s campaign platform include the creation of a better jobs market that she hopes will retain more younger people in the district, and expanding access to public education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since launching her campaign in March, Baker said she has talked to thousands of voters in the district. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I go to concerts, flea markets, I’m looking for the people that wouldn’t automatically think to vote for me. In other words, leaning Republicans or Republicans. Those are the people that I need to get to know me and to like me in order for me to win, and so that’s where I am.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But despite the excitement among Democrats over Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential bid, Baker said she isn’t running on a national ticket. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s not my campaign, because nobody expects Harris to win in the 9th, and I can win because I am for everybody in this district. I tell people I’m a Democrat, but I don’t run out yelling I’m a Democrat. I run out saying, ‘I’m here for you, I will work for you.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When talking to voters, Baker said she always asks them about Griffith, her opponent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People sometimes go, who’s that?  And generally, I would say 80 to 90% of the time, people say, ‘he doesn’t do anything for us.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griffith, however, insists that he hasn’t become complacent in a district where he has previously run for reelection unopposed, underscoring that he takes Baker’s challenge seriously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Am I doing more than when I don’t have an opponent? Yes,” he told The Mercury in a phone interview earlier this week. “But I generally work the district pretty hard anytime I have an opponent. We’ve had about 350 stops in the last term in the district, averaging about four events on the days that I am here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Philadelphia native who grew up in Salem and returned home after graduating from Washington and Lee University School of Law in 1983, Griffith first ran for public office in 1993, when he was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates, where he served as the House Majority Leader for 10 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2010, he ousted Boucher, the 13-term Democratic incumbent in the 9th Congressional District, by 51-46%. In the most recent congressional election in 2022, Griffith was reelected to his sixth term after defeating Democrat Taysha DeVaughan by a staggering 73-27%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a legislator, Griffith said he was proud of his role in advocating for the Abandoned Mine Land Economic Revitalization Program (AMLER) to implement strategies that return former coal mining sites to productive uses. Since its creation in 2016, the program has brought more than $10 million to the district every year, Griffith said. </span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Data centers, proliferating statewide, could soon be built on mined lands in Southwest Virginia&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/15/data-centers-proliferating-statewide-could-soon-be-built-on-mined-lands-in-southwest-virginia/embed/#?secret=xA3zMQtvhq#?secret=SxopI0zG6W" data-secret="SxopI0zG6W" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his time in Congress, Griffith has also sponsored or supported legislation to push back against what he called high taxes, unnecessary regulation, and an over-reliance on foreign industry that have strangled private businesses in our communities and prevented job growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He has also introduced the </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=258609" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EPA Regulatory Relief Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to reduce what he considered burdensome regulations on hospitals, manufacturers, and other businesses in the district. The measure failed in the Senate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rebuking his opponent’s claims that he had done little to help expand health care in the 9th, Griffith said he has been a strong supporter of federally qualified health centers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have more than any other in the state of Virginia,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griffith also was part of a bipartisan effort to expand care options for people who experience strokes by introducing the </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=398682" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthering Access to Stroke Telemedicine ACT (FAST) Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2017, which helps stroke victims gain faster access to high-quality care through remote evaluation and treatment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m a big supporter of the telehealth concepts, of our federally qualified health centers, and of trying to make sure that we continue to pay our health care providers enough that they can make it,” Griffith said in the interview. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In June, Griffith touted his role in securing a $1.6 million federal grant benefitting the Piedmont Planning District’s Commission’s Route 122 Regional Corridor Plan, which was funded under the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in 2021 — which he voted against.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the interview, Griffith explained this contradiction by stating that as a congressman, he had two jobs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One is to legislate, and the other is to act like an ombudsman. On my legislative side, I still think it was bad policy. But on my ombudsman&#8217;s side, on the side that says I’m supposed to help the district, once it’s passed into law, I would be failing to do my job if I didn’t then advocate for those federal monies to come to the 9th District.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If reelected on Nov. 5, Griffith vows to continue advocating for what he considers issues that are in the best interest of the people in his district, such as “fighting for medicine, making sure that rural health is getting a fair shake,” and leading the charge against regulations trying to eliminate coal, among other priorities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to get broadband finished up, and that&#8217;s an important issue. I’m hopeful that that will actually happen in the next couple of years. But we just have to keep moving forward and I want to make sure that our tax rates are low,” Griffith said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Jan. 6, 2021, Griffith was one of </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/01/07/us/elections/electoral-college-biden-objectors.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">147 House Republicans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who voted against certifying the 2020 presidential election, which Democrat Joe Biden won by more than 7 million votes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost four years later, Griffith said that he never took the position that fraud was an issue during that election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Some people did, but I believe fraud is a purview of the states and not the federal government,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, he said that he had concerns with changes that bureaucrats in states like Arizona and Georgia had made to their election laws within 30 days of the election that had not been approved by the respective state legislatures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That is in violation of the federal law, therefore, those elections are subject to not being certified,” Griffith said, adding that he doesn’t foresee this happening again after this year’s election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t know that we’ll have the same problems that we had in the 2020 election.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this feature, we aim to highlight the frequency with which officials around Virginia are resisting public access to records on issues large and small — and note instances when the release of information under FOIA gave the public insight into how government bodies are operating. </span></i></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Chesterfield County police dispatch relayed break-in attempt before fatal shooting</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal Court records obtained by </span><a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/new-audio-charles-byers-shooting-sept-24-2024" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WTVR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> revealed information dispatchers gave Chesterfield police officers before they fatally shot Charles Byers on July 8, 2023.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the news station, police responded after a resident on Wycliff Court reported Byers breaking through a window to enter a home where he told the resident he thought he was at his family’s house and asked for water. Another resident reported Byers tried to enter his home and appeared to be “messed up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dispatcher relayed the breaking and entering attempt through the window to the officers. The officer, who fatally shot Byers as he was walking away from them with a hatchet in his hand, had asked about any crimes committed so far and if he made entry into anything. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Looks like he vandalized one residence. Other than that, I’m not seeing anything,” the dispatcher responded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Byers’ family is suing Chesterfield County over the death, arguing the crimes committed by him didn’t warrant the use of deadly force. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">County attorneys are seeking a dismissal, saying Byers had “squared up” with the officer and the reported crimes would lead a reasonable responding officer to believe a “potentially dangerous crime” was in the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The attorney for Byers’ family contended the officer was only aware of a misdemeanor, and that Byers never made a threatening motion with the hatchet toward the officers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A judge is considering whether the case has merit to continue. The Byers family is also suing HCA’s Chippenham Hospital and the city of Richmond for jointly and improperly removing Byers from a mental health facility, despite a court order directing him to be there.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Richmond finance department doesn’t tell business owners about money they’re owed</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of continuing coverage of several issues with the city of Richmond, the </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/richmond-business-tax-finance-department-overpayment-refund-credit/article_f9d4edae-79e3-11ef-86d4-53caef1a3217.html?utm_source=richmond.com&amp;utm_campaign=breaking-news&amp;utm_medium=cio&amp;lctg=a2f10705c6e001b7f40a&amp;tn_email_eh1=875e038257cbb4f38a7302384230aa63140080cba4da0031789a69022d8423c6" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond Times-Dispatch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported the finance department wasn’t notifying business owners that had overpaid on their tax bills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asia Spratley, a former program and operations manager in the finance department, told an employee in an August 2022 email, “please do not include credit balanced,” when the employee asked how to determine the number of taxpayer accounts no longer had a balance due, according to the email obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of his report, journalist Samuel Parker detailed how Jason Roop, who owns the public and relations marketing firm Springstory, and Jeff Marks, who ran Promotional Considerations, received notices of unpaid taxes and the city’s intent to sue, respectively. It took a visit to city hall for Roop and Marks to learn of their accidental overpayments, and credits owed to them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spratley told the RTD credit balances were omitted from reports because they were intended to determine who had outstanding balances. Overpayments were the responsibility of the “revenue side” of the department, added Spratley, who resigned in August after a dispute with management.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Margaret Ekam, a city spokeswoman, said Spratley’s instructions followed the “normal process” to write payment letters. Ekam also said most tax compliance and audit employees are no longer working with the finance department, which is “streamlining several processes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city council passed an ordinance in March requiring notification of credits to taxpayers, but those records aren’t tracked, Ekam said. An inspector general said a city attorney told him to end an investigation into the finance department’s handling of tax overpayments because it was outside of his responsibilities. Ekam denied that, saying an investigation had cleared the city of wrongdoing, but didn’t state what agency carried out the investigation.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Fairfax County teacher sues for lack of records </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Fairfax County school teacher and former state Senate candidate filed a lawsuit against the district employing her alleging a failure to hand over all of the documents she requested through a Freedom of Information Act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julie Perry, who teaches history at Centreville High School, filed the records request after she thought her job was under attack following a post on X involving alleged transgender autistic kids, the </span><a href="https://www.dailysignal.com/2024/09/20/virginia-school-district-refuses-give-public-records-teacher-sabotaged-election/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daily Signal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In May, Perry posted about a trend she saw in her classrooms of autistic kids identifying as transgender, adding, “The far-left uses the literal mentality of children with Autism to abuse them in this manner. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is why children with Autism need greater protection.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After seeing the post, Vanessa Hall, who was not co-director of Fairfax County’s LGBT Pride club at the time but now is, sent an email to the high school principal voicing concern over the post, according to records received through a request from a Daily Wire reporter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“However, these tweets below show that she is using students for her political gain,” Hall said in her complaint, adding she’s refrained from reporting Perry’s other “homophobic, transphobic and deeply hurtful” posts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She has crossed a serious ethical line if she is willing to release personal information about her students to the public on social media in direct violation of school policy and parental rights,” Hall said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, Perry received a memo telling her that her posts, “should not impair your capacity” to be respectful of students and parents and the ability to do her job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Any action that brings the school system into disrepute may be just cause for dismissal.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perry filed a FOIA request on May 29 for emails from Assistant Principal Penny Gros, who received a complaint about Perry and would seek guidance on how to handle it before the memo went out, mentioning her name. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gros received the complaint, the Daily Signal reported, from the principal at Perry’s high school initially who received it from a donor to the campaign of then school board member and now Sen. Stella Pekarsky, the Democrat who beat Perry to represent Fairfax County. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perry only received one document in response to her FOIA, despite the Daily Wire receiving 14 documents for a similar request.</span></p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: This story has been corrected to state Vanessa Hall was not co-director of Fairfax County’s LGBT Pride club when she emailed the high school principal.</em></p>

(Screenshot courtesy U.S. Senate Budget Committee livestream)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WASHINGTON – Conversations about things like zoning laws, permits, or use of housing subsidies typically happen in city or county government chambers rather than those of the U.S. Senate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But people in localities across the nation, including Virginia, are experiencing the persistent challenges of finding and affording a place to live. So, the <a href="https://www.budget.senate.gov/hearings/the-costs-of-inaction-economic-risks-from-housing-unaffordability" target="_blank">Senate&#8217;s budget committee had a hearing Wednesday</a> to listen to a cohort of various housing experts about ways the federal government can help. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As housing costs outpace wages, today more than 10 million Americans spend over half of their income on housing — leaving little for essentials like food, healthcare and education,” said Greta Harris, president and CEO of the Richmond-based Better Housing Coalition, who was a guest speaker at the hearing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also noted ripple effects that stem from housing issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This suppresses consumer demand and hampers economic growth,” Harris added. “Businesses in both urban and rural areas struggle to attract and retain talent because workers can’t afford to live nearby.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the state and local level, Virginia is already spearheading some targeted solutions. A state commission recently launched a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/workforce-housing-pilot-launches-to-support-southern-and-southwestern-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">workforce housing pilot program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the state’s southwestern and Southside regions, and the city of Richmond earmarked money in its budget to create a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/19/could-this-right-to-counsel-program-for-evictions-become-a-statewide-model/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">right-to-counsel program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for people facing evictions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developers around Virginia and America continue to tap into use of federal Low Income Housing Tax Credits to bolster construction of below-market-rate housing available to certain percentages of area median income. Expanding the federal program was floated by several senators during the hearing (and is part of Vice President </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/how-kamala-harris-new-policy-plan-could-impact-housing-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kamala Harris’ housing plans </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">if elected president). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris, of the Better Housing Coalition, said that LIHTC has been an “extremely effective” tool.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaker of Rhode Island’s house of representatives, Joseph Shekarchi, was also a guest at the hearing. He shared his perspective pressing for </span><a href="https://rhodeislandcurrent.com/2024/02/05/rhode-island-needs-to-pick-up-the-pace-to-tackle-affordable-housing-crisis/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">various housing policies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Rhode Island’s legislature, such as streamlining permitting and appeals processes for developments and investments in its housing production fund. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can do all the policy programming we want, but if a child doesn’t have a safe place to sleep, what does it all mean?” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a state lawmaker, he implored Congress to provide “greater funding mechanisms and grant opportunities to develop more housing, foster public-private partnerships, and to see further expansion of financial assistance” for renters and first-time homebuyers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Republican senators and some guest speakers cautioned against more government spending. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, took particular aim at Harris’ proposal of $25,000 in downpayment assistance for first-time homebuyers. If elected president, that plan would hinge on congressional approval. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His concern was echoed by guest speaker Ed Pinto, co-director of AEI Housing Center, a conservative think tank.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pinto said Harris’ proposal is “almost certain to lead to higher home prices, thereby, more than eliminating the intended benefits. Millions of program recipients would become price setters in their neighborhood.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He projected the downpayment assistance would cost the U.S. $100 billion over four years and wouldn’t help with supply issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This would be a wealth transfer to existing homeowners and really rewarding NIMBY opposition to additional supply,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NIMBY, which stands for “not in my backyard,” is a casual term used when discussing housing policy for people who oppose new developments or types of developments.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally, lawmakers and the guest speakers agreed that increased housing supply will help with affordability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pinto did thank Virginia’s senators Tim Kaine and Mark Warner along with Van Hollen, D-Md., for their introduction of the LIFT Act, which draws inspiration from Pinto’s own proposals. The Low-Income First-Time Homebuyers Act would offer 20-year mortgages to first-time buyers whose incomes don’t exceed a certain threshold. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warner joked to Pinto that he might need help recruiting some Republicans onto the bill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine also noted bipartisan consensus on </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/09/white-house-gop-housing-federal-land-00170616" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">selling off some vacant federally-owned land for new housing construction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., asked if housing issues should be best handled by local governments and the private sector, Harris of the Better Housing Coalition responded that the federal government can help with a power check. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Left to its own devices, the market is not equitable and it serves certain portions of our society and not all,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s where encouragement of local zoning reforms by the state and federal government could help localities increase their supply through more development. From his perspective as a Rhode Island state lawmaker, Shekarchi said localities are going to need all the help they can get.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We need federal subsidies. We need land use reform on a local level. We need the federal government to step in, because the states and the local communities cannot do it alone.”</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce for the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bipartisan coalition of lawmakers in Virginia and other states want to strengthen privacy laws regarding the non-consensual distribution of intimate images. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forty-nine states including Virginia already have some law on the books to protect peoples’  sexual or intimate images from being shared without their consent, but model policy from former democratic House of Delegates candidate Susanna Gibson provides a blueprint for lawmakers to use. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The issue took center stage in Gibson’s campaign last year, when news media was alerted to sex videos she and her husband had streamed online. Though the married couple had consented to the content that they streamed together being published on a particular pornography website, they did not consent to the content being recorded or widely disseminated beyond their audience of followers on that website. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Screenshots of Gibson’s nude body then circulated on social media along with derogatory language by online users. The </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/susanna-gibson-chatterbate-video-porn-republican-party-of-virginia/article_d1e5aaa6-72a8-11ee-92c9-afa9a79d1c01.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Party of Virginia later sent out campaign mailers with cropped, explicit photos of Gibson. </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">At one point a false emergency call had been placed to </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/henrico-officers-sent-to-susanna-gibsons-house-on-a-false-call/article_8c021524-69f2-11ee-83b2-3f32185898ed.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">send law enforcement to her home — an act colloquially referred to as “swatting.” </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gibson also </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/susanna-gibson-revenge-porn-virginia-lawmaker/article_aef20e14-9089-11ee-9f6a-4f33e3f98a70.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said that people loitered outside of her home and she received death threats.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the fallout, Gibson also said prospective young women political candidates in other states had reached out to her. Learning her story had them concerned that ex-partners could someday share nude images of them, and made them afraid to run for office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I quickly realized that my path had shifted from candidacy to advocacy,” Gibson said in a press call Wednesday to announce model policy from her organization, MyOwn Image. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year Gibson worked with Del. Irene Shin, D-Fairfax to expand the statute of limitations for prosecutions of unlawful dissemination of images in Virginia. The new model policy, which Gibson and MyOwn board members say six states are planning to implement, would create various tiers of misdemeanor and felony penalties for unlawful dissemination and remove language that requires proof of intent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic Florida lawmaker Katherine Waldron said the measure is important because without the consent of the person whose image is being shared, the intent to cause them harm, or lack thereof, doesn’t erase the harm that happens. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She and several other lawmakers that joined the press call relayed how victims’ mental health, personal relationships, employment or ability to find employment can be negatively impaired. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While several speakers acknowledged that anyone can become a victim of their image being shared without their consent, they noted how it often happens to women, minors or victims of sex trafficking. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Jersey assemblywoman Jessica Ramirez also noted how the crime could deter women from office, echoing Gibson’s concern, or be used as an intimidation tactic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We know that women still have a long way to go with representation in our halls of power,” she said. “So when these images are shared or used as a threat, it really can impact elections. It can impact someone’s desire to step up and run for office. We have to take action now to ensure that anyone can engage in public service without fear of intimidation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia delegates Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield and Karrie Delaney, D-Fairfax, plan to build on Virginia’s law using the model policy, they said. Coyner, who was inspired to carry the legislation as the mother of teen daughters, expressed concerns about artificial intelligence as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The rapid rise of (artificial intelligence) image generation software has heightened the threat posed by non consensual disclosure of intimate images,” Coyner said. “I know fellow parents are familiar with the harms and risks of social media and cyberbullying, but the increased risk posed by digitally forged intimate images make these issues much more severe.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, South Carolina is the only state without existing protections against non-consensual distribution of intimate images. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former Miss South Carolina Jill Dudley joined the call along with the state’s deputy attorney general and Republican state representative Chris Wooten. All will press for the creation of a law based on the model policy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dudley, who advocates for protections and support for survivors of rape and sexual assault, stressed that distributing someone’s intimate image, whether real or artificial, fits within the scope of rape culture. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Rape culture thrives when we blame or shame victims, when we dismiss their trauma, or when we fail to address sexual violence in all of its forms.”</span></p>

(Courtesy of National Weather Service)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Wednesday </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/eo/EO-37---Declaration-of-a-State-of-Emergency-Due-to-Hurricane-Helene.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declared</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a state of emergency for the commonwealth of Virginia in anticipation of impacts from Hurricane Helene later this week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the current storm path places its center west of Virginia, </span><a href="https://www.weather.gov/media/jax/briefings/nws-jax-briefing.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">forecasts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the National Weather Service and the National Hurricane Center suggest that the western parts of the state could face significant rainfall and flooding from Friday into Saturday, compounded by earlier rain events expected in the coming days.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Cz6YWOTfK6"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/24/health-department-urges-preparedness-ahead-of-peak-storm-season/">Health department urges preparedness ahead of peak storm season</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even though the largest impacts of Helene are predicted to the south and west of us, we cannot ignore the fact that we have had significant flooding events arise from pre-cursory rain events and outer bands from tropical systems that drop locally heavy rainfall leading to flooding, especially in our southwestern region,” Youngkin said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is critical that we remain vigilant, understanding that tracks and impacts can shift. As high winds and heavy rains are predicted for parts of Virginia, we urge everyone to stay informed through trusted resources and follow the direction of your local officials.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor’s state of emergency declaration gives Virginia greater flexibility to mobilize resources and equipment to respond to the storm, including activating Virginia’s Emergency Operations Center and the Virginia Emergency Support Team, putting into effect anti-price gouging measures and authorizing up to $350,000 in response and recovery funding. </span></p>

Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears and U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Prince William, the two leading declared candidates for governor, are tied at 39% support each, according to a </span><a href="https://www.umw.edu/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/09/UMW-Survey-Topline-Two-1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new statewide poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the University of Mary Washington’s Center for Leadership and Media Studies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The remaining 22% of respondents in the survey of 1,000 adult Virginians said they were undecided, did not plan to vote,  would back another candidate or refused to answer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The poll is in line with the results from </span><a href="https://www.umw.edu/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/09/UMW-Survey-Topline-One-1-1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">another UMW survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that also found Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump locked in a tight contest in Virginia, with the Democrat edging her Republican opponent by 48-46%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger, who has represented Virginia’s 7th Congressional District since 2019, was the first candidate </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/11/13/abigail-spanberger-virginia-governor-00126815" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to announce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> her gubernatorial bid in November 2023. Earle-Sears, the first Black woman in the commonwealth to hold statewide office, and the first woman to attain such a role since Mary Sue Terry’s tenure as attorney general in the 1990s, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/06/lt-gov-winsome-earle-sears-announces-run-for-virginia-governor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched her campaign</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> earlier this month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorney General Jason Miyares, another potential Republican candidate for his party’s gubernatorial nomination, would be equally competitive in a general election, the poll found. In a possible match-up between Spanberger and Miyares, 40% of survey respondents backed Spanberger while 39% favored Miyares, well within the survey’s margin of error.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares has not yet announced his intentions for 2025, but Virginia attorney generals often either run for re-election to the commonwealth’s top legal office or campaign to become governor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Glenn Youngkin, the current governor, cannot run for re-election next year because of Virginia’s one consecutive term limit for governors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia elections are often close, and the look ahead to next year suggests more of the same in the campaign for governor,” said Stephen J. Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington and director of UMW’s Center for Leadership and Media Studies. “The big challenge for these potential candidates is becoming better known across the commonwealth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginians were more negative about the direction of the nation than about the direction of the commonwealth, with 24% saying Virginia was headed in the right direction and 26% saying it was headed in the wrong direction. The rest offered mixed views. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the nation overall, 51% of those surveyed said that things in the country were headed in the wrong direction, with only 16% saying the nation was on the right track.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginians in this new survey said they approved of Youngkin’s job performance by a 46 to 34% margin. As for President Joe Biden’s job performance, 37% of survey respondents approved while 53% disapproved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Elections never stop in Virginia, and 2025 looks to be another very interesting electoral year in the commonwealth,” Farnsworth said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UMW poll was conducted by Research America Inc. between Sept. 3 and 9, 2024. The survey included a total of 1,000 Virginia residents, consisting of 870 registered voters and 774 likely voters. The margin of error is +/- 4.1%. </span></p>

(Tim Walck/Dulles Corridor Metrorail Project)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 80% of people surveyed in the National Capital Region said they “support more and better transit services, even if it requires higher investment by the region,” according to a survey conducted by two advisory groups associated with a regional task group’s effort to create a new funding plan for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (Metro).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under a proposed funding plan known as Scenario 1, the advisory groups said the region would have to generate an additional $645 million to cover all the transit agencies in fiscal year 2028, with 70% of the funds for capital investments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Scenario 2, the region would need to raise $835 million. The figures are based on assumptions for future inflation, project costs, regional ridership growth and sustained commitments from funding jurisdictions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, how Virginia would meet those possibilities is uncertain. Earlier this year, the state legislature allocated $144.7 million in funding to pay for Metro’s $750 million shortfall with the General Fund, which can vary based on the amounts of tax collections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The commonwealth commonly supports areas of transportation from its non-General Fund.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whether we can continue that General Fund support is unknown because it’s a little unprecedented,” Del. Mark Sickles, D-Arlington, told The Mercury on Monday. Sickles, a member of the task force, was involved in Virginia’s final budget discussions this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers and leaders from around the region gathered at Metro’s office in New Carrollton Monday to hear the </span><a href="https://dmvmoves.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/DMVMoves-Task-Force-Meeting-2_Presentation.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recommendations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from two advisory groups representing the area’s community organizations and governments to meet the goal of developing “stronger coordination” among the 14 different transit systems, the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments (MWCOG) said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In May, Metro and MWCOG launched a joint initiative known as DMVMoves, dedicated to creating a “unified vision” for transit service in the metro region that encompasses part of Virginia after Metro’s financial challenges to maintain services surfaced during the most recent budget season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Metro is supported by ridership and fare revenue, which has steadily increased since the pandemic when travelers stayed home. The agency also receives contributions from localities, Virginia, Maryland and Washington, D.C.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, who serves on the task force, said the goal is to develop a regional funding solution so Metro has a sustainable, long-term revenue source. He said this would help minimize the budget negotiations in the commonwealth, which occur every few years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It just seems like every six or seven years Metro has another funding crisis because our region has punted on a permanent solution down the field another 70 yards instead of dealing with it head-on,” Surovell said after the meeting.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40146" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1024px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-40146" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_2701-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_2701-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_2701-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_2701-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_2701-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_2701-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Virginia Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, at a regional task force meeting in Maryland on Sept. 23. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Scenario 1, the least expensive option, the plan focuses on all providers maintaining the existing service and limiting capital investments to keep the transit system efficient and reliable with repairs and maintenance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scenario 2 would be in addition to Scenario 1, plus improve services by supporting Maryland’s MARC Train and Maryland Transit Administration, or MTA, commuter bus, as well as fund increases for local bus services, optimize Metrorail service by increasing service frequency, using 8-car trains, and expanding weekend operating hours. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scenario also includes implementing the first phase of the </span><a href="https://www.wmata.com/initiatives/plans/Better-Bus/What-We-Heard.cfm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Better Bus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Visionary Network, which is Metro’s commitment to improving service and connections using the existing resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The task force will be briefed on the two remaining scenarios, which focus on expansion, maximizing service, and modernizing assets, at the Nov. 14 meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some potential ideas for localities to consider when creating new public revenues include taxes, collecting revenue from assessments, real estate transfers, and vehicle registration fees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to transit leaders, determining how revenue would be collected from Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia is still challenging since each jurisdiction has its own funding mechanism and operates its budgets differently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Representatives from the community and government advisory groups also suggested the task force consider several suggestions to improve the transit service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of these included integrating and aligning fare policies to provide consistent customer experience, improving wayfinding, customer information and amenities at transit stops, and exploring shared use of resources and assets and grouped procurements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The task force is expected to vote on the group’s recommendations Nov. 14. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An area not included in the list of recommendations was the idea of consolidating Northern Virginia’s bus services with Metro, something some Virginia leaders vocally supported.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surovell said he did not have to travel on multiple transit systems when he traveled out of the country and visited different cities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You buy one ticket, and you go from one train, one bus, and whatever, and it’s simple,” he said, adding, “It strikes me that one solution to having a better functioning system is one system.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phyllis Randall, chair of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors and Northern Virginia Transportation Authority, added, “I think when people are trying to move throughout this area, if you want to go from Loudoun to Alexandria, you don’t want to have to go on three different bus systems to do that.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loudoun County operates a bus service for commuters around the county and to other parts of Northern Virginia and Washington. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simultaneously, as the task force is working to develop a model, state </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+ful+SJ28ER+pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">leaders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Virginia are meeting to study the growing transit needs in Northern Virginia</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">studying sustainable, dedicated operations and capital funding for Metro.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State leaders will hear several presentations on short–and long-term needs for transit agencies, trends and funding ideas.</span></p>

(Scott Olson/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the aftermath of the recent </span><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/georgia-school-shooting-suspect-gun-backpack-hid-bathroom/story?id=113622880" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">school shooting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Winder, Georgia, that left four students and teachers dead, and the threats of violence made online in various Virginia school districts, the NAACP Virginia State Conference has pushed for increased action on social media education, mental health services and a renewed commitment to addressing racism and inequality in public schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No student should live in fear of attending school, nor should any student be the target of racially motivated hatred,” the Rev. Cozy Bailey, the group’s president, said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We call on school districts, state leaders, and policymakers to prioritize expanding both mental health services and DEI initiatives in schools. These efforts are not mutually exclusive but critical to building inclusive and supportive environments where all students feel safe and valued,” Bailey said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Virginia has been spared a fatal school shooting since November 2022, when three people were killed and two others were injured in </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/12/26/uva-shooting-timeline-what-happened/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a mass shooting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the University of Virginia, online threats continue to disrupt school operations and scare parents and students. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just last week, the Harrisonburg Police Department </span><a href="https://www.dnronline.com/places/local/rockingham_county/harrisonburg/harrisonburg-teen-arrested-after-posting-shooting-threat-on-social-media/article_1bf1d0aa-3d4c-58a6-9b99-29b6af85bba6.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">arrested</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a 16-year-old male suspected of making violent threats against other students. The arrest was the result of an investigation into the threats posted to social media on Sept. 15, which resulted in both Harrisonburg High School and Rocktown High School closing the next day as a matter of precaution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/us/school-shootings-fast-facts-dg/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent report by CNN</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there have been 50 school shootings this year in the United States. While this is lower than last year’s 82 school shootings, if patterns move as they have historically, a dramatic uptick is to be expected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While addressing school security is critical, the Virginia NAACP stresses that a comprehensive strategy is needed to tackle not only gun control but also the mental health crisis facing youth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This strategy must also confront the harmful effects of racism that persist in educational settings and has motivated racial issues that the Virginia NAACP regularly receives reports about, the organization said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The rise in violent threats demonstrates the pressing need for DEI programs and inclusive curriculums that can address these systemic issues and create inclusive school environments. Calls to dismantle DEI efforts ignore the reality of the continued presence of racism in schools, where marginalized students are often most vulnerable,” the statement said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bailey, the group’s president, added that the mental health and safety of Virginia’s school children must remain a top priority.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia NAACP further called for collaboration between local governments, law enforcement, community organizations, and educational institutions to ensure that schools are not only secure but equipped to confront both mental health challenges and the ongoing issue of racial discrimination.</span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With early voting now underway in Virginia, former President Donald Trump appears to have warmed up to the practice of sending out mail-in ballots to voters for the November general election — a position contrary to his many deprecatory comments regarding mail-in voting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In this election we must use every appropriate tool to beat the radical left Democrats, that’s why I am urging every Virginia patriot to vote early, and don’t wait,” Trump said during a telephone rally hosted by Gov. Glenn Youngkin Sunday evening. “You’ve heard a lot about voting by mail, but that’s what we have right now.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the 15-minute call, Trump asked Republican voters to cast their ballots “either by mail, early in person or on election day.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have long term voting, we used to have one day, paper ballots, all the things that you know we want to do, but you’re in the first group and I am asking you to get your friends, get your family, get everyone you know and make a plan to vote for Trump,” the GOP’s presidential nominee said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is one of just three states — the other two being Minnesota and South Dakota — where early voting started on Friday, 45 days before the Nov. 5 election. At least 59,686 Virginians have since cast their ballots as of Sunday evening, according </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/elections/early-voting/#2024" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Virginia Public Access Project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With just 895 returned ballots, mail-in voting marked just a fraction of the total number of votes cast by that time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump has consistently spoken against mail-in voting on the campaign trail while spouting conspiracy theories and falsely claiming that the 2020 presidential election that he lost to Democrat Joe Biden by more than 7 million votes had been stolen from him. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mail-in voting is totally corrupt. Get that through your head. It has to be,&#8221; </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2024/06/29/trump-attack-vote-by-mail-election-ad/74218068007/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at a rally in Michigan in February. And during an </span><a href="https://www.gbnews.com/politics/us/donald-trump-interview-nigel-farage-in-full-watch" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">interview with the British GB News</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in March, he asserted that “anytime the mail is involved, you’re going to have cheating.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump’s cautious embrace of early and mail-in voting aligns with the GOP’s slow acceptance of a practice that has expanded the tent of voters nationwide in recent years and proven to be beneficial for increasing turnout on both sides of the aisle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Both campaigns are really talking about the election in apocalyptic terms, and this is really motivating voters,” said Stephen Farnsworth, a political science professor at the University of Mary Washington. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Early voting absolutely works for campaigns; you don&#8217;t have to worry about getting voters to the polls on election day. If the ballot is locked in at election time, it gets a lot easier, and election officials can focus on voters who haven’t made it to the polls,” Farnsworth said</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During Sunday’s telephone rally, Trump rattled off a list of different ways for Virginians to cast their ballots early.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every county in Virginia has at least one early voting location, so that’s important to know. Most counties have early voting Monday through Friday. Any registered Virginia voter can get out and vote as early as possible, you can vote tomorrow,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump said that he could be the first Republican presidential candidate to carry Virginia since President George W. Bush won his reelection bid in 2004. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Because if we are really going at it, we have a really good chance to win Virginia, there hasn’t been one in decades by a presidential candidate,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump still faces an uphill battle in the commonwealth, where he trails Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, by 10 percentage points, according to a </span><a href="https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/2024-election-state-polls" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morning Consult poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conducted between Aug. 30 and Sept. 8.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a </span><a href="https://www.umw.edu/news/2024/09/20/new-survey-from-umw-center-for-leadership-and-media-studies-takes-closer-look-at-presidential-election-in-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more recent survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the University of Mary Washington released last week found that the race has since tightened, with Harris leading Trump with just 48 to 46% in a two-way contest, within the poll’s margin of error.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Democrats, however, pushed back against the narrative that the presidential race in the commonwealth was competitive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While Trump is literally phoning it in here in Virginia, Team Harris-Walz and Virginia Democrats are turning unmatched enthusiasm into action, highlighting the stark contrast between Vice President Harris’ new way forward and Trump’s extreme Project 2025 agenda that would give him unchecked control over our daily lives,” said Virginia Democratic Party chair Susan Swecker. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris has yet to campaign in the commonwealth as the Democratic presidential nominee. Her husband, Douglas Emhoff, is set to visit Charlottesville on Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also on Sunday’s call, Youngkin reiterated that elections in Virginia are safe and that voters can trust the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have paper ballots, we have counting machines, not voting machines, lock boxes are under 24-7 security, and we have a great process to make sure that the ballots are not only kept but custody is clear. And finally, non-citizens will be prosecuted if they vote,” he said.</span></p>
