Dozens of media outlets republished our stories, too, which helped us reach new readers inside and outside the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, our readers were especially hungry to learn more about blue catfish and the invasive species&#8217; culinary potential, the state&#8217;s most stately trees and why preserving them is vital, a local school board that made history as the first in the nation to re-name schools after Confederate figures and another that sued a special needs student&#8217;s parent for $600,000. Here&#8217;s a recap of those stories and our other most-read reports and commentary of 2024.</span></p>

<p><strong>From the story: </strong>Proud and satisfied, or sad and embarrassed. However citizens of the commonwealth view Shenandoah County School Board’s recent decision, Virginia appears to be the first in the nation to restore Confederate school names, after years of vigorous community engagement, a controversial renaming process, and a change in board priorities related to race, diversity and inclusion. <strong><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/20/virginia-school-board-restores-confederate-names/">Read more.</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>From the story:</strong> Of the roughly 2 million Virginians who’d been enrolled in Medicaid before the COVID-19 pandemic, over 480,000 of them have been disenrolled as of this August. Typically eligibility determinations are made annually, but they’d been on pause nationwide amid the pandemic due to federal policy. That’s changed over the past year in what’s colloquially referred to as “Medicaid Unwinding” as provisions of federal law have expired. <em><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/nearly-500000-virginians-in-medicaid-have-been-disenrolled/"><strong>Read more.</strong></a></em></p>

Last Monday, Youngkin awarded a $250,000 grant to Sea Farms, a family-owned and -operated aquaculture and seafood processing business with operations in Gloucester and Mathews counties, that among other uses will pay for a blast freezer that will increase the amount of blue catfish the company can buy and sell. </span><em><strong><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/05/blue-catfish-are-invasive-in-virginia-the-state-is-paying-to-get-more-of-them-on-peoples-tables/">Read more.</a></strong></em></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>From the column:</strong> Data centers are making the transition (to zero-carbon energy sources) harder, but so is local resistance to building solar. General Assembly members mostly understand the connection, leading to a lively debate in last year’s legislative session over whether to override some local permit denials for solar projects – and if so, how to ensure the localities still have some say. Though none of the legislative proposals moved forward last year, the topic has become a central one for the recently revamped Commission on Electric Utility Regulation (CEUR). </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/03/data-centers-approved-solar-farms-rejected-what-is-going-on-in-rural-virginia/"><b>Read more.</b></a></p>

As President Joe Biden’s administration </span><a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2024-30921.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">backtracks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its efforts to maintain some protections for transgender students due to pending litigation, similar efforts in Virginia could be rolled back, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed rule — which would have required states to allow biological males who identify as female to compete in girls’ and women’s sports — is separate from an extended civil rights protections rule for LGBTQ students under Title IX, which is still being challenged.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares called the withdrawal a “major victory” in a statement on Monday. Last year, he </span><a href="https://6rdh5iebb.cc.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001jvtWsOWktXoHSP5jkLp53sRncR-6Co9RDAN0u3JkFjolTeANSTc_esQPt0pWBfCJfi8kUy1XPaIOmDuTdxCYSMoLnIE4w1SinQjK4xgqdmhuLkepmb9JnoJebWBtbAv4kjM7hjTcZxWyd8z98pZOgPKvI9vGgEbaSSvo7bMm4f-mE7mNUyzRs6F9COtlPctd9MD0LBtPTWJ8pADp3jtoFHpPKtPrJRWSwIgzCTjWP8ZMSWrqy5-TyB5Yg7gshIn1rGTVql65zyH6g0h1NgP_E8kc2ToNkwKsK8dHGepfSPoUEtlh3Lk6U8gOh2pnJ1MfXuoAcdc6vHXEP4D2GGaqopH6F9vCvZbv2HtlonOyx1VCGLea3CzJpEqrXos1qrtLQXvaNukZ2FqZFQ14eANb8S6XgpdJwQP0&amp;c=uClvih1ISydmTc0WAlFY_XEIYaAuDa0l8s_kZJRdRFoOyjD-cYQUvg==&amp;ch=1nNdTwA10fWIw4_2uESac5akNGXVdqE1Uue_euaBr9NKvbFndb239g==" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">joined</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a coalition of attorneys general to oppose the Biden administration’s attempt to make changes to TItle IX that aimed to protect LGBTQ+ students from discrimination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The proposed rule would have jeopardized the integrity of women’s sports, forcing female athletes to compete on an uneven playing field while uprooting decades of progress for women in sports. I’m proud to have stood up for Virginia’s female athletes and for the common-sense protections they deserve,” said Miyares in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the past four years, lawmakers and attorneys have sparred over transgender policies in Virginia, as the Biden administration and groups like the </span><a href="https://www.acluva.org/en/cases/doe-v-hanover-county-school-board#:~:text=On%20July%203%2C%202024%20ACLU,she%20tried%20out%20and%20qualified." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ACLU of Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have sought to maintain and expand safeguards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opponents of the rule said it would impose gender ideology on others with conservative views and potentially impact the safety of women and girls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alliance Defending Freedom Senior Counsel and Vice President of Legal Strategy Jonathan Scruggs said female athletes deserve to compete on a “level playing field” and the presidential administration, through the Department of Education, has taken a step in the right direction with the withdrawal. ADF, a conservative Christian legal organization focused on protecting religious rights, has been active in cases seeking to prohibit transgender athletes from competing in women’s sports. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The decision to withdraw the proposed sports rule merely reflects the views of the vast majority of Americans who </span><a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/507023/say-birth-gender-dictate-sports-participation.aspx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">believe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that women’s sports should remain reserved for female athletes,” Scruggs said in a statement, adding that ADF will continue to fight other Title IX measures.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Other efforts to ban transgender women athletes</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bluefield University in Southwest Virginia, and other National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics member schools, </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/naia-transgender-ban-ad422f3a86ebcc4db618750c6a5d1c5f" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">banned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> transgender women from competing in women&#8217;s sports in April.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other efforts to ban transgender women from sports in Virginia have been unsuccessful. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this year’s General Assembly session, Democrats killed bills that would have essentially </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB723" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">banned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> transgender students from competing in sports programs at elementary, middle and high schools as well as higher education institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February, Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration </span><a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/government-politics/youngkin-administration-play-to-change-policy-for-transgender-high-school-athletes-falls-short-in-charlottesville/article_0ab1748c-c54c-11ee-9a8f-4745a6f30110.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">attempted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to match the Virginia High School League’s policy on transgender athletes with its overhauled policies that students should be placed on teams based on their biological sex rather than their gender identity, but the attempt failed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia High School League, which oversees interscholastic athletic competition for Virginia’s public high schools, </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OxLAgeE0tBHCgcHBdYoMBDGepYL2fN7W/view" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">allows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for transgender athletes to participate on teams that match their gender identity, but under certain conditions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The parents of a Hanover County transgender student were successful in challenging a school’s decision to ban their child from trying out for her school tennis team when a federal court judge temporarily allowed the student in August to try out for and, if selected, play on a sports team this school year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But four months later, the parents of the student dropped the lawsuit against the school system because the student was no longer enrolled in the school division due to “ongoing harassment and concerns about her safety.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump presidency could usher in new era of challenges for trans student athletes</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia, like all the states, is preparing for  Republican President-elect Donald Trump to take office next month. Trump promised that he would ban trans students from playing on school sports teams that align with their gender identity during his successful campaign for office against Vice President Kamala Harris. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rhetoric has left transgender youth </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/transgender-rights-trump-title-ix-1b9d3a1d928ea78c21372da63600c6d1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seeking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> help, the Associated Press reported, as Trump continues the calls to roll back protections for trans students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With the stroke of my pen on day one, we’re going to stop the transgender lunacy,” </span><a href="https://www.c-span.org/program/public-affairs-event/president-elect-trump-speaks-at-turning-point-action-conference-in-arizona/653788" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Trump at AmericaFest on Sunday, adding that “I will sign executive orders to end child sexual mutilation, get transgender out of the military and out of our elementary schools and middle schools and high schools.”</span></p>

(Photo by Getty Images)</p><p dir="ltr">WASHINGTON — The form to apply for federal financial student aid must roll out by Oct. 1 annually after President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-passes-bill-move-annual-fafsa-release-deadline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed a bill into law</a> Wednesday that ensures an earlier processing cycle.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Though the <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/feds-roll-out-2025-26-college-financial-aid-form-ahead-planned-date" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Free Application for Federal Student Aid</a>, or FAFSA, typically launches in October each year, the U.S. Department of Education legally had until Jan. 1 to make the form available.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The new law came as the department has taken heat over its <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/gaps-fafsa-rollout-are-closing-watchdog-tells-us-house-panel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">botched rollout</a> of the 2024-25 form, when users faced a series of glitches and errors. The form did not officially launch until January.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Adding fuel to the fire, the agency announced earlier this year that it would take a staggered approach to the 2025-26 form so it could address problems that might pop up before opening applications to everyone — again making the form available later than usual.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-department-education-begins-testing-new-fafsa-form" target="_blank" rel="noopener">testing stages</a> that began Oct. 1, the department fully debuted the 2025-26 form in late November — 10 days ahead of its Dec. 1 official launch.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A spokesperson for the department said it is “committed to enforcing all laws duly passed by Congress” when asked about Biden signing the FAFSA bill into law.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, the department said Thursday it had received over 1.5 million 2025-26 FAFSA submissions and has delivered more than 7 million student records to states and schools.</p>
<p dir="ltr">U.S. Under Secretary of Education James Kvaal said that even with these developments, the department’s work “is not done.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We will continue to fix bugs and improve the user experience to make it easier for students and families to get the financial aid they need,” Kvaal said on a call with reporters Thursday regarding updates on the 2025-26 form.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">FAFSA deadline bill breezed through Congress</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The bill was met with sweeping bipartisan support and swiftly passed both the House and Senate in November. Indiana GOP Rep. Erin Houchin, a member of the U.S. House Committee on Education and the Workforce, introduced the legislation in July.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sen. Bill Cassidy, ranking member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, put forth the Senate version of the bill. The Louisiana Republican is in line to chair the panel next year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Rep. Bobby Scott, ranking member of the House education panel, celebrated the bill becoming law on Wednesday.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“As college costs continue to rise, federal financial aid, including Pell Grants, is essential to making higher education more affordable and accessible,” the Virginia Democrat said in a statement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Scott said that by standardizing the deadline, the measure “gives students and families more time to complete their applications and secure the financial support they need to attend college without unnecessary delays.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The 2024-25 application got a makeover after Congress passed the FAFSA Simplification Act in late 2020 but was met with several issues that prompted processing delays and gaps in submissions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The department’s staff worked to fix these errors and close the gap in submissions from the previous processing cycle, and officials said they reflected on how to make improvements for the 2025-26 form and beyond. </p>

Glenn Youngkin's proposal to invest another $290 million for school construction needs during the upcoming legislative session which begins in January. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Tuesday announced that he is asking the legislature for an additional $290 million to support school construction and modernization efforts across Virginia. This latest investment would bring the total funding for the current biennium to $700 million and raise the state’s overall contribution under Youngkin’s administration to nearly $2 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s funding request is included in his proposed budget amendments, which he plans to present next week at a joint meeting of the General Assembly’s money committees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the governor’s office, the state’s financial commitments have spurred an estimated $3.4 billion in total funding for school construction. The additional support would be made possible through a combination of local government contributions and federal matching funds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Over the last three years, we have invested historic amounts in our education system, including our public school facilities,” Youngkin said in a statement. “Our record economic growth and the resulting surplus allows us to make this critical investment to ensure every Virginia student has access to high-quality school facilities that support academic success.” </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_38057" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/07/bill-to-allow-marijuana-sales-in-peril-after-breakdown-on-virginia-arena-deal/img_1875/" rel="attachment wp-att-38057"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-38057" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_1875-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_1875-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_1875-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_1875-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_1875-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_1875-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Gov. Glenn Youngkin speaking with reporters outside the Capitol Building on March 7, 2024. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin plans to use the newly announced $290 million in non-general funds to expand competitive grant opportunities for school divisions, particularly in high-need areas. The money would also address critical infrastructure issues, supporting the construction and renovation of schools in urgent need of repair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State officials say the increased funding will provide K-12 students with safer, more conducive learning spaces, a move that has been welcomed by educators and community leaders alike. Local school divisions will be able to apply for grant support to fast-track modernization projects that may have been delayed due to funding shortfalls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Youngkin administration has framed the initiative as part of a broader effort to support Virginia&#8217;s educational system and improve outcomes for students. As schools across the state face aging infrastructure and capacity challenges, this investment aims to reduce disparities in facility quality, especially in underserved areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of our guiding principles since day one of the Youngkin Administration has been to provide safe, vibrant, and healthy learning environments for all of our students,” said Secretary of Education Aimee Guidera. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This investment in supporting new and refurbished school buildings makes it possible for every community in the commonwealth to have the means to provide a best-in-class education that prepares every student for success in our increasingly demanding knowledge- and skills-based economy.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Candi Mundon King, D-Prince William, a member of the Commission on School Construction and Modernization, said that while she welcomed Youngkin’s proposal, she needed more information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have been screaming from the rooftops about more money for school construction and ensuring that localities have what they need, so I’m glad to see that he&#8217;s trying to get on board,” Mundon King said. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_41173" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:280px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/10/youngkin-seeks-additional-290-million-boost-for-school-construction/screenshot-2024-12-10-at-3-02-35-pm/" rel="attachment wp-att-41173"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-41173" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-10-at-3.02.35 PM-280x300.png" alt="" width="280" height="300" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-10-at-3.02.35 PM-280x300.png 280w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-10-at-3.02.35 PM-957x1024.png 957w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-10-at-3.02.35 PM-768x822.png 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-10-at-3.02.35 PM.png 1032w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Del. Candi Mundon King, D-Prince William, is a member of the Commission on School Construction and Modernization (Courtesy Candi Mundon King).</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is clear that we need to put more money into school construction, but I can’t say more without seeing a fully fleshed out plan. So I’m looking forward to his presentation next week with the joint money committees so we can fully evaluate what this proposal actually is, and not just some slick press release that doesn’t go into detail.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022, Youngkin’s first year in office, the General Assembly in a bipartisan effort approved a historic $1.2 billion investment in school construction, aiming to modernize aging facilities and reduce funding disparities among school divisions. The sweeping plan combined grants and loans to support renovations, new construction, and capacity expansion for K-12 schools across the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the $1.2 billion, about $850 million was allocated for grants. This included $400 million in formula-based grants, which provided each of Virginia’s 134 school divisions with a $1 million base allocation. The remaining $266 million was distributed based on the Local Composite Index (LCI) — a state funding formula that considers factors like property values, taxable sales and population data to assess a locality’s financial ability to support its schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another $450 million was funneled into the newly created School Construction Fund and Program, a competitive grant program designed to assist divisions with the most critical infrastructure needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">School systems with poor building conditions and limited financial capacity could apply for these funds to support construction, renovation, or expansion projects. This program is primarily funded by 98% of gaming revenue from Virginia’s four new casinos in Bristol, Danville, Portsmouth, and Norfolk. The fund is administered by the Virginia Board of Education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia faces a mounting crisis with school infrastructure. Data released by the Virginia Department of Education in 2022 revealed that nearly 1,000 school buildings across the state are at least 50 years old. Replacing these facilities would cost more than $25 billion — a figure far beyond the capacity of most localities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditionally, local governments have shouldered the financial burden of school construction, relying on local tax revenue. But for economically distressed areas, particularly in Southwest Virginia and Southside, this has become an increasingly difficult challenge due to population decline and economic hardship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in April, Youngkin </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/11/youngkin-vetoes-measure-to-let-va-localities-increase-sales-tax-to-pay-for-school-construction/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed a bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lawmakers sent to his desk that would have allowed localities to implement a 1% sales tax to help cover the costs of school construction and modernization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB14" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> required voter approval through a referendum before the tax could be enacted by local governments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin acknowledged that school construction is a “worthy cause” but argued that Virginia has already taken substantial steps to address those costs. He contended that citizens should not face additional taxes, particularly the $1.5 billion annually that would have been raised by the 1% sales tax.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The commonwealth should pursue a tax policy that unleashes economic development and prioritizes job and wage growth through innovative reforms,” Youngkin said in his </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+amd+SB14AG" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">veto</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “These reforms must allow hardworking Virginians to keep more of their money, not less; any proposal that increases the cost of living and the cost of business is not a policy we should pursue.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to 2022, state assistance for school construction was limited, with much of it coming from the Literary Fund, a state-managed pool of money established in Virginia’s Constitution. Funded by sources such as unclaimed lottery winnings, criminal fines, and unclaimed property, the Literary Fund historically provided low-interest loans to support school construction and debt service for technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in recent years, much of the fund’s revenue was redirected to cover teacher retirement costs, leaving fewer resources for school building projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2022 legislative session retooled the Literary Fund’s loan program, significantly increasing its impact. Lawmakers raised the maximum loan amount from $7.5 million to $25 million and capped the interest rate at 2%. These changes made it more feasible for school divisions to finance major construction projects at a lower cost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the state’s total contribution now approaching $2 billion, education advocates are hopeful the increased funding will lead to long-term improvements in school facilities and better learning conditions for students throughout the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Board of Education President Grace Creasey said Tuesday that the panel will prioritize “those school divisions in greatest need that have missed out on prior grant opportunities,” especially rural divisions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We also know that school divisions are eager to adopt seat time flexibility and competency-based models which requires us to design learning environments and spaces differently. This new investment will make this possible,” Creasey said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each year since 2019, the federal government found that Virginia’s education department repeatedly failed to resolve complaints filed by parents of special education students, and it did not have “reasonably designed” procedures and practices to ensure a timely resolution process for those complaints.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the state has taken the necessary steps to “address and resolve the findings of noncompliance and the required corrective actions” outlined in a March 13 monitoring report, according to a Dec. 5 letter from the U.S. Department of Education&#8217;s Office of Special Education Programs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal agency indicated that no further action is needed after Virginia officials submitted documents highlighting corrective actions, including providing quicker feedback to school divisions and ensuring that all entities rather than LEAs, or school divisions, listed under the “</span><a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-34/subtitle-B/chapter-III/part-300/subpart-A/subject-group-ECFR0ec59c730ac278e/section-300.33" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">public agency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” definition are following the due process procedures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has nearly 181,000 students with disabilities. As federal law requires, Virginia must provide all students with disabilities a “free and appropriate public education” through personalized plans under the Individualized Education Program (IEP).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its letter, OSEP said that “having a consistent and transparent system for identifying and correcting noncompliance, particularly noncompliance that impacts the delivery of early intervention services, in accordance with individualized education programs (IEPs), and dispute resolution systems that protect the rights of parents, are essential elements to ensuring improved results for children and youth with disabilities,” and acknowledged Virginia’s “continued efforts” to better implement the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) Part B and to put in place “a reasonably designed general supervision system which ensures compliance and improving results for students with disabilities.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">VDOE’s corrective actions</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to the compliance issues facing students, VDOE announced in October 2023 the formation of a workgroup to help develop the 2024 </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/programs-services/special-education#:~:text=2024%20Roadmap%20for%20Special%20Education&amp;text=This%20roadmap%20is%20expected%20to,postsecondary%20pathways%20for%20all%20learners." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roadmap</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for Special Education and a team that reports directly to the superintendent of public instruction to monitor how school divisions provide special education services and assist them as needed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around the same time period, VDOE also created a system to oversee the development and use of IEPs for students with special needs. Educators are required to undergo additional training on providing inclusive special education instruction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Board of Education also </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/29/virginia-adopts-regulatory-changes-for-special-education-amid-federal-review/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">adopted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> regulatory changes to how the state handles compliance complaints regarding students with disabilities and dedicated funds to examine the dispute resolution system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Since day one, Governor Youngkin has prioritized the success of students with disabilities and I am pleased that the U.S. Department of Education has recognized the hard work VDOE has done to improve our work for Virginia’s children with disabilities,&#8221; Superintendent of Public Instruction Lisa Coons said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Concerns, funding</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While she has not reviewed the documents the state’s education department submitted to federal authorities, special education advocate Kandise Lucas said she was concerned with the “accuracy” of those documents, specifically concerning the policies and procedures, and independent evaluations based on her recent interactions with schools, parents and students, one of whom she said has been out of school for three years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I just have a real concern that … the Board of Education submitted those documents knowing that they&#8217;re not complying with the law, specifically as it pertains to independent evaluations, which was a major issue,” Lucas said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She questioned if VDOE is following the federal agency’s summary contained in the Dec. 5 letter, which requires the commonwealth to issue a memorandum or other directive to all local educational agencies (LEAs), parent advocacy groups, and other interested parties advising them of the proposed changes to state regulations and complaint procedures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucas said some hearing officers, who review parents&#8217; complaints, have yet to hear of the changes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also voiced concerns about the state refusing to enforce its regulations in school divisions about parents’ right to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">access educational records promptly under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act. Another worry is VDOE refusing to enforce hearing officer orders and state complaint determinations well beyond a year after the compliance requirement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carol Bauer, president of the Virginia Education Association, said in a statement that Gov. Glenn Youngkin’sadministration&#8217;s actions are “temporary solutions” that don’t solve the main issue — the underfunding of special education student needs in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bauer claimed that since the governor was elected, actual state spending on special education students has continued to “erode” and led to “unmanageable caseloads and subpar parent and family engagement.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, evidence of underfunding schools was outlined in a study conducted by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, the state’s legislative watchdog.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JLARC found that the formula used to decide how much money schools need for teachers suggested fewer special education teachers than schools use or need.</span></p>

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers will consider a bill in January that aims to stop unlicensed minors from operating a vehicle by charging the vehicle owner with a Class 1 misdemeanor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tammy McGee, whose son died in a 2019 car crash after an unlicensed and underage teen driver crashed the car he was in, has become an outspoken advocate for safe driving laws. She is now working with lawmakers including Del. W. Chad Green, R-York, to create accountability for parents and adults regarding driver safety for teenagers with </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/HB1549" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 1549</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s another tool that law enforcement would have to hold parents responsible,” Green told the Mercury. “Maybe with this change in law, parents and adults will say, ‘hey, we’re not going to let this happen,’ and it could end up saving some lives.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under current </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-301.1/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, owners only face a penalty if they knowingly allow someone whose driver&#8217;s license, learner&#8217;s permit, or privilege to drive a motor vehicle has been suspended or revoked to drive a vehicle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the General Assembly and the governor approve the new bill, vehicle owners could face a one-year jail sentence and a $2,500 fine. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGee, who operates the </span><a href="https://www.connergweedo.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gweedo Memorial Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in honor of her late son, Joseph Conner Williams Guido, affectionately known as “Gweedo,&#8221; died in a car crash on Oct. 26, 2019 in York County. Since the crash, she has advocated for teen driving education in Virginia.</span></p>

(Courtesy of the Gweedo Memorial Foundation)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, the General Assembly passed a bill that she pushed to address safety in </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+sum+HB1918" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">school parking lots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and another the following year requiring </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=221&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb78" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">parental involvement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in teen driver education. She also launched a </span><a href="http://www.ifyouseesomethingsaysomething.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to allow people to anonymously report tips about unsafe driving, illegal activities, and bullying, to name a few.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGee said she hopes the momentum will carry during the short session beginning on Jan. 8 with House Bill 1549 and another bill, still to be filed, that will ensure all students have access to in-car driver education. McGee said not all school divisions offer behind-the-wheel education in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She fears that if students don’t have a behind-the-wheel education, they are likely to drive without a license if they or their families cannot afford private instruction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That gives our parents a peace of mind about the quality of education and the safety of their child when you think about these driving schools,” McGee said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Would I have been in these shoes had my son not died?” said McGee.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I wouldn&#8217;t be passionate about driving and safety,” she added. “But what I do know is that what happened to me shouldn&#8217;t have happened. … My baby’s aspirations to play collegiate soccer were wiped away by an innocent act of stepping into a vehicle, and anybody should be able to hop into another vehicle and know that that teen is licensed, and that wasn&#8217;t the case.”</span></p>

(Mario Tama/Getty Images)</p><p>Jill Norton, an education policy adviser in Massachusetts, has a teenage son with dyslexia and ADHD. Shelley Scruggs, an electrical engineer in the same state, also has a teenage son with ADHD. Both students go to the same technical high school.</p>
<p>But this fall, Norton and Scruggs advocated on opposite sides of a Massachusetts ballot referendum scrapping the requirement that high school kids pass a standardized state test to graduate.</p>
<p>Norton argued that without the high bar of the standard exam, kids like hers won’t have an incentive to strive. But Scruggs maintained that kids with learning disorders also need different types of measurements than standardized tests to qualify for a high school diploma.</p>
<p>Voters last month approved the referendum, 59% to 41%, ending the Massachusetts requirement. There and in most other states, Scruggs’ position against testing is carrying the day.</p>
<p>Just seven states now require students to pass a test to graduate, and one of those — New York — will end its Regents Exam as a requirement by the 2027-28 school year. Florida, Louisiana, New Jersey, Ohio, Texas and Virginia still require testing to graduate, according to the National Center for Fair and Open Testing, a group that opposes such mandates.</p>
<p>In Massachusetts, teachers unions favored getting rid of the exam as a graduation requirement. They argued it forced them to teach certain facts at the expense of in-depth or more practical learning. But many business leaders were in favor of keeping the test, arguing that without it, they will have no guarantee that job applicants with high school diplomas possess basic skills.</p>
<p>State by state, graduation tests have tumbled over the past decade. In 2012, half the states required the tests, but that number fell to 13 states in 2019, <a href="https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/why-the-pioneers-of-high-school-exit-exams-are-rolling-them-back/2024/11" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Education Week</a>. The trend accelerated during the pandemic, when many school districts scrapped the tests during remote learning and some decided to permanently extend test exemptions.</p>
<p>Studies have found that such graduation exams disadvantage students with learning disabilities as well as English language learners, and that they aren’t always a good predictor of success in careers or higher education.</p>
<p>An oft-cited 2010 <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0034654310383147" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a> by researchers at the University of Texas at Austin may have ignited the trend to scrap the tests. Researchers’ review of 46 earlier studies found that high school exit exams “produced few of the expected benefits and have been associated with costs for the most disadvantaged students.”</p>
<p>Some states began to find other ways to assess high school competency, such as grades in mandatory courses, capstone projects or technical milestones.</p>
<p>“Minimum competency tests in the 1980s drove the idea that we need to make sure that students who graduate from high school have the bare minimum of skills,” said John Papay, an associate professor of education at Brown University. “By the mid-2000s, there was a reaction against standardized testing and a movement away from these exams. They disappeared during the pandemic and that led to these tests going away.”</p>
<p>Despite the problems with the tests for English learners and students with learning disabilities, Papay said, the tests are “strong predictors of long-term outcomes. Students who do better on the tests go on to graduate [from] college and they earn more.”</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" title="“Computer programs monitor students’ every word in the name of safety” — Stateline" src="https://stateline.org/2024/10/17/computer-programs-monitor-students-every-word-in-the-name-of-safety/embed/#?secret=vOFYyjUPWZ#?secret=k9h6MYFY5j" width="500" height="461" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-scripts" data-secret="k9h6MYFY5j" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>Papay, who remains neutral on whether the tests should be required, pointed out that high school students usually have many opportunities to retake the tests and to appeal their scores.</p>
<p>Anne Hyslop, director of policy development at All4Ed, a think tank and advocacy group for underserved communities, noted that in many states, the testing requirements were replaced by other measures.</p>
<p>The schools “still require some students or all students to demonstrate competency to graduate, but students have many more options on how they could do that. They can pass a dual credit [high school/college] course, pass industry recognized competency tests. …</p>
<p>“A lot of states still have assessments as part of their graduation requirements, but in a much broader form,” she said.</p>
<h4 class="editorialSubhed">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Massachusetts moves</h4>

	</h4>
<p>Scruggs said her son took Massachusetts’ required exam last spring; he passed the science and math portions but fell 1 point short in English.</p>
<p>“He could do well in his classes, but if he didn’t pass the three tests, he wouldn’t get his regular diploma,” Scruggs said. “How do you go out into the working world, and you went to school every day and passed your classes, but got no diploma?”</p>
<p>Her son has taken the English test again and is awaiting his new score, she said.</p>
<p>Norton, by contrast, said the exam, called the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System, or MCAS, gave her son an incentive to work hard.</p>
<p>“I worry that kids like him … are going to end up graduating from high school without the skills they will need,” Norton said. “Without the test, they will just be passed along. I can’t just trust that my kid is getting the basic level of what he needs. I need a bar set where he will get the level of education he needs.”</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" title="“Hotter August days push some schools to delay start dates” — Stateline" src="https://stateline.org/2024/09/10/hotter-august-days-push-some-schools-to-delay-start-dates/embed/#?secret=SY9VDiJCCX#?secret=5ZZuwVgqug" width="500" height="327" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-scripts" data-secret="5ZZuwVgqug" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>Students in Massachusetts still will have to take the MCAS in their sophomore year of high school, and the scores will be used to assess their overall learning. But failing the test won’t be a barrier to graduation beginning with the class of 2025. The state is still debating how — or whether — to replace the MCAS with other types of required courses, evaluations or measurements.</p>
<p>High school students in Massachusetts and most states still have to satisfy other graduation requirements, which usually include four years of English and a number of other core subjects such as mathematics, sciences and social studies. Those requirements vary widely across the country, however, as most are set by individual school districts.</p>
<p>In New York, the State Education Department in 2019 began a multiyear process of rethinking high school graduation requirements and the Regents Exam. The department decided last month to phase out the exit exam and replace it with something called a “Portrait of a Graduate,” including seven areas of study in which a student must establish proficiency. Credit options include capstone projects, work-based learning experiences and internships, as well as academic achievement. Several other states have moved recently to a similar approach.</p>
<p>Harry Feder, executive director of FairTest, an advocacy group that works to limit standardized testing, said course grades do a better job of assessing students’ abilities.</p>
<p>“Standardized tests are poor ways of incentivizing and measuring the kinds of skills and knowledge we should have high school kids focusing on,” Feder said. “You get ‘teaching to the test’ that doesn’t bear much of a relationship to the kinds of things that kids are being asked to do when they go on to college or the workplace.”</p>
<p>Max Page, president of the Massachusetts Teachers Association union, said phrases such as “teaching to the test” disrespect teachers and their ability to know when students have mastered content and competency. The high school tests are first taken in the 10th grade in Massachusetts. If the kids don’t pass, they can retake the exam in the 11th or 12th grade.</p>
<p>“Educators are still evaluating students,” he said. “It’s a mirage to say that everything that a student does in education can be measured by a standardized test in the 10th grade. Education, of course, goes through the 12th grade.”</p>
<p>He added that course grades are still a good predictor of how much a student knows.</p>
<h4 class="editorialSubhed">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Colorado’s menu</h4>

	</h4>
<p>Several of the experts and groups on both sides of the debate point to Colorado as a blueprint for how to move away from graduation test requirements.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" title="“When ‘universal’ pre-K really isn’t: Barriers to participating abound” — Stateline" src="https://stateline.org/2024/07/03/when-universal-pre-k-really-isnt-barriers-to-participating-abound/embed/#?secret=TCuvlpDPUy#?secret=EjJmLrWSjh" width="500" height="440" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-scripts" data-secret="EjJmLrWSjh" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>Colorado, which made the switch with the graduating class of 2021, now allows school districts to choose from a menu of assessment techniques, such as SAT or ACT scores, or demonstration of workforce readiness in various skill areas.</p>
<p>A state task force created by the legislature recently <a href="https://www.cde.state.co.us/communications/11-8-24-news-release-1241-task-force" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recommended some changes</a> to the education accreditation system to “better reflect diverse student needs and smaller school populations.” They include creating assessments that adapt to student needs, offering multilingual options, and providing quicker results to understand student progress.</p>
<p>The state hopes the menu of assessment options will support local flexibility, said Danielle Ongart, assistant commissioner for student pathways and engagement at the Colorado Department of Education.</p>
<p>“Depending on what the student wants for themselves, they have the ability to show what they know,” she said in an interview. In particular, she said, the menu allows for industry certificates, if a student knows what type of work they want to do. That includes areas such as computer science or quantum computing.</p>
<p>“It allows students to better understand themselves and explain what they can do, what they are good at, and what they want to do,” she said.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our system has to change for the benefit of our students and our families, and frankly, for our schools, which are pillars in the community, and so I really look forward to moving this process ahead,” Hansen said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Todd Reid, a spokesman for VDOE, any changes to the new accountability system would require a regulatory change by the board, which is a lengthy and involved process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the summer, the state’s board of education approved the new accountability framework, which has been in the works for two years and overhauled the existing system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new framework is intended to depict how schools are meeting all requirements set by state laws and regulations, and provide “timely” and “transparent” information on student and school performance, according to the VDOE.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VDOE doubled down on its plans Monday, and staff </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/58674" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the agency had offered multiple training sessions for superintendents, school division leaders, and counselors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 73 participants from 55 of the total 131 school divisions have participated in two office hour sessions, which are ongoing on Wednesdays, and 40 individual technical assistance sessions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Nov. 8, Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration announced the launch of an additional resource, the digital Roadmap to Readiness Hub, designed to improve student and school performance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our students cannot wait another year. That&#8217;s why earlier this month, Governor Youngkin took a significant step forward in addressing the needs of Virginia&#8217;s students and public schools with the release of the Roadmap to Readiness, a comprehensive online resource hub that provides parents, teachers, school leaders, and communities with a robust set of supports, resources, and transparent data to inform decision making,&#8221; said Christian Martinez, a spokesman for the governor, in a statement on Monday. &#8220;Since the start of the administration, we continue to raise expectations for every child and put systems in place that will make a measurable difference in students’ lives now, not years from now.&#8221;</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="64ngvob44e"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/11/va-launches-resource-hub-to-improve-student-and-school-outcomes-amid-performance-data-questions/">Va. launches resource hub to improve student and school outcomes amid performance data questions</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Va. launches resource hub to improve student and school outcomes amid performance data questions&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/11/va-launches-resource-hub-to-improve-student-and-school-outcomes-amid-performance-data-questions/embed/#?secret=072MQ2g8Dz#?secret=64ngvob44e" data-secret="64ngvob44e" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a Nov. 18 letter, signed by eight school board chairs from the counties of Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun and Prince William and the cities of Alexandria, Arlington, Fairfax, Falls Church and Manassas, the group urged the administration to delay implementation of the accountability framework despite the rollout of the resource hub and the pending review by the U.S. Department of Education’s review of Virginia’s Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) plan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan&#8217;s full implementation is slated to begin at the start of the next school year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to be good partners with the state in our shared mission to foster the success of each and every student; however, we are concerned that school divisions have not been provided that appropriate amount of time to address the new accountability requirements the commonwealth has established,” the chairs wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The framework was established after their divisions “planned, budgeted and staffed” for the current school year and students had already selected their courses, the chairs wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a quarter of the school year passed, the chairs said that many of the framework’s measures “have still not yet been fully defined,” and that detailed modeling has not been shared with school divisions. The chairs also said Virginia has not identified the types of support it will provide to schools needing improvement and secured the necessary related funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chairs recommended the state education board “reinstate student knowledge growth and alternative measurement alongside mastery as key framework components.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also recommended the department clearly explain and test all the components of the framework’s calculations, and clarify and publicly vet the components and intent of any agreement that will be required for low-performing schools or school divisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The letter urged the board to prioritize an immediate increase in appropriated funding for any school identified as “Off Track” or “In Need of Support,” as well as for comprehensive professional development related to the new framework for all school divisions based on their actual number of instructional full-time employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the accountability system, schools are given one of four labels based on their performance: “Distinguished,” “On track,” “Off Track,” and “Needs Intensive Support.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schools considered “distinguished” are those that exceed the state’s expectations for growth, achievement and readiness, while those that need “intensive support” do not meet any of the state’s expectations. In addition, “on-track” and “off-track” descriptors indicate whether schools are generally meeting expectations or not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to the board’s work session on Monday, the Virginia Education Association, the largest organization representing teachers and school employees, published a </span><a href="https://www.veanea.org/performance-framework-exposed-see-the-data-and-why-it-matters/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">webpage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stating the system is a “problem” and suggesting lawmakers could delay the implementation through legislation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia’s families, educators, and students deserve an accountability system that supports growth and improvement – not one that stigmatizes schools without addressing the root causes of their challenges,” VEA said in a statement. “We urge lawmakers to act swiftly in 2025 to delay this system and lay the groundwork for an approach that works for everyone.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Board member Anne Holton, former Virginia Secretary of Education, said it&#8217;s helpful that staff is providing tools to help educators and school staff get up to speed on how to put the new standards into practice, but providing a clear explanation of the process is also key for school boards and parents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am absolutely confident they have asked for a delay because they want to do the very best by all of our students and because they want to be able to support their teachers,” Holton said. “They may see that differently than you, but it&#8217;s not because they want to cover up problems. They are in the field every day trying to get the very best education to all of our kids, and I have complete confidence in our school division leaders as to their motivation, whether or not they agree with you as to the mechanics of how we implement all of this.”</span></p>

(miniseries/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of Virginia’s public universities and colleges are aware of student food insecurity  at their institutions, according to a November </span><a href="https://www.schev.edu/home/showpublisheddocument/4120/638677880196199761" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conducted by the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia. 80% labeled on-campus food insecurity as a “somewhat” or “very problematic&#8221; issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The total number of college students experiencing food insecurity is unclear because not all public colleges and universities are tracking the issue, and the economic and social stigma associated with food insecurity has prevented students from asking for help. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A total of 35 of 39 institutions completed the survey, representing 343,797 students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to SCHEV, the coordinating body for the state’s colleges and universities, eight institutions said they had researched food insecurity affecting their students, while 19 had not and eight did not know or preferred not to say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most schools estimated between 25% to 49% of their students faced food insecurities, and another third estimated between 1% and 24%. “Most of these estimates (53%) were based partly on estimates or best guesses, and partly on data collected, monitored or maintained by the institution and/or other organization(s),” SCHEV reported.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Rae Cousins, D-Richmond, who carried the successful legislation </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb827" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">directing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the council to survey each public institution of higher education to identify how they address food insecurity, said she was pleased to see the report confirm her observations. She hopes to receive student input as lawmakers consider the recommendations and potential legislative solutions to prevent students from going hungry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I sympathize with these kids because I know how important food and nourishment has been to me, how important it is to my daughter — who&#8217;s three years old— and so whatever I can do to ensure that people are getting the nutrition that they need, especially our kids and our students … while they&#8217;re in school, I&#8217;m just all in for it,” said Cousins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In January 2022, the federal government made it possible for colleges and universities to pinpoint how many students were in need after it permitted institutions to use financial aid or FAFSA data to determine the SNAP eligibility of students, the study states. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, 26% of institutions have not used the data and the remaining 34% did not respond if they had. SNAP, also referred to as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, is a government initiative that provides monthly food benefits to low-income people and families.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SCHEV also found that private donations are the most frequently mentioned source of funding to address food insecurity at colleges and universities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report indicated that federal grants and state general fund dollars are rarely obtained. Some institutions use student emergency funds permitted under the 2024-26 biennial budget to address food insecurity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its report, SCHEV recommended that institutions normalize asking for and accepting government help, involve students in developing and implementing campus services, and leverage existing legislation and funding to grow on-campus support programs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report also recommends policymakers increase state support for direct partnerships between public institutions of higher education and the Department of Social Services, and invest in expanding access to tested, effective services for students across institutions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, SCHEV advised policymakers to work with federal partners and legislators to increase state flexibility for SNAP.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a Nov. 21 announcement by the Virginia Department of Education, each school division can receive grants of up to $250,000 for the current school year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Safety has been a priority for school divisions in the commonwealth, especially after a 6-year-old student shot his teacher at Newport News Elementary School in January 2023.

Schools were awarded grants based on a ranking of those needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The equipment purchased with these grants will help ensure the safety of all students and staff in Virginia’s public schools,” said Lisa Coons, superintendent of public instruction for VDOE. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every child deserves a high-quality education experience, one where they can deeply focus on learning and growing the minute they step onto a school bus or pass through the doors of their school. These grants help create safe, supportive environments, both on school grounds and while traveling to and from school,” she added.</span></p>

Tim Kaine, D-Va., reintroduced <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/5086/text" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/5086/text&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1732371896430000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1Mw-4iqJSCMDBegjgUmwnw">a proposal</a> in September after an earlier <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/4846?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%224846%22%7D&amp;s=1&amp;r=9" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/4846?q%3D%257B%2522search%2522%253A%25224846%2522%257D%26s%3D1%26r%3D9&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1732371896430000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3U3oCMyRRr7zd4Ob-Hh5QY">version</a> died in the last session of Congress. This bill amends the Higher Education Act of 1965, which, among other things, created the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Act.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The act requires higher education institutions to provide support for victims of violent crimes and to make publicly available campus crime statistics and institutional policies for campus safety, according to the Clery Center.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Kaine’s bill would require schools that receive federal funding to appoint an advocate, independent of the institution, who guides victims of sexual assault throughout the process. This would include better connection to available resources, emotional counseling and protection for the student from more harm – such as disciplinary action or penalization for reporting the incident.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bill requires the advocate to report incidents to an investigative body and submit an annual report to the learning institution with the number of victims and how each resource was used.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The SOS Campus Act was referred to the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, according to Kaine.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The inspiration for the legislation is to protect the rights of students to feel safe on campus, according to Kaine.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“That’s why I’ve worked on legislation, including the SOS Campus Act, to prevent sexual assault and support survivors,” Kaine stated. “I will keep working to garner support among my colleagues for the SOS Campus Act and work to get it passed and signed into law.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">HB 369 &#8211; Sexual Misconduct Policies and Task Force</p>
<p dir="ltr">Del. Marty Martinez, D-Loudoun, introduced <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/HB369" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/HB369&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1732371896430000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0X1b_ife_8AXjVfJigr1-j">House Bill 369</a>, which had similar objectives to Kaine’s bill, to update sexual misconduct policies and increase accountability for institutions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bill was introduced in the 2024 General Assembly session, but a Rules subcommittee continued the bill to the 2025 session. The bill was officially left in that committee on Nov. 18, effectively killing it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bill would create a task force which produced an annual climate survey, install a crisis center, establish a designated confidential adviser on all campuses and impose civil penalties for institutions that violate the proposed guidelines.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The State Council of Higher Education for Virginia would appoint the task force, whose charge would be to create a base sexual misconduct campus climate survey, according to SCHEV communications director Bob Spieldenner. This survey would be distributed to all institutions across the state, which would be a routine task for SCHEV, he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Schools could tailor the survey with campus-specific questions before sending them to students, according to the bill. The results would be shared with SCHEV and posted online within about four months for public viewing, along with the institution’s website.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bill required for-profit, private institutions to have a designated crisis center with a confidential, independent advocate to provide support to victims of sexual assault and direct them on the next steps. This is something that nonprofit, private universities are already required to do.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bill also created accountability on institutions to report alleged incidents and investigations. If an institution did not take any action “after reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing,” then they would be fined up to $150,000 (or 1% of institution’s annual operating budget, whichever is lower) for each violation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, was a co-patron of the measure. The bill was a step toward the ultimate goal of every individual to feel safe at their school, he stated.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Virginia’s students have one job &#8212; to learn,” Helmer stated. “And as legislators, it’s our job to protect them when our schools won’t.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Neither Martinez nor Helmer responded when asked if they had plans to reintroduce this bill or similar legislation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Liberty University Shows Cracks In System</p>

Sam Rasoul)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House lawmakers studying how some of Virginia’s universities handle campus protests and free speech policies faced criticism Wednesday after arranging a hearing that some in attendance felt leaned heavily toward institutional and pro-Israeli perspectives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, House Majority Leader Charniele Herring, D-Alexandria, who chairs the House Select Committee tasked with reviewing campus safety and free speech at Virginia’s colleges and universities, addressed public concerns by emphasizing that this was just the first in a series of meetings aimed at providing a comprehensive review.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Herring said the next meeting is slated for December with a final report due afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are not here to solve the issues that spark conversations, protests and public displays. We are not equipped to do that in this venue,” Herring said. “However, we are here to make sure that we are working toward campuses continuing to be safe places and learning for all of our students, while ensuring there are safe places to speak out and engage in civil discourse.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee convened for the first time on Wednesday after canceling two prior meetings which had left the public without answers. Herring attributed the delays to low attendance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The postponents frustrated some students and faculty members who had hoped that lawmakers would introduce legislation for the upcoming General Assembly session, which begins in January. Some had also called for earlier hearings to address public concerns about new university policies as well as demands for independent investigations and legislative oversight to safeguard First Amendment rights.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration </span><a href="https://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Campus-Safety-and-Security-A-Message-From-Secretary-of-Education-copy.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">urged</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Virginia’s colleges and universities in the spring to “take proactive steps to update policies and improve communication channels before students return this fall.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The directive came in the wake of demonstrations at five universities, sparked by responses to an attack by Hamas, a Palestinian militant organization, on Israel near the Gaza Strip in October. According to reports, Hamas killed 1,200, injured hundreds, and took hostages. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the resulting aftermath of the attack, Israel declared war, resulting in the death of over 41,000 Palestinians, while nearly 100,000 were injured and the health care system in Gaza has collapsed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The public response to the conflict prompted the creation of both the House committee and a parallel Senate group to examine campus policies and ensure free speech protections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last spring, demonstrators across Virginia called for a cease-fire and staged protests at five universities in the commonwealth last spring: The protests resulted in more than 125 arrests at four campuses: the University of Mary Washington, Virginia Commonwealth University, Virginia Tech and the University of Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wednesday&#8217;s two-hour hearing in Richmond, hosted by the House committee, featured testimony from a law enforcement official and a representative from the governor’s administration, along with updates from the University of Virginia and Virginia Commonwealth University regarding the campus protests. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee also heard a presentation on the history of the First Amendment followed by remarks from a pro-Israeli student from Virginia Tech who shared her personal experience with the protests and the university&#8217;s policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiera Schneiderman, student body president at Virginia Tech, called for a more “peaceful” and “constructive” approach to the campus protests. After the encampment at Virginia Tech, Schneiderman recounted visiting the protest site where she and others were met with chants of “shame” and witnessed a large crowd chasing a Jewish student. She also reported three students were punched in the face. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is nothing wrong with criticizing Israel. There is nothing wrong with advocating for a better future for Palestinians and trying to preserve their livelihood,&#8221; Schneiderman said. &#8220;I want to be very clear when I say that this is not what is happening in our current state of campus protest.&#8221;</span></p>

(Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a 30-minute public comment period, community organizers, faculty members and students shared their concerns about the protests, with some alleging excessive use of force by law enforcement and questioning the safety of students facing hate and intimidation. Others advocated for policies that protect free speech as well as for greater accountability and reform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I stand before you in the year 2024 and ask you to tell me which Virginia college will my son be safe in attending,” said Yael Levin, a Jewish mother of two, recounting violent acts in the state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House Select committee also invited law enforcement to speak on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonathan Schleffer, deputy secretary of Virginia Public Safety and Homeland Security, explained that the administration has been actively collaborating with law enforcement and universities throughout the surge in protests. He emphasized the importance of ensuring student safety while addressing the underlying causes of the protests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lt. Col. Kirk Marlowe, deputy superintendent of the Virginia State Police, told the committee that law enforcement faces challenges in managing crowd sizes and identifying individuals protesting unlawfully. He noted that some unlawful protestors can blend in with larger groups and carry items that can be used as weapons.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40916" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40916" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_2888-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_2888-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_2888-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_2888-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_2888-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_2888-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_2888-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Scott Ballenger, special advisor to the Provost on Free Expression and Inquiry at the University of Virginia, provided an overview of the First Amendment at the Nov. 20 House Select Committee meeting in Richmond. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked by a committee member, Marlowe was unable to confirm if any state police officers were injured during the protests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want protesters, spectators and law enforcement all to be safe, and we want to create a safe space for people to lawfully exercise their first amendment rights,” Marlowe said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, some speakers expressed frustration that the hearing included presentations from representatives of institutions and law enforcement. They argued that guest speakers advocating for free speech, such as the American Civil Liberties Union, should have been included.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’ve invited and given an extensive platform to the very perpetrators of the violence, including the police and administrations that have inflicted violence upon myself and my peers, allowing the space for full presentations,” said Selma Ait-Bella, a senior at VCU. “Meanwhile, the advocates of free speech, those that have been punished for speaking out, are all relegated to short testimonies in the public hearing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shahed Sanuri, a graduate student at Virginia Tech, criticized the committee for showing a lack of “empathy” in the way it organized the agenda.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The people selected and presented were the exact people that are systematically and continuously suppressing Palestinian voices on campuses, people that have called for extreme brutality against their own students, faculty and staff,” Sanuri said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we chant ‘Free Palestine,’ we are fighting for the Liberation of Palestine from the occupation and settler colonialism by Israel on Palestine. Free Palestine has never and will never mean hate towards Jews.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the meeting, Herring said that the committee is laying the groundwork in this initial hearing for potential future legislation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m not saying it’s anyone’s priority, but maybe there’s no need for legislation. But this at least gives us something, some knowledge as we move forward,” Herring said.</span></p>

(JW Caterine for the Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers will consider legislation allowing Virginia to recruit more teachers through a multi-state agreement in the upcoming legislative session, which some see as an opportunity to continue reducing the state’s teacher shortage that has declined in recent months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/HB328" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to enter Virginia into the </span><a href="https://teachercompact.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interstate Teacher Mobility Compact was</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> carried by Del. Jackie Glass, D-Norfolk, earlier this year. A similar </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB407" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was left in the Senate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If passed, Glass said the legislation would diversify pathways and processes and remove barriers for experienced teachers who want to bring their skills to Virginia classrooms, ensuring that every student has access to a high-quality education. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The measure would also support military spouses who frequently move with their partners and face licensing barriers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Re-filing the teacher compact bill is a priority because the urgency to address Virginia&#8217;s teacher shortage cannot be overstated,” said Glass in an email to the Mercury. “We are navigating the challenges of a highly transient population, particularly in communities like ours that are influenced by military movement and economic shifts; it’s essential to me that we make it easier to attract and retain qualified educators.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Education Association, the largest teachers union in the state, supported the bill in the 2024 session. Carol Bauer, president of the VEA, said as lawmakers mull over the teacher compact legislation, they should also consider ensuring that the bill works toward improving the quality of candidates by keeping “high standards” while reducing “bureaucratic barriers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We still need to hold high standards for training and we need to make sure that our students have teachers that have had the opportunity to get the experience they need to teach,” Bauer said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regarding the benefits, Bauer said the interstate compact legislation could help teachers move closer to helping aging family members in another state or obtaining support services for their children.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Compact origin</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://compacts.csg.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Center for Interstate Compacts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at </span><a href="https://www.csg.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Council of State Governments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the compact, initiated by the U.S. Department of Defense, will allow teachers to use an eligible license held in a compact member state to be granted an equivalent license in another compact member state, lowering barriers to teacher mobility and getting teachers back into the classroom more seamlessly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A minimum of 10 states was required to move the compact forward. Some of the states that joined the compact include Alabama, Florida, Kentucky and Pennsylvania.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last February, a House General Laws subcommittee </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/HB328/text/HB328AH" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">amended</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the legislation, requiring any potential license holder to be responsible for paying for their background check. The bill was left with the House Education Committee when session ended</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Va. teacher shortage shows improvement</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to data from the Virginia Department of Education’s Office of Licensure, the teacher vacancy rate was down to 3.4% at the start of the school year after hovering at 4.7% in July. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studies have found that teachers were leaving public schools due to several factors including dissatisfaction with wages, challenges after the pandemic, and recent political battles over academic content and benchmarking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia, in response, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/09/01/youngkin-outlines-steps-to-address-teacher-shortage-in-executive-directive/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">initiated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> several actions that included relaxing guidelines to hire retired teachers, and targeting educator recruitment and retention efforts in areas of need. The administration of Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkinalso worked on the issue with the Democrat-controlled state legislature this year, whose priorities included </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/17/legislation-to-bring-va-teacher-pay-to-national-average-gets-bipartisan-support/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raising</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> teacher salaries to the national average.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glass said the 3.4% vacancy rate appears to be a small number, but </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">it represents “thousands” of unfilled positions that directly impact students and families, necessitating continued efforts towards progress. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our approach must be multifaceted: removing barriers for teachers entering the profession, supporting current educators to prevent burnout, and recognizing the unique needs of our communities,” Glass said. “We owe it to our students to provide stability and opportunity, and that starts with ensuring every classroom has a dedicated and qualified teacher.”</span></p>

(Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)</p><p dir="ltr">WASHINGTON — A measure to ensure the federal student aid form opens up annually by Oct. 1 passed the U.S. House Friday with overwhelming bipartisan support.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/BILLS-118hr8932rh/pdf/BILLS-118hr8932rh.pdf" target="_blank">effort</a> — which passed 381-1 — came after the U.S. Department of Education faced major backlash over the botched rollout of the 2024-25&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/dont-give-fafsa-advocates-student-financial-aid-urge" target="_blank">Free Application for Federal Student Aid</a>, or FAFSA. California Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren was the only lawmaker to vote against the bill.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Though the form got a makeover after Congress passed the FAFSA Simplification Act in late 2020, users faced multiple glitches and technical errors throughout the form’s soft launch in December and past its full debut in January, prompting processing delays and gaps in submissions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The department has worked to correct these glitches and close that gap while also fixing major issues that prevented parents without Social Security numbers from completing the form.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Adding another complication, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-education-department-gradually-roll-out-new-fafsa-form-dec-1" target="_blank">department said in August</a> it would use a phased rollout of the 2025-26 form in an attempt to address any errors that might arise before it opens up to everyone — making the application fully available two months later than usual.</p>
<p>“Since Oct. 1, the Department has conducted three successful beta tests of the 2025–26 FAFSA form to ensure it is ready for all students and families on or before Dec. 1,” U.S. Under Secretary of Education James Kvaal said in a statement shared Monday with States Newsroom, while noting that the department already began its fourth testing stage this past week.</p>
<p>“We have a fully functioning site and a form working end-to-end that has been successfully submitted by more than 10,000 students, with dozens of schools all over the country receiving the data for student aid packages,” he said.</p>
<p>The department is on track to launch the 2026-27 FAFSA on Oct. 1, 2025, with “a fully functioning system,” according to Kvaal.&nbsp;</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Codified deadline</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Though the department legally has until Jan. 1 to roll out the form, it typically launches Oct. 1.</p>
<p dir="ltr">U.S. Rep. Erin Houchin, an Indiana Republican and member of the U.S. House Committee on Education and the Workforce, in July&nbsp;<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/8932" target="_blank">introduced the bill</a> to standardize that deadline.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I’m especially frustrated considering the Department of Education has had three years to simplify the FAFSA as Congress has dictated,” Houchin said during floor debate Friday.</p>
<p dir="ltr">She also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/gaps-fafsa-rollout-are-closing-watchdog-tells-us-house-panel" target="_blank">referenced recent findings</a> from the Government Accountability Office, including that nearly three-quarters of all calls to the call center went unanswered in the first five months of the 2024-25 rollout.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We want this program to work — we want to make sure that children and families that want to send their kids to college have the availability to do that and that the FAFSA is available and workable,” she added.</p>
<p dir="ltr">U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott, ranking member of the House education panel, echoed his support during the floor debate, saying the measure will “help ensure that even more students have the information they need in a timelier manner to access Pell Grants and other vital student aid.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Scott initially opposed the effort when the committee took it up in July out of concerns that the implementation deadline could force the department to roll out an incomplete form on Oct. 1 of this year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“However, because we’re now considering the bill after Oct. 1, the deadline will apply next year, 2025, and that gives the department ample time to make improvements and fix any lingering issues,” the Virginia Democrat said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/4632" target="_blank">introduced a companion bill</a> in July.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bill was referred to the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, where Cassidy serves as ranking member. After Republicans won a Senate majority in the Nov. 5 elections,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.help.senate.gov/ranking/newsroom/press/cassidy-to-chair-help-committee-in-119th-congress" target="_blank">Cassidy is in line</a> to chair the panel next year.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The commission’s creation came after the publication of a series of essays in The New York Times dubbed the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">1619 Project, whose namesake reflects the first year enslaved Africans were brought to the shores of what would become the United States. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, national debate was brewing about how history concerning </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">slavery and Black Americans’ contributions to the country was taught, a discussion that </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/11/17/missing-context-political-bias-some-of-critics-objections-to-virginias-new-history-standards/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">manifested</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Virginia after Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration authorized a rewrite of Virginia history and social science education standards that critics said lacked important context but included bias. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The 1776 Commission’s background</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump has not mentioned plans for the commission since his re-election over Democrat Vice President Kamala Harris on Nov. 5, despite his party’s affirmation of their intent to reinstate it. The former president </span><a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-establishing-presidents-advisory-1776-commission/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">created</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the commission during his previous term via an executive order issued on Nov. 2, 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It came after the Trump administration and some conservatives accused the 1619 Project and  critical race theory college courses of teaching students to “hate their own country.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This radicalized view of American history lacks perspective, obscures virtues, twists motives, ignores or distorts facts, and magnifies flaws, resulting in the truth being concealed and history disfigured,” the order reads. “Failing to identify, challenge, and correct this distorted perspective could fray and ultimately erase the bonds that knit our country and culture together.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, the 1776 Commission published a 41-page </span><a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/The-Presidents-Advisory-1776-Commission-Final-Report.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that received criticism from historians and educators largely because it was developed by experts from Hillsdale College, a Christian school in Michigan, politicians and conservatives. Detractors said the report attempted to downplay how the institution of slavery shaped U.S. history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://www.historians.org/news/aha-statement-condemning-report-of-advisory-1776-commission/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the American Historical Association, joined by 47 organizations, said the report attempted to “elevate ignorance about the past to a civic virtue.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The AHA said the report included “an homage to the Founding Fathers” that was “a simplistic interpretation that relies on falsehoods, inaccuracies, omissions and misleading statements.” It also said the report featured “a screed against a half-century of historical scholarship, presented largely as a series of caricatures, using single examples (most notably the ‘1619 Project’) to represent broader historiographical trends.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beau Dickenson, executive board member and former president of the Virginia Social Studies Leaders Consortium, said the 1776 Commission&#8217;s report tried to rewrite history and insulted social studies teachers by suggesting they don&#8217;t want to be patriotic, which he said was contrary to their motives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want those dispositions in our students, but we want them to have a balanced view of our past,” Dickenson said. “And even within the topics that these folks would prefer us to overlook, I see a very compelling story of agency and resilience and people overcoming despite these odds and making this country stronger as a result. It&#8217;s a testament to our people that we can be a flawed country and make it a better one, but the 1776 Commission seeks just to overlook that history or rewrite it entirely.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were also some educators, like Carol Swain, defending the commission. Swain, former commission vice chair and retired political science and law professor at Vanderbilt and Princeton Universities said “No parts of history were taken out in the report, and the people from the left attacked it because it was the Trump administration that put it together.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon after the commission published the </span><a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/The-Presidents-Advisory-1776-Commission-Final-Report.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1776 Report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in January 2021, the group was </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-advancing-racial-equity-and-support-for-underserved-communities-through-the-federal-government/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">disbanded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by President Joe Biden through an executive order focused on advancing racial equity and supporting underserved communities on Jan. 20, 2021. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virginia parallels</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his first year as Virginia’s governor in 2022, Youngkin began addressing and reforming public education, and, in his first </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/74---eo/74---eo/EO-1---ENDING-THE-USE-OF-INHERENTLY-DIVISIVE-CONCEPTS,-INCLUDING-CRITICAL-RACE-THEORY,-AND-RESTORING-EXCELLEN.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executive order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, prohibited “inherently divisive concepts,” including critical race theory (CRT), in K-12 education. CRT is a graduate-level framework focusing on racial inequity that has not been found in Virginia&#8217;s curricula. Youngkin also signed off on revamping the state’s history and social science education standards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The administration faced criticisms after state historians, lawmakers and education groups learned that Hillsdale College was involved in the rewrite of Virginia’s standards, which outline the commonwealth&#8217;s expectations for student learning and are assessed through the Standards of Learning tests. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia lawmakers, educators and community organizers </span><a href="https://www.sikhcoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Hamkae-Center-and-Sikh-Coalition-Letter-VA-History-and-Social-Standards-SOLs.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Nov. 5, 2022 that they were “alarmed” to hear of Hillsdale’s involvement with the draft history standards following accusations that the college, in its work with other states, did not provide feedback on public education systems’ social studies standards, but instead created a curriculum for them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group also pointed out that experts found the 1776 curriculm’s pedagogical framework had “content inaccuracies” and was “lacking” in inquiry, critical thinking and analysis of primary sources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are highly concerned that Hillsdale College, a private liberal arts college in Michigan, has the potential to dictate and influence what Virginia educators teach and what Virginia students learn,” the group wrote.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to the outcry, Youngkin’s administration pulled the department’s draft standards from further review. It replaced it months later with a draft missing influential figures and events, a flaw historians said was similar to missing information in the 1776 report. Educators, lawmakers, and community organizers also voiced concern about the process&#8217;s lack of transparency regarding who authored the changes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swain, a native of Southwest Virginia, disagreed with the claim that no professional historians were involved in creating the 1776 report. She did say she’s pleased that the governor’s administration may have included elements from the report in the draft standards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the things that we argued and were pushing was for history to be taught using original documents, to get the young people to read the Declaration of Independence, to read the Constitution … (and also) the constitutions of their states for themselves,” Swain said. “And so that was one of the things that I know we were united on, and I believe that the best schools, the private academies, that&#8217;s what they do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, historians and educators continued challenging the Youngkin administration and the Virginia Board of Education on the draft standards over several months. By April 2023, the Board of Education </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/04/20/after-months-of-debate-virginia-board-of-education-adopts-history-standards/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">adopted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the updated standards, which had been changed to include more of the historic context and content lawmakers, educators and advocates had sought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dickenson said there are similarities between how the 1776 Commission&#8217;s report and the Youngkin administration’s proposed education standards were created. </span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Missing context, political bias: Some of critics&#8217; objections to Virginia&#8217;s new history standards&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/11/17/missing-context-political-bias-some-of-critics-objections-to-virginias-new-history-standards/embed/#?secret=O6fU8arOZq#?secret=MCJZ1gXLCD" data-secret="MCJZ1gXLCD" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like the 1776 report, Dickenson said professional historians were “sidelined” in favor of conservative groups such as Hillsdale College in the early development of Virginia’s standards. The efforts also shifted from inquiry-based learning to a rote, fact-focused approach emphasizing memorization over critical thinking and analysis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This directly contradicts Youngkin’s claim that students should ‘learn how to think, not what to think,’ and it limits opportunities for students to explore, question, and engage deeply with historical content,” Dickenson said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report and draft standards both aimed to frame the removal of critical race theory as a way to change or remove parts of history that discuss racial issues, colonialism and the struggles of marginalized groups, Dickenson said. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What’s next?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plans for reorganizing the 1776 Commission are uncertain, since it was housed under the U.S. Department of Education, an agency that Trump has vowed to disband.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the 2024 national Republican </span><a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/2024-republican-party-platform" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">platform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “Republicans will reinstate the 1776 Commission, promote fair and patriotic civics education, and veto efforts to nationalize civics education. We will support schools that teach America&#8217;s founding principles and Western civilization.”</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin speaking at a Nov. 8 press briefing in Richmond. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia legislators, educators and parents were  surprised to learn in the past few months how many schools failed to meet expectations under a new accountability system compared to an older system that showed most schools were accredited.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During an announcement on Friday about the Department of Education’s new </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/state-board-data-funding/accreditation-accountability/school-performance-and-support-framework" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Road to Readiness Hub</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help improve student and school performance, the agency’s current reports showed most schools were meeting or are on track to meet expectations compared to a report presented in August demonstrating that more than half of schools lagged behind and required support, based on 2023-24 data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the accountability system, schools are given one of four labels based on their performance: “Distinguished,” “On track,” “Off Track,” and “Needs Intensive Support.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schools considered “distinguished” are those that exceed the state’s expectations for growth, achievement and readiness, while those that need “intensive support” do not meet any of the state’s expectations. In addition, there are “on-track” and “off-track&#8221; descriptors that indicate whether schools are meeting or not meeting expectations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It seems like there is not [any] clarity around what we are talking about and what this new accountability system is actually looking at,” Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, the Senate Health and Education Committee chair, told reporters on Friday, adding that the VDOE has not been forthcoming with its data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don’t have the data ourselves to evaluate what these numbers constitute and what they represent,” she said, “and so that’s a real concern why there’s not the transparency we need in order to understand where our schools are actually performing.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked about the data gap, Superintendent of Public Instruction Lisa Coons said on Friday that the modeling was “incomplete.” The August data was not finalized until Sept. 30, Coons said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on 2023-24 data, the VDOE projected in </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/56656/638598579207770000" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">August</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that 55.5% of schools were significantly “off track” and not meeting the state’s expectation for growth, achievement, and readiness, while current </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/state-board-data-funding/accreditation-accountability/school-performance-and-support-framework/spsf-overview" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows that 34.7% of schools are “off track” and would need intensive support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hub’s launch on Friday comes as Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration seeks to provide the public with transparent access to preliminary data on school performance and resources to support students and schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This new Road to Readiness embodies our commitment to high expectations, transparency, and prioritizing resources to those students and schools most in need,” Youngkin said in a statement. “Our school performance framework and this new resource hub reaffirm our commitment to empowering our teachers, partnering with our parents, strengthening our schools and most importantly, preparing every student for success.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The administration believes the performance data was masked behind an existing system that showed an inaccurate picture of K-12 public education in Virginia, as identified by state and national assessments. Youngkin suggested the inaccurate picture was because of previous administrations’ decisions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hub is also in conjunction with the new accountability framework, which has been in the works for two years and was overhauled from the existing system. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new framework is intended to depict how schools are meeting all requirements set by state laws and regulations, and provide “timely” and “transparent” information on student and school performance, according to the VDOE.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Education leaders, including members of the Board of Education, said the existing system has been considered “vague” and fails to clearly state to the public how students are performing academically since its development in 2018-2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new system also aims to improve the direction of state resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, Youngkin said he would commit at least an additional $50 million to support schools that were “most in need,” as well as an unspecified amount of additional operating funds for the Office of School Quality. The Richmond Times-Dispatch previously </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/education/virginia-education-assessment-system/article_4773aef0-8cc3-11ef-aa61-6780d4a1c068.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the agency requested $125 million for the assessment system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data collection on assessments is underway, and full implementation of the plan &#8211; is set to begin in the 2025-26 school year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public speakers at Board of Education meetings and Democratic lawmakers have </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/education/virginia-education-accountability-hashmi/article_1c46cf0e-8ff3-11ef-9fbb-ef6affd1b57d.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criticized</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> agency leaders for using performance labels that they say have a negative connotation. They also said that they believe the overhauling of the system was rushed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speakers have also said that the changes would increase current inequities for students, and require teachers to earn additional certifications to teach accelerated coursework in middle school mathematics, science, history and social science. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">English learners, which have been typically excluded because of the language barrier, will also be considered in the accountability calculations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The previous rules allowed VDOE to exclude ESL students from their assessment for 11 months per year. Under the new rules, the agency can only discount ESL student data for three months of the year.. Under the previous regulations, approximately 35,000 students were excluded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maria Arcara and Selene Cerankosky, the two students who received the no-contact orders, responded to the Sept. 27 proposal in an online chat group, according to a </span><a href="https://adfmedialegalfiles.blob.core.windows.net/files/CerankoskyComplaint.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filed on behalf of the students’ attorneys from Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal organization focused on protecting religious rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cerankosky said if women accessed male restrooms, she believed that men would seek to access private female spaces, which would violate her safety and privacy as well as her religious convictions about human sexuality, ADF stated. Acara agreed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the exchange of views led the student, identified in the lawsuit as Mr. Doe, to accuse them of bigotry and report them to the university’s Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Office. Arcara and Cerankosky received no-contact orders prohibiting them from contacting Mr. Doe</span><b>.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ADF claims that their clients potentially face expulsion from school and scrutiny in their legal careers due to the orders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorneys also claim in the complaint that the school’s </span><a href="https://universitypolicy.gmu.edu/policies/sexual-harassment-policy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allows the school to include protected speech as “sexual harassment.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ADF claims the policy “does not require the DEI Office to determine that sexual harassment occurred, give notice to students before they are disciplined, advise the accused of the allegations, or allow students to appeal ‘supportive measures’—which include no-contact orders—imposed by the DEI Office.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tyson Langhofer, senior counsel and director of the ADF Center for Academic Freedom, said that Arcara and Cerankosky expressed their opinion about the biological differences between men and women, but Mr. Doe’s proposal “blurs those lines at the expense of safety, privacy, and religious conviction. Because of this, their academic and professional careers are now in serious jeopardy.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Langhofer added that the university’s policy is “far too subjective” and allows university officials to punish students simply because “their opinions about hotly debated social issues don’t align with their own.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">George Mason University President Gregory Washington, Sharnnia Artis, vice president for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and Chief Diversity Officer, and Thomas Bluestein, Title IX coordinator and assistant vice president of equity and access services, are named in the lawsuit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The university acknowledged The Mercury&#8217;s request for comment but did not supply a response before press time. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But after five months, there has yet to be a hearing or word on when one will occur.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zahra Jalajel, a senior at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, said the House&#8217;s lack of action suggests that it is “supportive” of the universities&#8217; and law enforcement&#8217;s protest response, which, in VCU’s case, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">included using pepper spray to clear encampments and arresting 13 people.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jalajel described the experiences as “brutal” after watching friends and schoolmates being dragged and arrested by police, and their belongings including laptops being permanently destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think that by not having those conversations, it is saying that we&#8217;re not important and what occurred to us is not important to them,” said Jalajel.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Updated campus protest policies still a concern</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students, university faculty members, and organizers hoped that lawmakers&#8217; interest would help influence how universities responded to the demonstrations and take accountability for the flurry of policy changes about public demonstrations several schools have made since the protests. Free speech advocates have described the series of updated campus policies </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/03/virginia-colleges-change-protest-rules-mirroring-unprecedented-u-s-trend-advocate-says/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“unprecedented” </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and questioned whether they infringed on students’ First Amendment rights. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was violent; it was the unnecessary use of violence, and people were hurt and harmed. It didn&#8217;t have to happen that way,&#8221; said Walt Heinecke, immediate past president of the American Association of University Professors Chapter at the University of Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think faculty staff and students around the commonwealth are asking for some accountability about what&#8217;s been happening and what has happened since with the changes of university protest policies.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Others hoped some legislation could also be proposed for the upcoming session starting in January, but they did not have any specific ideas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the spring, Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration has urged Virginia’s colleges and universities to “take proactive steps to update policies and improve communication channels before students return this fall,” according to an Aug. 8 </span><a href="https://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Campus-Safety-and-Security-A-Message-From-Secretary-of-Education-copy.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">email</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> quoting Secretary of Education Aimee Guidera.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VCU has made changes like </span><a href="https://vcu.public.doctract.com/doctract/documentportal/08DCB87F8F1BF38525EBA350748F2D3D" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">requiring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> students to have identification when covering their faces or heads, and </span><a href="https://vcu.public.doctract.com/doctract/documentportal/08DA32A740D31FB4D9FC17CC1351AF65" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">banning encampments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on campus grounds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Charlottesville, the University of Virginia administration has already implemented new disciplinary and protest policies “with no student input” from faculty members and students, according to an Aug. 21 letter from AAUP Chapter at UVA.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="5FwkLGe6KL"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/08/uva-president-said-protest-outcome-upsetting-professors-condemn-administrations-actions/">UVA president said protest outcome ‘upsetting’; professors condemn administration&#8217;s actions</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;UVA president said protest outcome ‘upsetting’; professors condemn administration&#8217;s actions&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/08/uva-president-said-protest-outcome-upsetting-professors-condemn-administrations-actions/embed/#?secret=Yrxn4VmTTM#?secret=5FwkLGe6KL" data-secret="5FwkLGe6KL" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heinecke fears the longer lawmakers wait to meet, the policy changes could negatively impact students and faculty members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that the policy changes at UVA would increase the punitive nature of protesting and make it “almost near to impossible for students to protest in what is normally accepted ways of protesting.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Faculty members and students could also face harsher penalties, including termination or expulsion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They have made it harder to protest, they have made the consequences for protesting more severe, and they are actually squelching the First Amendment rights of students both at a psychological level and a policy level,” Heinecke said.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Legislators’ response</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Majority Leader Charniele Herring, D-Alexandria, briefly spoke with the Mercury after the first meeting was canceled. However, neither the office of Del. Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, or Herring, both committee chairs, have responded to questions about the second cancellation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Hamas, a Palestinian militant group, attacked Israel near the Gaza strip last October, killing 1,200, injuring hundreds, and taking hostages, demonstrators have called for a cease-fire and protested at five universities in Virginia last spring. In the resulting aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack, Israel declared war and over 41,000 Palestinians have been killed, while nearly 100,000 were injured and the health care system in Gaza has collapsed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia demonstrations ended with more than 125 arrests at four campuses in the commonwealth — the University of Mary Washington, Virginia Commonwealth University, Virginia Tech and the University of Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since lawmakers in both chambers </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/14/virginia-lawmakers-to-study-campus-safety-policies-after-series-of-protests/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">formed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> select committees in May to examine campus safety only Senate lawmakers have met, which was a contentious gathering between students, faculty members and some lawmakers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans disagreed with the hearing process, described as a “fact-finding” session, because lawmakers could not ask university leaders questions publicly. Lawmakers were urged to submit questions afterward in writing. The meeting agenda also went beyond the scope of the events, and no law enforcement agencies were directly invited to speak; instead, they were offered to comment through university leaders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the meeting, Capitol Police had to break up students and faculty members with opposing views. Jalajel, who identifies as a Black Palestinian, said the confrontation is an example of why Virginia’s legislature needs to get involved sooner rather than later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think the climate worsens every day, and I think the sooner we have the (hearings) … maybe we&#8217;re able to make some changes before it gets worse,” Jalajel said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A second meeting has yet to be scheduled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jack Leff, a recent Virginia Tech graduate arrested during the April campus protest, attempted to find more about the conversations between the House committee chairs and House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth. However, after reviewing the responses from Leff’s records request, the offices invoked their working papers exemptions and didn’t release any correspondence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leff, now an adjunct professor who identifies as Jewish, said it&#8217;s important for lawmakers to investigate the campus protests to ensure the First Amendment rights of everyone, including Palestinian and Jewish activists, are honored.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Abandoning their responsibility to protect Palestinian, Jewish, and activist students is a failure to uphold First Amendment rights,” Leff said, adding that it&#8217;s truly “undemocratic not to be investigating universities more in response to these protests.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leff said he’s worried about retaliation for his involvement in the encampment at Virginia Tech in the spring. Despite his “strong” employment record, he said Virginia Tech failed to renew his contract as a staff member following his arrest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oliver Nicholson, a senior at the University of Virginia, experienced a similar issue at an encampment at his university. Even though the court dismissed the charges against him, and Nicholson said he regained the job he lost, he is now concerned about losing his job again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said the House holding its hearings could help everyone understand what happened at Virginia’s universities in response to the continuing conflict.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think having an official institution like the Virginia Senate, like the Virginia House, record it and show ‘Hey, here&#8217;s what the encampment is about,’ here&#8217;s what students endured, here&#8217;s how safe it actually was,’ rather than whatever demonization you saw on social media, I think that&#8217;s very valuable as providing truth and clarity on the issue,” Nicolson said. “So yeah, it&#8217;s disheartening to me that so many of these meetings have been canceled or pushed back. I would like to see them reinstated.”</span></p>

(Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, Virginia lawmakers discussed ways to address the state’s decades-old funding formula, which determines the funding level for public schools, and considered a series of near-term recommendations that could be phased into the commonwealth’s plans within three to four years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lifting the support cap, which limited the number of support positions the state would fund, was one of the recommendations put forth by Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission researchers. JLARC’s December </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt575.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showed that local governments in Virginia are spending more to pay for K-12 education than the commonwealth to fund the </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/constitution/article8/section2/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state’s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Standards of Quality in Virginia school divisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s SOQ formula determines funding for divisions by calculating the number of staff they need and then the cost of those staff. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other near-term recommendations from JLARC:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Address technical issues with the formula</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discontinue Great Recession-era cost reduction measures such as the support cap</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use division averages instead of approximating what most school divisions spend on operating their schools in calculations. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The commission also recommended that the Local Composite Index, or a locality’s ability to pay education costs, should be changed to a three-year average instead of every two. They also suggested changing the at-risk funding formula that would impact low-income or students identified as “at-risk,” and studying special education staffing needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The joint subcommittee, tasked with reviewing and proposing changes to the funding formula, learned that on Thursday, the near-term recommendations could be phased in over three to four years. The long-term recommendations are “more complex and will require additional review to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">implement,” the commission told them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terry Jones, a special education teacher and member of the Virginia Education Association, said at Thursday’s joint subcommittee hearing with members of both the House and Senate that since the pandemic in 2020 and the continued exodus of k-12 teachers, special education has been one of the hardest hit areas in terms of staffing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“(It’s been) so severe that classrooms are often led by substitutes or adults with no training in education and in many schools, this is more than half of the classrooms,” said Jones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said while lawmakers are considering long-term reforms, including shifting to a student-weighted funding model compared to the current staff-based model, “they don&#8217;t address the immediate needs we face today,” urging them to act immediately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the long-term recommendations offered by JLARC:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Develop and adopt new staffing ratios similar to more accurately reflect how divisions are staffed</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Update old salary assumptions during rebenchmarking, a period every two years in which the state reviews the cost of continuing to provide direct aid to programs </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Replace the cost of competing, a measure to help school divisions compete for staff in more expensive labor markets, with a new and more accurate method</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add economies of scale adjustment, or a cost savings measure, to provide additional funding to divisions with fewer than 2,000 students.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Understanding the support cap</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to staff, the committee received responses about the funding formula from nearly 60 respondents, who were not identified to the public. Staff said some of the responses expressed support for lifting the support cap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cap was enacted during the Great Recession in 2007, impacting central office and administrative, technical, clerical, maintenance and instructional support positions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funding levels have never been fully restored, but the support cap was partially lifted last year, which increased the funding ratio from 21 support positions per 1,000 pupils to 24 per 1,000 pupils.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Terry Austin, R-Botetourt, said he hopes the committee will work with the Virginia Department of Education to ensure the funding supports classrooms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know the support cap is very broad and what it covers, but I hope our emphasis will be on improving the quality of education and putting the dollars where we&#8217;ll get the most benefit from them,” Austin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislature </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2024/1/SB30/Introduced/CA/117/3s/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">allocated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $600,000 to the department over the next two years to support the subcommittee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of studying special education staffing needs, JLARC identified that per-pupil special education funding has declined over the last 10 years when adjusted for inflation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers also found that the most significant gap between SOQ formula estimates for staffing compared to actual division staffing was in instructional aides, including special education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the last session, Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB624" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would have reviewed special education staffing needs in an omnibus package he and Democrats sparred over regarding teacher pay. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, some of the legislation’s elements were successfully passed in the 2024-2026 budget. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers agreed to allocate $72.1 million over the next two years to expand and provide targeted support for English learner students and $371.3 million in additional funding for at-risk students over the next two school years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislature also redirected approximately $650 million each year and added around $180 million yearly to develop the at-risk program. Most localities have opted into the program, which helps to provide sufficient funding for schools to serve low-income students in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;ve done quite a bit in the areas of ELL and at-risk, but this is one of the areas that we have neglected,” said Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, adding that there may be some overlap with ELL and at-risk, “but I think that this is one area where we do need to do some work.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee will next meet on Dec. 9 ahead of the 2025 General Assembly session that starts in January.</span></p>

(Courtesy of Rebecca Rivas/Missouri Independent)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Board of Education sent the proposed </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/58022/638646898284400000" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">standards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for licensed child care centers for regulatory review on Tuesday, potentially ending the existing standards to enhance the safety of children receiving care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The review will include </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the publication of the proposed regulation in the Virginia Register, then</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after review by the Attorney General&#8217;s office and the governor, public comments will be solicited and revisions made prior to the final adoption by the board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, after some providers aired concerns over the changes at the business meeting, the board on Thursday directed staff to create guidance for providers on screen time and other common issues raised through variance requests. The board also removed the requirement for providers to use only liquid soap in the proposed regulation since some children can only use bar soap because of sensory needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Honestly, it just seems like an over-regulation to require child care centers to apply for a variance for something like just using a bar of soap,” said Board Member Meg Bryce, a Gov. Glenn Youngkin appointee. “I have a 3-and-a-half-year-old who can&#8217;t pump liquid soap, so I can see why this would be a pretty common issue in child care centers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process began in December 2021 to protect children while also meeting state and federal laws, considering the cost and operational impact of regulations, and reducing any “burdensome” requirements, according to Virginia Department of Education (VDOE) staff. Public comments on the updated rule will still be accepted through the Early Childhood Advisory Committee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed regulation, dubbed Standards for Licensed Child Day Centers, is expected to help people more easily understand the standards and keep kids safer under state and federal laws. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The regulation describes to providers the health and safety requirements of operating a child care center and provides the standards to protect children under the age of 13, and also reduces risks and ensures the services and resources at the centers are “conducive to the well-being of children,” according to VDOE staff.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, the Virginia General Assembly transferred oversight of early childhood care and education programs from the Board of Social Services to the Virginia Board of Education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, funding and oversight of early childhood programs and policies, including the Child Care Subsidy Program and child care licensing and monitoring, transitioned to the Virginia Department of Education from the Department of Social Services on July 1, 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“From the beginning, we&#8217;ve tried since the shift to DOE to say our job is to partner with programs to keep kids healthy and safe,” said Jenna Conway, deputy superintendent at VDOE, adding that if any providers don’t understand the standards or need additional help the department will assist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She continued that there is still more work to be done and it is essential that providers “believe in these regulations” so they can employ these practices “day in, day out” to prevent child care center fatalities in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed regulation includes </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title22.1/chapter14.1/section22.1-289.059/#:~:text=%C2%A7%2022.1%2D289.059.-,Possession%20and%20administration%20of%20an%20appropriate%20weight,dosage%20of%20epinephrine%20by%20employees." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a state law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requiring centers to have a stock of epinephrine on hand and to train staff on its administration. </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title22.1/chapter14.1/section22.1-289.057/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requires centers to perform lead testing to ensure drinking water meets minimum standards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the proposed regulation, the definition “school-age” was revised to clarify that the allowance for children 5 years of age by Sept. 30 to be considered school-age is not exclusive to school-age only groups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Records could include a child’s dietary restrictions and any special accommodations needed, and centers must also inform the superintendent if a child is lost, missing or wandered away unattended from the facility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The height requirement of climbing equipment installed outdoors after June 1, 2005, was proposed to be reduced from seven feet to six for toddlers and preschool children. Indoor climbing equipment height requirement would remain at five feet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of a handful of speakers requesting the board modify the proposed regulation on Thursday said the height requirement is unclear. Other speakers urged the board to modify the regulation that calls for providers to increase the ratio of staff to children by two, which they fear may not decrease the costs for centers entirely. Speakers also asked the board to modify the standards around visual media screen time to differentiate between the age groups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conway said there are approximately 2,600 child care centers across the state.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Correction: This story was updated to reflect that the Board of Education’s decision was not finalized, but instead will go through a regulatory process before it can potentially be completed in six to eight months.</span></em></p>

(Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parents of nearly 10,000 children in Virginia are seeking early childhood care and education services primarily in the south and central regions, according to data collected by the Department of Education as of Oct. 1. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Industry experts say the challenge is balancing capacity and demand as the state focuses on preparing children and supporting families.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia faces unmet parental demand for all three state-funded child care programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state-funded programs are the </span><a href="https://www.childcare.virginia.gov/providers/child-care-subsidy" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Child Care Subsidy Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which provides subsidies to eligible families; the </span><a href="https://vecf.org/mixed-delivery-grants/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mixed Delivery</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program, which offers funding to private, community-based preschools to serve children at risk of entering school without the necessary skills, and the </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/teaching-learning-assessment/early-childhood-care-education/virginia-preschool-initiative" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Preschool Initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program, which is provided for free, for four-year-old children.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unmet parent demand for child care is essentially a loss or a leak in our workforce pipeline,” said Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield, at the Oct. 9 Commission on Early Childhood and Education meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. David Bulova, D- Fairfax, added that while the commission is off to a great start, there is still a long way to go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve built up a system that I think is gathering a great reputation, and so it’s not surprising that people are taking notice and they want to participate in that,” Bulova said. “This is really a very important part of our economy, it’s an important part of our workforce development and it’s also just a really great way to help families become self-sufficient and successful in the long term.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The wait list</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to data collected by VDOE, 9,657 children, including infants, toddlers, and school-age children, are on the Child Care Subsidy Program waitlist based on information collected from 93 of the 120 localities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jenna Conway, deputy superintendent at VDOE, said at the commission meeting that the remaining localities either have enough attrition or are seeing a different level of demand. The agency did not provide data on the enrollment changes for the Mixed Delivery or Virginia Preschool Initiative programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chesapeake Bay region has the most significant demand for services at 24%, followed by the Central and North Central regions at 22%.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40454" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40454" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024.10.09_ECCE_CommissionSlides-Waitlist-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1440" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024.10.09_ECCE_CommissionSlides-Waitlist-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024.10.09_ECCE_CommissionSlides-Waitlist-300x169.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024.10.09_ECCE_CommissionSlides-Waitlist-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024.10.09_ECCE_CommissionSlides-Waitlist-768x432.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024.10.09_ECCE_CommissionSlides-Waitlist-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024.10.09_ECCE_CommissionSlides-Waitlist-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  (Courtesy of the Virginia Department of Education)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A total of 4,100 infants and toddlers comprise most of the children on the waitlist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conway said that excluding any policy changes, $112.7 million in additional funds would be needed to fully cover the 9,657 children on the waitlist. Excluding school-age children would cost $94.1 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She added that about two-thirds of families seek options in the private sector because they have infants and toddlers or need a full-day or full-year option. A third of families are seeking options through public school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the agency, Virginia families contribute an average of 2% of gross income. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current average copayment is $77 per month. Changing the current copayment policy for any of the three state-funded programs requires a change to Virginia’s biennial budget, completed in May.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Improving child care services</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the progress made to identify the need and demand for child care services, the commission celebrated the state’s </span><a href="https://earlychildhoodquality.doe.virginia.gov/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">release</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 3,121 profiles of publicly funded early childhood sites across the commonwealth detailing each program&#8217;s health, safety and learning information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data was published on Oct. 8.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The profiles stem from the Unified Virginia Quality Birth to Five system, or </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/teaching-learning-assessment/early-childhood-care-education/quality-measurement-and-improvement-vqb5" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VQB5</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, focused on improving children’s school readiness and expanding access to parents and support providers. The system is also a tool to help gauge the effectiveness of Virginia’s early childhood education programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bulova said earlier that more than half of child care programs, approximately 75%, that received public funding previously did not participate in the state’s voluntary quality measures. His 2020 legislation, which he co-patroned, led to all publicly funded providers being required to participate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coyner said she was anxious to begin reviewing the data as the commission seeks to support families with access, costs and quality of services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For our families to work, attend job training, get more education and pursue greater self-sufficiency, which is our goal, while putting their children on track for success in school, we need to ensure that eligible families have access,” Coyner told the panel at the meeting. “And again, that comes back to our task with finance, right? Access and quality equates to our ability to finance the system.”</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The commission will conclude its review and recommend updates to the current copayment schedule, parental work requirements, and attendance expectations applicable to the Child Care Subsidy Program and Mixed Delivery Grant Program by Dec. 1, according to </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://vecf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024.10.09_ECCE-Commission-Budget-Language.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">language</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> in the biennium budget. The commission was tasked with considering </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">leveraging state general funds to minimize the fiscal cliff as family income increases beyond the program eligibility</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">” </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">and using</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> &#8220;</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reasonable copayments to minimize the need for additional general funds</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee made the recommendation, along with a list of others — including funding special education based on based on the state funding formula and continuing ongoing training for families and using the new </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/teaching-learning-assessment/student-assessment/virginia-sol-assessment-program/virginia-alternate-assessment-program-vaap" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">student evaluation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tool — to the Board of Education, as the Virginia Department of Education (VDOE) and lawmakers continue working to improve services to special needs families and meet federal requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2019, the U.S. Department of Education has been investigating how Virginia handles special education disputes. The department previously determined that the state repeatedly failed to resolve complaints filed by parents and did not have “reasonably designed” procedures and practices to ensure a timely resolution process for those complaints.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A study by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, the state’s legislative watchdog, surveyed parents and found that they were not adequately informed of the state-level resources available to them for resolving disputes with their child’s school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Samantha Hollins, an associate superintendent with VDOE, said given the increasing number of complaints, the Office of Dispute Resolution’s staff size has made it a challenge to meet the adjudication requirements set by the federal government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee recommended that VDOE evaluate the proper staffing levels in the Office of Dispute Resolution and the Office of Program Improvement within the Department of Special Populations, which handle complaints to “ensure the increasing needs of families of children with disabilities requesting assistance can be met,” the report states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The department should consider providing an annual summary in order to help the advisory committee perform its “statutorily required duty of identifying trends in the issues being raised by parents of students with disabilities in the commonwealth, the committee suggested.”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VDOE and lawmakers have taken several steps to improve services for nearly 181,000 students with disabilities this school year, which coincide with the advisory committee’s recommendations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The department created a system to oversee the development and use of individualized education programs (IEPs) for students with special needs.  Educators are now required to undergo more training on providing inclusive special education instruction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The board also adopted regulatory changes to how the state handles compliance complaints regarding students with disabilities and dedicated funds to examine the dispute resolution system, which has been criticized for failing to monitor and respond to complaints against school districts.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Teacher pipeline and funding </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the Sept. 26 presentation to the board, the committee also raised awareness about incentivizing and funding high school educator prep programs to develop a pipeline for potential special education teachers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia was one of a few states to </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/Home/Components/News/News/399/227" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">receive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a $6 million grant to expand its registered apprenticeship program for K-12 educators and create opportunities in the teaching profession. Last year, 28 school divisions launched registered teacher apprenticeship programs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee also recommended that the department ensure that if a locality uses Virginia IEP and has optional add-ons, those comply with IDEA parent participation requirements, “specifically that parents are able to access their student’s information and increase their participation in the IEP process.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://sites.ed.gov/idea/about-idea/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Individuals with Disabilities Education Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (IDEA) is a federal law that ensures students with disabilities receive a “free appropriate public education” and guarantees special education services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hollins said the department and governor’s administration are “actively” seeking additional resources to support some of the specialty modules. An allocation from the special education fund goes to the IEP process, but there is no dedicated fund to support it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s also been recent evidence that Virginia has underfunded schools for years, leaving localities responsible for filling the gaps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the JLARC 2023 study into K-12 funding, analysts found that the Standards of Quality formula, which helps the state determine how much funding schools need, estimated that fewer special education teachers are needed than actual staffing, and a workgroup of K–12 teachers, principals and other school staff concluded. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For fiscal year 2023, the funding formula calculated that 13,300 special education teachers were needed, which was 93% of the number employed by school divisions and 66% of what practitioners estimated was required. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State analysts </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/summary/Rpt575Rec.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recommended</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lawmakers require the VDOE to work with school division staff and experts to develop new special education staffing need estimates based on a review of current ones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts also suggested the legislature amend state law to replace the funding formula calculations for special education and English as a second language students, including any associated calculations for benefits and payroll taxes under the Standards of Quality, with student-based funding calculations based on actual average school division expenditures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers formed a joint subcommittee to review and transform the state’s funding formula, which could take a while.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The subcommittee will vote on a work plan at its Oct. 31 meeting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, Alliance Defending Freedom, representing the Harrisonburg teachers, filed the brief in Rockingham County Circuit Court. In June 2022, Harrisonburg City teachers Deborah Figliola, Kristine Marsh, and Laura Nelson filed a </span><a href="https://adfmedia.org/press-release/parents-teachers-sue-va-school-district-concealing-childrens-discomfort-biological" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> challenging the school board’s decisions that they claim “violate Virginia’s Free Speech Clause and the Virginia Religious Freedom Restoration Act by compelling them to speak a message to which they object,” the attorneys stated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legal team recently </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/30/va-school-board-to-pay-575k-to-fired-teacher-who-refused-to-use-transgender-students-pronouns/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">settled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a case for a former high school French teacher who declined to refer to a transgender student by his requested pronouns. The case ended with the West Point School Board agreeing to pay $575,000 in damages and attorneys’ fees.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal organization focused on protecting religious rights, claimed the teachers were directed to “immediately implement” three practices through a series of trainings: asking students their preferred pronouns; always using them, even when contrary to a student&#8217;s sex; and doing so without notifying parents or seeking their consent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ADF Senior Counsel Vincent Wagner said by doing so, the Harrisonburg City School Board is compelling its employees to refer to students by their pronouns that don’t correspond with their sex.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[Figliola, Marsh, and Nelson] like all School Board employees, face a choice: comply with the trainings’ ‘Best Practices’ or risk losing their jobs,” the brief read. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wagner added that Virginia’s Constitution and other laws contain “robust free speech” and “free exercise protections for public employees, and let teachers do their jobs. Because of those protections, we urge the court to rule for our clients.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In September 2022, Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/parents-students/for-parents/model-policies-on-ensuring-privacy-dignity-and-respect-for-all-students-and-parents-in-virginia-s-public-schools" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">overhauled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the state’s policies for transgender and nonbinary students to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/09/16/youngkin-administration-overhauls-virginia-transgender-student-policies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">require parental approval</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for any changes to students’ “names, nicknames, and/or pronouns.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The changes also included a directive to schools to keep parents “informed about their children’s well-being,” and a mandate that student participation in activities and athletics be based on sex and the use of bathrooms correspond to a students’ sex, “except to the extent that federal law requires.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt593.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, which conducts analysis and provides oversight of state agencies on behalf of the General Assembly, each institution is &#8220;attempting to address its viability risks through various initiatives and efforts.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JLARC assessed Virginia&#8217;s 15 public four-year public higher education institutions in three areas: enrollment, institutional appeal and finances using data collected through 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Mark Sickles, D-Arlington, chair of the commission, said there’s a number of factors that have led to the increased viability risks for some institutions, including the state’s shift to offering education based on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, or STEM, at four-year universities compared to the smaller, liberal arts schools, who are attempting to offer more STEM-education programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is not a surprise to the presidents or the boards of visitors of all these schools,” said Sickles. “They&#8217;ve already taken some remedial action. I&#8217;m really curious whether what they&#8217;ve done now is going to work or not.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers also found that public opinion on the value of higher education has changed while institutions, including Radford University, recover from enrollment declines over the past decade.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Factors putting the schools at risk</h4>

(Courtesy of the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Radford’s viability is at risk because of declining enrollment, after JLARC found that its total full-time enrollment dropped by 26% over the past decade, more than any other four-year institution in the commonwealth including nearby Virginia Tech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mary Washington and Virginia State’s viability is at risk due to the institutions’ inability to increase tuition without losing students and the age and condition of their facilities. Mary Washington also carries a risk due to its financial ratio because of its relatively high debt from absorbing foundation debt and assets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between 2015-22, VSU, which has the oldest facilities in the commonwealth, experienced a decline in tuition revenue per student by 26%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, questioned if the risks against Virginia State have any connection to the institution </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/25/va-governor-rejects-claim-of-underfunding-virginia-state-university/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">not being funded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the same levels as Virginia Tech after the federal government estimated a year ago that VSU is owed over $277 million in state funding from 1987 to 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Virginia Tech, the historically Black college in Petersburg is a land grant institution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s an HBCU and this state is known for not having funded HBCUs to the levels that they should be funded,” Locke said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration has denied the claim, stating that the U.S. Departments of Education and Agriculture used a </span><a href="https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">database</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the administration characterized as having “well-documented issues.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of JLARC’s study in the cost efficiency of public higher education institutions, researchers found that Christopher Newport, Longwood, and Norfolk State Universities and the University of Virginia’s College at Wise all have a “very low” viability risk. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JLARC made no further recommendations for action in addition to the analysis and planning processes each institution conducts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sickles said the state increased its funding for higher education over the past two bienniums, which includes adopting a budget that provides </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/sessionreport/2024/2/2434/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$205.4 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the 2024-26 biennium to increase access, aﬀordability and degree production at public colleges and universities.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Recommendations on spending and efficiency</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a separate </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt594.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to address the increased spending with the slow growth of enrollment, researchers recommended amending state code to place a cap on the amount of student fees and institutional funds that can be allocated to intercollegiate athletics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At James Madison University, athletics revenue grew by $11.8 million over 10 years, $8.7 million of which was funded by student fees and the institution without exceeding the </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title23.1/chapter13/section23.1-1309/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statutory limit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> set in 2015.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers also recommended the legislature require institutions experiencing reductions in cost efficiency because of declining enrollment to report their efforts on how they’re working to improve enrollment operations.  JLARC also suggested amending the state code to ensure schools’ boards of visitors fully consider the impact that policies and decisions in non-instructional areas have on student costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers found that some institutions have not implemented efficiency strategies in areas of spending growth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, researchers added that some institutions are not “consistently” implementing efficiency strategies previously recommended by JLARC and subsequently required in the Appropriation Act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Total spending by Virginia’s 15 public four-year institutions increased by 64% over the past 20 years, which was adjusted for inflation. Instruction made up the largest cost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Total spending by Virginia’s 15 public four-year institutions increased 64% over the past 20 years. This was greater than the national average for public four-year institutions during that time period, which was 50 percent.”</span></p>

<p dir="ltr">Demonstrations erupted around the world after the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attack on Israel that killed approximately 1,200 people, according to the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/gaza-death-toll-hamas-war-israel-40000-32a79e03c8eb62669412dab23d03219e" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://apnews.com/article/gaza-death-toll-hamas-war-israel-40000-32a79e03c8eb62669412dab23d03219e&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1727988385777000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0003H3QDYKal7pEwoTUlA3">Associated Press</a>. About 250 hostages were seized in the attack.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A war ensued in the region that has led to the death of at least 41,000 Palestinians, as of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/gaza-death-toll-how-many-palestinians-has-israels-campaign-killed-2024-07-25/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/gaza-death-toll-how-many-palestinians-has-israels-campaign-killed-2024-07-25/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1727988385777000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3vkfleJJr4yLhdOyDdiKho">October.</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">State Attorney General Jason Miyares denounced student demonstrations last November, and <a href="https://files.constantcontact.com/d3e83e11901/99d2bc94-226a-42bb-8bea-28f626cda252.pdf?rdr=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://files.constantcontact.com/d3e83e11901/99d2bc94-226a-42bb-8bea-28f626cda252.pdf?rdr%3Dtrue&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1727988385777000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0_iVf3xynaASRHRn1cagNa">stated</a> Jewish students felt unsafe and threatened by certain chants and slogans that called for a free Palestine. Miyares concluded some of the speech is antisemitic and might not be protected by the First Amendment, because it could incite “imminent lawless action”.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Miyares recommended Virginia colleges implement policy changes to foster safer campuses and avoid disruptions of the educational environment, according to communications director Shaun Kenney</p>
<p dir="ltr">State Secretary of Education Aimee Guidera in August urged governing board members of Virginia universities to update their codes of conduct, according to an <a href="https://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Campus-Safety-and-Security-A-Message-From-Secretary-of-Education-copy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Campus-Safety-and-Security-A-Message-From-Secretary-of-Education-copy.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1727988385777000&amp;usg=AOvVaw02107xq0feGQeYCohQqbGw">email</a> statement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Considering the challenges faced on college and university campuses last academic year and reports that the fall will be even more chaotic, we have asked each institution take proactive steps to update policies” Guidera stated.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Students for Justice in Palestine has chapters across Virginia that organize campus demonstrations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">State leaders, in multiple statements and most <a href="https://virginia-senate.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=3&amp;clip_id=6906" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://virginia-senate.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id%3D3%26clip_id%3D6906&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1727988385777000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2V9LXzBPrrb615EXYsvi4L">recently</a> at a legislative hearing, highlight the SJP as a source of antisemitism and disruption on campuses.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Last academic year, an anti-abortion campus event at VCU also ended in disruption, when abortion-rights <a href="https://commonwealthtimes.org/2023/04/14/protesters-were-assaulted-at-pro-life-event-now-demand-apology-from-vcu-president/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://commonwealthtimes.org/2023/04/14/protesters-were-assaulted-at-pro-life-event-now-demand-apology-from-vcu-president/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1727988385777000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2voFW1rYUx5qHcntwx734y">protesters</a> interrupted a meeting because they did not want people “spewing hate on our campus,” according to the Commonwealth Times.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The new policies will impact how and where student organizations meet moving forward.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sereen Haddad is a Palestinian student and organizer for the SJP chapter at VCU since October 2023. Haddad has regularly helped host peaceful protests in support of Palestine.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Haddad is concerned the policies intended to protect free speech, actually infringe on free speech rights. The new policies limit outlets for peaceful protests, she said. Students can only display posters the size of a letter-size piece of paper and assemble in designated areas.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It’s very clear that quite frankly all these policies that are being put in place are no way promoting safety, instead they do promote fear and they promote silence,” Haddad said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The 25-year-old Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression is a nonpartisan and nonprofit organization that defends free speech.</p>
<p dir="ltr">FIRE rates and tracks the policies that regulate student expression at almost 500 colleges and universities. It works to ensure students are able to lawfully protest, and reaches out to universities whose policies violate the First Amendment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Laura Beltz, director of policy reform at FIRE, has seen the impact of increased policies regarding student demonstrations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We&#8217;ve seen a lot of policy changes happening this academic year,” Beltz said. “An unprecedented number of new restrictions on the way students can get out and express themselves on campus.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">No Virginia universities are in direct violation of the First Amendment, yet these institutions have taken a heavy hand through new restrictive policies, according to Beltz.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I&#8217;m concerned that students will see these new regulations when they come back to campus and the message they will receive is that it&#8217;s either too onerous to get out and express themselves or that there&#8217;s really no reasonable opportunity to do so,” Beltz said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">FIRE <a href="https://www.thefire.org/colleges/university-virginia" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.thefire.org/colleges/university-virginia&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1727988385777000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1m1Fm2M9gDS3X8X7uYb9LZ">ranked</a> UVA.

<p dir="ltr">The Senate Education and Health Committee <a href="https://virginia-senate.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=3&amp;clip_id=6906" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://virginia-senate.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id%3D3%26clip_id%3D6906&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1727988385777000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2V9LXzBPrrb615EXYsvi4L">met</a> Sept. 17 to hear directly from those who were involved in student-led actions, as well as eyewitnesses, and to learn about the new policies.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Numerous speakers from Virginia colleges offered testimony at the two-hour long hearing, including teachers and students arrested in the spring. Jewish students and people affiliated with universities offered perspectives that the demonstrations were important to address injustice. Representatives also said certain SJP chants are offensive.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Committee chair Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield, a former college professor, encouraged universities to think about uniform policies to approach student activism and faculty rights when it comes to protest.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, teaches high school government classes. He questioned if the Senate should be doing anything legislatively concerning college policies.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Colleges have two conflicting responsibilities: to uphold free speech and to uphold anti-discrimination, according to VanValkenburg. Colleges need to make sure all kids have a voice and are safe, he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“At the end of the day this comes down to clear boundaries, clear rules, clarity and objective standards that are followed, no matter what,” VanValkenburg said. “I might like some of those rules, I might not like some of those rules, but they’re the rules.”</p>

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Education is launching the first testing period for its phased rollout of the 2025-26 form to apply for federal financial student aid on Tuesday, with more students set to partake in this beginning testing stage than initially expected.</p>
<p>The department <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-education-department-gradually-roll-out-new-fafsa-form-dec-1" target="_blank">announced in August</a> it would be using a staggered approach to launch the 2025-26 <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/dont-give-fafsa-advocates-student-financial-aid-urge" target="_blank">Free Application for Federal Student Aid</a> — or FAFSA — in order to address any issues that might arise before the form opens up to everyone by Dec. 1. The number of students able to complete the form will gradually increase throughout four separate testing stages, with the first one beginning Oct. 1.</p>
<p>The phased rollout makes the form fully available two months later than usual and comes as the 2024-25 form — which got a makeover after Congress passed the FAFSA Simplification Act in late 2020 — faced a series of highly publicized hiccups that the department has worked to fix.</p>
<p>Earlier in September, the department <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-education-department-open-new-financial-aid-form-more-applicants" target="_blank">announced six community-based organizations</a> chosen to participate in the first testing period: Alabama Possible; Bridge 2 Life, in Florida; College AIM, in Georgia; Education is Freedom, in Texas; the Scholarship Foundation of Santa Barbara, in California; and the Scholarship Fund of Alexandria, in Virginia.</p>
<p>“Thanks to the wonderful organizations, we expect closer to 1,000 students in Beta 1 as opposed to the 100 we initially thought,” FAFSA executive adviser Jeremy Singer said on a call with reporters Monday regarding the 2025-26 form.</p>
<p>During this first testing stage, U.S. Under Secretary of Education James Kvaal said the department will process students’ FAFSAs, “give students an opportunity to make corrections, if needed, and send the records to colleges and state agencies.”</p>
<p>“Colleges will be able to use these same records when it’s time for them to make financial aid offers,” said Kvaal, who oversees higher education and financial aid, including the Office of Federal Student Aid.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Three more testing periods</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The department on Monday also named 78 community-based organizations, governmental entities, high schools, school districts and institutions of higher education to participate in its three subsequent testing periods for the 2025-26 form.</p>
<p>Three of the community-based organizations chosen to take part in the first testing period — Florida’s Bridge 2 Life; Texas’ Education is Freedom; and Virginia’s  Scholarship Fund of Alexandria — will also participate in subsequent testing stages.</p>
<p>To help students and families prepare for the 2025-26 application cycle, the department said this week it’s releasing a revised <a href="https://studentaid.gov/aid-estimator/" target="_blank">Federal Student Aid Estimator</a>, updated resources for creating a <a href="http://studentaid.gov/" target="_blank">StudentAid.Gov account</a>, including a “parent wizard,” as well as an updated prototype of the 2025-26 FAFSA.</p>
<p>Last week, the department released <a href="https://www.ed.gov/sites/ed/files/2024-09/AFocusonImprovingtheFAFSAExperience.pdf" target="_blank">a report</a> outlining 10 steps it’s taking to <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/gaps-fafsa-rollout-are-closing-watchdog-tells-us-house-panel" target="_blank">improve the FAFSA application process</a>. Part of those efforts include the department strengthening its leadership team and working to address issues for families without Social Security numbers when completing the form, in addition to vendors adding more than 700 new call center agents.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the flip side, no school was denied accreditation, leading the governor’s administration and some from the education industry to say that the existing accreditation system is a “failure” to provide the public with “accurate and actionable” insights into how well students perform academically.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Approximately 14% of the 1,824 schools are accredited with conditions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As soon as I came into office, I committed to reverse the systematic lowering of standards and lack of transparency in Virginia’s education system,” said Youngkin in a statement on Monday. “As students struggle to recover from pandemic learning loss, it’s more important than ever to prioritize high expectations, transparency and accountability. We must be honest with ourselves that too many students and schools are not on track for success.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few weeks ago, the Virginia Board of Education </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/29/virginia-board-of-education-approves-changes-to-accreditation-accountability-systems/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">approved</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a new School Performance and Support Framework for the current school year, which aims to improve the direction of state resources. Under the new system, the </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/data-policy-funding/virginia-board-of-education/board-comprehensive-plan" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">board</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will be able to set and assist students in meeting high academic expectations while supporting learning loss recovery by ensuring the school performance framework holds schools accountable for actual performance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the board’s action, the state’s accreditation system will be split into two: an accreditation system to assess whether schools meet all requirements laid out in state laws and regulations; and an accountability system to provide “timely and transparent information on student and school performance.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state is already collecting data. The plan&#8217;s full implementation will begin at the start of the next school year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In August, Youngkin praised school divisions for </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/20/virginia-students-make-some-gains-on-annual-test-scores-schools-see-less-absenteeism/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">improving</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their annual Standards of Learning tests, which measure student learning and achievement in mathematics, reading, science, writing, and history and social science. However, he acknowledged that schools have more work to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data showed that the number of schools that met or exceeded the English standard increased by 77. However, the total number of schools that met the mathematics standard dropped by 25.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past year, the governor and lawmakers have agreed to invest more state funding in instruction and current and future teachers. The commonwealth also measures achievement through attendance, which improved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the 2022-23 school year, only 647 schools met the state’s attendance indicator. The total increased to 1,509 schools in 2023-24.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agreement came several months after the Virginia Supreme Court </span><a href="https://adfmedialegalfiles.blob.core.windows.net/files/VlamingDecision.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reinstated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Vlaming’s case, which the King William Circuit Court dismissed. The lower court did not believe Vlaming had any valid reasons for the law to accept his suit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the Supreme Court determined in December that the school board violated Vlaming’s rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vlaming’s lawsuit alleged “constitutional, statutory, and breach-of-contract claims” against the school district, Justice D. Arthur Kelsey wrote in an opinion explaining the high court’s ruling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Examining only the allegations in Vlaming’s complaint, the circuit court dismissed Vlaming’s claims, finding that they failed to state legally viable causes of action. Disagreeing with the circuit court, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal organization focused on protecting religious freedoms, represented Vlaming in the case and announced the settlement Monday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Peter wasn’t fired for something he said; he was fired for something he couldn’t say. The school board violated his First Amendment rights under the Virginia Constitution and commonwealth law,” said Tyson Langhofer, senior counsel for ADF and director of the ADF Center for Academic Freedom, in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Langhofer said Vlaming felt using male pronouns to address the student were “untrue,” even though the student had recently undergone a gender transition and legal name change. ADF said that for Vlaming to use the preferred pronouns went against his religious beliefs and violated his right to free speech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to ADF, the board cleared Vlaming’s firing record and changed its policies to conform to the new policies overhauled by Gov. Glenn Youngkin. West Point School Board did not immediately respond to The Mercury’s request for comment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In September 2022, Youngkin’s administration </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/parents-students/for-parents/model-policies-on-ensuring-privacy-dignity-and-respect-for-all-students-and-parents-in-virginia-s-public-schools" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">overhauled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the state’s </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/09/12/despite-law-few-virginia-school-districts-adopt-state-model-transgender-policies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> model school policies for transgender and nonbinary students designed under former Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most notably, the list of changes included </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/09/16/youngkin-administration-overhauls-virginia-transgender-student-policies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">requiring parental approval</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for any changes to students’ “names, nicknames, and/or pronouns,” a directive to schools to keep parents “informed about their children’s well-being,” and requiring that student participation in activities and athletics be based on sex and the use of bathrooms correspond to a students’ sex, except to the extent that federal law requires.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ADF and Vlaming said they are pleased that the case has been settled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was wrongfully fired from my teaching job because my religious beliefs put me on a collision course with school administrators who mandated that teachers ascribe to only one perspective on gender identity — their preferred view,” Vlaming said in a statement.</span></p>

State support for higher education </span><a href="https://www.schev.edu/Home/Components/News/News/501/16" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increased 28%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the past five years, alongside greater investments in Advanced Placement classes and regional collaborations between community colleges and employees. It’s no surprise then that Virginia has earned accolades like </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/11/virginia-americas-top-state-for-business-nations-best-schools-solid-infrastructure.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNBC&#8217;s top ranking for education</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These achievements reflect the resilience and drive of our students, teachers, and administrators. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, these rankings obscure the fact that our K-12 education system is seriously lagging. Virginia had perhaps the </span><a href="https://cepr.harvard.edu/news/virginia-experienced-some-nation%E2%80%99s-biggest-drops-reading-and-math-scores-analysis-shows" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">greatest learning loss of any state</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during the pandemic. Nationally, Virginia’s performance is average, and we fall significantly short in serving Black, Hispanic, and economically disadvantaged students. For example, the </span><a href="https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/profiles/stateprofile/overview/VA?sfj=NP&amp;chort=1&amp;sub=MAT&amp;sj=VA&amp;st=MN&amp;year=2022R3&amp;cti=PgTab_OT" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Assessment of Education Progress</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (NAEP) shows that Virginia’s average 4</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> grade reading score (214) is below the national average (216) while the gap between low-income students and others increased 10 points from 1998 to 2022. Moreover, </span><a href="https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/subject/publications/stt2022/pdf/2023011VA8.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">35% of 8th graders are </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">below basic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in math proficiency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (including 59% of Black students and 50% of Hispanic students), meaning that a significant population of Virginia’s students are not prepared for meaningful choices in life, let alone to reach their full potential.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="OtmgW3wGAt"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/29/virginia-board-of-education-approves-changes-to-accreditation-accountability-systems/">Virginia Board of Education approves changes to accreditation, accountability systems</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia Board of Education approves changes to accreditation, accountability systems&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/29/virginia-board-of-education-approves-changes-to-accreditation-accountability-systems/embed/#?secret=cYM7vnj1ft#?secret=OtmgW3wGAt" data-secret="OtmgW3wGAt" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new Virginia accountability system the Virginia Board of Education is putting in place is an opportunity to focus on improving Virginia students’ outcomes. Unlike Virginia’s traditional accreditation model, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/29/virginia-board-of-education-approves-changes-to-accreditation-accountability-systems/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this complementary system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> promises timely and transparent school and student performance data and raises our ambitions about what we should expect from our public schools. It empowers parents, clarifies achievement, and encourages school communities to unite around common improvement goals. While some have raised concerns that over half of Virginia’s schools could be deemed ‘off track’ by the new system, such ratings should fuel our ambition to together achieve higher standards and greater excellence. A state that has, for instance, six in ten of its Black students and half of its Hispanic students below basic is going to have a lot of schools off track under any meaningful accountability system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new system’s emphasis on transparency, support for underserved student groups, and focus on advanced coursework and chronic absenteeism are vital steps forward to improve student learning and protect the civil rights of Virginia’s students. The Virginia accountability system has the potential to drive systemic change if leveraged effectively. What we’ve learned over the years here at the University of Virginia’s Partnership for Leadership in Education (UVA-PLE) highlights how such systems foster collective ownership across communities for improving outcomes. An accountability system like this can heighten attention to exemplars, guide resource allocation, and ignite collective actions towards improving outcomes, particularly for underserved students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve seen this across the country. For instance, in Colorado’s Boulder Valley School District, Alicia Sanchez Elementary received the state’s lowest accountability rating in 2018. In response, the district provided additional attention and resources to help the school implement data-informed strategies to boost collaboration, instructional delivery, and student well-being. As a result, </span><a href="https://www.bvsd.org/about/news/news-article/~board/district-news/post/alicia-sanchez-elementary-granted-highest-state-ranking-earns-governors-bright-spot-award" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the school in 2020 received the highest rating in the state and the Governor’s Bright Spot Award</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with notable acceleration in Black and Hispanic student achievement. Similarly, the district leveraged lessons from exemplars and challenges highlighted in the accountability system to heighten school support across the district, spurring the district to now </span><a href="https://www.the74million.org/article/which-school-districts-do-the-best-job-of-teaching-kids-to-read/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">outperform what demographics would expect</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, too few districts have rallied community support to improve student outcomes due to a lack of clear focus on this goal obscured by accreditation rankings that do not reflect the reality of school performance. Despite this, Danville Public Schools leaders were able to heighten attention to what it would take to accelerate student achievement due to strong leadership’s focus on the issue, their embrace of the state’s corrective action plan and locally developed ideas to heighten quality teacher instructional support, and a partnership with UVA-PLE. The </span><a href="https://www.danvilleva.gov/DocumentCenter/View/32359/23-24-Danville-Public-Schools-SOL-Test-Results" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">meaningful recent progress for students in Danville</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> demonstrates what could be possible with greater transparency and attention to student achievement across the state.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We must approach this accountability system with a forward-thinking mindset. It should drive leaders to invest in proven interventions, competitive teacher pay, and increased support for schools in line with recommendations from the state’s </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/landing-2023-virginias-k-12-funding-formula.asp" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Any accountability system will have flaws and need improvement, but we can adapt over time based on learning from implementation to ensure the system recognizes schools that demonstrate exceptional growth, increases access to rigorous dual enrollment or internship opportunities and shines a light on where we must serve students better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a civil rights issue. Ensuring the system ultimately increases equitable and excellent outcomes is an opportunity for bipartisan collaboration, collective innovation and a commitment to meeting every student’s needs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, the Founding Freedoms Law Center, the legal division of the Family Foundation, announced it filed a lawsuit in Henrico County Circuit Court, claiming the state violated their clients&#8217; right to free speech and religious freedom. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The suit names the Virginia Board of Counseling, Virginia Department of Health Professions, and its director, Arne Owens, as the defendants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The American Medical Association has denounced conversion therapy, </span><a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/population-care/advocating-lgbtq-community" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">saying</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the practice is based on the idea that “homosexuality and gender nonconformity are mental disorders and that sexual orientation and gender identity can be changed,” assumptions that are not based on medical or scientific evidence.</span></p>
<p>Narissa Rahaman, executive director for Equality Virginia, said the Family Foundation&#8217;s latest action is another attempt to discriminate against LGBTQ+ people.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once again, anti-LGBTQ+ forces are just trying to find new ways to advance their failing cause,&#8221; Rahaman said in a statement. &#8220;To the LGBTQ+ youth in Virginia and around the country who have been subjected to this dangerous practice: We will not stop fighting for you. You are worthy of love, support and access to affirming therapy.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, Virginia </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title54.1/chapter24/section54.1-2409.5/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">banned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conversion therapy, which prohibits state-licensed healthcare providers and counselors from practicing it on anyone under 18. Sen. <a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+SB245" target="_blank">Scott Surovell</a>, D-Fairfax, and Del. <a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+HB386" target="_blank">Patrick Hope</a>, D-Arlington, carried the legislation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the suit, John and Janet Raymond, the plaintiffs and owners of the Associate Counseling Center in Front Royal, have lost “significant” business income due to the ban.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Raymonds wish to counsel children who are seeking help to align their sexual feelings, actions, and identity toward a biblical sexual ethic, in accordance with God‘s design for human beings, including those struggling with homosexuality and so-called &#8216;gender identity,’” the suit states.</span></p>

(Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia lawsuit was announced soon after Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear banned the practice through an executive order on Sept. 18. Republicans outraged by the decision said it violated parental rights and hindered their legal authority to make decisions about their child’s care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founding Freedoms Law Center attorney Josh Hetzler said their case is independent of Kentucky’s recent action, but makes the Virginia lawsuit “all the more timely” and could be a learning opportunity for the neighbor state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We think our case is going to help (and) hopefully when we win, Kentucky will see the writing on the wall and will do the right thing as well,” Hetzler said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a </span><a href="https://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/therapeutic-response.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the American Psychological Association, behavior therapists used treatment like inducing nausea, providing electric shocks, or having the individual snap an elastic band around their wrist when they became aroused by same-sex erotic images or thoughts. Virginia’s ban on the practice in 2020 came after</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2020/02/18/after-years-of-efforts-virginia-passes-law-to-ban-conversion-therapy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> several years of failed legislative efforts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to make it illegal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, minors’ sexuality and gender expression have been at the forefront of political discussions concerning education and athletics in Virginia schools. Both Democrats and Republicans have  fought over the protections and rights of minors as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most notable actions came when Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration overhauled the state&#8217;s </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/09/12/despite-law-few-virginia-school-districts-adopt-state-model-transgender-policies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> model school policies for transgender and nonbinary students designed under former Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam to protect the privacy and rights of such minors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, groups including the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia have filed lawsuits challenging the Virginia Department of Education on the policies that some schools have adopted. In February, the ACLU and Freshfields filed three related lawsuits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One case, involving at least one teacher refusing to address a transgender student by her preferred first name, was </span><a href="https://www.wtkr.com/news/in-the-community/historic-triangle/york-county-court-dismisses-lawsuit-challenging-virginias-transgender-student-policies" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dismissed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in July. The other two cases are still being litigated in the Eastern District of Virginia and the Hanover County Circuit Court.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the Mercury </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/07/12/changes-to-sex-listed-on-virginia-birth-certificates-more-than-doubled-after-2020-law/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the number of Virginians changing the sex listed on their birth certificate more than doubled between 2020 and 2022, after lawmakers passed </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+SB657" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> streamlining the process for individuals wanting to do so.</span></p>

<p>Members of the U.S. House Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Development expressed frustration Tuesday over the botched rollout and its repercussions for students and families at a hearing that coincided with the release of a <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-24-107783" target="_blank">pair of findings</a> from the <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-24-107407" target="_blank">Government Accountability Office</a> on the major issues that plagued the rollout of the 2024-25 Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA.</p>
<p>Though the application got a makeover after Congress passed the FAFSA Simplification Act, advocates have shared concerns over processing delays as a result of the form’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/24/politics/fafsa-inflation-fix-income/index.html" target="_blank">failure to adjust for inflation,</a> its <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/miscalculation-in-fafsa-formula-is-another-unforced-error" target="_blank">formula miscalculation</a> and its <a href="https://fsapartners.ed.gov/knowledge-center/library/electronic-announcements/2024-04-01/update-tax-data-received-fa-ddx-and-manually-entered-information" target="_blank">tax data errors</a>. Major issues also initially prevented parents without Social Security numbers from completing the form.</p>
<p>The department has worked to fix issues surrounding the 2024-25 form and reevaluated the implementation of the 2025-26 form, taking into account feedback from students, families and stakeholders.</p>
<p>On Monday, the <a href="https://www.ed.gov/sites/ed/files/2024-09/AFocusonImprovingtheFAFSAExperience.pdf" target="_blank">department released a report</a> reviewing implementation of the 2024-25 form as well as the progress it’s making to try to improve the user experience since the streamlined form launched.</p>
<p>Part of those efforts include the department <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-education-department-open-new-financial-aid-form-more-applicants" target="_blank">using a phased rollout of the 2025-26 form</a> in an effort to address any problems that might arise before opening to everyone by Dec. 1. The staggered approach will make the 2025-26 FAFSA fully available two months later than usual.</p>
<p>Members of both parties criticized the 2024-25 form’s rollout at Tuesday’s hearing.</p>
<p>Subcommittee Chairman Burgess Owens said the “FAFSA rollout was mired in delays, errors, frustration — and for some of our most vulnerable students — the loss of their dreams for a higher education.”</p>
<p>The Utah Republican said the “impact of the Biden administration’s failure on real lives has been devastating.”</p>
<p>Rep. Frederica Wilson, ranking member of the subcommittee, said implementation of the FAFSA Simplification Act “has been derailed by a series of mistakes made by the Department of Education, leading to delays and ongoing setbacks in the rollout of the new application.”</p>
<p>The Florida Democrat expressed frustration that “aside from the dozens of letters Congress has sent, this is not the first hearing we’ve had this year about this same issue, nor is this the first application cycle with these issues.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Lack of information</h4>

	
<p>In one of the two GAO reports released Tuesday, the watchdog found that about 432,000 fewer people submitted a FAFSA compared to last year — marking a 3% decrease as of late August.</p>
<p>The decline in submissions was “most pronounced among lower income students and families,” per GAO.</p>
<p>The investigators also found that the department did not consistently provide students with timely information on processing delays, changes in their student aid eligibility, or “solutions to technical barriers they encountered during the application process.”</p>
<p>Melissa Emrey-Arras, a director at GAO who oversees work on education, said at the Tuesday hearing that delays “significantly hindered (students’) ability to choose a college, thinking wisely about their finances and whether they could afford a school.”</p>
<p>“Can you imagine? It’s like buying a house but not knowing how much aid you’re gonna get and having to make a commitment right then and there,” Emrey-Arras said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Understaffing leads to unanswered calls</h4>

	
<p>The government watchdog also found that, as a result of understaffing, nearly three-quarters of all calls to the call center went unanswered in the first five months of the 2024-25 rollout — totalling 4 million out of 5.4 million calls.</p>
<p>As for the communication with schools, GAO found that the department “consistently failed to meet promised deadlines and provide colleges with sufficient notice” of timeframe changes throughout the 2024-25 FAFSA rollout.</p>
<p>Marisol Cruz Cain, a GAO director who oversees work on information technology, said the Office of Federal Student Aid “did not fully test the system, leading to numerous performance problems.”</p>
<p>Cruz Cain said that after the initial deployment, “FSA identified 55 defects, which was almost twice as many as were identified when testing the system as a whole prior to launch.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Improvement plan</h4>

	
<p>In a Monday <a href="https://www.ed.gov/laws-and-policy/education-policy/secretarys-cover-letter-focus-improving-fafsa-experience" target="_blank">letter to college and university presidents</a> regarding progress on the 2025-26 form, U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said the department “has worked tirelessly to completely overhaul a system that had largely remained untouched for over four decades and itself included twenty different sub-systems that required significant changes — a wholesale transformation to enable the most sweeping changes to federal financial aid eligibility and processes in years.”</p>
<p>The department outlined in its <a href="https://www.ed.gov/sites/ed/files/2024-09/AFocusonImprovingtheFAFSAExperience.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> Monday 10 steps it has taken to improve the FAFSA application process, such as increasing the number of call center agents — with more than 700 new agents added. The department is also working to address issues families without Social Security numbers faced when completing the form.</p>
<p>The department’s efforts also include strengthening its leadership team and offering “additional outreach and support for students and families who need the most help completing the form.”</p>
<p>In a statement responding to Tuesday’s hearing, a spokesperson for the department said that “after the first major overhaul of the FAFSA system in more than four decades, there are more than 500,000 more students eligible for Pell Grants than there were at this time last year.”</p>
<p>“We have sought advice from students and families, colleges, and partners and provided more than 1,000 documents to the Government Accountability Office,” the spokesperson added. “Thanks to this input, along with community partnerships, we have now narrowed the FAFSA completion gap to about 2% compared to this time last year — down from 40% in March.”</p>

(Scott Olson/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the aftermath of the recent </span><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/georgia-school-shooting-suspect-gun-backpack-hid-bathroom/story?id=113622880" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">school shooting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Winder, Georgia, that left four students and teachers dead, and the threats of violence made online in various Virginia school districts, the NAACP Virginia State Conference has pushed for increased action on social media education, mental health services and a renewed commitment to addressing racism and inequality in public schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No student should live in fear of attending school, nor should any student be the target of racially motivated hatred,” the Rev. Cozy Bailey, the group’s president, said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We call on school districts, state leaders, and policymakers to prioritize expanding both mental health services and DEI initiatives in schools. These efforts are not mutually exclusive but critical to building inclusive and supportive environments where all students feel safe and valued,” Bailey said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Virginia has been spared a fatal school shooting since November 2022, when three people were killed and two others were injured in </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/12/26/uva-shooting-timeline-what-happened/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a mass shooting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the University of Virginia, online threats continue to disrupt school operations and scare parents and students. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just last week, the Harrisonburg Police Department </span><a href="https://www.dnronline.com/places/local/rockingham_county/harrisonburg/harrisonburg-teen-arrested-after-posting-shooting-threat-on-social-media/article_1bf1d0aa-3d4c-58a6-9b99-29b6af85bba6.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">arrested</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a 16-year-old male suspected of making violent threats against other students. The arrest was the result of an investigation into the threats posted to social media on Sept. 15, which resulted in both Harrisonburg High School and Rocktown High School closing the next day as a matter of precaution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/us/school-shootings-fast-facts-dg/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent report by CNN</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there have been 50 school shootings this year in the United States. While this is lower than last year’s 82 school shootings, if patterns move as they have historically, a dramatic uptick is to be expected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While addressing school security is critical, the Virginia NAACP stresses that a comprehensive strategy is needed to tackle not only gun control but also the mental health crisis facing youth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This strategy must also confront the harmful effects of racism that persist in educational settings and has motivated racial issues that the Virginia NAACP regularly receives reports about, the organization said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The rise in violent threats demonstrates the pressing need for DEI programs and inclusive curriculums that can address these systemic issues and create inclusive school environments. Calls to dismantle DEI efforts ignore the reality of the continued presence of racism in schools, where marginalized students are often most vulnerable,” the statement said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bailey, the group’s president, added that the mental health and safety of Virginia’s school children must remain a top priority.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia NAACP further called for collaboration between local governments, law enforcement, community organizations, and educational institutions to ensure that schools are not only secure but equipped to confront both mental health challenges and the ongoing issue of racial discrimination.</span></p>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20240916/RCP_3724_01_xml.pdf" target="_blank">End Woke Higher Education Act</a> — which succeeded <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2024433" data-type="link" data-id="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2024433" target="_blank">213-201</a> — marks one of <a href="https://www.gop.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1850" target="_blank">several so-called anti-woke initiatives</a> and messaging bills from Republican lawmakers to hit the House floor this week.</p>
<p>The higher education measure, which drew fierce opposition from the Biden administration and major associations of colleges and universities, came amid a <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/government-shutdown-deadline-nearing-us-house-stumbles-stopgap-spending-bill%C2%A0" target="_blank">looming government shutdown deadline</a> and in the heat of the 2024 campaign.</p>
<p>Four House Democrats voted in favor of the GOP measure, including Reps. Don Davis of North Carolina, Jared Golden of Maine, Mary Peltola of Alaska and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington.</p>
<p>Baked into the legislation are two bills introduced by Republican members of the U.S. House Committee on Education and the Workforce — the Accreditation for College Excellence Act and the Respecting the First Amendment on Campus Act.</p>
<p>Utah Rep. Burgess Owens, chairman of the Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Development, introduced the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3724/text" target="_blank">Accreditation for College Excellence Act</a> in May 2023, while New York Rep. Brandon Williams brought forth the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7683/text" target="_blank">Respecting the First Amendment on Campus Act</a> in March.</p>
<p>In a statement to States Newsroom, Owens said “House Republicans passed the End Woke Higher Education Act to stand up for academic freedom, defend students’ constitutional rights, and ensure that colleges and universities aren’t forced to bend the knee to activist accreditors pushing political agendas as a condition for federal funding.”</p>
<p>The Utah Republican said the “Biden-Harris administration has injected its far-left ideology — Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion and Critical Race Theory — into every part of American life, including our higher education system.”</p>
<p>Owens’ bill says accreditation standards must not require, encourage or coerce institutions to support or oppose “a specific partisan, political, or ideological viewpoint or belief” or “set of viewpoints or beliefs on social, cultural, or political issues” or support “the disparate treatment of any individual or group of individuals.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Williams’ Respecting the First Amendment on Campus Act forces schools to disclose policies regarding free speech to students and faculty as a condition of receiving any Title IV funds.</p>

<p>But the legislation is highly unlikely to be passed in the Democratic-controlled Senate.</p>
<p>The Biden administration also strongly opposed the measure, saying in a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/SAP-HR-3724.pdf" target="_blank">statement</a> this week that the legislation would “micromanage both public and private institutions, undermining their ability to recognize and promote diversity.”</p>
<p>The legislation “would go beyond Congress’s traditional role in higher education with a wide range of confusing and unprecedented new mandates,” the administration added.</p>
<p>Rep. Bobby Scott — ranking member of the U.S. House Committee on Education and the Workforce — called the measure a “baseless attempt to inject culture wars into an ever-important accreditation process” during the floor debate Thursday.</p>
<p>The Virginia Democrat said the legislation “attempts to circumvent the First Amendment to establish a whole new scheme to regulate speech and association rights on campus outside of established precedents and practices.”</p>
<p>The GOP measure also drew the ire of leading associations of colleges and universities, who opposed the legislation both individually and collectively.</p>
<p>In a joint letter this week to House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York, <a href="https://www.aau.edu/sites/default/files/Letter-House-End-Woke-Higher-Education-Act-091724.pdf" target="_blank">six major associations</a> led by the American Council on Education took aim at Williams’ portion of the legislation, saying it “would undermine efforts to protect free speech on campus and provide safe learning environments free from discrimination.”</p>

(Ty Jackson/Laaces Ouut Media)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Newport News task force, one of two recently established groups in Virginia investigating the historic displacement of Black communities by the state’s public universities, is facing allegations that it has not been open about its operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The six-member local government and university </span><a href="https://cnu.edu/news/2024/04/03-cnu-city-joint-task-force/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">joint initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, along with a separate nineteen-member statewide </span><a href="https://studies.virginiageneralassembly.gov/studies/720" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">panel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is seeking potential redress for Black residents that were uprooted to make way for university expansion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the state commission’s first meeting in August, Joni Ivey, a member of both bodies, appeared to address public criticism calling for “greater transparency” of the local working group. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It seems as if we&#8217;re quiet, but we&#8217;re working deeply to get knowledgeable about the information,&#8221; Ivey said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Newport News task force, which began working in April, is reviewing decisions made by city and university officials that led to the destruction of a Black middle-class community. These decisions were the focus of an </span><a href="https://vcij.org/stories/how-virginia-college-expanded-by-uprooting-black-neighborhood" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">investigative series</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Virginia Center for Investigative Journalism at WHRO and ProPublica, which examined the widespread displacement of Black residents by American colleges and universities. In the 1960s, an all-white Newport News council seized 60 acres to halt the Black community’s growth and build what is now Christopher Newport University (CNU). The university’s expansion overtime led to the acquisition of remaining homes. Today, only five remain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly all of the local task force members appointed by Newport News Mayor </span><a href="https://www.nnva.gov/2965/Mayors-Office" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phillip Jones</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and CNU President </span><a href="https://cnu.edu/whoweare/administration/president/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bill Kelly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are current city council and university officials. The lone citizen representative is Ivey, community leader and </span><a href="https://bobbyscott.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/house-floor-scott-honors-his-chief-staff-joni-ivey-her-retirement" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">retired Chief of Staff</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va. Task force meetings are also closed to the public. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ivey’s remarks follow a Daily Press editorial </span><a href="https://www.dailypress.com/2024/08/10/letters-for-aug-11-transparency-is-needed-from-cnus-newport-news-task-force-on-the-shoe-lane-neighborhood/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from a Newport News interfaith group, </span><a href="https://standrews-episcopal.org/pastoring-the-city/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pastoring the City</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which also criticized the task force for lacking ”direct representation” of the impacted community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were unhappy that no resident of Johnson Terrace or other representative of the Shoe Lane neighborhood were named to the task force,” their editorial stated. Pastoring the City demanded a timeline reflecting task force activities, Shoe Lane neighborhood appointments, and “assurances that CNU’s 2030 expansion will not include any more neighborhood homes.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Mercury sent Jones, Kelly and the task force a list of detailed questions about its appointments and operations. Neither answered questions directly, but responded with a Sept. 17 statement from CNU chief spokesperson Jim Hanchett indicating the local group is currently focused on “documenting all properties that once existed” on CNU’s main campus and “as we are able, meeting with the families currently living in that area of land and families who formerly lived in that area of land.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We continue our work, and will report on our progress as it is made,” the statement read.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vice Mayor </span><a href="https://www.nnva.gov/465/Elected-Officials" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Curtis Bethany</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and CNU Provost </span><a href="https://cnu.edu/people/qkidd/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quentin Kidd</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> told the Virginia Mercury in a separate statement on August 20th that the task force is in the process of scheduling interviews with impacted families.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The families will inform the ultimate recommendations and final report this task force produces,&#8221; Bethany and Kidd wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like the interfaith group, Minerva Douglas, who owns one of the remaining homes in the neighborhood displaced by CNU, questions their exclusion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why didn&#8217;t they include at least one person from (our) group to be on the task force?” Douglas asked. “It looks like they just overlooked us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest call for transparency highlights the lack of clarity on the broader Newport News community’s role in task force proceedings. Multiple statements have indicated that the city would “collaborate closely” with the community as well as CNU students, faculty, staff, alumni and administration. However, what remains unclear is whether community collaboration includes plans to consult with the city’s larger population while investigating the matter. Letters provided to the Virginia Mercury also suggest that at least two requests to Jones and Kelly for community or citizen appointments to the task force have gone unanswered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Audrey Perry Williams, a Newport News </span><a href="https://www.hamptonroadsasalh.org/about" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">historian</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who participated in a November 2023 CNU-sponsored </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rCpfFljGBw" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">panel discussion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about the displaced community, provided a letter dated February 5th, that she said she sent to Jones and Kelly after the task force’s announcement, advocating for resident appointments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I do hope the task force will invite the members of the affected community that are still living in the area,&#8221; wrote Williams, &#8220;and those that are no longer living there.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Williams told the Virginia Mercury she hasn’t received a direct response from Jones or Kelly, though she says the Mayor’s office sent a receipt acknowledging her letter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April, a week after Jones and Kelly </span><a href="https://cnu.edu/news/2024/04/03-cnu-city-joint-task-force/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">named</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> final members to the task force, concerns about the absence of a public process for membership were raised at a </span><a href="https://cnu.edu/ccejrp/conference/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">social justice conference</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on CNU’s campus. Pastoring the City hosted that discussion. According to their editorial, they sent letters afterwards to Jones and Kelly requesting a “public call for citizen participation” and a task force appointment from their organization.  Andrew Millard, who penned the editorial on behalf of the group, told the Virginia Mercury those requests also went unanswered. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to make sure this task force doesn&#8217;t ignore the residents, because they&#8217;re the ones who&#8217;ve been most impacted by this,” Millard said in an interview. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neither the cIty of Newport News nor Christopher Newport University would confirm if Jones or Kelly responded to letters from Williams or Pastoring the City. Additionally, they did not clarify if the two would consider adding new task force members. Questions about whether public participation or review of task force proceedings would be offered were similarly not addressed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a joint statement, the city and university reiterated the task force’s focus on researching the ”removal of the Shoe Lane community” and the expansion of CNU’s campus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Task Force</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> members are hard at work fulfilling this charge,” their Sept. 17 statement read. Hanchett further clarified with the statement provided that “neither the City or the University are involved in its day-to-day activities.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior statements from the task force have noted that the research of the group is the first of a three-phase plan that includes developing recommendations and implementing them. Amidst recent frustrations, the task force sent an </span><a href="https://cnu.edu/news/2024/08/19-cnu-nn-shoe-lane-task-force/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">update</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to reporters on Aug. 15 and posted an update on Aug. 19 stating the group was constructing a research timeline. The group or its co-chairs did not answer questions about when or if they would make a research timeline publicly available. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Bethany and Kidd’s update indicated that the task force has not yet completed its first phase, which they described as the “longest and most robust” and would include interviews with families as well as historians, policy makers and experts. The task force leaders also stated that the research would inform recommendations and they would seek feedback from families to refine them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The task force has not addressed questions seeking information on the number of family interviews the group has confirmed. The Virginia Mercury reached out to the five remaining households. Two households reported speaking to a member of the task force informally. Three said they have not received any correspondence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A member of one of those families, Dwayne Johnson, said he and his relatives have not heard from the task force. Johnson suggested that the city and university offer more oversight and open task force meetings to the families as a gesture of good faith.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There&#8217;s a lot of mistrust there because of how they&#8217;ve handled things in the past,” Johnson added. “Are we going to be trusting of them? They have to really show us something to even earn a little bit of it,” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gail Guynn, a remaining homeowner, also told the Virginia Mercury that the community as a whole hasn’t received official communication informing them of the task force’s plans and she’d like to see more details on its “members, its mission, action steps, how our input would be incorporated.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the Newport News group is working independently of the state commission, at some point their work may overlap, as the statewide group plans to consult with Virginia universities for its own research. The Virginia commission will assess what forms of compensation, if any, might be appropriate for impacted families or their descendants</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the state commission’s August meeting its chair, Del. </span><a href="https://history.house.virginia.gov/members/8638" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delores McQuinn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, D-Richmond, said she expects all universities to cooperate with requests for information.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Across this nation this has happened,&#8221; said McQuinn. “I&#8217;m hoping that as Virginians and (the) General Assembly, that we could say we’re ready to take on the challenges. We’re ready to stand in the face of this and address it.”</span></p>

Tara Durant and Christie New Craig speaking at a Senate Education and Health Committee meeting on Sept. 17, 2024. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Senate committee meeting in Richmond focused on investigating the wave of Israel-Hamas war protests at several Virginia colleges and universities turned intense on Tuesday, as public testimonies extended beyond the scope of the events last spring and some Republican lawmakers accused the committee of excluding law enforcement officials from the dialogue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans on the Senate Education and Health Committee also opposed the hearing’s rules, which would not allow committee members to ask university and college representatives questions during their six-minute testimonies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the start of the hearing, committee chair Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, told lawmakers their questions would be submitted to the university reps after the testimonies were provided. She also added that law enforcement and campus police were invited to speak because they were included in the committee’s invitation to the universities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We learn very little when there is an effort to just grab 30-second bites, and the opportunity to dive deeply into issues is something we&#8217;re not afforded during a General Assembly session,” she said, “but we have that opportunity now in a meeting that is really meant to develop insights and to dig deeper into and really learn from lived experiences of individuals who are sharing it today.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, the committee listened to testimony from five university representatives who shared their responses to the demonstrations, and details about the involvement of law enforcement and campus police, institutional policies on public demonstrations and free speech, and their history of modifying their policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee also heard from multiple speakers in person and online who shared their negative experiences at the demonstrations, including some people who were arrested. The committee heard from 30 speakers in total.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Republicans said that the </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://lis.virginia.gov/241/oth/Agenda.SEH.091724.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">meeting</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">which was</span> <span data-preserver-spaces="true">organized mostly by</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Democratic senators, was one-sided. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">They pointed to speakers’ remarks about “police </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">brutality,</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">” </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“genocide,</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">” and claimed none of the speakers were Jewish, despite several speakers being from the Jewish community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I hope we can continue this conversation,” said Sen. Christie New Craig, R-Chesapeake. “I hope we can bring everybody together because ‘fact-finding’ means everyone has to come together to figure out a way to find a resolution to this. So I&#8217;m praying that we can do that.”</span></p>

Mark Peake speaking at a Senate Education and Health Committee meeting on Sept. 17, 2024. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Mark Peake, R-Lynchburg, and other Republicans questioned the chair about the decision to hold questions and not directly invite law enforcement. Peake left the room for 15 minutes after the university representatives finished their remarks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I needed to calm down,” Peake said, adding that he initially believed the committee would have been able to question the speakers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secretary of Public Safety and Homeland Security Terry Cole was in attendance, while members of the Capitol Police provided security. Cole said he looks forward to discussing officers&#8217; role in the protests and noted that members of some campus law enforcement teams were assaulted and hit with bear spray, hammers, and rocks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During Tuesday’s hearing, Senate Republicans released a </span><a href="https://x.com/VASenateGOP/status/1836131266456064332" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> urging their Democratic counterparts “to immediately stop this unacceptable attempt to legislate in secrecy. A new committee should be convened where law enforcement and Jewish community representatives can present, and Senators can ask questions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No Democratic lawmakers expressed opposition to how the hearing was run. House lawmakers are scheduled to have a similar meeting on Sept. 26. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In May, lawmakers in both chambers </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/14/virginia-lawmakers-to-study-campus-safety-policies-after-series-of-protests/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">formed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> select committees to examine campus safety at Virginia’s colleges and universities after more than 125 people were arrested last spring at four campuses — the University of Mary Washington, Virginia Commonwealth University, Virginia Tech and the University of Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past several months, demonstrators and faculty members have criticized college administrators and law enforcement for their handling of anti-war protests, including using pepper spray to clear encampments. Demonstrators have largely called for a cease-fire in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas militants, highlighting the deaths of thousands of Israeli and Palestinian citizens, and urged an end to the anti-semetic activity on campuses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, expressed concern about trying to legislate institutions’ responses to the protests. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m not sure we should have a legislative policy on this,” VanValkenburg said, adding that Virginia universities are “wildly” different and since case law on the subject is evolving, the legislature shouldn’t be overly prescriptive.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40080" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1024px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-40080" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_2691-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_2691-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_2691-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_2691-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_2691-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_2691-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Secretary of Public Safety and Homeland Security Terry Cole speaking at a Senate Education and Health Committee meeting on on Sept. 17, 2024. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No future meeting date was set at the end of Tuesday’s committee hearing. Hashmi said testimonies and existing policies will be compiled for the committee to consider. The list of speakers for a future meeting has not been arranged.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think overall, our colleges and universities have good policies in place that&#8217;s part of their requirements, and they&#8217;ve done that for decades, and there may not be a need to correct anything,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her main concern, Hashmi said, are “new policies that have been implemented without going through that process of shared governance, and that&#8217;s what I want to catalog and assess what&#8217;s happened, and then see how the universities are going to address that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The American Association of University Professors Chapter at the University of Virginia has criticized UVA’s administration for working to implement new disciplinary and protest policies “with no student input” from faculty members and students, according to an Aug. 21 letter to the president and provost.</span></p>
<p>Walt Heinecke, immediate past president of the AAUP UVA Chapter, said the chapter is continuing to urge the <a href="https://facultysenate.virginia.edu/meetings" target="_blank">Faculty Senate</a> to reject the policy changes made by the university’s Faculty Senate Executive Council at its upcoming meeting on Friday, adding, “we believe the policy changes should be suspended&#8221; until faculty, students and staff fully vet them.</p>

(Courtesy of SDI Productions via Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Education announced on Tuesday that it has published its<a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/about-vdoe/cell-phone-free-education-in-virginia-k-12-public-schools/cell-phone-free-education-guidance-resources" target="_blank"> final cellphone-free education guidelines</a>.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final guidelines, which have grown from a seven-page document to 27 pages, include suggestions on improving communication gaps between parents, teachers and school officials in emergency and non-emergency situations. Additional information was added to support school leaders with the best practices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guidelines continue to define “cellphone-free” education as “bell-to-bell,” meaning phones should be turned off and stored away from the first school bell until dismissal. The period includes lunchtime and breaks between classes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VDOE said many students wrote in asking to use their cellphones during lunch, but doubled down on its position that the phones distract students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is essential that students have the opportunity to develop face-to-face conversations and critical in-person communication skills during unstructured school hours,” the agency stated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final guidelines only provide exemptions for students with disabilities and English Learner students with a documented language barrier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to studies, students have used cellphones to browse the internet and social media apps, and message people during instructional time. Students have also used the devices to record events at schools and post them on various platforms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As proposed last month, the draft guidance includes age-appropriate cellphone restrictions in Virginia’s elementary and secondary public schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a parent determines an elementary student needs to bring a cellphone or personal electronic communication device to school, it must be stored, off, and away from the student during the school day. Students should not use cellphones in the school building or on the school grounds before or after school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In middle and high school, students should not have a readily available cellphone or personal electronic communication device during the bell-to-bell school day, the guidance states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Middle schools should establish local policies that determine cellphone and personal electronic communication device use within the school building or on school grounds outside of bell-to-bell,  the guidance stipulates, including before and after school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cellphones and personal electronic communication devices may be used on a high school campus before or after school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officials said Tuesday that a task force will also be established to support schools and division leaders in enhancing communications and handling school-based emergencies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This guidance from the Virginia Department of Education is an important step towards creating a healthier learning environment where students can receive a quality education free from harmful distractions,” said Gov. Glenn Youngkin in a statement, who thanked parents, students and school staff for their “substantive engagement” in the process and committed to continued discussions to refine the policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Department officials held several meetings with the public before drafting the guidelines. The public comment period ended on Sunday. While some have already adopted cellphone regulations, school boards are expected to adopt them by Jan. 1.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, VDOE will release an “Administrator’s Toolkit” to support school leaders in implementing their policies. No timetable was provided for when the microgrants are expected to be available for schools to raise awareness about the mental health impacts of cellphones and social media. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor allocated $500,000 from existing funds for the Departments of Education and Behavioral Health and Development Services to support the initiative.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are so thankful for the collaborative input from families, educators, and students on such a critical challenge for our young people,” said Superintendent of Public Instruction Lisa Coons in a statement. “Virginians helped us shape the final guidance and our implementation supports. We look forward to continuing to work with families and educators as we help ensure that every student can have a cellphone-free education.&#8221;</span></p>

Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, and Del. Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke, at a joint subcommittee meeting on Sept. 16 in Richmond. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia lawmakers are carefully examining the state’s 52-year-old funding formula, which determines the funding level for public schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During its first meeting in Richmond on Monday, a small subcommittee of lawmakers faced the reality that the transformation could take a while, with members of the public in attendance and watching online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers said they hope to move forward swiftly, but not too quickly, after a December </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt575.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showed that local governments in Virginia are spending far more than the state for K-12 education to fund the </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/constitution/article8/section2/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state’s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Standards of Quality in Virginia school divisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers learned that for fiscal year 2021, school divisions needed close to $11 billion in state and local funding. Instead, schools spent $17.3 billion, $6.6 billion more than the funding formula indicated was needed. Researchers said local governments covered the “vast amount” of funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, which studied the formula, said lawmakers could partially replace the SOQ formula by using student-based calculations for special education and English learner funding, or fully replace the entire staffing-based formula with a new student-based formula.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Senate Appropriations Committee, since the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission published its report on the Standards of Quality last December, funding for public education is projected to increase by $1.85 billion between fiscal years 2023 and 2026. $1.17 billion of this new funding will result from new policy spending, including salary increases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Policy experts told legislators from the House and Senate that other states have taken around three years to adopt new funding formulas. According to the Learning Policy Institute, a nonprofit that studies ways to improve education policy, nine states, including Tennessee and Pennsylvania, have adopted new funding formulas since 2000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The education system today does not look the same as it did when our funding system was designed,” said Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, serving as the committee chair. “This is our opportunity to evaluate the current system and ensure that it is aligned to meet the needs of our students and school divisions for the next half-century.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke, chair of the House Education Committee, said funding for public education is one of the largest components of the state&#8217;s budget. As a result, he said funding schools often impacts other priorities around the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For that reason, we will be careful, thoughtful and deliberate as we move through this process to make sure we get it right,” Rasoul said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Terry Austin, R-Botetourt, said he would like to see the Department of Education staff and the Secretary of Education involved in the lengthy process. Neither </span>Secretary of Education Aimee Guidera nor any Department of Education staff appeared to be present for the meeting on Monday. The legislature <a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2024/1/SB30/Introduced/CA/117/3s/" target="_blank">allocated</a> $600,000 to the department over the next two years to support the subcommittee.</p>

Terry Austin, R-Botetourt, asking questions at a joing subcommittee meetiing on Sept. 16. (Nathhaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don&#8217;t want to see us work through this very quickly,&#8221; Austin added. &#8220;Although we can move through it in a timely fashion with a good, organized work plan, &#8230; this is something that&#8217;s going to be very challenging because there is tremendous diversity in the commonwealth of Virginia from one border to another, both east, west, north and south.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Democratic lawmakers, including Locke, believe much of the work the committee will be tackling could have been addressed in two </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB105" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">omnibus bills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed last session. The bill would have raised teacher salaries to the national average. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his veto, Youngkin said he supported the desire of “ensuring that teachers and state-funded education support positions are funded competitively,” but passed up on the legislation because it relied heavily on what he viewed as flawed data from the </span><a href="https://www.nea.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Education Association</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which represents educators across the country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, while the governor and legislature could not agree on the two bills, they agreed on reforming the funding formula.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christian Martinez, a spokesman for Youngkin, said the governor has been clear that the funding formula is “archaic” and an “opportunity for real reform.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The commonwealth needs a more effective K-12 funding formula that strategically allocates resources to meet the specific needs of students, teachers, and school divisions, ensuring that critical needs are addressed effectively,” Martinez said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee will keep its </span><a href="https://forms.microsoft.com/r/bvp0spxBjr" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">public comment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> period open through Thursday. Lawmakers will review a draft work plan at its next meeting on Oct. 31.</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statewide, the teacher vacancy rate was down to 3.4% at the start of the school year after hovering at 4.7% in July, according to data provided by the Virginia Department of Education’s Office of Licensure during an advisory meeting on Monday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s teacher vacancy rate was 3.9% last October. The agency’s annual vacancy report, which provides a breakdown of school division vacancies, will be published next month, along with the vacancy rate for bus drivers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the 131 school divisions in Virginia, 30 have a 0-1% vacancy rate, and 64 have a vacancy rate under 2%.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The focus on the teacher shortage in Virginia’s K-12 schools sharpened in recent years, after studies found that teachers were  leaving public schools because of several factors including dissatisfaction with wages, challenges after the pandemic, and political battles over education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We continue to look for innovative ways to help school divisions ensure that every Virginia child has a high-quality educator in their K-12 classroom,” said Todd Reid, a spokesman for the Department of Education, in a statement to the Mercury. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration has tried </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/09/01/youngkin-outlines-steps-to-address-teacher-shortage-in-executive-directive/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">different methods</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to address the shortage by relaxing guidelines to hire retired teachers and targeting educator recruitment and retention efforts in areas of need.The Republican governor also worked on the issue with the Democrat-controlled state legislature, whose priorities included </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/17/legislation-to-bring-va-teacher-pay-to-national-average-gets-bipartisan-support/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raising</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> teacher salaries to the national average. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last session, the General Assembly passed </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=SB142" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> authorizing school boards to issue a one-year, nonrenewable local eligibility license to people to work as teachers within the school division that made the authorization. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the legislation, locally licensed teachers must have a college degree from a regionally accredited institution of higher education, be a subject matter expert or have training in a specific area of instruction and not seek to teach special education or  plan to be certified to teach at a college or higher professional level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation expires on July 1, 2030.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Agency efforts and improvements</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the state education department developed the Grow Your Own initiative, which helps develop well-qualified teachers locally. As part of the program’s mission, the agency </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/Home/Components/News/News/350/227?npage=2" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">awarded $1.5 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to 24 school divisions in February.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, in July, VDOE </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/Home/Components/News/News/399/227" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">received $6 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in federal funding to expand its </span><a href="https://vmm0dj30.r.us-west-2.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.doe.virginia.gov%2Fteaching-learning-assessment%2Fteacher-residency-and-apprenticeship-programs/1/01010190a75a3ed9-c2edf737-365c-4148-904b-92eeae116d74-000000/RilapvtjwgRWUGqYO5V9EeXwvJM=383" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">registered apprenticeship</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program for K-12 teachers and create pathways for beginners to become educators. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VDOE has also updated its licensure office, including fully staffing it, improving communications about licensing, and, last year, launching a new teacher licensing system, </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/teaching-learning-assessment/teaching-in-virginia/licensure/licensing-services" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VALO</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phase 2 of the system, which will debut in the fall, will allow applicants to renew their licenses, add endorsements and print licenses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the agency rolled out VALOto help “modernize” the teacher licensure process and make the application process more “user-friendly” for first-time applicants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VDOE said it reduced the time required to process complete applications from approximately one month to an average of two weeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the licensure office, there are 339 different areas within the agency where an educator can obtain a license. Currently, there are over one million active license types among all eligible teachers in the commonwealth.</span></p>

(Photo by Catherine Lane/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Education named the first six organizations to participate in the phased rollout of the <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-education-department-outlines-testing-period-phased-rollout-new-fafsa-form" target="_blank">2025-26 form to apply for federal financial student aid</a> Wednesday, and <a href="https://fsapartners.ed.gov/knowledge-center/library/electronic-announcements/2024-09-11/availability-2025-26-fafsa-betas-2-4-interest-form" target="_blank">opened up the interest form</a> for high schools, school districts and other entities to get involved in its next three testing periods.</p>
<p>In August, the department said it would <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-education-department-gradually-roll-out-new-fafsa-form-dec-1" target="_blank">take a staggered approach</a> to launching the application period for the <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/dont-give-fafsa-advocates-student-financial-aid-urge" target="_blank">Free Application for Federal Student Aid</a> — better known as FAFSA — in an effort to address any problems prior to the updated form opening up to everyone by Dec. 1.</p>
<p>The phased rollout will make the application fully available two months later than usual.</p>
<p>The first testing period beginning Oct. 1 will include six community-based organizations. The department on Wednesday said it selected Alabama Possible; Bridge 2 Life, in Florida; College AIM, in Georgia; Education is Freedom, in Texas; the Scholarship Foundation of Santa Barbara, in California; and the Scholarship Fund of Alexandria, in Virginia; to participate.</p>
<p>The six organizations will provide access to the new form to hundreds of participants in the first testing period. The form will gradually open up to tens of thousands of students in the subsequent testing stages.</p>
<p>“Each of these orgs have committed to recruit 100-plus students and contributors, which will allow us to test the FAFSA system end-to-end from the submissions process, to processing, to ingestion of the (Institutional Student Information Records) by colleges and possibly even state agencies,” FAFSA executive adviser Jeremy Singer said on a call with reporters Wednesday.</p>
<p>Singer said each of the community-based organizations will host an in-person FAFSA event over the first few days of October.</p>
<p>“We will send some of our team members to these sites to observe and learn from our experienced partners, seeing how students and families are interacting with the application, what’s working for them, what’s challenging, what’s clear, what’s less clear,” said Singer, who heads FAFSA strategy within the department’s Office of Federal Student Aid.</p>
<p><strong>Next phases</strong></p>
<p>Singer said the second testing period would launch in mid-October, with the third debuting in early November and the fourth period beginning in mid-November.</p>
<p>Community-based organizations, high schools, school districts and institutions of higher education have from Wednesday until Sept. 20 to submit an interest form to be part of the next three testing periods.</p>
<p>The department said it plans to notify those selected to participate in the second testing period by Sept. 24 and inform those chosen to take part in the third and fourth testing periods shortly afterward.</p>
<p>The department has also worked to close the gap in FAFSA submissions compared to the prior cycle. In March, the department said it received roughly 40% fewer FAFSA applications than the same time last year.</p>
<p>But as of this week, the gap had fallen to approximately 2.3%, the department said.</p>
<p>The department also said that as of early September, roughly 500,000 more FAFSA applicants are eligible for <a href="https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/grants/pell" target="_blank">Pell Grants</a> compared to the same time in 2023.</p>
<p>The updates to the rollout of the 2025-26 form come as the department has worked to resolve the 2024-25 form’s multiple glitches and errors, which advocates voiced concerns over. The application got a makeover following the December 2020 passage of the FAFSA Simplification Act.</p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Abortion</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the only state in the South that hasn’t restricted abortion access since the Supreme Court overturned Roe. v Wade in 2022, which made abortion a federal right, Virginia is a key player in the country’s reproductive health landscape. By dismantling Roe v Wade, the nation’s highest court laid the groundwork for each state to restrict or enhance access to abortion; a spate of state bans on abortion have since emerged, with 14 states making the procedure illegal. Abortion remains legal in Virginia and state Democrats will push to enshrine it as a right in the commonwealth’s constitution next year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Republican candidates in Virginia’s congressional races assert that abortion access should be determined at the state level. In District 2, Republican incumbent U.S. Rep. Jenn Kiggans, a Navy veteran, nurse and former member of the state senate, has “consistently advocated for women to choose life, but respects exceptions for rape, incest, and life of the mother,” according to her campaign </span><a href="https://jenforcongress.com/issues/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Democratic challenger Missy Cotter Smasal, who is also a Navy veteran as well as the director of a nonprofit focused on women veterans, </span><a href="https://fb.watch/uhpo6DTiSN/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declared herself</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “the only pro-choice Navy veteran in this race.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 7, anchored in Prince William County but also spanning rural parts of the state, Spotsylvania attorney and former Green Beret Derrick Anderson, a Republican, is challenging career military officer and Democrat Eugene Vindman for the seat currently occupied by Abigail Spanberger, who is running for governor next year. Anderson has expressed support for the overturn of Roe and </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/DerrickAndersonforVA/videos/my-life-story-is-pro-life-and-thats-how-i-will-serve-in-congress-my-mother-got-p/414067620643367/?locale=ms_MY" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">called himself “pro-life” while sharing on social media</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that his mother had him as a single parent at 17 years old. Vindman plans to support </span><a href="https://vindmanforcongress.com/issues/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">access to abortions and contraception along with in vitro fertilization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 10, anchored in Loudoun County, Democratic state Sen. Suhas Subramanyam is running against Republican Mike Clancy to fill Rep. Jennifer Wexton’s seat. Wexton will not seek reelection due to a health issue, and endorsed Subramanyam during his democratic primary. He has supported an effort to </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SJ255" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">enshrine abortion protections into Virginia’s constitution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and plans to support federal protections. Clancy said that he “does not support federal action on abortion.” His campaign website lists “respect life” as a campaign issue and notes his support for resources for pregnant people and families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 9, incumbent Rep. Morgan Griffith faces Democratic challenger Karen Baker, a lawyer-turned-nurse. Griffith has voted against congressional efforts to protect abortion access and </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=402684" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Roe v. Wade had “produced decades of tragedy.” Baker wrote on her campaign website that “women’s choices must be respected.”</span></p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Housing </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing is an issue people experience practically and constantly, amid paying rent or mortgages. Local governments handle approvals or rejections of developments and craft zoning laws that guide development potential. But state and federal lawmakers have roles to play as well — largely through funding mechanisms or taking action where housing intersects with other policy platforms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While many congressional candidates this year don’t have housing policy outlined on their websites, some have been talking about how they plan to help states and local governments from the federal level. The Mercury reached out to others for more details on what they would do to help with housing supply and affordability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 2, Incumbent Rep. Jen Kiggans did not respond to inquiry for more details on housing policy by the time of this publication, though during her time in the state legislature as a senator, she voted in favor of the </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+vot+SV0271HB1889+HB1889" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her challenger, Democrat Missy Cotter Smasal, acknowledged the Mercury’s request for comment but did not follow through with a response in time for this publication. Her website touches on housing policy while addressing the economy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We need to stop the price gouging on groceries, and stop massive corporations from buying up houses and raising rent,” she wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 7, Democratic candidate Eugene Vindman expressed support for building more homes that middle-class families can purchase and “support programs that help first-time homebuyers buy a house.” He added that he’s concerned about out-of-state corporations buying homes that they then sell or rent at higher prices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Congress, I will work to take on these speculators who are putting regular people&#8217;s American dream out of reach,” he said in an email. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican candidate Derrick Anderson said he’s going to focus initially on how Congress can help reduce inflation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The first thing I’d do is pass a federal balanced budget amendment – ridiculous inflationary spending drove up housing prices (and grocery costs, gas costs, etc),” he said in an email. “Let’s stop the spending and get inflation down for the sake of Virginians who are struggling to get by.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 10, Republican Mike Clancy could not be reached for comment by the time of this publication. His campaign website doesn’t include housing policy, but it does stress his goal of helping to reduce inflation and stimulate the economy by “unleashing American innovation” and energy as well as reducing regulations on small businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Suhas Subramanyam’s campaign replied to The Mercury’s inquiry but did not follow through with his housing policy plans should he become a congressman before publication. He has supported affordability measures as a state senator: This year he </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB597" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">co-sponsored a bill </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to allow more Virginian localities to utilize Low Income Housing Tax Credits when approving developments, but it was vetoed by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 9, Democratic challenger Karen Baker supports expansion of tax credits that can help spur construction of affordable housing available to various levels of area median income. She also wants to</span><a href="https://www.bakerforva9th.com/affordable-housing" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “work on tailored solutions that address the specific needs of rural communities,”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like the Southwest Virginia ones she seeks to represent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his tenure as representative, Morgan Griffith has </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=402287" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">supported funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> appropriations to his district meant to help with affordable housing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine has cited his early-career experience as a fair housing lawyer before he went into politics. As a member of congress, he pointed to a bill he co-sponsored, the </span><a href="https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/klobuchar-kaine-introduce-legislation-to-address-nationwide-housing-shortage" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing Supply and Affordability Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would create a grant program for state and local governments to tap into. He’s also been involved with the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/2797" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low-Income First-Time Homebuyers Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would establish fixed-rate 20 year mortgages for first-time buyers whose income doesn’t exceed a certain amount. Both bills have been introduced multiple times but have yet to become law. Kaine also supports expansions to Low Income Housing Tax Credits, which helps increase affordable housing supply. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine’s opponent, Hung Cao, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/how-kamala-harris-new-policy-plan-could-impact-housing-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">echoes a stance of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump that ties housing issues to the U.S.-Mexico border</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“First and foremost, we need to secure the border,” Cao said in an email to The Mercury. “Everything that’s going wrong in our country right now is a direct result of our wide-open southern border. Housing costs are at an all-time high because there&#8217;s millions who were not here a few years ago for which we need to provide housing.” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Guns</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congress remains at a standstill as lawmakers fiercely debate the future of gun rights in America, with proponents of stricter gun control measures clashing with staunch defenders of the Second Amendment. Amid a surge in mass shootings and growing public outcry, both sides are digging in, setting the stage for what will likely be another defining battle over gun laws as the nation is headed toward the 2024 presidential election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Senate, U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., who was governor of Virginia when the deadly mass shooting at Virginia Tech took place in 2007, co-sponsored the Virginia Plan to Reduce Gun Violence, which he said would enact the same gun safety provisions passed by the Democratic-controlled Virginia General Assembly in 2020 at the federal level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hung Cao, Kaine’s Republican opponent, strictly opposes further legislation that he believes would infringe Second Amendment rights. Instead, Cao proposes that gun-related violence to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Prosecutors who refuse to enforce the law must be held accountable, the retired U.S. Navy captain said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia’s 2nd Congressional District, U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, in 2023 received a 100% rating by Gun Owners of America (GOA), a national gun rights organization, and a 92% rating by the National Rifle Association (NRA) in the previous year. While in the Virginia legislature, Kiggans has voted against universal background checks, expanding red flag laws that take guns out of the hands of domestic abusers and those who pose a threat to Virginians, and against prohibiting guns in schools and childcare centers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Missy Cotter Smasal, Kiggans’ Democratic opponent, states on her campaign website that she is committed to legislation seeking to prevent gun violence, create safer communities, and prevent veteran suicide. Smasal said that there are “commonsense measures supported by large majorities of Virginians” that can make Virginia’s neighborhoods safer while also protecting individual rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 7, Derrick Anderson, the Republican nominee, has stated that Second Amendment rights are sacred and shall not be infringed upon. As a former special forces Green Beret, Anderson vows to be “a strong advocate for gun owners in the halls of Congress.” Earlier this year, the Republican turned to the social media platform X, where </span><a href="https://x.com/DerrickforVA/status/1774127722647687559" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">he said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Americans have to “stand up for and protect our 2nd Amendment rights.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eugene Vindman, a former career military officer and the Democratic nominee, supports gun safety measures such as background checks and red flag laws to keep guns out of the hands of criminals, the mentally ill, and others who might cause harm. While he believes in the right of law-abiding gun owners to own firearms, Vindman also pushes for more legislation ensuring public safety. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, the incumbent in District 9, is a strong advocate for Second Amendment rights. Griffith said in a statement to The Mercury that he does not support government-mandated registrations of guns but that he backs harsher penalties for offenders who “abuse the right to have guns” by committing felonious crimes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Karen Baker, Griffith’s opponent and a gun owner, said she backs rigorous gun safety training for children in school. She is also pushing for enhanced gun safety laws, including tax credits for trigger locks, and she has called for enhanced mental health services for troubled individuals, and a legal mechanism to manage early reports of suspicious behaviors involving non-imminent ideation of shootings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the state in District 10, constitutional lawyer Mike Clancy, the Republican nominee, has vowed to defend Americans’ constitutional rights without exception, including the Second Amendment right to bear arms. Instead of regulating gun ownership. Clancy is pushing for legislation to fully fund law enforcement to ensure law enforcement has the training and equipment to protect Virginia’s communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his time in Virginia’s state legislature, Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, Clancy’s opponent, has actively supported several gun safety laws, including </span><a href="https://www.suhasforvirginia.com/press-and-media/key-gun-violence-prevention-bills-from-senator-subramanyam-vetoed-by-gun-lobby-backed-governor" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">several measures which passed the General Assembly just this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, two of which were signed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican. Suhas told The Mercury he believes America can achieve serious progress on this issue while respecting the Second Amendment, and without undermining the rights of responsible gun owners.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Education/Project 2025</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With divergent calls from some to eliminate the U.S. Department of Education and from others to improve teacher pay, public education is a top matter for voters in Virginia and across the nation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a Pew Research Center </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2024/04/23/what-are-americans-top-foreign-policy-priorities/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published in April, half of the Americans surveyed said that public K-12 education is going in the wrong direction. Some believe that schools should spend more time on core academic subjects. At the same time, communities, including those in Virginia, are sparring over what is taught in schools, particularly history, and gauging if students are falling behind in their studies and how to address that challenge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schools are also facing confrontation from parents over social issues, such as the types of books that are allowed in schools and the treatment of transgender students. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of these education issues and recommendations to address them are outlined in </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/04/what-could-project-2025-mean-for-education-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Project 2025</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — a conservative plan for how the country should operate if a Republican wins the White House. Some support the plan and others fear it could derail previous efforts to improve public education in Virginia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the state’s District 2 congressional race, Republican nominee and incumbent Jen Kiggans has publicly supported</span><a href="https://jenforcongress.com/issues/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> prioritizing students&#8217; safety and security</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and equipping teachers with tools and resources to improve student outcomes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She voted for the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/5" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parents Bills of Rights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a measure to “ensure the rights of parents are honored in public schools” and stands against critical race theory, a graduate-level framework that focuses on racial inequity and has not been found in Virginia curricula.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like the authors of Project 2025 and Kiggans, the Republican nominee for the District 10 seat Mike Clancy said he supports school choice. </span></p>
<p>Democratic nominee Eugene Vindman, in District 7, said he opposes book bans and the project, which he <a class="c-link" href="https://dailyprogress.com/opinion/column/eugene-vindman-project-2025-is-a-threat-to-democracy/article_709f3f3a-6a2a-11ef-927e-b310eb440bd5.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://dailyprogress.com/opinion/column/eugene-vindman-project-2025-is-a-threat-to-democracy/article_709f3f3a-6a2a-11ef-927e-b310eb440bd5.html" data-sk="tooltip_parent">sa</a>id his opponent and Republican nominee Derrick Anderson has failed to denounce.</p>
<p>Anderson said Vindman is “lying” and denied supporting the project&#8217;s proposal to eliminate the U.S. Department of <span class="c-mrkdwn__highlight">Education</span>.</p>
<p>He said he supports helping students in his home district “succeed” and will advocate for ensuring that “test scores go up and conflicts go down.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 9, Karen Baker, the democratic nominee, said she supports strengthening public schools, much like Vindman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Baker’s </span><a href="https://www.bakerforva9th.com/issues" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">campaign website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, she supports making universal preschool “a reality for all families” in Southwest Virginia. She also supports investing in vocational education and making it accessible to the area. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, the Democratic nominee in District 10, said if elected, he will work to expand Pre-K, access to “critical“ job training into apprentice programs, and support providing resources to local schools to close the pandemic, learning loss gap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He told the Mercury that if the recommendations for Project 2025 were implemented, it would “devastate” Virginia’s public education system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We must do the opposite: invest in our schools, support our parents and teachers, and make college and postgraduate education affordable,” Subramanyam’s campaign said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Environment/Climate</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic candidates in Virginia’s congressional races largely have expressed the desire to address climate change by transitioning to zero-carbon generation sources. Some candidates differentiate themselves, like District 3 incumbent U.S. Rep. Bobby </span><a href="https://www.bobbyscottforcongress.com/the-scott-record" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who’s advocated for funding Norfolk’s flood wall to reduce sea level rise damage. District 6 contender Ken </span><a href="https://www.kenmitchellforvirginia.com/issues" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitchell</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> highlighted a need to “transition public investments away from propping up fossil fuel companies” on his campaign site, while District 11 incumbent U.S. Rep. Gerry </span><a href="https://gerryconnolly.com/issues/environment/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connolly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has said he’s an advocate for environmental justice, an environmental lens that amplifies the voices and needs of overlooked and overburdened communities during development that could impact their area. District 9 candidate Karen </span><a href="https://www.bakerforva9th.com/coal-miners" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baker </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">doesn’t address climate change on her website, but highlights a need to protect coal miners’ health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the aisle, Republican congressional candidates also mostly fall in line with each other’s environmental policy views by advocating for  </span><a href="https://www.mikeclancyforcongress.com/services-5" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reducing regulations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.hungforva.com/enviornment/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">energy independence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or promoting energy sources stemming from </span><a href="https://cline.house.gov/issues/energy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fossil fuels</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://sitkaforcongress.com/on-the-issues" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nuclear</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some candidates don’t take clear positions about their environmental policy plans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking unique approaches on the GOP side are District 2 incumbent U.S. Rep Jen Kiggans, who signed onto a letter with other House Republicans earlier this year asking for House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana to </span><a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/some-house-republicans-warn-against-climate-law-repeal/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">not repeal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tax credits of the IRA, which have helped incentivize a burgeoning offshore wind </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2024/07/09/south-korean-company-plans-to-build-681-million-offshore-wind-submarine-cable-plant-in-chesapeake/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">development</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> industry in the Hampton Roads region. U.S. Rep.

District 7 candidate Derrick Anderson doesn’t offer a clear position on his website.</span></p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Election integrity</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concerns over election integrity and the potential for voter fraud have sparked a renewed focus in Congress, as lawmakers from both parties debate how best to safeguard the democratic process. With allegations of fraudulent voting making headlines in recent election cycles, the issue has become a political flashpoint. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some legislators call for stricter voting regulations to prevent potential abuse, others argue that such measures could suppress voter participation. As the 2024 election approaches, members of Congress are crafting new policies aimed at ensuring fair elections while addressing public concerns over security and accessibility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the U.S. Senate, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., has carried legislation such as the Freedom to Vote Act, which would implement provisions like automatic voter registration, same-day and Election Day voter registration, online voter registration, and no-excuse mail voting. Kaine has also co-sponsored the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which seeks to restore and update crucial protections against voting discrimination that were weakened by recent Supreme Court decisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine’s Republican opponent Hung Cao, a retired U.S. Navy captain who is backed by former President Donald Trump, has proposed few legislative means to secure the electoral process beyond a universal requirement for providing a voter ID in order to cast a ballot. But he said in a statement to The Mercury that “the only way to have election integrity is to have people watch the polls.” Cao has also suggested that the U.S. hold elections like the ones he witnessed in Iraq and Afghanistan, where people vote with their finger and blue ink. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In July, U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, who represents House District 2, voted in support of the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr8281/BILLS-118hr8281rh.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which passed in the House of Representatives by a 221-198 vote. Advocates of the SAVE Act say it would ensure that only citizens can vote in federal elections, partly by making it mandatory for states to obtain proof of citizenship to register voters and also requiring states to purge noncitizens from voter rolls. But President Joe Biden has vowed to veto the measure, stating that it would make it more difficult for eligible voters to register and increase “the risk that eligible voters are purged from voter rolls.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiggans’ Democratic challenger Missy Cotter Smasal, who previously mounted an unsuccessful campaign in Virginia’s 8th Senate District, has talked little about election integrity legislation. But the U.S. Navy veteran has attacked her Republican opponent for being  a “big supporter of President Trump” for backing “Big Lie” conspiracy theorists in Virginia’s state legislature by being one of </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/02/24/virginia-youngkin-tax-cuts-house-senate/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">only four Senators to vote for an audit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the 2020 election that would have cost Virginia taxpayers $70 million.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Derrick Anderson, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">former special forces Green Beret and the Republican nominee in District 7, has talked little publically about election integrity and he offers no clues about his views on his campaign website, but in </span><a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/government-politics/elections/derrick-anderson-talks-biden-the-border-and-inflation-ahead-of-tuesdays-gop-primary/article_a009bd2a-2837-11ef-9cbd-0f478e969dbd.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with The Daily Progress he acknowledged that Joe Biden is the legitimate president.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If elected, Anderson’s Democratic opponent Eugene Vindman, the twin brother of anti-Trump whistleblower Alexander Vindman, has vowed to work to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and strengthen protections for election workers, “so that anyone who threatens a poll volunteer or election official in an attempt to undermine our vote is held accountable.” Vindman, whose family emigrated to the United States from the former Soviet Union, has also warned against downplaying the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, which he blamed on a pro-Trump movement that did not recognize the nation’s norms of peaceful transfer of power and that he said undermines elections across the country to this day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, the incumbent in District 9, in 2023 sponsored the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/4460" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No Vote for Non-Citizens Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, seeking to ensure only eligible American citizens may participate in federal elections. The bill, which is still moving through the House, withholds some federal dollars that go to localities that allow non-citizens to vote in their elections. Griffith also voted for the SAVE Act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Karen Baker, Griffith’s opponent, told The Mercury that Republicans have failed to provide any evidence of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election and therefore there is no reason to believe that this year’s election will be different. Baker also stated that fears of undocumented immigrants voting are generated to induce distrust of election integrity but are absolutely without basis, and she has criticized Griffith for refusing to state that he will accept the outcome of the 2024 presidential election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Mike Clancy, an attorney from Loudoun County and the Republican nominee in District 10, does not list election integrity as one of his legislative priorities on his campaign website, he has been outspoken on social media about strengthening election laws. “Congress must pass the SAVE Act,” Clancy </span><a href="https://x.com/MikeClancyVA/status/1811031488923586986" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said on X</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in July. “Only U.S. citizens should be voting in our elections.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, Clancy’s opponent and a strict opponent of the SAVE Act, believes that “democracy is under attack” in America. The son of Indian immigrants, Subramanyam has vowed to continue to fight against “restrictive voter ID laws that are designed to suppress the vote, protect early voting to ensure greater access to the polls, and combat political gerrymandering.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Immigration</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Americans find that more migrants are turning to the United States for employment opportunities or to escape violent conflict in their home countries, among other reasons, they are increasingly interested in candidates&#8217; views on immigration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">America has become one of the most prominent destinations for migrants. However, over several years, many migrants have entered the country illegally, prompting backlash. At the same time, migrants have also been a staple of America’s workforce, including in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the </span><a href="https://map.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/locations/virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Immigration Council</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, immigrants comprised about 12.6% of Virginia’s total population in 2022, and 16.2% of Virginia&#8217;s labor force.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the District 9 race, Republican nominee and incumbent Morgan Griffith said immigrants are welcome to come to the United States “legally” and share in the “American dream,&#8221; but supports “cracking down” on illegal immigration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While criticizing the House for ducking its responsibility, Democratic nominee Karen Baker in District 9 said Congress needs to pass comprehensive immigration reform. She said she supports the Senate&#8217;s template for more border control agents and asylum officers and advocates for a DACA bill to protect children who have lived in the U.S. their entire lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the District 2 race, Jen Kiggans’ campaign said the Republican nominee and incumbent voted for legislation to increase security at the U.S. border by ensuring that federal immigration officials have the training and resources to stop the influx of illegal immigration, drugs and crime into the U.S. The measure has remained in the Senate since last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiggans supports strict enforcement of existing federal immigration laws and holding President Joe Biden’s administration accountable. She also backed legislation to prevent the administration from using National Parks to house illegal immigrants.</span></p>
<p>Derrick Anderson, the Republican nominee for the District 7 seat, said he <a class="c-link" href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/government-politics/elections/derrick-anderson-talks-biden-the-border-and-inflation-ahead-of-tuesdays-gop-primary/article_a009bd2a-2837-11ef-9cbd-0f478e969dbd.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/government-politics/elections/derrick-anderson-talks-biden-the-border-and-inflation-ahead-of-tuesdays-gop-primary/article_a009bd2a-2837-11ef-9cbd-0f478e969dbd.html" data-sk="tooltip_parent">supports</a> shutting down the border.</p>
<p>“It’s clear that the crisis at the border is hurting people right here in Virginia’s 7th District,” Anderson said in a statement. “Drugs, fentanyl, human trafficking – we need a serious change. We need to secure the border.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, the Democratic nominee in District 10, said with the U.S. immigration system being “broken,” he supports the country taking a comprehensive approach to the problem by starting with securing the border and ensuring that people who are doing “the right things the right way and contributing to our economy“ have a path to citizenship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said the country must also fix its “broken” asylum system.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Foreign policy (Israel-Hamas conflict, China, Ukraine)</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Virginia voters are following their congressional candidates&#8217; views on common issues in the U.S., they are also considering their responses to global conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a Pew Research Center </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2024/04/23/what-are-americans-top-foreign-policy-priorities/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that was completed in April, two of the most important issues to Americans are limiting the powers of China and finding a solution to the Israel-Hamas conflict.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Americans are also interested in limiting Russia’s powers following its invasion of Ukraine in Feb. 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said he takes pride in the fact that he is among a wide slate of lawmakers President Vladimir Putin of Russia permanently banned from visiting Russia in response to his record of standing against Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine two years ago. Kaine has voted for aid to Ukraine, and earlier this year he helped pass a supplemental package that included support for the country to defend its sovereignty. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine also said he views the U.S.-China relationship as the most consequential bilateral relationship of the century. Kaine voted to pass the </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/09/fact-sheet-chips-and-science-act-will-lower-costs-create-jobs-strengthen-supply-chains-and-counter-china/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CHIPS and Science Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> designed to outcompete China by shoring up domestic supply chains and bringing manufacturing back to America. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Hamas terrorists attacked Israeli territories on Oct. 7, 2023, Kaine has worked with Democrats, Republicans, and the Biden administration to ensure that Israel has defensive support. But Kaine has also called for a reduction of civilian casualties, supported the safe and swift delivery of humanitarian assistance to civilians in Gaza and the West Bank, and for long-term solutions to allow Palestinians and Israelis to live alongside each other in peace.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="andlM785qX"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/06/more-than-125-arrested-at-four-virginia-universities-amid-nationwide-protest-over-israel-hamas-war/">More than 125 arrested at four Virginia universities amid nationwide protests over Israel-Hamas war</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine’s Republican opponent and former U.S. Navy captain Hung Cao in a statement criticized the Biden administration and Congress for giving “blanket amounts of money” towards Ukraine’s defense effort, alleging the financial support instead helps fund Ukraine’s retired workers pension plans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cao considers China an “existential threat” to the United States, and he has further called for the continued support of Israel, which he considers one of the United States’ closest allies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Jen Kiggans’ campaign, the District 2 Republican nominee and incumbent supports legislation to impose sanctions against China for its responsibility in the fentanyl crisis and </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/22/cosponsors" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prevent selling any petroleum to Chinese Communist Party-controlled entities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her campaign also said she prioritizes protecting American jobs and intellectual property from being stolen by the CCP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Derrick Anderson, the Republican nominee in District 7 and a former special forces Green Beret with six tours of duty overseas, including Afghanistan, Iraq, and various countries throughout the Middle East, told the </span><a href="https://jewishinsider.com/2024/04/virginia-congressional-candidate-derrick-anderson-military/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Jewish Insider”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in an interview in April that Congress needs to move quickly to provide additional aid to the Jewish state in its war against Hamas. He added that he was skeptical of sending more U.S. funds to the Palestinians, noting that other countries are providing aid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Anderson, his Democratic opponent Eugene Vindman, also a veteran, called for continued support for Israel, while asking that the U.S. continue to ensure that all the hostages — including Americans — are returned safe and sound to their families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman has also pushed for the continued support of Ukraine in both military and economic terms, and for taking on China&#8217;s state-directed economic system, which he said unfairly competes in the market and compromises America’s national security. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, voted for the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2022, which allowed the lending and lease of American defense material to the country in its defense of the Russian invasion, he also also voted to block similar legislation last year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griffith </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=403045" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has called</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> China a “dangerous, power-hungry actor” over the country’s territorial claims in the South China Sea, as well as its escalating efforts to control Taiwan, while </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=403086" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criticizing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> President Joe Biden’s decision to hold an arms shipment to Israel last spring. Griffith also said that America’s dealings with other countries must be driven by a careful analysis of what best serves the United States and its citizens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In relation to the conflict between Israel and Hamas, Karen Baker, Griffith’s Democratic opponent, has pointed out that while she acknowledged Israel’s right to exist, there are “bad acts on both sides.” Baker has also endorsed the continued financial and military support of Ukraine by the United States, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, the Democratic nominee in District 10, said he supports the U.S. in opposing Russia leader Vladimir Putin&#8217;s territorial ambitions in Europe and standing up to China, which is “violating international law and illegally dumping goods to prop up their economy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also supports the CHIPS Act, which helped to boost domestic research and manufacturing of semiconductor chips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the Israel-Hamas war, Subramanyam said he supports the U.S. returning hostages, especially  American citizens, and helping to rebuild communities affected by the war.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also supports a two-state solution, adding that Hamas cannot be one of the states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The human lives lost in this conflict have been devastating for all sides,” Subramanyam said in a statement. “I have visited the region, including the areas of Israel that were attacked, and made good friends there. I want to see an end to the war and a long-term path to peace.”</span></p>

(Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Virginia leaders tout improvements in public education, they are still working to address achievement gaps, facility improvements and the diverse needs of students and educators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, recommendations in Project 2025 — a conservative plan for how the country should operate if a Republican wins the White House — if implemented, could derail those efforts. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, has for years made recommendations found in the Project, and some were used in former President Donald Trump’s </span><a href="https://www.heritage.org/impact/trump-administration-embraces-heritage-foundation-policy-recommendations" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first term</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project includes conservative policy recommendations in various government areas, including defense, health and human services, and education. Some state leaders are concerned about the project’s proposed impact on school funding and resources. In contrast, others, including Gov. Glenn Youngkin, say the focus should be on what the presidential campaigns are proposing instead of Project 2025, which the governor characterized as a routine transition plan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;At the end of the day, there are lots of transition plans that are written, and they&#8217;ve been written for decades,” said Youngkin during an Aug. 15 meeting with reporters. “I do believe that what would really benefit Virginians and Americans is if the media would actually report on what the candidates are talking about, what they will do, or candidates that have yet to tell anybody what they&#8217;re going to do, as opposed to supposing what they might do from some transition plan that&#8217;s been written for presidents, literally since Ronald Reagan.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The plan’s stance on public education </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonathan Butcher, co-author of the education plan and senior research fellow with the Heritage Foundation, said nearly everything found in Project 2025 came from foundation research or is something it has advocated for years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project’s </span><a href="https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_CHAPTER-11.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">education plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suggests eliminating the U.S. Department of Education, which is responsible for serving students, executing plans by the president and Congress, and advocating for parental choice in education and for civil rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Butcher said the agency “failed” to address its goals of closing the achievement gap and improving the outcomes of children from low-income areas, while the federal government is spending billions on schools, compared to 50 years ago. He also said reading and math scores have reached historic lows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The authors of the plan also propose advancing school choice options, eliminating student loan forgiveness programs, eliminating a childcare program that focuses on children from low-income families, and rolling back regulations to protect transgender students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The education chapter states: “When power is exercised, it should empower students and families, not government. In our pluralistic society, families and students should be free to choose from a diverse set of school options and learning environments that best fit their needs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal recommends that the next president issue a series of executive orders requiring an unspecified group report on the “negative” influence of action civics on students’ understanding of history and civics and their disposition toward the United States. The report would also include an accounting of how federal programs and grants spread critical race theory and ideology centered on gender and diversity, equity, and inclusion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic legislators leading the General Assembly’s education committees have expressed concern about the proposed ideas. Several Republican legislators did not return The Mercury’s requests for comment on how Project 2025 could impact education in the state, or said that they weren’t well versed in the material. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, the House and Senate are controlled by Democrats who have prioritized funding teacher pay increases, and dedicating additional funds for disadvantaged students, higher education and providing more mental health resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats have dismissed Republican legislative efforts to ban certain books and allow parents to use state funding to cover the costs of educational opportunities outside of the public school system. But the two parties have worked together to improve special education and address child care needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we’re seeing in Project 2025 is really steering away from those critical core issues that we need to focus on in education, particularly around giving our students the skills that they need to succeed in a very complex world not just in the academic sense, but also socially and culturally,” said Senate Education and Health Committee Chair Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In another section of Project 2025, the authors recommend eliminating the Head Start program, which has fostered educational and social development for children under 5 years of age across the country since 1965. In 2021, the Heritage Foundation </span><a href="https://www.heritage.org/education/commentary/preschool-funding-35-trillion-spending-bill-modeled-after-failed-head-start" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the program negatively affected children and that the federal government should sunset it in 2023. Virginia currently offers 52 Head Start and Early Head Start programs across four regions statewide, according to the </span><a href="https://headstartva.org/about-us/membership/membership-directory/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Head Start Association</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Butcher said Project 2025 and the foundation have also called for an end to the federal student lending program, stating that it&#8217;s not “Washington’s job to be the bank for every college student.” Instead, the plan calls for consolidating student loans, moving them to the U.S. Department of Treasury and opening an opportunity for private lenders to offer loans to students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Education Committee Chair Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke, said the plan is “dangerous for business” and could negatively affect early education, increase college costs, and deprive disadvantaged students of resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;ve made record investments in public education, and just this year, we put an extra half billion dollars into early childhood slots because businesses were saying ‘Our workers need this,’” Rasoul said. “This is sadly a poorly concocted right-wing agenda to just prey on people, and to me, it clearly would be taking Virginia backward, and a lot of the good work that we&#8217;ve done in a bipartisan way would be unraveled.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hashmi said Republican members at the state and federal levels have long pushed ideas to dismantle the Department of Education and return control to the localities, which she said has likely adversely affected public education funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While a lot of these ideas are not necessarily new, they are really, really concerning in the ways in which Project 2025 spells out with great clarity the efforts to, in essence, destroy public education in the country.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said the plan also attacks the teaching of American History in schools, and protections for transgender and nonbinary children.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan lists several principles for safeguarding parental, student, and civil rights. The authors stated that “enforcement of civil rights should be based on a proper understanding of those laws, rejecting gender ideology and critical race theory.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The authors added that federal officials should protect educators and students in jurisdictions under federal control from “racial discrimination by reinforcing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and prohibiting compelled speech.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Butcher said while the education plan has no curricular recommendations based on gender, Project 2025 does follow the foundation’s </span><a href="https://www.heritage.org/model-legislation/the-given-name-act#:~:text=No%20public%20education%20employee%20or,a%20student's%20parents%20or%20guardians." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Given Name Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which states that “no public education employee or contractor shall use a name to address a student other than the name listed on a student’s birth certificate, or derivatives thereof, without the written permission of a student’s parents or guardians.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In higher education, Hashmi said there is also a growing argument from Republicans that higher learning is not essential and students should be diverted to trade programs instead. While workers are needed across the economic sector, she said, the proposed measure should not be implemented at the expense of higher education.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Governor keeps Project 2025 author on GMU Board of Visitors</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lindsey Burke, appointed by Youngkin to a four-year term on the Board of Visitors at George Mason University, is one of the authors of Project 2025 and director of the Center for Education Policy at the Heritage Foundation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some state leaders have criticized her role in the plan. Virginia House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, </span><a href="https://x.com/DonScott757/status/1820884230999830666" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">urged</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the governor in an Aug. 2 letter to remove Burke from her seat on the board, writing that “her extreme views are alarming and contradicts the commonwealth’s efforts.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin responded by writing that the commonwealth is “very fortunate” to have Burke on the board and said he has no intention of removing her. He said Burke was among his early higher education appointees because of her extensive preschool, K-12 and higher education policy background.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Removing her would not only do a tremendous disservice to George Mason University, but it would also undermine the spirit of Virginians from all walks of life coming together to improve their community and their commonwealth,” Youngkin wrote. </span></p>

(Spencer Platt/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday slashed the Biden administration’s latest efforts to provide student debt relief to millions of borrowers to go forward while the appeals process unfolds.</p>
<p>The Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan provided lower monthly loan payments for borrowers and lessened the time it takes to pay off their debt. The program came shortly after <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2023/06/supreme-court-strikes-down-biden-student-loan-forgiveness-program/" target="_blank">the Supreme Court struck down</a> an earlier student loan forgiveness plan from the administration in June 2023 that would have canceled more than $400 billion in debt.</p>
<p>But the SAVE plan was quickly met with a wave of legal challenges from a coalition of GOP-led states in two lawsuits stemming from Missouri and Kansas.</p>
<p>Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, North Dakota, Ohio and Oklahoma filed a <a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2024/04/09/missouri-attorney-general-leads-coalition-challenging-biden-student-debt-relief/" target="_blank">federal lawsuit</a> alongside Missouri in April against the administration over the plan.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court on Wednesday allowed an August ruling from the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/09/politics/student-loan-repayment-plan-court-blocks/index.html" target="_blank">U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit</a> that temporarily halted the plan to remain in effect. The appellate decision followed a federal judge in Missouri <a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2024/06/25/federal-rulings-out-of-kansas-missouri-put-biden-student-loan-forgiveness-on-hold/" target="_blank">issuing a preliminary injunction</a> blocking the plan in late June.</p>
<p>In its decision, the nation’s highest court said it expects the 8th Circuit to “render its decision with appropriate dispatch.”</p>
<p>Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey praised the Supreme Court’s decision in a <a href="https://ago.mo.gov/supreme-court-upholds-attorney-general-baileys-court-order-blocking-biden-harris-student-loan-scheme/" target="_blank">statement</a> Wednesday, calling it a “huge win for every American who still believes in paying their own way.”</p>
<p>On the other hand, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Education said “we are disappointed in this decision, particularly because lifting the injunction would have allowed for lower payments and other benefits for borrowers across the country,” per a statement shared with States Newsroom.</p>
<p>The spokesperson said the department “will work to minimize further harm and disruption to borrowers as we await a final decision from the Eighth Circuit,” adding that “the Biden-Harris Administration remains committed to supporting borrowers and will continue to fight for the most affordable repayment options for millions of people across the country.”</p>
<p>In a statement, Mike Pierce, executive director of the Student Borrower Protection Center, said “in rejecting this appeal, the Supreme Court perpetuates the 8th Circuit’s bogus legal fiction that pausing affordable payments is ‘preserving the status quo.’”</p>
<p>“This is ludicrous. Millions of people were repaying their student loans. Now they are in limbo,” Pierce added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kansas, Alabama, Alaska, Idaho, Iowa, Louisiana, Montana, Nebraska, South Carolina, Texas and Utah also <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2024/03/28/kobach-files-lawsuit-challenging-bidens-latest-effort-to-diminish-college-student-loan-debt/" target="_blank">filed a lawsuit over the plan</a> in March.</p>
<p>A federal judge in Kansas dismissed eight of those states — allowing only Alaska, South Carolina and Texas to move forward with their challenge — and issued a preliminary injunction.</p>
<p>In late June, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit allowed parts of the SAVE plan to go forward — forcing Alaska, South Carolina and Texas to <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A11/316401/20240705173618326_Alaska%20v%20Cardona%20Application%20to%20Vacate%20Stay%20final.pdf" target="_blank">file an emergency request</a> to the Supreme Court to vacate the stay.</p>
<p>But the Supreme Court rejected this attempt from the states’ attorneys general on Wednesday, saying that “applicants represent that they do not require emergency relief from this Court as long as the Eighth Circuit’s injunction … is in place.”</p>

<p>The girl’s teacher told her to keep moving without her shoe, then grabbed it herself and gave it back to the girl when the class settled into their designated safe location.</p>
<p>The girl recently recounted the story of losing her shoe during a morning car ride to school. It was just one of several times the girl or her siblings described what they were supposed to do – run “over to that fence,” “across that field” or “into those woods” – if an intruder enters their school building.</p>
<p>The reason I know this story is because the girl is my daughter.</p>
<p>In the quarter-century since the <a href="https://vault.fbi.gov/Columbine%20High%20School%20" target="_blank">Columbine High School massacre</a> of April 20, 1999, a whole generation of children, including my own, have lived under the threat of school-related gun violence. More recent tragedies, like those occurring at <a href="https://vault.fbi.gov/sandy-hook-elementary-school-shooting" target="_blank">Sandy Hook Elementary School</a> in Connecticut in December 2012 and <a href="https://portal.cops.usdoj.gov/resourcecenter/Home.aspx?item=cops-r1141" target="_blank">Robb Elementary School</a> in Texas in May 2022, reveal the persistent nature of this threat.</p>
<p>Regrettably, gun violence stands at the backdrop of all contemporary American education. As such, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/02/when-schools-simulate-mass-shootings/385642/" target="_blank">active shooter and intruder drills have become standard fare</a>, not only for my children but for nearly all American schoolchildren.</p>
<p>I am concerned about the fact that preparedness exercises – such as the one in which my daughter temporarily lost her shoe – sometimes <a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/146/3/e2020015503/36710/Participation-of-Children-and-Adolescents-in-Live" target="_blank">cause students harm</a>. For example, a recent study showed that active intruder drills can result in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2018.0120" target="_blank">distress and anxiety</a> for students. In another case, one of these drills led to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/03/active-shooter-drills-erika-christakis/580426/" target="_blank">hysteria and a stampede</a> in a school in Florida as students attempted to flee their faux intruder. Students and teachers alike experienced terror at the pronouncement of a real threat, that it was “<a href="https://www.today.com/parents/active-shooter-drill-leaves-students-teachers-shaken-t144748" target="_blank">not a drill</a>.”</p>
<p>As a <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aREmyhsAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">researcher in developmental and educational psychology</a> – and as a <a href="https://www.clemson.edu/education/about/directory/profile.html?userid=lrapa" target="_blank">faculty member who trains future teachers</a> – I understand the need for schools to ensure the safety and security of <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=372" target="_blank">the nation’s 55 million school-age youth</a>. But might there be a better way to protect children in the post-Columbine era?</p>
<p>I’m not the only one raising this question. A new initiative by the <a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/the-impact-of-active-shooter-drills-on-student-health-and-wellbeing" target="_blank">National Academies</a> has been initiated to assess the effects of active shooter drills on student health and well-being and to determine best practices in preparing schools to respond to threats of violence.</p>
<h2>A look at the trends</h2>
<p>To gain insight on the prevalence of school-related gun violence, my colleagues and I conducted a study of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2023-064311" target="_blank">school shootings and school mass shootings</a> that took place in America’s K-12 schools from 1997 through 2022. We used two public databases to count <a href="https://www.chds.us/sssc/data-map/" target="_blank">school shootings</a> and <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/" target="_blank">school mass shootings</a> that occurred each school year.</p>
<p>School shootings in our study were defined as “each and every instance a gun is brandished, is fired, or a bullet hits school property for any reason, regardless of the number of victims, time of day, or day of week.” School mass shootings were defined as those that happened at a K-12 school site and met the federal definition of a mass shooting in place at the time of the shooting: four or more victims killed, up to December 2012, or three or more victims killed, from January 2013 onward.</p>
<p>During the 25 school years we examined, 1997-2022, there were 1,453 school shootings. More than half of those, 794, occurred in the last five years, 2017-2022. Our analyses revealed a <a href="https://publications.aap.org/view-large/figure/13881403/peds.2023-064311f1.tif" target="_blank">sharp increase in school shootings after 2017</a>, with the number of shootings jumping from a then-record high of 89 in the 2017-2018 school year to 328 in the 2021-2022 school year.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" id="TQnEX" class="tc-infographic-datawrapper" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/TQnEX/1/" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>While the number of school shootings has increased dramatically in recent years, the number of school mass shootings has not increased at the same rate – though they have become more deadly. In total, 11 school mass shootings occurred across the 1997-1998 to 2021-2022 school years, with 126 fatalities and 122 injuries sustained overall. Five of those school mass shootings occurred in the 1997-2012 school years, while six occurred in the 2012-2022 school years. Nevertheless, the fatality rate nearly doubled in the last decade, rising from 7.6 deaths per mass shooting event from 1997-2012 to 14 deaths per school mass shooting event from 2012-2022.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" id="jSGzS" class="tc-infographic-datawrapper" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/jSGzS/1/" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>Efforts to maximize student safety are paramount. To be sure, I want my children’s schools to do their utmost to protect their students. However, many current measures designed to keep students safe – like the appointment of <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/docs/wh_now_is_the_time_full.pdf" target="_blank">school resource officers</a> – have <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/2372966X.2020.1846458" target="_blank">not been proven to prevent school shootings</a> or <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2018.12.006" target="_blank">lessen the severity of school shootings</a>, in terms of injury or fatality, when they do occur.</p>
<p>Gun injury is now the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMc2201761" target="_blank">leading cause of death for children and adolescents</a> in the United States. While school shootings and school mass shootings represent only a portion of gun injuries sustained by school-age youth, gun violence – including school-related gun violence – is a <a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/sites/default/files/2024-01/2023-june-cgvs-u-s-gun-violence-in-2021-v3.pdf" target="_blank">public health crisis</a>. As such, a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMsb1302631" target="_blank">public health approach</a> is merited.</p>
<h2>Relying on research</h2>
<p>I see at least three ways that schools and communities can work to lessen gun violence occurring in and around schools:</p>
<p><strong>1: Educate parents and families about safe gun storage.</strong></p>
<p>Educators and community health care providers – including <a href="https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2023-065281" target="_blank">pediatricians, primary care physicians and mental health clinicians</a> – can engage in efforts to counsel families on <a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/at-home/Pages/Handguns-in-the-Home.aspx" target="_blank">safe firearm storage</a>. Health care providers can also work to understand <a href="https://www.aap.org/en/advocacy/state-advocacy/extreme-risk-protection-orders-erpo-or-red-flag-laws" target="_blank">Extreme Risk Protection Order laws</a> in their states; such laws allow them to coordinate with law enforcement to remove firearms from a home environment when an individual is identified who may be at risk of doing harm to self or others.</p>
<p><strong>2: Utilize evidence-based, schoolwide approaches to promote school safety.</strong></p>
<p>School safety can be supported through evidence-based frameworks, such as <a href="https://www.pbis.org/" target="_blank">Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports</a>, which aims to improve school-based practices affecting student outcomes. This positive approach can be used to proactively address students’ <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/pits.22614" target="_blank">social, emotional and behavioral needs</a> and promote school safety. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2012-0243" target="_blank">This approach</a> also allows school personnel to monitor and manage students’ mental health needs, attend to schoolwide behavior and discipline issues, and foster a safe school climate. Accordingly, it may help reduce potential threats of gun violence perpetrated by students.</p>
<p><strong>3: Support legislation and regulations for gun safety and violence prevention.</strong></p>
<p>Community members, including parents and teachers, and policymakers can support <a href="https://efsgv.org/wp-content/uploads/PublicHealthApproachToGVP-EFSGV.pdf" target="_blank">legislation for gun safety, evidence-based violence prevention practices and regulations</a>. For example, child access protection laws – laws that impose penalties on gun owners if children access firearms – decrease <a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/wjps-2020-000223" target="_blank">firearm injuries</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1086/699657" target="_blank">gun carrying</a>, and thus help promote safety in and around schools.</p>

<h2>Hope for the future</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://nij.ojp.gov/funding/opportunities/o-nij-2024-171966" target="_blank">National Institute for Justice</a> has made it a priority to support new research to study firearm violence and mass shootings, including research on the effectiveness of school campaigns to educate families on safe gun storage.</p>
<p>These efforts will provide important new insights about how to <a href="https://everytownresearch.org/report/how-to-stop-shootings-and-gun-violence-in-schools/#solutions-to-prevent-school-gun-violence" target="_blank">prevent school-related gun violence</a>.</p>
<p>While my own children and their millions of peers attending school in the United States today continue to endure the threat of school-related gun violence, I hope future generations will experience school without having to worry about someone showing up at their school with a gun.</p>

(Klaus Vedfelt / Getty Images) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Board of Education on Wednesday approved the final touches on the state’s Every Student Succeeds Act plan, designed to address concerns with how schools were rated and student performance was measured to determine better how to direct state resources. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the special meeting in Richmond, the board approved Virginia’s ESSA plan, readiness weighting for different grade levels, and the overall school performance and support framework proposal as part of its package of accountability system changes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compared to the existing system, the new regulations are splitting the state’s accreditation system into two: an accreditation system, to assess whether schools meet all requirements laid out in state laws and regulations; and an accountability system, to provide “timely and transparent information on student and school performance.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VDOE staff said this plan helps meet the board’s </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/data-policy-funding/virginia-board-of-education/board-comprehensive-plan" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">goals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of setting and assisting students in meeting high expectations and supporting learning loss recovery by ensuring the school performance framework holds schools accountable for actual performance.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="I6qUehRHfV"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/26/virginia-board-of-education-board-adopts-new-school-standards-of-accreditation-regulations/">Va. education board adopts new school accreditation regulations</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Va. education board adopts new school accreditation regulations&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/26/virginia-board-of-education-board-adopts-new-school-standards-of-accreditation-regulations/embed/#?secret=nqv27Yi67M#?secret=I6qUehRHfV" data-secret="I6qUehRHfV" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whether that is human resources or financial resources, whatever it is, targeted support is absolutely what this is,” said Board President Grace Creasey, an appointee of Gov. Glenn Youngkin, like most members of the board, following the group’s vote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on 2022-23 data, VDOE projects that 60.5% of schools are off track or would need intensive support according to the new accountability system standards, meaning they are “significantly” or “not meeting the state’s expectation for growth, achievement, and readiness.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compared to the existing system, 11.5% of schools were found not fully accredited, with conditions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin, who directed the board to split the accountability system into two, suggested </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/05/19/youngkin-says-report-on-honesty-gap-points-to-decline-in-virginia-schools/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">earlier</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in his tenure that the decisions by previous administrations created an inaccurate picture of the state of K-12 public education in Virginia as identified by state and national assessments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Board member Mashea Ashton stated that the old system identified schools needing support and resources. Still, it didn&#8217;t give schools the data they needed to use their resources appropriately to target the students who needed it most such as English language learner students, who were excluded from that data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chad Alderman, a co-consultant on the redesign, said the new accountability system will require more schools to examine a greater number of student groups than under the previous system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And when more schools have to pay attention to more groups of students, that’s a good thing,” said Board member Andy Rotherham. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Board Vice President Bill Hansen added that “in so many ways, this is such a wonderful opportunity for us to change our system — bring accountability, bring transparency, bring innovation into this conversation.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data collection on assessments is underway, and full implementation of the plan will begin in the 2025-26 school year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some members of the public who spoke at Wednesday’s meeting were perplexed by the changes, after Virginia’s education system helped the commonwealth earn </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/11/virginia-americas-top-state-for-business-nations-best-schools-solid-infrastructure.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNBC&#8217;s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rating as the top state for business in 2024. CNBC examined Virginia’s K-12 public schools and higher education institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The board also faced criticism regarding the accountability changes from speakers who claimed the changes will increase current inequities for students, require teachers to earn additional certifications to teach accelerated coursework in middle school mathematics, science, history and social science, and require more English learners to be considered in accountability calculations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">English learners are typically excluded because some children are learning English for the first time and may need more time to become proficient in the language. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The board said the new rules would reduce the number of semesters English learners are excluded from the calculations from 11 to three. Under the previous regulations, approximately 35,000 students were excluded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you know how many students cannot access advanced classes due a language disability, cost or availability?” asked parent Vanessa Hall. “We asked for equitable support for student success; instead, these measures punish schools with too many low income English language learning or disabled students.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hall added that the measures “throws them under the bus” and challenged the board to learn a language in three semesters in order to take science and history tests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other speakers embraced the changes. Todd Truitt, a parent with children in Arlington schools, said he supported the newly adopted accountability framework, the middle school accelerated coursework readiness factor and changes to give school districts extra credit for students successfully taking Algebra before the eighth grade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also pointed to a </span><a href="https://x.com/arneduncan/status/1780285163127382412" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">social media post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from former U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, who supported updating the accountability framework and said that “Lying to parents about how their children are doing academically is definitely the easier path, but it is always the wrong path.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Truitt added that with the changes, Virginia will “finally live up to its responsibility” to students, parents and communities with “proper disclosure of academic performance data.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, the board successfully approved its newly designed Standards of Accreditation </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/55896/638569321084370000" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">regulations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, separating the existing system because information about the quality of schools or student learning outcomes wasn’t clearly delineated. In addition, the existing system used the process for accrediting schools as an accountability system to “foster” school improvement, instead of fostering the establishment of effective school-level educational programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ESSA plan is subject to revision by the U.S. Department of Education. According to Todd Reid, a spokesman with VDOE, the federal agency will have 90 days to review and approve the revisions to the ESSA state plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The changes they are making are consistent with components of other states’ plans that have been approved by USDOE previously,” Reid wrote in an email to the Mercury. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anne Holton, an appointee of Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam and former state secretary of education, said she disagreed that the new accountability system enhances transparency. She said the previous system was developed in 2018-2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also said the development process of the new system ignored feedback from parents and members of other academic organizations, some who claimed that it was “wrongheaded” and “not fully flushed out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I certainly can&#8217;t say that it&#8217;s perfect in every way, and I think there are some legitimate improvements that the new framework would make,” Holton said of the splitting of the system, “but I think that [the new system] is fundamentally flawed in a number of ways.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holton said many people have said there is an issue with the “honesty gap” — the perceived difference between how students in Virginia fared on state assessments versus national assessments — but she believes the state should address the “support gap” for schools, which has spanned across different administrations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s what we need to do next,” Holton said.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin speaking on Aug. 20 about the 2023-24 Standards of Learning results in Richmond.

However, pass rates in other subjects are still behind results from the 2022-23 school year.</span></p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Statewide Pass Rates: 2018-19 vs. 2023-24</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reading </strong>77.55 | 73.05</p>
<p><strong>Writing </strong>75.74 | 75.69</p>
<p><strong>History and Social Science </strong>79.99 | 65.2</p>
<p><strong>Mathematics </strong>82.05 | 70.95</p>
<p><strong>Science </strong>80.91 | 68.44</p>
</div>
	</div>
	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pass rates for grades 3 through 8 in reading, math, and science Standards of Learning tests all showed increases statewide by at least 1%. Writing showed the highest increase — 17 percentage points — while history and social science saw little gain, less than a percentage point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Standards of Learning tests (SOLs) are used in Virginia to measure student learning and achievement in mathematics, reading, science, writing, and history and social science. Testing was suspended during 2020-21, when many schools around the state stopped in-person instruction in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2023-24, roughly 71% of Virginia students passed the math tests compared to 82% before the pandemic. On reading tests, 77.5% of students overall passed compared to 73% before the pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The administration has regularly </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/03/29/virginia-explained-the-debate-over-student-expectations/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pinned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the results of the learning loss on prior Boards of Education that changed the state’s standards of school accreditation and </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/03/29/virginia-explained-the-debate-over-student-expectations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lowered the scores</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> required to be considered proficient in a certain subject, on student assessments. Democrats and previous board members have defended such decisions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every single one of our data releases is a snapshot into a motion picture, and I&#8217;m pleased today that the</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">motion picture will, in fact, show that a ship that was off course has been turned around, and that we are seeing progress,” said Gov. Glenn Youngkin, “but we will also say today that we have a long way to go.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last September, the administration, troubled by the significant learning loss in reading and math, dedicated $418 million through the 2025-26 school year to the problem. The administration launched “high-intensity” tutoring programs and the “ALL IN VA” plan to focus on attendance, literacy and tutoring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statewide, schools hired additional tutors, extended instruction time before and after school, and focused on using the state’s free personalized supplemental math and reading resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data showed a 16% reduction in students chronically absent in 2023-24 compared to the previous year. Students are chronically absent if they have missed at least 18 days of instruction for any reason, including excused and unexcused absences. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data shows pass rates statewide increased for economically disadvantaged students, English learners and students with disabilities over the previous two school years.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Mixed results between counties</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, school divisions have had mixed results with pass rates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fairfax County, the largest school division in Virginia, maintained similar pass rates in reading, math and science over the previous two school years, but experienced significant drops in writing, and history and social science by at least 20 percentage points each.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Craig County, one of the smaller school divisions in the commonwealth, saw increases in all five subject areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The administration also praised school divisions such as Bath and Brunswick County Public Schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between 2022-23 and 2023-24 school years, Bath saw a 19% increase in reading scores and Brunswick saw a 21% increase in grades 3-8 math pass rates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With schools facing the threat of All In VA funding ending in two years, Kristy Somerville-Midgette, superintendent of Brunswick County Public Schools, recommended superintendents work with their school boards, and local government and “be creative” with their funding and “look for opportunities to best serve students.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levi Goren, a policy director at The Commonwealth Institute for Fiscal Analysis, said in a statement that the increases in pass rates are “great” and the success is likely connected to the recent increases in state support for students. Support for students facing “higher barriers,” such as students from low-income families, students with disabilities, and English language learners, is still needed, Goren added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While today’s scores were promising for some of these students, we know that one strong year of improvement cannot make up for the continued impact of years of insufficient funding,” Goren said. “Sustained increases in state funding would help lift test scores and other outcomes for students facing greater barriers.” </span></p>

Glenn Youngkin policies, Sept. 27, 2022. (Courtesy of Z2B Photography)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walkouts over mask mandates, overhauled transgender policies and gun violence have disrupted some high schools in Virginia in recent years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now with public schools underway in a new year, educators are bracing for actions that could mimic spring protests on college campuses over the Israel-Hamas war.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a principals’ conference earlier this summer, education leaders discussed how to prepare for the political climate in the upcoming year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Longtime educator Tim Healey in Prince William County told his colleagues at the conference in June that school climate and culture will become more important than ever in an age of political unrest, divided opinions, and student activism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healey said the upheaval students are learning now is completely different from what his colleagues learned regarding free speech from the 1969 Supreme Court case, Tinker vs Des Moines Independent Community School District, when students were disciplined for wearing armbands to protest against the Vietnam War. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court </span><a href="https://perma.cc/8K9M-3MVG" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">decided</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in favor of the students who did not “materially or substantially interfere“ with the school&#8217;s operation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No longer is it just armbands in the Tinker case we all studied in school law, student activism has taken on a much more unique role in our schools, and how we keep our school together with this political unrest is really, really important,” said Healey at the annual Virginia Middle and High School Principals Conference and Exposition in Norfolk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healey, who is principal at Colgan High School in Northern Virginia, said his students have walked out over the issues in the Middle East, racial injustice, school shootings and violence, transgender rights and abortion rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said the challenge for school officials and teachers is that students are learning about the history of the Middle East through short social media videos, some of which need to be fact checked. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He stressed that school officials need to facilitate students’ free speech, saying it’s important to listen, validate students and teach them how to disagree appropriately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think we see a lot of models around of people yelling and screaming at each other or folding their arms, and [saying] ‘because you disagree with me, you&#8217;re the worst person in the world;’ and so we in our history classes and our leadership classes, we are deliberate about teaching our kids how to disagree with each other and have different opinions,&#8221; he said.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healey said expanding beyond the traditional sports teams and clubs could also help to foster a positive culture and climate in schools. For example, Healey said his school boosts student spirit around musicals and multicultural events. At Colgan&#8217;s Multicultural Spirit Week, Colgan students wear the colors of their native flag and jerseys from their favorite sports team. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Education Committee Chair Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke, who recently attended Roanoke City Public Schools </span><a href="https://www.wdbj7.com/2024/08/15/convocation-kicks-off-roanoke-city-school-year/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">annual kickoff</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the school year, told the Mercury that one of his takeaways from the event is that a way teachers can help students learn is through their own interests. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What better way to channel their passion, their interest into better understanding civics, history, constitutional rights amongst other things than to take these interests, take these passions and embrace them and channel them,” Rasoul said. “My best advice is to use this as an experiential moment for those students who genuinely are concerned and would like to have their voice heard.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the collegiate level, Virginia’s colleges and universities are a bit more experienced in handling student activism. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The State Council of Higher Education for Virginia, the coordinating body for the state’s colleges and universities, holds an annual training and discussion session because of increased campus protests in recent years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s legislature formed a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/14/virginia-lawmakers-to-study-campus-safety-policies-after-series-of-protests/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">select committee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on maintaining campus safety and allowing students to exercise their First Amendment rights, after more than 125 arrests at four of Virginia’s college campuses were recorded in May.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there are some differences between K-12 and higher education, Senate Education and Health Committee Chair Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, said students, teachers, and administrators must know their rights and limitations when it comes to demonstrating, and for schools to have clear guidelines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Essential to this is how we teach our students the parameters of debate, discussion, dissent from each other,” Hashmi said to the Mercury. “That&#8217;s part of our responsibility as we&#8217;re teaching civic-minded individuals and to give them the tools and the resources to engage in discussion, but to do it in a respectful way, in a nonviolent way.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February, the student, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia and the law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP, filed a lawsuit claiming the school division violated Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ACLU stated that the ruling found that the school board “likely violated” both when it banned the Hanover student from the tennis team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This order is a reminder to school boards that protecting transgender young people is part of protecting girls’ sports,” said legal director Eden Heilman, in a statement. “And it’s a flashing red light to any Virginia school board that might be tempted to think that VDOE’s anti-trans model policies give it license to abuse its power. As the court reminded Hanover County School Board in its ruling, no state policies can shield Virginia schools from accountability for violating federal law.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration overhauled the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/09/12/despite-law-few-virginia-school-districts-adopt-state-model-transgender-policies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> model policies for transgender and nonbinary students designed under former Gov. Ralph Northam to protect the privacy and rights of such students. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February, ACLU and Freshfields filed three lawsuits challenging the Virginia Department of Education on the policies that some schools have adopted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In opposition to a student’s right to decide who finds out about their gender status out of fear of being bullied or harassed, the governor sided with parents’ rights, directing the administration to overhaul the policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The administration </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/09/16/youngkin-administration-overhauls-virginia-transgender-student-policies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">revised</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the policies to require parental approval for any changes to students’ “names, nicknames, and/or pronouns,” direct schools to keep parents “informed about their children’s well-being” and require that student participation in activities and athletics and use of bathrooms be based on sex, “except to the extent that federal law otherwise requires.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freshfields and ACLU filed the Hanover case in two courts, the Eastern District of Virginia and the Hanover County Circuit Court. The third lawsuit involving a York County student was </span><a href="https://www.wtkr.com/news/in-the-community/historic-triangle/york-county-court-dismisses-lawsuit-challenging-virginias-transgender-student-policies" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dismissed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in July. That suit claimed that at least one teacher had refused to address the student by her correct first name.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The draft defines “cell phone-free” education as “bell-to-bell,” meaning phones should be turned off and stored away from the first school bell until dismissal. This includes lunchtime and breaks between class periods. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On July 9, Gov. Glenn Youngkin issued Executive Order 33, directing his administration to create guidelines to limit students’ time in front of “addictive” cell phones and eliminate “clear distractions” in the classroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The education department said over 600 community members, parents, teachers and school officials attended public events to provide input on the guidelines as well as other community events to understand concerns about cell phones and personal electronic devices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The extensive input we received from Virginians was clear and direct,” said Superintendent of Public Instruction Lisa Coons. “They asked for cell phones and personal electronic communication devices to be removed from our children’s public schools during the school day at every level — elementary, middle and high school. By refocusing our students’ attention back into learning and away from their phones and social media, all our children will have a better opportunity to learn and succeed academically.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studies have shown that students use cell phones to browse the internet and social media apps, and message people during instructional time. Students have also used the devices to record events at schools and post them on various platforms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The draft guidance includes age-appropriate cell phone restrictions in Virginia’s elementary and secondary public schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the draft, if a parent determines an elementary student needs to bring a cell phone or personal electronic communication device to school, it must be stored, off, and away from the student during the school day. Students should not use cell phones in the school building or on the school grounds before or after school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In middle and high school, students should not have a readily available cell phone or personal electronic communication device during the bell-to-bell school day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Middle schools should establish local policies that determine cell phone and personal electronic communication device use within the school building or on school grounds outside of bell-to-bell, including before and after school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cell phones and personal electronic communication devices may be used on a high school campus before or after school.</span></p>
<p>Exemptions will be permitted for students with disabilities and EL students with a documented language barrier.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/programs-services/school-operations-support-services/cell-phone-free-education-in-virginia-k-12-public-schools" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feedback</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the draft guidelines closes Sept. 15. School boards must adopt the final guidance by Jan. 1. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of Virginia’s school boards have already banned or restricted cell phone use in schools.</span></p>

(Courtesy of Cassandra Loper/Capital News Service)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most Virginians agree that public K-12 schools should teach the history of race, but fewer say it should be required in colleges and universities, according to a </span><a href="https://news.vcu.edu/article/2024/08/75-of-virginians-agree-that-the-history-of-race-should-be-taught-in-k-12-schools" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conducted by the L. Douglas Wilder School of Government and Public Affairs at Virginia Commonwealth University.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The poll found that 75% of respondents supported such a curriculum for K-12, the remaining 15% disagreed. But less than half of Virginians, or 49%, said those lessons should be required in postsecondary education in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study indicated that Democrats and independents were more likely to support a college requirement, while 6 in 10 Republicans polled disagreed. Wilder School used telephone interviews from 809 Virginians, ages 18 or older, between June 24 and July 3. The margin of error is plus or minus 4.81 percentage points.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2022, Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration has been examining and revising educational content related to race and equity, which the governor branded “divisive” in his </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/74---eo/74---eo/EO-1---ENDING-THE-USE-OF-INHERENTLY-DIVISIVE-CONCEPTS,-INCLUDING-CRITICAL-RACE-THEORY,-AND-RESTORING-EXCELLEN.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first executive order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last spring, the governor directed his administration to review VCU’s racial literacy syllabi and the diversity-themed coursework from George Mason University.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VCU students sought to make racial literacy general education a requirement for graduation, but the university’s Board of Visitors, which is appointed by the governor, </span><a href="https://blogs.vcu.edu/provost/2024/05/10/provost-statement-on-the-board-of-visitors-decision-regarding-vcus-racial-literacy-requirement/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">killed it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in May.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While VCU still offers racial literacy classes to VCU students, the graduating students walked out of the commencement address given by the governor the day after the board’s decision. George Mason delayed its courses until the 2025-26 school year.</span></p>
<p><b>Rao still remains health system chair</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the release of the poll data, the Wilder School was criticized by the university for errors it </span><a href="https://news.vcu.edu/article/2024/08/vcu-statement-about-the-commonwealth-poll" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">identified</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the release accompanying the poll, specifically that the General Assembly recommended VCU President Michael Rao step down as chair of the VCU Health System Board of Directors and that Rao resigned from the board after an unsuccessful development project costing the university millions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rao remains the chair, VCU stated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unfortunately, this is the </span><a href="https://news.vcu.edu/article/2024/01/vcu-statement-about-the-commonwealth-poll" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">second time in 2024</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> former Gov. Wilder’s personal agenda has skewed polls regarding VCU and President Rao,” the university wrote. “His continued bias runs the risk of tarnishing the Wilder School’s otherwise strong reputation. VCU is proud of the Wilder School dean, leadership and its dedicated and award-winning faculty, staff and students. They deserve better from their namesake.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rao </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/06/vcu-officials-reviewing-56m-payment-to-richmond-for-failed-development-project-jlarc-suggestions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told lawmakers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in June that plans to develop a medical tower on the site of Richmond’s former Public Safety Building at Clay and 10th streets ended due to concerns over the unsuitable site conditions and increased construction costs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VCU officials are still reviewing an agreement to pay the city of Richmond approximately $2.5 million annually in lieu of taxes for a development that was never built. The school paid the city, investors and developers nearly $80 million to exit the project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wilder School’s study indicated that 84% of Virginians think Rao should provide a public accounting of where VCU spent the money, and 53% said Rao shouldn’t receive his comprehensive salary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a Richmond Times-Dispatch </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/vcus-rao-ranks-high-on-list-of-highest-paid-university-presidents/article_dc7326fe-2b50-575d-997a-f62e2fd6dce3.html#:~:text=Rao%27s%20pay%20in%20his%20first,for%20last%20year%20as%20%24875%2C284" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2018, Rao’s compensation was $875,284.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers redirected approximately $650 million each year and added around $180 million yearly to develop the at-risk program. Most localities have opted into the program, which helps to provide sufficient funding for schools to serve low-income students in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data from the Department of Education shows that at-risk students comprised approximately 43% of Virginia’s total enrollment last year.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Underfunded schools, under-resourced students</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state investment comes after localities </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/20/after-a-state-study-found-virginia-is-underfunding-schools-local-governments-want-action/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">urged</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lawmakers to address Virginia’s historical underfunding of its school divisions. This was backed by a </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt575.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">July 2023 study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission that </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt575.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">found</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Virginia schools receive 14% less state funding than the 50-state average, roughly $1,900 less per student.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Any additional money that the state provides to local governments to the local school divisions to help restore the balance in the funding relationship to what it should be based on the JLARC [recommendations] is greatly appreciated and is a good first step,” said Jeremy Bennett, director of intergovernmental affairs for the Virginia Association of Counties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bennett said the report shows that local governments and school divisions are “paying billions more than they&#8217;re required to by the state because we recognize that the cost of providing quality education is higher than what is recognized on the state&#8217;s current funding formula.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB825" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rae Cousins</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, D-Richmond, who carried unsuccessful at-risk add-on legislation based on JLARC’s recommendations, said changes to the program will help support at-risk students with potentially more one-on-one instructional time, more nutritional school meals, and before-and after-school programs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our schools just didn&#8217;t have the resources that those [at-risk] students needed to be successful,” Cousins said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local leaders said funding formulas that underestimated the needs of school divisions and a cap on the number of support positions the state would fund enacted amid the Great Recession in 2007 have contributed to the lack of funding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/04/virginia-budget-puts-millions-toward-support-staff-as-schools-struggle-to-find-teachers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">partially lifted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the cap last summer by investing $152 million in school support positions, but funding levels were never restored.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Recommended changes for the at-risk program</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After finding the previous add-on program for at-risk students relied on outdated free lunch data, JLARC </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/summary/Rpt575Rec.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recommended</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> changing the state code and language in the Appropriation Act to designate the at-risk add-on program as a Standards of Quality funding program, which would signify that the funding is  “essential for providing Virginia K–12 students with a quality education.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers also recommended changes to allow for the federally-approved Identified Student Percentage (ISP) measure to calculate funding for all at-risk programs that relied on outdated free lunch estimates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the two-year budget lawmakers adopted in May, funding would be allocated based on each school division’s weighted ISP. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the new program, 60% of funding would be distributed to divisions using a flat per-student rate, and 40% would be distributed using a variable rate based on the concentration of poverty in each school division.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">School divisions that opt into the program will receive a minimum 11% basic aid add-on per estimated at-risk student and an additional add-on to basic aid varying between 0% and 37%, depending on the number of at-risk students relative to other school divisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB609" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lashrecse Aird</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, D-Petersburg, carried legislation that would have added at-risk add-on funding to the Standards of Quality, as well as updated the funding formula to “ensure that money designated for our highest-need students doesn’t go unused,” in a statement to the Mercury.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the legislation was incorporated into an </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB105" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unsuccessful bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> vetoed by the governor after the legislature failed to accept his recommendations. If the bill had been successful, the program would have been a mandatory part of the Standards of Quality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Joint Subcommittee to Study Elementary and Secondary Education Funding, which will be meeting for the first time on Sept. 16, was created to provide direction and oversight of Standards of Quality funding cost policies and make recommendations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local governments that opt into the at-risk add on program are responsible for providing a local match to receive state funding.</span></p>

Parker Michels-Boyce for The Virginia Mercury</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Lottery announced Wednesday that $934 million in fiscal year 2024 sales profits will benefit K-12 public education, a record amount. The total amount it collected for the fiscal year that ended June 30 was more than $5.5 billion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lottery’s total proceeds to public education stands at $13.6 billion, and the agency continues Virginia’s year-over-year sales increases since the pandemic. Last year, the Virginia Lottery earned $867.4 million from lottery sales, an increase from $779.6 million in 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Over the course of my administration, we have been able to achieve record funding for K-12 education, allowing for increased opportunities in the classroom,&#8221; said Gov. Glenn Youngkin in a statement on Wednesday. “I am so thrilled these record profits will help provide the necessary support and resources for Virginia&#8217;s students,” the governor said, noting that about 10% of the state’s k-12 education budget stems from Virginia Lottery profits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin, along with Secretary of Education Aimee Guidera, said the lottery helps to support various aspects of Virginia’s K-12 education, including special education, career and technical learning, and early reading intervention. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guidera thanked lottery employees and expressed that their work helps set students up for success outside the classroom. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is preparing every single graduate of our K-12 schools to be ready for life, and that means preparing them to be productive members of our economy, to be informed and engaged citizens in our democracy, and to be engaged, thoughtful and good neighbors in our communities,” Guidera said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The announcement of the lottery’s sizable profits comes after some convenience stores </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/15/convenience-stores-shut-down-virginia-lottery-sales-in-protest-for-skill-games/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shut down</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Virginia Lottery sales briefly in April in protest to the ban on skill games, which are still illegal in the state after a lengthy campaign to lift the ban and protracted deliberation in the legislature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Lottery Director Khalid Reede Jones said in the past fiscal year, the agency paid $4.2 billion in prizes to lottery participants, and $142 million to retail partners, while doing so with an expense ratio of 3.8%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his remarks to the governor, Jones said “the only thing I can promise is that we are endeavoring to make fiscal year 2025 even bigger, better and greater than this year.”</span></p>

Data is still being collected for VMSDEP costs for the 2023-24 school year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program was established nearly 95 years ago to provide college tuition waivers to the spouses or children of permanently disabled military veterans or those killed in action.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amy Griffin, wife of the late Norfolk firefighter Chris Griffin, said her husband’s sacrifice was a big loss for the family and challenged their financial stability. However, the tuition program changed their son’s life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was told that school would be one less thing that we had to be worried about and one less thing I had to try and plan for,” said mother Amy Griffin, during a June 28 Senate Select Committee Workgroup. “That was such a relief to not have to worry about that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chuck Zingler, commissioner of the Virginia Department of Veterans Services, added “people are definitely becoming more aware of the program” and are “able to enjoy the benefit of [an] education earned by deaths and wounds.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although military families say VMSDEP greatly benefits them, the rising costs for the state&#8217;s institutions of higher learning is a continuing concern for some lawmakers. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The cost to colleges</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to SCHEV’s figures, George Mason, Virginia Commonwealth and Old Dominion Universities have experienced the most significant cost impacts from the program year over year since 2019, compared to other schools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mike Porter, a spokesman for VCU, said the program&#8217;s cost has impacted the university’s ability to invest in essential areas such as academic programs, student experiences, and research initiatives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data shows that VCU lost more than $11 million due to the program during the 2022-23 school year, the most in a single year compared to other institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Although VMSDEP is a waiver program, there are real costs associated with delivering a comprehensive educational experience and support services to these students while receiving no revenue to support those costs,” said Porter. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_36388" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1024px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-36388 size-large" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/VCU_sign_CNS-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/VCU_sign_CNS-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/VCU_sign_CNS-300x225.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/VCU_sign_CNS-768x576.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/VCU_sign_CNS-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/VCU_sign_CNS-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  The VCU sign located at Shafer Street. (Courtesy of Cassandra Loper/Capital News Service)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that VCU has periodically raised tuition and fees to cover all new costs, though they can’t be pinned solely on the tuition waiver program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While increases have not been directly attributed to VMSDEP, the program&#8217;s costs are part of the overall financial picture that necessitates tuition hikes,” he said. “Without state support, VCU would need to increase tuition by 3.6% to cover the full cost of the VMSDEP waiver.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data shows that Old Dominion had the largest increase in VMSDEP waiver participation, jumping from 53 participants in 2018-19 to 735 in 2022-23. VCU had 538 participants in 2022-23, while George Mason had 514 and Virginia Tech enrolled 477.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kelsey Kendall, a spokeswoman from Old Dominion, said in an email that the program has expanded access to the university for a number of students. As a result, she said, Old Dominion has had to realign internal resources to cover the growing expense, which includes reallocating funds to student services from non-student service areas, and making changes to student fees and tuition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While these adjustments did help, it did not fully cover the waivers, although needed services were provided to support students,” Kendall said in a statement. “With the new law now providing funds for VMSDEP waivers, the university looks forward to continuing to serve our military students and further investing in our long-standing commitment to access and excellence.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the state’s figures, the program recorded 6,344 waiver recipients last school year; in contrast,the program provided 1,387 waivers during the 2018-19 school year. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How the program works</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Veterans Services certifies applicants’ eligibility for the Virginia Military Survivors and Dependents Education Program. SCHEV and Virginia’s public colleges and universities apply the program’s financial aid benefits including stipends, and tuition and fee waivers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Benefits are available for up to eight semesters, the equivalent of four academic years,” according to the Department’s website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program saw significant legislative changes that expanded its benefits, starting in the late 1970s, according to a May 28 House Appropriations Committee </span><a href="https://www.dvs.virginia.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/House-Approprations-Committee-Staff-Higher-Education-Update-2024-5-28.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some of the changes included shifting the benefit from appropriation-based to a waiver format and creating a stipend benefit for room, board, and books.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, the legislature also passed a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+SB1173" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">measure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expanding tuition waivers to applicants of a veteran with at least a 90% permanent and service-related disability.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Program changes prompted pushback, repeal</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Debates about the program’s impact dominated the spring, after advocates urged Virginia lawmakers to repeal a budget provision that would have required family members of disabled veterans seeking a college education to first complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), among other new eligibility requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers responded by repealing the changes last month and allocating $90 million in additional funding from the state’s surplus in addition to the $40 million included in the two year budget. However, the legislature’s actions left lingering questions about the program&#8217;s future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In June, lawmakers </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/resolutions/2024%20Joint%20JLARC%20VMSDEP%20Request%20Letter.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">directed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> JLARC to study the program to “ensure the long-term sustainability of the program and evaluate all aspects of eligibility criteria, program parameters, and impact on Virginia’s higher education institutions and tuition paying students.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The letter also directs JLARC to provide recommendations on legislative action and budget modifications that could improve the stability and strength of the program and ensure its long-term viability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JLARC’s findings are due to the governor and chairs of the House Appropriations and Senate Finance and Appropriations Committees by Sept. 1. Gov. Glenn Youngkin </span>also <a class="c-link" href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/ed/ED-7---Addressing-Changes-to-the-Virginia-Military-Survivors-and-Dependents-Education-Program.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/ed/ED-7---Addressing-Changes-to-the-Virginia-Military-Survivors-and-Dependents-Education-Program.pdf" data-sk="tooltip_parent">convened</a> a task force to study the program.</p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: This story has been updated to reflect that a task force was formed to study the tuition benefit program.</em></p>

(Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s school bus driver vacancy rate has decreased by five percent over the past three school years, according to the Virginia Department of Education. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the legislature amended its reporting requirements, the agency started collecting bus driver vacancy data two years ago. Factors like pay and recruitment challenges, and drivers leaving for the private sector, led to the shortage of drivers.</span></p>
<p><iframe id="datawrapper-chart-hLcn8" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" title="Virginia Bus Driver Vacancy Rate" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/hLcn8/1/" height="272" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" aria-label="Multiple Donuts" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, schools were closed to in-person leaving some drivers to find other ways to meet the increased cost of services and goods due to inflation that burdened families in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the 2021-22 school year, Virginia recorded a vacancy rate of full- and part-time drivers at 16% in 2021-22. The rate decreased to 11% in 2022-23 and last year to 10%. Data on the upcoming school year 's driver vacancy rates will not be available until the fall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s good news,” said Scott Brabrand, the executive director of the Virginia Association of School Superintendents. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said superintendents around the commonwealth have been working to address the shortage by offering bonuses and increasing bus driver salaries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schools in Virginia found other unique ways of transporting students amid the bus driver shortage, such as altering routes, placing more students on buses, and using car and van services. Some communities created programs to promote </span><a href="https://news.virginia.edu/content/shortage-bus-drivers-uva-students-walk-children-school" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">walking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to school. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state legislature has also attempted to address the shortage in recent years. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the General Assembly agreed to legislation carried by Del. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1630" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carrie Coyner</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, R-Chesterfield, and Sen.</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1479" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Louise Lucas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, D-Portsmouth, to shorten the time period during which retired drivers with at least 25 years of service could return to work without jeopardizing their pension benefits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In another measure, Sen. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB622" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Todd Pillion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, R-Abington, and Del. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB687" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Israel O’Quinn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, R-Washington, raised awareness of the retirement benefits for teachers who drive buses. Following the session earlier this year, the Virginia Retirement System clarified that qualifying teachers who drive buses would receive compensation when they retire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the agency’s </span><a href="https://employers.varetire.org/media/shared/pdf/er-manual-enroll-and-maintain-employees.pdf#page20" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">employer manual</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, VRS-participating school divisions may combine the job duties of two positions under one contract as long as one of the positions is a covered position.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is a huge benefit to teachers,” Washington County Public Schools Superintendent Keith Perrigan said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experts have said that transportation is one key to keeping children in school, limiting a high number of absences, and addressing the learning loss exacerbated during the pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perrigan, who serves on the state’s </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/teaching-learning-assessment/all-in-va/attendance-matters/chronic-absenteeism-task-force" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">task force</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to address absences, said a few school divisions he represents in the Coalition of Small and Rural Schools of Virginia will start the school year fully staffed with drivers, unlike previous years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Much of rural Virginia, especially Southwest Virginia, is seeing progress in this area. Although we still have some work to do, we are breathing a little easier with the bus driver shortage,” Perrigan said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Perrigan, seven teachers in Washington County will split their time teaching and driving students, and more than 20 will do the same in Buchanan County. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, Rappahannock County faced a shortage of drivers. However, according to Shannon Grimsley, superintendent of Rappahannock schools, the school division is fully staffed with drivers and has substitute drivers available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This comes after Grimsley became a part-time school bus driver to alleviate transportation barriers for students and encourage others to become drivers. The division's focus now is covering the costs of replacing aging buses, another transportation challenge some districts face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are creatively working with the county government on our bus replacement schedule to ensure our fleet is in proper order and meeting all guidelines for optimum operability,” Grimsley said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grimsely said the costs of buses have significantly increased and the impact on rural school districts with limited state funding can be a challenge. She said the costs of buses in her district have increased by more than 63% over the past five years.</span></p>

(Stock photo by Vladimir Vladimirov/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liberty University, a private institution in Lynchburg, is facing </span><a href="https://www.acluva.org/en/cases/zinski-v-liberty-university" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for allegedly firing an employee after she disclosed her identity as a trans woman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia announced that it and the law firm Butler Curwood filed the lawsuit on behalf of Ellenor Zinski, who they claim was fired in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin.</span></p>
<p>Liberty University did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No one should be fired because of who they are — but Liberty University made it clear that’s exactly why it fired Ellenor,” said Wyatt Rolla, the ACLU of Virginia’s senior transgender rights attorney, in a statement. “Workplace discrimination against transgender people is against the law, and it’s especially telling that Liberty University sees a practicing Christian’s gender identity as so antithetical to its mission that it was willing to flout the law in order to cast out one of its own.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the ACLU, Zinski was hired to work at Liberty’s IT Helpdesk last year and received a positive review from her supervisor. Three months after being hired, her supervisor told Zinski that her performance was above average and she was “on the path to success.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, things started to change after she notified the university’s Human Resources Department that she identifies as a trans woman and planned to change her name legally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ACLU said Zinski had not received a response for over a month. She later met with leaders from Human Resources and IT.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officials read a termination notice aloud, citing “denying biological and chromosomal sex assigned at birth” as the basis for her termination, stating a conflict with Liberty’s Doctrinal Statement that names “denial of birth sex by self-identification with a different gender” as a “sinful act prohibited by God.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the ACLU, Ellenor is a devout Christian who is committed to Liberty’s mission of “preaching Christ.” She is an active member of her local church, Trinity Episcopal, whose pastor fully supported her transition, even providing gender-affirming clothing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The first time anyone ever told me God made me this way was at Trinity Episcopal Church,” said Ellenor Zinski. “Christianity has been so weaponized against the LGBTQ community, but there doesn’t need to be a conflict: You can be transgender and Christian. I am.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the ACLU, Zinski is seeking declaratory relief that Liberty University’s policy violates Title VII and compensatory and punitive damages.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two said they were “disappointed” after the school system voted to rebrand schools with Confederate names on May 10, four years after the district stripped the names. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The students are now taking responsibility for representing a small population of Black students in a Virginia NAACP-backed </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/12/virginia-naacp-sues-shenandoah-school-board-after-district-restored-confederate-names/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against their school board for allegedly “reaffirming discrimination” after voting to revert Mountain View High School back to Stonewall Jackson, and Honey Run Elementary School to Ashby-Lee after Confederate Gens. Turner Ashby and Robert E. Lee. The Confederate names were removed in 2020.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to recent data from the Virginia Department of Education, the two students represent 2.9% of Black students in Shenandoah County Public Schools.White students make up 73% of the student population, Hispanic students represent 17% and the remainder being Asian, Indigenous and Pacific Island students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nobody really cared about how this mentally affects students, makes them feel unsafe and unwanted in their learning environment and that’s something that should have never been the case,” said student Briana Brown, who attends Massanutten Regional Governor’s School, based at Mountain View High School.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown, one of the rising seniors on the lawsuit, said some of her peers felt hopeless during the renaming process and after the decision. She said she’s pleased that she’s gained support following her decision to speak out against the board’s decision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between the 1950s and 1960s, local leaders in Shenandoah County named public schools after Confederate leaders. Some did it in protest of the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1954 decision to desegregate schools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A.D. Carter V, the son of a government teacher and a student plaintiff in the lawsuit, said at the announcement of the lawsuit in June that history upsets him. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The reason they had done that was that they were trying to disincentivize Black people from attending that high school … and so they had used it specifically as a scare tactic to try and keep them out,” Carter said.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39448" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1024px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-39448" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_2509-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_2509-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_2509-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_2509-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_2509-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_2509-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Briana Brown and AD Carter speaking in front of the Shenandoah County Circuit Court on June 11, 2024 (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorneys from Guynn Waddell representing the school board are requesting the court dismiss the case because the complaint fails to prove that any student has been coerced into supporting the board’s decision against their will or harmed for refusing to do so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The only alleged harm is emotional and psychological, or speculative and potential,” the attorneys wrote. “The claims are simply not ripe for adjudication because no student has alleged that they suffered actual harm. Hurt feelings will not suffice.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia NAACP alleges in the suit that the school board violated the U.S. Constitution, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Equal Educational Opportunity Act. The plaintiffs seek to remove the Confederate names, mascots and vestiges, and to prevent any future school naming involving Confederate leaders or references to the Confederacy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Virginians believe the Confederacy represents a heritage of Southerners’ courage against the federal Union while fighting for the rights of southern states. Others, like the students and lawsuit’s plaintiffs, view the Confederacy as defenders of slavery and a foundational part of America’s history of racism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, Virginians have been working to address the commonwealth’s history of white supremacist ideology and historical practices of creating unfair advantages for white people by implementing policy changes and hosting community discussions on these topics. Signs, symbols and statutes of the Confederacy have also been renamed or removed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immediately following the board’s decision to reverse the school names, the monikers were changed with the help of the donations collected by the Coalition for Better Schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mike Schiebe, a spokesperson for the group, said approximately $70,000 in private donations have been spent to help with name-changing expenses, compared to the approximately $300,000 in 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former board members said the 2020 costs were covered by $135,000 from unused salary accounts for frozen positions, and $133,284 from residual Shenandoah Valley Regional Program for Special Education tuition. </span><a href="https://www.shenandoahforward.org/about" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shenandoah Forward</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which was founded by community members, raised the remaining amount, under $40,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students will be starting school in Shenandoah County on August 13.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We stand with our clients as they’re about to experience having to walk into the doors again of these schools with these Confederate names and certainly understand that this presents a real challenge for them,” said Kaitlin Banner, deputy legal director for the Washington Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_38925" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1024px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-38925" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2528-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2528-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2528-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2528-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2528-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2528-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A view from outside Stonewall Jackson High School in Shenandoah County. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorneys from the Washington Lawyers’ Committee and Covington &amp; Burling LLP are representing the plaintiffs — the NAACP and five current students in Shenandoah County Public Schools including Brown and Carter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the lawsuit, Virginia NAACP President Cozy Bailey Bailey urged the school board to oppose renaming the schools after Confederate leaders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Memorializing that historical reality by naming your public schools after Confederate military leaders and sympathizers subverts part of your district’s mission that claims that ‘all members of the learning community are valued and respected,’” Bailey wrote in a May 8 letter. “Students must believe they are valued and protected in order to thrive.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the school board members did not directly comment on the lawsuit during a June 19 business meeting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Board Member Gloria E. Carlineo </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3CyHdWszvo&amp;list=PLfMoFJbmXuzWdX7OD5QZst4XC2SsXtgMs&amp;index=4" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">defended</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> division staff for taking “nasty” and “harassing” calls following the board’s decision to put the Confederate school names back in place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are fully committed to fighting this lawsuit to the fullest extent of the law and we are confident that the whole truth will come out,” Carlineo said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banner said the court is considering a hearing between September and early October.</span></p>

These regulations simplify how schools are rated and allow the state to separate accountability from accreditation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A final vote on the accountability system is expected at next month’s board meeting. The accountability system includes Virginia’s Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) plan, readiness indicators and weighting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m really excited for what this new system provides for our students, for our parents, for our families, for our teachers [and] for our school divisions across the state,” said Board President Grace Creasey, who was appointed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin. “I think it absolutely contributes to increasing transparency and understanding the outcomes that our students are achieving, and how well our schools are ensuring students are having those positive outcomes for life beyond our schools.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Gov. Youngkin’s direction, the board was tasked last year with separating the existing system because information about the quality of schools or student learning outcomes wasn’t clearly delineated, the repeal states. In addition, the existing system used the process for accrediting schools as an accountability system to “foster” school improvement, instead of fostering the establishment of effective school-level educational programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the list of regulation changes, schools would receive credit for seniors who earn an advanced studies, standard or applied studies diploma within six years and credit for helping students demonstrate college and career readiness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The changes also include providing credit to schools for middle school students taking advanced coursework.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Chad Aldeman, a co-consultant on the redesign, a central theme of public comment about Virginia’s school system accreditation standards is the importance of transparency, high academic standards, and career and college readiness and pathways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Superintendent of Public Instruction Lisa Coons said the public comment on the regulation changes, which ended on July 5, “shaped and developed” the proposed system. She said the system will help the commonwealth “focus on what schools need and provide the support that they need” to achieve a distinguished rating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The department said out of the 34 total comments submitted, most were supportive of the regulations’ changes, including the revamped standards’ favoring student mastery in a school subject over growth and supporting a continued focus on chronic absenteeism, or students missing at least 18 days of instruction for any reason, including excused and unexcused absences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike other states, Virginia is proposing to raise the academic standards for English learners by including more students in the accountability calculations. English learners are typically excluded because some children are learning English for the first time and may need more time to grow in proficiency of the language. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To meet that goal, more resources would likely be required to address the achievement gap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agency said the new rules would reduce the number of semesters English learners are excluded from the calculations, from 11 semesters to three. Approximately 35,000 students were excluded under the existing regulations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consultants said the change would help identify schools struggling to support students classified as English Learners and provide them with resources and services. According to VDOE, 1.5 years is the maximum allowed under federal law to exclude an English learner from accountability calculations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As a former high school English teacher, I have seen the frustration of ELL students, many of whom have a second or third-grade English comprehension level being placed in a high school English class without any support,” said Shelly Norden, a director with the School Board Member Alliance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said ELL students would often “give up” out of frustration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data collection on assessments will begin at the start of the 2024-25 school year, and full implementation will begin the following school year. The federal government’s adoption of the state ESSA plan is a vital part of the implementation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Todd Reid, a spokesman with VDOE, Virginia is on track to submit its state plan to the U.S. Department of Education by the February deadline.</span></p>
<p><em>Note: An earlier version of this story stated that <span style="font-weight: 400;">Chad Aldeman was the Edunomics Lab policy director at Georgetown University. He left that position during the accountability system redesign.</span></em></p>

Glenn Youngkin to serve as the newest member of the Virginia Board of Education. The governor has yet to fill the second seat on the nine-member board after two seats became available earlier this month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are excited to have Dr. Bryce as a part of the team now,” said Board President Grace Creasey, who Gov. Glenn Youngkin appointed. “Thank you so much, and we look forward to all that you have to offer and bring it as far as your expertise, to add to our team here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bryce, a mother and college psychology teacher, has been </span><a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/government-politics/meg-bryce-addresses-elephant-in-the-room-at-town-hall/article_a09eea80-519b-11ee-a4d9-c7148c607840.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criticized</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for taking her children out of Virginia’s public schools following the pandemic. Bryce told the Daily Progress that she took them out of Murray Elementary School in Albemarle County after losing faith in the school’s leadership during the pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, Bryce unsuccessfully ran for the at-large seat on the Albemarle County School Board, saying she wanted to help improve the system. She’s also written commentary in opposition of decisions made by Albemarle County Schools regarding “</span><a href="https://megforschoolboard.com/megs-blog/f/lowering-standards-is-inequitable" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lowering the standards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” and ignoring </span><a href="https://megforschoolboard.com/megs-blog/f/acps-doesnt-listen-part-ii" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">parents</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the same year, she told </span><a href="https://www.cbs19news.com/news/politics/albemarle-school-board-candidate-profiles-meg-bryce-part-3/article_b7648a09-255c-5854-bd97-1bb2d748da07.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBS 19</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that being Scalia’s daughter made it, “very easy for people to dismiss me as partisan because of my maiden name.” The late justice opposed abortion, affirmative action and gay rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the same interview for her school board run, she said she hoped people would look at policies and issues instead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bryce joined the board for the first time during Wednesday’s work session. After she was introduced, Bryce did not directly comment on her appointment. She is expected to speak during Thursday’s business meeting.</span></p>
<p>Christian Martinez, a spokesman for Gov. Youngkin, said in a statement that the governor wished to thank Bryce for agreeing to serve on the board.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her extensive background in <span class="c-mrkdwn__highlight">education</span>, her advocacy for student-centered policies, and her commitment to restoring common sense in <span class="c-mrkdwn__highlight">education</span> for all Virginia students will be instrumental in ensuring that every parent, student, and teacher receives the essential resources and support needed to thrive,&#8221; Martinez said in a statement.</p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: This brief was updated with a response from the governor&#8217;s office.</em></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research shows that some students use cell phones to message people and browse the internet and social media apps during instructional time. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Others use them to record events in school and post them on various platforms. The resulting videos aren’t always positive: Earlier this month, a Pennsylvania school district acknowledged that several middle school students had made fake TikTok accounts impersonating their teachers, “and apparently made some posts using racist, homophobic and sexually explicit language” according to NPR. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I hate TikTok,” said Oveta Scott, a teacher in Northern Virginia, at a Thursday listening session hosted by the state’s education department about the proposed cell phone ban in schools. “If I hear another TikTok challenge where they are destroying the bathroom, making noises in class, chirping like birds, I go insane, and I can’t take it anymore.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But she said she understands some circumstances in which a child needs a cell phone including for health reasons. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last Thursday’s listening session was the first of several seeking public input on the future cell phone-free policies and procedures, which school boards must adopt by Jan. 1, 2025, or before. Some of Virginia’s school boards have already begun banning or restricting cell phone use in schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The initiative is spearheaded by the Virginia Department of Education, the Departments of Health, and Health and Human Services as part of Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s executive order signed earlier this month that requires the departments to create guidelines to limit students’ time in front of “addictive” cell phones and eliminate “clear distractions” in the classroom. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Democrats also </span><a href="https://x.com/ssurovell/status/1811120474275074425" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on July 10 the creation of a Senate Democratic workgroup on school mobile phone policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many said teacher input on the forthcoming policies is vital to eliminating distractions at a time when questions are circulating about the use of technology in schools and artificial intelligence’s impact on learning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I certainly am not opposed to a ban. I just think it&#8217;s a bandaid for a much bigger issue that we have in public education that speaks to so many things about how we&#8217;re able to hire amazing teachers and retain them,” Del. Laura Cohen, D-Fairfax, a former preschool teacher and school board member.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The benefits: technology tools, expanded internet access</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While cell phones are often considered a distraction for students, researchers and professors say they also have their share of benefits and tools that can help with students’ studies, like language translators, rulers and calculators. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There&#8217;s reasons we should be concerned about cell phones as distractions to learning, but they&#8217;re also very powerful learning tools potentially, you know, their access to information,” said Jesse Senechal, executive director for the </span><a href="https://soe.vcu.edu/centers/-institute-for-collaborative-research-and-evaluation/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Institute for Collaborative Research and Evaluation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the School of Education at Virginia Commonwealth University.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senechal said that cell phones offer support in some cases when schools have a limited number of computers and internet access. He said policies could also create broader equity issues in how marginalized students are disciplined in contrast to socio-economic privileged students. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leon Rouson, a professor in the School of Education at Norfolk State University, said the phones also allow students to do research without a computer or laptop, which is helpful for high school students he assists in preparing for college during the summer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If we say ‘no cell phones, ‘get rid of them,’ ‘throw them out,’ ‘they should not exist’ — I think we would also be creating some disconnection,” Rouson said.</span></p>
<p><b>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The challenges: Enforcement questions, negative impacts on some learners</h4>

	 </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teachers have also questioned who will enforce cell phone restrictions. Some are worried that the restrictions will create additional responsibilities for teachers and contribute to further burnout.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022, a Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission study found that increased workloads and behavioral and mental health issues among students were some of the factors leading teachers to leave the career field.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers also found that teachers were dissatisfied with the lack of respect from parents and the public.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="vA7XB2lVXo"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/11/07/virginia-report-shows-more-teachers-leaving-the-workforce-than-entering-it/">Virginia report shows more teachers leaving the workforce than entering it</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia report shows more teachers leaving the workforce than entering it&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/11/07/virginia-report-shows-more-teachers-leaving-the-workforce-than-entering-it/embed/#?secret=aK3MnJNXKg#?secret=vA7XB2lVXo" data-secret="vA7XB2lVXo" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If students are simply told not to have cell phones out during class, then teachers become the cell phone police,” said Nancy Bradley, a Salem City School Board member and associate director for the Office of Academic Programs at Virginia Tech. “As they are trying to teach, they are also trying to monitor which students are on their cell phone and asking that they put the cell phones away or taking the cell phones from these students. It is not a productive use of instructional time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While studying teacher burnout and their well-being, Tim Pressley, associate professor in the Department of Psychology at Christopher Newport University, found that student behavior has “drastically changed” since returning to in-person learning due to the pandemic. Further research found that students relied heavily on their phones, scrolling through social media and talking through classroom lessons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Technology is kind of just getting out of hand with students using it,” Pressley said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Critics are concerned that parents’ and students’ anxieties about special learners’ needs and gun violence in schools will increase if policies restrict cell phones in schools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cohen raised similar concerns after an unsuccessful </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB28" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cell phone bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was returned to the House Education Committee for review in March. She said the bill could have negatively impacted English Language Learners and students with disabilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill would have empowered local boards to prohibit cell phones and other “handheld communication devices” such as Chromebooks, which can be used to message other students during class.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to make sure … that we are not doing anything to stigmatize or not support our students with disabilities,” Cohen said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cohen said another common reason parents want their children to have their cell phones is in case of a school emergency, such as a school shooting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public alarm about gun violence in Virginia schools was heightened after a then-six-year-old student brought a firearm from home to his Newport News elementary school and shot his teacher. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Providing assurance to parents that even if their child doesn’t have their cell phone on them during the school day, that they will receive communication from the school regarding emergency situations, is an important component to get them to buy into the changes to cell phone policies,” Bradley said. “I do think that’s probably going to be one of the tougher hurdles to overcome.”</span></p>

<p>A three-judge panel of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals <a href="https://www.ag.ky.gov/Press%20Release%20Attachments/DN%2041%20Order%20Denying%20Partial%20Stay.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agreed Wednesday </a>to block the rules from taking effect Aug. 1, shortly before most schools begin their academic year. The rules, created by the U.S. Department of Education, were aimed at protecting students from discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation.</p>
<p>Chief Judge Jeffrey Sutton wrote in the majority opinion that all judges on the panel agreed the central parts of the rules should not take effect on Aug. 1.</p>
<p>“It is hard to see how all of the schools covered by Title IX could comply with this wide swath of new obligations if the Rule’s definition of sex discrimination remains enjoined,” Sutton said. “Harder still, we question how the schools could properly train their teachers on compliance in this unusual setting with so little time before the start of the new school year.”</p>
<p>Judge Andre Mathis wrote in a dissenting opinion that he would grant a partial stay, as requested by the Department of Education. “I am cognizant of Plaintiffs’ argument that the benefits of enacting the Rule’s unchallenged provisions are outweighed by the expense or confusion of phased implementation,” Mathis wrote. “But most of the expense is attributable to provisions that Plaintiffs neither directly challenge nor cite as a source of harm.”</p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed by Republican attorneys general in six states — Kentucky, Virginia, Indiana, Ohio, Tennessee and West Virginia.</p>
<p>Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman said in a statement that Title IX, which was established more than 50 years ago, “created equal opportunities for women and young girls in the classroom and on the field.” The Sixth Circuit ruling, he added, made it the first appellate court “to stop President Biden’s blatant assault on these fundamental protections.”</p>
<p>“This ruling is a victory for common sense itself, and it’s a major relief for Kentucky families,” Coleman said. “As Attorney General and as a Dad, we’ll keep up the fight for my girls and for women across Kentucky so they can continue to fulfill their potential for the next 50 years and beyond.”</p>
<p>In June, <a href="https://kentuckylantern.com/2024/06/17/us-judge-in-kentucky-blocks-biden-title-ix-rules-says-sex-gender-identity-not-the-same-thing/" target="_blank">Chief Judge Danny Reeves</a> of the U.S. District Court in Eastern Kentucky sided with Coleman and the other five GOP attorneys general. The judge said the Department of Education “seeks to derail deeply rooted law” with its proposed Title IX rules.</p>
<p>“At bottom, the Department would turn Title IX on its head by redefining ‘sex’ to include ‘gender identity.’ But ‘sex’ and ‘gender identity’ do not mean the same thing,” Reeves wrote. “The Department’s interpretation conflicts with the plain language of Title IX and therefore exceeds its authority to promulgate regulations under that statute.”</p>
<p>Established in 1972, <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/tix_dis.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Title IX</a> was created to prevent “discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities that receive federal financial assistance,” according to the Department of Education.</p>
<p>The Biden administration introduced the rules to “build on the legacy of Title IX by clarifying that all our nation’s students can access schools that are safe, welcoming, and respect their rights,” U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona previously said in a statement. The rules also <a href="https://kentuckylantern.com/2024/04/19/biden-administration-to-roll-back-the-betsy-devos-title-ix-rules/" target="_blank">would have rolled back Trump administration changes</a> that narrowly defined sexual harassment and directed schools to conduct live hearings, allowing those who were accused of sexual harassment or assault to cross-examine their accusers.</p>
<p>The Lantern has sought comment from the U.S. Department of Education on the latest ruling.</p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislators met on Thursday and</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?242+sum+SB6012" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">passed bills</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to repeal changes to a college financial aid program for military veterans’ families and designate $90 million towards sustaining it for at least the next two years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Military Survivors and Dependents Education Program (VMSDEP) provides education benefits to children and spouses of severely injured or killed veterans. Amid the rising costs of the program in recent years, an effort to downsize it appeared in the state budget that lawmakers passed and Youngkin signed earlier this summer. That move was met with swift pushback from military families, who called for the changes to be reversed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A point of contention throughout the summer has been who should take the credit — or blame — for the changes, as lawmakers met several times attempting to resolve matters. Members from both parties have acknowledged a desire to fix what several deemed a “mistake,” and to study the matter further. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Clearly, we did this in the budget and quite a few of us didn’t understand the implications,” Sen. Richard Stuart, R-King George, said during a Senate Finance and Appropriations Committee meeting earlier in the day. “We are trying to fix it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter military spouse Kayla Owen, who’s prodded lawmakers all summer to protect the program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During public comment at the committee meeting, military spouse Kayla Owen — who has prodded lawmakers all summer to protect the program —  said that she didn’t feel like the day’s proceedings should be something legislators should pat themselves on the back too much for. While speaking to the committee, she urged lawmakers to stop “sneaking contentious or highly controversial legislation through the budget.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The statement gave Stuart and Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, pause; they both asked Owen if she’d rather they leave and not pass the bill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both in a rebuttal to Owen and in an interview with media after the committee meeting, Lucas stressed that the changes to the program originally stemmed from the governor’s administration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nothing was tucked into my budget,” Lucas said. “The bill came out of the governor&#8217;s office. So I just want to make sure I cleared that up.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Curious about details leading up to the now-repealed changes to the program, Owen has sought internal communications from the governor’s office for insights into how the changes came about in the first place. Despite being a member of a task force Gov. Glenn Youngkin created to study the program and its future sustainability, Owen’s </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/05/youngkin-administration-denies-foia-request-from-member-of-own-task-force/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freedom of Information Act request was denied.</span></a></p>

<p>After the legislature&#8217;s actions, Youngkin signed the bills and said in a statement he and lawmakers &#8220;took the necessary step to reverse and fully repeal changes to VMSDEP and provided significant new funding for the program. We will continue our work to make Virginia the best place for our military, veterans, first responders and their families to live, work, raise a family, and retire.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond the bills passed Thursday to continue funding the program for two years, Virginia’s Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission will conduct a study and Youngkin’s task force will analyze the program, as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Owen said she hopes the situation will encourage lawmakers to stop using the budget to legislate, as changes to VMSDEP done through a standalone bill originally would have been able to undergo a robust committee process. She suggested that the original VMSDEP changes were made “under the cloak of darkness.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Everybody’s blaming each other and it’s like that Hamilton song ‘Room Where It Happens’— nobody else is in the room where it happens!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the matter resolved for now, lawmakers will have their eyes on the various groups that are analyzing VMSDEP. As the costs of the program rise, Lucas stressed that lawmakers need to figure out how to make sure it can last for future generations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[The passage of bills on Thursday] will allow us to have a solution while we await results from the JLARC study and other groups to ensure that the program is sustainable in the long term,” Lucas said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the legislature reconvenes for its 2025 session, it could take up adjustments to the program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Owen, who has spearheaded military families’ advocacy for keeping the program, she said Thursday’s actions are “a sigh of relief until January.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If successful, the case could strengthen the reformed transgender student school policies adopted by Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration, requiring </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/09/16/youngkin-administration-overhauls-virginia-transgender-student-policies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">parental approval</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for any changes to students’ “names, nicknames, and/or pronouns.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Wisconsin, a group of parents attempted to overturn in court a school division’s decision to implement guidelines allowing students to change their gender identity at school without parental consent or notification. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After two </span><a href="https://www.wpr.org/news/eau-claire-parents-ask-us-supreme-court-to-strike-down-school-district-gender-support-plan" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unsuccessful tries</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the parents filed a suit in the Supreme Court.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Parents have the right to be involved in major decisions affecting their children&#8217;s lives. This case presents an opportunity for the U.S. Supreme Court to provide much-needed clarity and reaffirm that government officials cannot override parents’ fundamental rights simply because they believe they know better,” said Miyares in a July 8 statement. “It is essential that schools work with parents, not against them, to support a child’s wellbeing.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not all schools in Virginia have supported the revised policies. The state’s revised transgender student policies haven’t been embraced by all school districts in the state. The Virginia Department of Education was facing </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/aclu-sues-virginia-department-of-education-over-transgender-policies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two lawsuits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — stemming from Hanover and York Counties — over the policy changes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, the York County Circuit Court accepted the VDOE&#8217;s pleas in bar and dismissed the one case. The second case in Hanover was continued to Aug. 20.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breanna Diaz, policy and legislative counsel for the ACLU of Virginia, which promotes and defends citizens’ civil liberties and rights, said the lower court in Wisconsin has already ruled that the parents did not experience any actual injury from the decision, compared to the transgender and nonbinary students in Virginia who alleged they experienced “real harm” and “actual discrimination” due to the revised policies in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February, the ACLU of Virginia announced that it and law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, LLP are representing two transgender students in the counties of </span><a href="https://www.acluva.org/sites/default/files/field_documents/hanover_model_policies_complaint.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hanover</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.acluva.org/sites/default/files/field_documents/final_york_county_complaint_w._verification_1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">York</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who are challenging the department’s policies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The reality is that what a few parents want doesn’t always match school policies designed to accommodate all families,” Diaz said in a statement. “Parents who opt for public schools are signing up for a system that must serve entire communities, and although parents can opt out of public schools by choosing private schools or homeschooling, they can’t remake public schools to match their individual preferences.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adults and Virginia schools must put pupils first by affirming all students, Diaz continued. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia’s leaders should focus on making Virginia schools safe for students of all gender identities, starting by rescinding the policies that have already harmed so many Virginia families.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a school that’s distinct from the general population of students – and possibly in a separate building altogether. Keep the enrollment to no more than about 30 students at a time. Invite hospitals, colleges and other institutions to share their expertise and resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another thing: “People often forget they are schools,” said Finch, a professor at Vanderbilt University and a co-founder of the</span><a href="https://recoveryschools.org/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Association of Recovery Schools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a nonprofit group based in Pennsylvania. Students are “working on high school diplomas, credits, preparing for college, the workforce. … A best practice is they have to provide a solid academic curriculum.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opening such specialized schools is a serious, possibly expensive project. However, it’s one that educational officials should undertake if they plan smartly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">School divisions and their larger communities are helping to rehabilitate young people at a critical time in their lives – and these academies might make the difference in keeping students clean. Costs shouldn’t be ignored; neither should the fact these schools fight alcohol and drug abuse among teenagers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Beach School Board members are weighing such an initiative, and they’ve already identified some public funding. They are leading an effort that could comprise public school students in Virginia Beach, Chesapeake, Norfolk, Portsmouth and Suffolk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carolyn Weems, a longtime Virginia Beach School Board member, is a key proponent. It’s also very personal to her, since Weems lost her</span><a href="https://www.wtkr.com/investigations/lawmakers-discussing-recovery-high-school-in-hampton-roads" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">21-year-old daughter Caitlyn to a drug overdose in 2013</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While in high school, Caitlyn Weems had a soccer injury; she broke her nose and lost three teeth. She became addicted to pain medicine and had taken Oxycontin and Percocet at various times, the elder Weems told me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s unbelievable how much medicine she was on,” Weems said, noting much of it was prescribed by doctors. “It was so hard to get her help.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The General Assembly approved $750,000 over two years for a recovery academy in the region. Virginia Beach also has committed $500,000</span><a href="https://www.wavy.com/news/virginia/virginia-to-receive-over-16m-in-juul-agreement/?fbclid=IwY2xjawD7e19leHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHaSycTRJO3nwIkUi2uMO0dfR5AzRoJJ1s6FeRN31-zaKN9_MS1zTXcWdvg_aem_qt2gQQDtO9qafWGe2jSQDQ" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">from the state settlement with JUUL, the e-cigarette brand</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, involving the firm’s marketing and sales practices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other details about the proposed academy, though, haven’t been decided. They include how much money each city would contribute; where the academy would be located; and how transportation would be worked out.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2024/1/HB30/Introduced/CR/124/13c/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loudoun County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is also considering a recovery high school.</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/07/05/virginia-prepares-to-launch-its-first-recovery-high-school/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Such schools have been around for decades</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, though they’ve generally been clustered in about half of the states. The academies often do random drug testing to ensure the students adhere to the rules.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://drugabusestatistics.org/teen-drug-use/#virginia" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Center for Drug Abuse Statistics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reports that 9% of all 12- to 17-year-olds in Virginia used alcohol in the past month, and 7% of the age group reported using drugs. One bright spot: Teenagers in the commonwealth were 16.5% less likely to have used drugs in the past month than the average American teen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hampton Roads’ developing plan will study the</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C56ivS1e9uE&amp;t=11s" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Chesterfield Recovery Academy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a possible model. The academy opened in August 2022,  and is a regional effort headed by Chesterfield Public Schools. It’s the first recovery school in the state, and Chesterfield’s is one of about 45 such schools nationwide. The General Assembly contributed</span><a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2023/RD671/PDF" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly $1.4 million to help start the Chesterfield academy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A recovery school is a good asset for any school division,” Justin Savoy, Chesterfield academy program coordinator, told me. “Unfortunately, the ease of access to drugs and alcohol has increased a lot for students.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The school takes up to 50 students but often has just 20, said Savoy, whose professional background is in mental health and substance abuse. The staff includes two academic facilitators, three clinicians and a peer recovery specialist, who is someone often maintaining sobriety. A white retriever named Lettie, a therapy dog, is part of the staff and encourages calm. Enrollment requires students to have abstained from drugs and alcohol for at least 20 days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This past spring, 10 students graduated, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Savoy and two of his students participated in a White House panel on recovery strategies in 2023. “There’s a lot of times when my recovery was impossible,”</span><a href="http://www.youtube.com/live/KZfZiB-WDQ8?si=yojbLf3uIIgXVSJe" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Spain told the audience</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “I spent the time. I put in the work.” He said he was scheduled to join the military this year, to the cheers of attendees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Durchslag is director of the</span><a href="https://mtcs.org/pease/about/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">P.E.A.S.E. Academy in Minneapolis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and he’s been at the recovery school since 1995. “Many of the schools operate on a shoestring budget,” he told me, but added, “they are needed resources.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nor are they panaceas. Some students, Durchslag said, would be better treated in other settings that offer different services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What they represent is hope, for students and parents alike. That a teen might kick the habit and stay that way. That he’ll have support when he thinks about backsliding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That kind of school “would have been perfect for Caitlyn,” said Weems, the school board member.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s worth the effort to begin the academy, she added. “The things we’re doing now aren’t working.” </span></p>

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. House on Thursday passed a measure to reverse an Education Department rule seeking to extend federal discrimination protections for LGBTQ students, though President Joe Biden has vowed to veto the legislation should it land on his desk.</p>
<p>House passage of the resolution on a party-line vote, <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2024354?Page=2" target="_blank">210-205</a>, is part of a barrage of GOP pushback at the state and federal levels to the <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/house-speaker-johnson-betsy-devos-lead-attack-title-ix-rule-protects-lgbtq-kids" target="_blank">Biden administration’s final rule for Title IX</a> since its April release. For all schools that receive federal funding, the rule protects against discrimination for students based on “sex stereotypes, sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex characteristics.”</p>
<p>Twenty-six states with GOP attorneys general have <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/more-half-states-sue-block-biden-title-ix-rule-protecting-lgbtq-students" target="_blank">sued to block</a> the rule, and courts have temporarily blocked it from going into effect in 14 states on August 1.</p>
<p>The 14 states with temporary blocks are: Alaska, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, Ohio, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming.</p>
<p>Illinois GOP Rep. Mary Miller <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-title-ix-regulation-targeted-republicans-congress" target="_blank">introduced the legislation</a> in early June. A week later, the Republican-controlled House Committee on Education and the Workforce approved it. Miller’s resolution seeks to reverse the rule through the <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF10023" target="_blank">Congressional Review Act</a>, a procedural tool Congress can use to overturn certain actions from federal agencies.</p>
<p>In the Senate, Mississippi Republican Cindy Hyde-Smith <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-joint-resolution/96" target="_blank">also introduced legislation</a> in June to try to block the final rule under the same tool. The Senate version has gathered over 30 Republican cosponsors.</p>
<p>Rep. Virginia Foxx — chairwoman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce and a fierce opponent of the administration’s final rule — said during the floor debate Wednesday that she wanted to preserve Title IX, which helped equalize funding for women’s sports and education programs beginning in 1972.</p>
<p>“Title IX ushered in a golden era for women’s competition and education,” the North Carolina Republican said. “There is sanctity in the community and tradition of these memories, these spaces and these opportunities for young girls.”</p>
<p>Regardless of whether the attempt to roll back the measure is successful in the Democratic-controlled Senate, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SAP-HJRes-165.pdf" target="_blank">Biden</a>’s veto threat leaves virtually no possibility it could be adopted this year.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Democrats, LGBTQ advocates in opposition </h4>

	
<p>Democrats and LGBTQ advocates have described the effort to overturn the rule as motivated by misinformation and fear.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, this resolution has been clouded by misinformation, unfounded fears and with some, just hatred of transgender individuals,” said Rep. Bobby Scott, a Virginia Democrat and ranking member of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, during the debate.</p>
<p>Oregon’s Rep. Suzanne Bonamici — ranking member of the House Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education — said the resolution was “another attempt to undercut this administration’s efforts to empower survivors and protect all Americans from discrimination.”</p>
<p>“If Republicans truly cared about protecting women and children, they would stop this prejudiced rhetoric and take action on bills that would actually protect women from discrimination and harassment and defend women’s reproductive health care, make child care more affordable, preserve opportunities in workplaces for all parents, especially women,” Bonamici said.</p>
<p>Scott called on the House to “reject these narratives and focus on real issues of safety and equity.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Final rule blocked in more states </h4>

	
<p>Meanwhile, challenges to the rule are playing out in a handful of federal courts.</p>
<p>Last week, Judge John Broomes of the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas temporarily blocked the measure from taking effect in the Sunflower State, along with Alaska, Utah and Wyoming.</p>
<p>Broomes also halted the rule from taking effect in “the schools attended by the members of Young America’s Foundation or Female Athletes United, as well as the schools attended by the children of the members of Moms for Liberty,” all groups that sued alongside the four states, per the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ksd.152561/gov.uscourts.ksd.152561.53.0.pdf" target="_blank">order</a>.</p>
<p>Under Broomes’ order, the rule is also halted in an Oklahoma public school attended by a minor who is one of the plaintiffs.</p>
<p>In June, U.S. District Judge Terry Doughty of Louisiana <a href="https://lailluminator.com/2024/06/13/title-ix-transgender/" target="_blank">issued a temporary injunction</a> barring the final rule from taking effect there, along with Idaho, Mississippi and Montana.</p>
<p>In Kentucky federal court, Chief Judge Danny Reeves <a href="https://kentuckylantern.com/2024/06/17/us-judge-in-kentucky-blocks-biden-title-ix-rules-says-sex-gender-identity-not-the-same-thing/" target="_blank">temporarily blocked the final rule</a> in the Bluegrass State, plus Tennessee, Ohio, Indiana, West Virginia and Virginia. Reeves rejected the department’s request for a partial stay of the injunction while its appeal plays out, per a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.kyed.104801/gov.uscourts.kyed.104801.117.0.pdf" target="_blank">Wednesday court filing</a>.</p>
<p>The Education Department has confirmed it is appealing the other two rulings but did not have an update Wednesday on whether it is filing a notice of appeal on the most recent ruling in the Kansas federal court.</p>
<p>The spokesperson reiterated earlier this week that the agency has “asked the trial courts to allow the bulk of the final rule to take effect in these states as scheduled, on August 1, while the appeals are pending.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">LGBTQ advocacy groups push back on GOP effort</h4>

	
<p>Allen Morris, policy director for the advocacy group National LGBTQ Task Force, said the vote was part of a pattern of anti-LGBTQ policy measures.</p>
<p>“When you look at the rise in hatred and the rise in violence and the rise of young LGBTQ individuals not having the support that they need, where suicide rates are high, it is disappointing to see our opposition go against us with such a high level of intention,” he said.</p>
<p>Morris told States Newsroom that “a lot of what is happening with this extremism is not founded in truth.”</p>
<p>“It is founded in ways to spew hate and to spew fear. It is a lot of fear mongering, and it’s anything to make people feel like their backs are up against the wall, or as if they don’t have the power,” he said.</p>
<p>Echoing a previous statement, a spokesperson for the Department of Education said it “does not comment on pending legislation” and emphasized that all schools receiving federal funding are obligated to comply with the new regulations as a condition of receiving those funds.</p>
<p>The department has yet to finalize a separate rule establishing new criteria for transgender athletes.</p>

(Courtesy of SDI Productions via Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia will soon establish guidance to restrict or eliminate student cell phone use during instructional time at school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, Gov. Glenn Youngkin issued Executive Order 33, which directs his administration to “heed the call” of parents, public health professionals, educators and others by establishing cell phone-free policies and procedures for school divisions, in light of growing concerns over children’s health and declines in academic performance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Education, in collaboration with the Departments of Health and Health and Human Services, must clearly define what “cell phone-free education” means, and publish model plans and draft guidance on implementing </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/programs-services/school-operations-support-services/cell-phone-free-education-in-virginia-k-12-public-schools" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cell phone-free education</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Virginia’s K-12 schools on its website by Aug. 15, according to the governor’s directive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The directive will establish “the clear goal to protect the health and safety of our students by limiting the amount of time they are exposed to “addictive” cell phones and social media and eliminating “clear distractions” in the classroom, Youngkin said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor added that $500,000 in existing funds allocated to the Departments of Education and Behavioral Health and Development Services will be made available to implement the initiative. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the governor’s office, the funds will support state and local efforts to facilitate family nights and community engagement events to combat youth mental health challenges, and provide microgrants for school divisions to help implement cell phone best practices in their communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the policies’ development, the departments will be required to hold listening sessions seeking public input on “age-appropriate cell phone-free education policies and procedures, gather feedback on best practices currently underway in Virginia public schools, and receive input for the draft guidance,” the governor’s executive order reads. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The departments are slated to release the final guidance by Sept. 16 of this year. The order directs school boards to adopt the policies by Jan. 1, 2025, or before. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s order cites American Psychological Association </span><a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2024/04/teen-social-use-mental-health" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that suggests adolescents who spend over three hours on social media daily have double the risk of poor mental health. The order also references studies showing that children spend about 4.8 hours a day on social media, and that students who use their phones during class learn less and earn lower grades. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Therefore, creating a cell phone-free education environment in public schools is not only a prudent measure but an essential one to promote a healthier and more focused educational environment where every child is free to learn,” Youngkin directive states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of Virginia’s school boards have already begun banning or restricting cell phone use in schools. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB28" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> empowering local boards to institute such prohibitions on cellphones and other “handheld communication devices” during regular school hours died last session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">James Fedderman, president of the Virginia Education Association, said in a statement that the organization recognizes the mounting worries over how cell phones impact students in classrooms and thinks it&#8217;s “essential” to approach the issue with “a nuanced perspective that considers the real-world needs of our students and teachers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fedderman, whose organization is the largest educator advocacy group in the state, went on to urge the Virginia Department of Education to engage with educators to develop balanced guidelines “that support effective teaching and learning while also addressing legitimate concerns about distractions.”</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bryan Viera, who arrived in America unaccompanied, and Millie Okoro, who arrived with family, migrated from different countries to the U.S. as teenagers, both to make a better life for themselves and to make their mothers proud. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They enrolled in and graduated from public high schools in Virginia, leaning heavily on the support of a few counselors, teachers and groups that work with migrant youth to attain their educational goals. Now young adults, Viera and Okoro’s journeys reflect that of thousands of youth the American government has released from federal custody to sponsors in Virginia over the past decade. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Migrant children are supported by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services&#8217; </span><a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/about/what-we-do" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is responsible for providing asylum seekers, including unaccompanied children, with equitable, high-quality services and resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the agency’s duties, the office is responsible for supporting unaccompanied children until it can release them into safe settings with sponsors, who are commonly family members, until their immigration proceedings.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">From October 2014 to April of this year, the agency <a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/grant-funding/unaccompanied-children-released-sponsors-state" target="_blank">reports</a> 33,812 unaccompanied children have been released to a sponsor’s care in Virginia.  </span><a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/grant-funding/unaccompanied-children-released-sponsors-state" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ranked eighth with the most children released in other states. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A federal law requires the commonwealth to provide all children, including migrants, “equal access” to a public education, regardless of their or their parents’ actual or perceived national origin, citizenship, or immigration status. This means migrant children may be navigating the same challenges Virginia-born children are facing, as the state grapples with declining assessment scores, striking policy issues and troubling student absences. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leaders and media reports have also questioned the disappearances of migrant children in the U.S. and Virginia, youth who are from predominantly Spanish-speaking countries including Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. As of June 28, a total of 41 migrant youth have been reported missing from the Town of Culpeper, with Hispanic people representing the second largest portion of the residents.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What happens when migrant kids arrive in America, alone?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ORR assists in finding a sponsor or family member to take care of children who arrive in America without their parents. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to ORR, the office was created as part of the Refugee Act of 1980 to support refugees, unaccompanied refugee minors, and Cuban and Haitian entrants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its establishment, Congress has expanded the office’s services to meet demands for asylum seekers, refugees, survivors of torture, unaccompanied minors, and victims of trafficking. The search for a sponsor can sometimes span the U.S. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

    </div>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Children who arrive to the U.S. without parents entered a sponsor’s care in </span><a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/grant-funding/unaccompanied-children-released-sponsors-county" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">14 Virginia localities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Oct. 2023 to April 2024, including Loudoun, Arlington, Prince William and Fairfax Counties in Northern Virginia, the city of Roanoke in the Southwest region of the state, Norfolk in Hampton Roads, and central Virginia’s Chesterfield and Henrico Counties, as well as the capital city of Richmond. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nationally, unaccompanied children were in the ORR’s care for an average of 27 days in 2023, which is the lowest annual average length of care per child since 2015.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A New York Times’ review of 2023 ORR data found 42% of unaccompanied children nationwide were released to a parent or guardian; in Virginia, 46% were. </span></p>
	<div class="newsroomSidebarContainer ">
	<div class="newsroomSidebar">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sponsorship candidates undergo a screening process to determine if they’re able to provide for a migrant child’s physical and mental well-being. ORR is also responsible for determining whether the candidates have engaged in any activity that would be a </span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/georgia-news/advocates-worry-about-unaccompanied-minor-surge-in-georgia/EIEBPS5PEFEIZJTGWYHTPNZIMI/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">potential risk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the child. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regarding legal requirements, sponsors sign the </span><a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/policy-guidance/unaccompanied-children-program-policy-guide-section-2#2.8.1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sponsor Care Agreement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to ensure the child is present at all future immigration proceedings and that, if an immigration judge issues a removal or voluntary departure order, they report to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, for removal from the United States.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The duties of the sponsor also include enrolling the child in school and ensuring their attendance, following the requirements of the state in which they live and otherwise supporting their academic success, the agreement reads.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ORR has organized with </span><a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/contact-information/state-virginia-programs-and-services-locality" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">partners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Virginia to assist with resources including churches and social service groups. Virginia also provides </span><a href="https://www.dss.virginia.gov/community/ona/refugee_services.cgi" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through the Department of Social Services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to ORR, the agency has no legal authority to compel children released or their sponsors to respond to inquiries or participate in such services that involve assistance with school enrollment or attendance and connecting the child or their sponsor to community-based resources suitable to their needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s congressional lawmakers, including U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, have sought to improve operations around releasing unaccompanied minors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April, Griffith filed </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/uploadedfiles/rep._griffith_unaccompanied_minor_placement_notification_act.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requiring HHS to provide advanced notification to school districts and child welfare agencies when a minor is placed in their respective jurisdiction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unaccompanied minors are crossing our southern border in record droves,” said Griffith, in an April statement. “ORR currently fails to notify any school district or child welfare agency if an unaccompanied minor is placed in a home, leading to issues of illegal child labor and abuse. The Unaccompanied Minor Placement Notification Act changes this HHS policy and it will give some protection to minors from exploitation.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">State policy seeks to address absenteeism, language barriers to learning</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia lawmakers and school divisions have attempted to both support children who speak English as a second language — some of whom migrated to the country on their own — and tackle chronic absenteeism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like other states, the commonwealth has been dealing with a troubling trend of chronic absenteeism, or students missing at least 18 days of instruction for any reason, including excused and unexcused absences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okoro, who attended high school virtually for almost two years, said she wished she could’ve gone in-person sooner, but her family was concerned regarding her immigration status. But in 2023, her last high school year, she decided to go in-person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Everything was happening so fast at the same time, and I wanted to get a lot of stuff [done], but I wasn&#8217;t really aware of my situation,” Okoro said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said she was oblivious to preparing for college until she arrived and met with her college counselor, the Dream Project — a group that empowers immigrant students who face barriers to their education through mentoring and offering scholarships — and even a member of custodial staff, who spoke her second language, Spanish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Viera added that the language barrier made it extremely difficult for him and other Spanish speaking students to follow classes. Later in his high school career, Viera said he started to recognize some of the gaps schools had in helping and encouraging migrant youth, including training staff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said he believes the lack of support for students who don’t speak English could be one of the reasons students are deterred from staying in school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They just didn&#8217;t know what to do with me, they didn&#8217;t know how to help me and I could see some of them felt really bad about not being able to, but it&#8217;s part of the lack of training that the [schools] give to the staff at the schools,” Viera said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the keys to their success to finishing high school in Virginia and enrolling in college was their attendance at Virginia’s public schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I just knew that if I needed help, I feel like education would have been … the first place to look for and so I tried as much as I could to limit the amount of absences I had, and if I had any absences, it was for a good reason,” said Okoro.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Viera said he’s uncertain where he would be if he didn’t show up to class, stayed after school or accepted volunteer opportunities. He recently graduated from college and is working in the technology industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I feel like if I didn&#8217;t attend school as often, if I missed class, I feel like I wouldn’t have achieved or accomplished the grades that I had … [or earned] the scholarships that I [received],” Viera said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a survey by the Virginia Association of School Superintendents, Virginia’s chronic absenteeism rate was more than four times higher during the 2022-2023 school year than pre-pandemic. Approximately a quarter of the 85 school divisions surveyed had a chronic absenteeism rate of over 25%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, Virginia education leaders launched a </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/teaching-learning-assessment/all-in-va/attendance-matters/chronic-absenteeism-task-force" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">task force</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to address students&#8217; disappearance from the classroom and incorporated Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s “</span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2023/september/name-1013658-en.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ALL IN VA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” plan to combat the learning loss during the pandemic through “high-intensity tutoring” and promoting school attendance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Superintendent of Public Instruction Lisa Coons said transportation, food and housing challenges can be factors for children missing school. Children may also be deterred from school because they are behind their class in learning, and may need mental health support, problems Coons said the state is working to correct as they try to educate caretakers on the resources available to students and the importance of being in school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to make sure that our students are in school because we know that&#8217;s the best place for them,” Coons said. “We know they access their learning and their experiences and their relationships with their peers and the adults in the school community, but it also provides support for some of those barriers that are hurting or causing students to not be able to be engaged as successfully and well in their education.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the last session, the General Assembly </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/get/budget/4972/SB6002/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">agreed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to appropriate $72.1 million over the next two years to expand and provide targeted support for English learner students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“English Learner students are one of the fastest growing segments of the student population, and their needs also vary greatly depending on their prior education experiences and English acquisition,” said House Education Chairman Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke, during a February House Appropriations Committee hearing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, and Del. Michelle Malando, D-Prince William, carried successful legislation revising the state code to require that state funding support ratios of instructional positions for English language learner students based on each student’s proficiency level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The budget includes language that directs the Department of Education to enter into statewide contracts for mental health providers for public school students and attendance recovery services for “disengaged, chronically absent or struggling students.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Language was also added to the budget requiring schools that receive state funding for the “After-the-Bell” breakfast program to report their chronic absenteeism rates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Northern Virginia, Edu-Futuro, an nonprofit organization focused on empowering immigrant and underserved youth and families through education and workforce development, has helped to address chronic absenteeism among Latino youth and English Learner students by forming an outreach team tasked with contacting hard-to-reach students and their families, and working to return chronically absent youth to the classroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the team’s first year in the 2022-2023 school year, Edu-Futuro returned 62% of the 273 children referred to them to the classroom in Fairfax County.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Through working directly with hundreds of families, our outreach team has found that students often don&#8217;t want to abandon their studies,” said the organization in a </span><a href="https://edu-futuro.org/about-us/#" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2022-2023</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> annual report. “They need encouragement and concrete help to address the underlying challenges that led to their absenteeism, such as financial struggles, mental health issues, or family crises that require the support of government or nonprofit partners.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Alfonso Lopez, D-Arlington, </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2024/1/HB30/Introduced/MR/124/46h/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the state appropriate $400,000 over the next two years to help Edu-Futuro expand its services to help reduce chronic absenteeism at public schools in Northern Virginia. The provision was not included in the state budget. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislation carried by Sen. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB619" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Todd Pillion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, R-Washington, to address chronic absenteeism was continued to next year. The companion bill carried by Del. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB767" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Israel O’Quinn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, R-Washington, which was left in the House, would have added the definition of “educational neglect” into state law and required school staff to report to authorities if a parent’s child is not attending school regularly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Karen Vallejos Corrales, executive director of the Dream Project, said she hopes lawmakers will continue to support and invest in counselors and parent liaisons to help migrant youth when they arrive. </span></p>

<p><b>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Continuing challenges: Many migrant children disappear and others work dangerous jobs</h4>

	 </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 85,000 migrant children have been </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/25/us/unaccompanied-migrant-child-workers-exploitation.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> missing, some of whom have later been found </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/exclusive-hyundai-subsidiary-has-used-child-labor-alabama-factory-2022-07-22/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">working</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> dangerous jobs including in some </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/12/14/us/roofing-children-immigrants.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hazardous</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> environments. These same problems can be a cause for concern after children are released from ORR’s purview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Culpeper Police Department Sgt. Norma McGuckin, who has leading efforts to find dozens of missing migrant children, said the area is known among the Hispanic community as a good place to find steady landscaping work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuckin said one of the most surprising takeaways from her investigations is that out of the 41 children who have disappeared from Culpeper, only a handful of children are enrolled in school. Culpeper Police Department keeps an </span><a href="https://crimewatch.net/us/va/culpeper-county/culpeper-pd/cases/current" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online record</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of missing children.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sponsors McGuckin has worked with in prior investigations are frustrated when children disappear, yet afraid of reporting the children out of fear they will be returned to their home country. She added some of the older children also have a sense of responsibility to support their families back home financially, so they’re more focused on finding work than studying schoolbooks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They do want to do the right thing and they do want to help these children to succeed in this country the best way that they can provide them help with, but unfortunately … the child already has this plan in mind when they come in across the border that they came here for work,” McGuckin said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares has called the situation “a serious emergency that is being ignored by the federal government.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Vulnerable unaccompanied minors are being dropped off in our cities and counties, and local social services and law enforcement agencies have no idea,” Miyares said in a February statement after writing a </span><a href="https://files.constantcontact.com/d3e83e11901/2527d423-ec6a-485e-a840-74241dfafe2e.pdf?rdr=true" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the White House about the problem. “How can they protect and check in on children they don’t know are there? We must advance federal, state, and local collaboration in the face of this unprecedented, horrifying crisis. No child should experience the uncertainty and vulnerability that these children are facing.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in February, the Office of the Inspector General published a </span><a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/OEI-07-21-00250.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that found gaps in ORR’s screening and follow-up process with sponsors. The office reviewed the ORR’s processes, including its </span><a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/policy-guidance/unaccompanied-children-program-policy-guide-section-2#2.8.4" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">post-release services,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> following a surge in referrals of unaccompanied children in 2021. Once the office examined data from March to April of that year, the Inspector General recommended changes to how ORR screens candidates for sponsorship and monitors them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is important for ORR to protect children from unsafe placements by taking appropriate steps to screen sponsors while also releasing children from care in a timely manner and without unnecessary delay,” the letter states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The office found that in 16% of children’s case files, one or more required sponsor safety checks lacked any documentation indicating that the checks were conducted. The office also found that the case files of 19% of children released to sponsors with pending FBI fingerprint or state child abuse and neglect registry checks were never updated with the results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeff Hild, acting assistant secretary of the Administration for Children and Families in the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the program ORR, said that the period reviewed was one of the most “challenging periods in ORR’s history” amid a historic number of unaccompanied children placed in ORR care, the largest and fastest expansion of emergency capacity, and at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As ORR worked quickly to respond to this unprecedented emergency, and with limited resources, it prioritized the safety and well-being of children at every step,” Hild wrote in December before the report was published.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hild said in a nine-page response that the office is working to meet the recommendations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Efforts by the </span><a href="https://www.scrippsnews.com/us-news/the-struggle-to-locate-migrant-children-missing-from-us-homes" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Center for Public Integrity and Scripps News</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> helped lead to a </span><a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/policy-guidance/unaccompanied-children-program-policy-guide-section-5#5.10.6" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> change with ORR after investigators were denied information to find missing children.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February 2023, ORR entered into an </span><a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/policy-guidance/unaccompanied-children-program-policy-guide-section-5#5.10.6" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">agreement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to provide all available data that might help locate the child.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then in August, ORR updated its </span><a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/policy-guidance/unaccompanied-children-program-policy-guide-section-5#5.10.6" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">policies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to clarify that, in cases of missing children, it will share information with investigative agencies without having to go through the full case file request process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some kids who come to Virginia from other countries find themselves working hazardous jobs that put their lives and health at risk.</span><b> </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia recorded 302 child care labor violation cases from 2020 to 2023, according to a child labor </span><a href="https://virginiainterfaithcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ChildLaborReportHiF-1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> compiled by the Virginia Interfaith Center for Public Policy, released in March of this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Because most labor violations go unreported, the actual number of child labor violations are likely to be significantly higher than those reported,” the center noted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than half of the cases occurred in 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Citing research that found teens who work more than 20 hours tend to have lower grades, more absences and higher dropouts, the center’s report underlined the importance of child labor laws. The report also said young workers have higher rates of job-related injuries and injuries that require emergency department attention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Department of Labor began a federal investigation into illegal child labor performed by migrant children following a damning </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/18/magazine/child-labor-dangerous-jobs.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year by the New York Times. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last September, the agency confirmed that it was investigating Fayette Janitorial Service, LLC, a company that had provided contract cleaning and sanitation services to slaughterhouses and meatpacking companies nationwide, including Perdue Farms, where the agency alleged migrant children were being used to clean slaughterhouses at Perdue’s plant on the commonwealth’s Eastern Shore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“High-profile cases occurring in Virginia that are being investigated at the federal level have detailed children cleaning equipment with acid and pressure hoses,” the Interfaith Center’s report stated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Times found that Marcos Cux, who migrated to Virginia from Guatemala, was hired at age 13 to work an overnight shift at an Accomack County Perdue plant, one of 15 migrant youths working there. None were older than 17. Cux’s forearm was torn “open to the bone” by a conveyor belt in the poultry deboning section of the plant he’d been sanitizing, the Times reported. He was in eighth grade at the time.</span></p>

Charlotte Rene Woods / Virginia Mercury</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Darryl Byers-Robinson choked up as he stood before a crowd of about 30 at Virginia&#8217;s Department of Corrections headquarters in Richmond on Monday with various advocacy groups and members of Virginia’s DOC. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The groups had gathered to celebrate the first year since the full reestablishment of eligibility for incarcerated people to receive Pell Grants. The grants, a federal subsidy for some qualifying undergraduate students, have not been applicable to incarcerated people for much of the past 30 years. That’s because the passage of the 1994 Violent Crime Bill made incarceration a disqualifier for Pell Grants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Byers-Robinson attributes his participation in a pilot program that allowed him to receive his associates degree as an example of how higher education can change someone’s life. His voice cracked and eyes watered as he recalled beginning his post-incarceration journey. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I remember the day when I got released — one of the things I held on tightly to in my folder was my degree,” Byers-Robinson said. “I knew it was going to give me an opportunity to do something powerful.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He has since gone on to serve as a pastor and public speaker. He’s also currently involved as an organizer with Virginia Interfaith Center for Public Policy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Byers-Robinson earned his degree by participating in the pilot program while incarcerated in New York through Bard College. Around that time in 2015, there were also four colleges in Virginia that had been part of a national Pell pilot program  through the U.S. Department of Education. Flash forward to July 2023, and Pell became fully accessible to people behind bars. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are currently 10 correctional facilities in Virginia that have established partnerships with community colleges for inmates to pursue associates or career technical education degrees with Pell Grants, as of July 1, 2024. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of colleges is expected to grow;  Virginia Wesleyan and Brightpoint Community College are currently going through the application process to partner with correctional facilities, officials said Monday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Rev. Kieth Jones, a Virginia Interfaith Center board member, and Virginia DOC director Chadwick Dotson noted the role that education plays in reducing recidivism.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The more education we can provide, the better outcomes are,” Dotson said of people being more prepared to find work and less likely to reoffend. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A January 2023 national study</span><a href="https://www.mackinac.org/30588" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that prison education programs reduced recidivism by about 15% while rates of employment for ex-offenders had increased about 7%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there’s still more work to be done, Dotson said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of that entails expanding high speed internet access for incarcerated students to be able to take advantage of virtual learning options through their colleges. Currently, students are limited to on-site classroom locations in their prisons. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allison Kroboth, a software engineer, Resilient Professional Community Manager  and former Fluvanna Correctional Center For Women inmate, recalled at Monday’s event the roundabout ways she had to retrieve research materials for coursework while earning her associates degree in 2013. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She had to fill out a form through her prison and then volunteers with Piedmont Virginia Community College would research the requested subjects that Kroboth would then have to pay 10 cents per page to get her hands on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That was a long process,” she said. “So we had to go about our assignments way in advance to make sure there was time for someone to get our research to us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dotson said that’s where investing in some on-site technology like tablets could help students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are there any legislators that want to toss us some money? We’ll use it for education, I promise,” Dotson said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, like Byers-Robinson, Kroboth used her degree to go into advocacy work for people with similar lived experiences to her. In addition to being a website engineer for Resilience Education, she is a mentorship program coordinator for the nonprofit that connects formerly incarcerated people seeking to use their degrees and reestablish their lives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a chance for these people “to come together and learn from each other,” Kroboth said of the mentorship programs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The significance of the moment wasn’t lost on Byers-Robinson, who was a featured speaker Monday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am standing here as an example for all of the people in prison,” he said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A task force directed by the Virginia legislature has recommended creating a dedicated funding stream for threat assessment team training on college and university campuses and allowing teams to share confidential information about a person who’s the subject of an investigation with other public institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An assessment team may investigate a person, whether a student or potential employee of a college or university, if they are determined to pose a “significant” threat of violence to others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This month, a task force directed by the state’s Secretary of Education and Secretary of Public Safety and Homeland Security released its </span><a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2024/RD284/PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a handful of recommendations to improve how threat assessment teams, responsible for campus safety, operate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislative action would need to be taken before any of the recommendations could be implemented.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the 2007 mass shooting at Virginia Tech, lawmakers passed </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+sum+SB539" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requiring colleges and universities to establish threat assessment teams to help prevent violence on campus. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, such laws have been expanded, requiring all K-12 public school divisions to have teams and permitting institutions of higher education to obtain records of people considered a “significant” threat on campuses, following the killing of three University of Virginia football players by another student in November 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the task forces’ recommendations was to dedicate a stream of funding for assessment team training.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The task force said the existing training requirement was never funded and was supported through grants. The group added that the most recent grant funding for assessment team training has expired.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Without grant funding, the department will be unable to deliver mandated training without </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">charging substantial tuition for training,” the report stated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The task force also recommended removing language from state law requiring the Department of Criminal Justice Services to approve an independent entity for training assessment teams, which they called “problematic.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the existing requirement, team members have to complete at least eight hours of training with the DCJS or a group it approves within 12 months of being appointed and at least two hours of additional training every year after that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The provision that discusses training conducted by an independent entity approved by the department is problematic, because DCJS does not have specific licensing authority for those independent entities, there is no criteria by which DCJS can judge whether to approve those entities and because it gives DCJS no authority over curriculum for those outside entities,” the report stated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The task force also proposed an amendment to the state code that would require each member to complete an introductory foundational course in threat assessment, approved and delivered under the supervision of DCJS within 12 months of joining the threat assessment team and complete a minimum of two hours of threat assessment training each academic year after that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another task force recommendation would amend state law to allow the public college or university’s threat assessment teams, which conducted an initial investigation of a student or employee deemed a “significant” threat, to share confidential information about that person when they are considering transferring schools or gaining employment at other Virginia public colleges and universities. At private Virginia institutions, they would be required to share that information with the dean of students, if the person investigated as a potential threat is a student, or with human resources if that person is an employee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The notification would occur after the initial assessment team determined through a “full inquiry and assessment,” compared to the current, less-clear language mandating teams take action“ pursuant to an investigation.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing state law only requires threat assessment teams to notify the receiving institution of the subject of their investigation or determination. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report stated that the provision’s current language could have made teams liable for defamation in other states because the requirement failed to explicitly limit the notification requirement to only Virginia schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The task force did not provide a list of best practices and procedures guidance for threat assessment teams because the ones the task force identified and would have recommended were “inconsistent” with the changes made in </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1916" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that passed last year, the report stated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The task force does not have the liberty to publish best practices guidance that is inconsistent with mandates in the Code of Virginia.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The colleges and universities that have received approval from the state will offer specialized instruction in areas such as computer science and technology. Lab school admission is based on a lottery system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ODU’s lab school collaboration will “expand high-quality educational opportunities for their students,” and has “expanded the definition of what it means to be a fiscal agent, in part going above and beyond in multiple different ways,” said Grace Creasey, president of the Virginia Board of Education, during a work session before Friday’s vote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, Gov. Glenn Youngkin and lawmakers agreed to a state budget requiring private and two-year institutions to partner with public institutions to obtain their respective lab school funding from the state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor’s administration, which has supported the establishment of lab schools — institutions similar to charter schools — has gone back and forth with the General Assembly over whether state law allows lab school applications from both private and public institutions to be considered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The administration, with support from the attorney’s general office, previously said that state law does not prohibit the lab school committee from accepting applications from all institutions. However, the legislature disagreed. Opponents, including state Democrats, have repeatedly said the schools take away from public school funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the budgetary decision, five schools — Emory &amp; Henry and Roanoke Colleges, and Mountain Gateway, Paul D. Camp and Germanna Community Colleges — chose to resubmit their applications. The schools’ applications were recommended for approval by the lab school committee and subsequently approved by the board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applications are reviewed by the department and review committee before reaching the board. The groups review such areas as lab school curriculum details and budget assumptions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The five newly approved lab schools will use the rest of the state’s lab school funds in the current budget, expiring June 30. Gov. Youngkin had proposed $60 million for lab schools over the next two years but the legislature declined to add the funds to the spending plan they and Youngkin signed off on last month.</span></p>

(Photo by sdominick/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Though the new version of the form to apply for federal financial student aid has had its fair share of highly publicized hiccups, U.S. Under Secretary of Education James Kvaal says the department has made a lot of progress in the past couple of months.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://studentaid.gov/help/fafsa" target="_blank">Free Application for Federal Student Aid</a> — better known as FAFSA — got a makeover after Congress passed the <a href="https://studentaid.gov/help-center/answers/article/fafsa-simplification-act" target="_blank">FAFSA Simplification Act</a> in late 2020. But users faced glitches and technical errors during the Dec. 30 soft launch and past the Jan. 8 official debut for the 2024-25 form, which covers the upcoming school year.</p>
<p>Advocates voiced concerns over the form’s failure to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/24/politics/fafsa-inflation-fix-income/index.html" target="_blank">adjust for inflation</a>, its <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/miscalculation-in-fafsa-formula-is-another-unforced-error" target="_blank">formula miscalculation</a> and its <a href="https://fsapartners.ed.gov/knowledge-center/library/electronic-announcements/2024-04-01/update-tax-data-received-fa-ddx-and-manually-entered-information" target="_blank">tax data errors</a>, prompting processing delays the department has worked to fix. The federal agency has also taken steps to address major issues that prevented parents without Social Security numbers from completing the form.</p>
<p>“We’re fixing things at a rapid pace, and we’ve been keeping the community updated. We have an <a href="https://fsapartners.ed.gov/knowledge-center/topics/fafsa-simplification-information/2024-25-fafsa-issue-alerts" target="_blank">issues guide</a> on the website that lets people know the problems we’re aware of and what the potential solutions are. In almost every case now, there is a way for students to submit the form,” Kvaal told States Newsroom in an interview.</p>
<p>“It may be a customer service experience that is not what we originally designed, and so we’re gonna continue to try and make this process easier and faster for all students, including those whose parents may not have Social Security numbers, but it is possible now for everyone to submit a FAFSA,” Kvaal said.</p>
<p>He oversees higher education and financial aid, including the Office of Federal Student Aid, which is the largest student financial aid provider in the country.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">More than 11 million FAFSA submissions</h4>

	
<p>Kvaal said the department has already received more than 11 million FAFSA submissions for the 2024-25 school year.</p>
<p>Last week, the <a href="https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-announces-jeremy-singer-fafsa-executive-advisor-office-federal-student-aid" target="_blank">department said</a> it has made “significant progress” in closing the gap in FAFSA submissions to an 8% decrease compared to this time last year, down from a nearly 40% decrease in March.</p>
<p>For both undergraduate and graduate students, the FAFSA form is a key indicator for financial aid eligibility, which comes in the form of grants, loans, work-study funds and scholarships.</p>
<p>The form is also not exclusive to first-year college students, and those already enrolled <a href="https://studentaid.gov/apply-for-aid/fafsa/renew" target="_blank">must renew their application</a> each academic year.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">&#8216;It’s still not perfect for all applicants&#8217; </h4>

	
<p>Though the department has made progress to address major known issues, “the system, certainly six months after it opened, is still not a totally functioning system,” said MorraLee Keller, senior director of strategic programming at the National College Attainment Network, a nonprofit membership and advocacy organization.</p>
<p>“Right now, the form is working for a lot of applicants, but it’s still not perfect for all applicants,” she added.</p>
<p>The organization <a href="https://www.ncan.org/page/fafsatracker" target="_blank">monitors FAFSA completion</a> for graduating high school seniors nationally and compares those figures to the previous school year. Keller said “one thing that we’re seeing is the class of &#8217;24, at this point in time, is almost 13 percentage points behind in the rate at which the seniors have filed a FAFSA” this past academic year.</p>
<p>“We are significantly behind in the number of FAFSAs, particularly for our graduating seniors, so that is ultimately probably going to have an impact in enrollment because completing a FAFSA is a pretty good indicator about whether you plan to enroll in college this fall,” Keller said.</p>
<p>Tennessee, Louisiana, Illinois, Washington, D.C., and Texas have the highest percentages of high school seniors completing the FAFSA form, according to NCAN’s tracker. Nevada, Florida, Arizona, Utah and Alaska have the lowest percentages. In Virginia, 44% of seniors — or 45,850, down from 51,597 last year — have completed the FAFSA.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kvaal said he thinks “it’s important to note that just about everybody can get their FAFSA through the process now.” He added that “there are some specific instructions that people in certain situations need to follow carefully” and encouraged applicants to pay careful attention to the instructions and help hints.</p>
<p>“The FAFSA is broadly available, and it’s not accurate to say that there are students who can’t get through them,” he said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">New strategy</h4>

	
<p>In early May, the federal agency launched the <a href="https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-launches-next-phase-fafsa-support-strategy-boost-completion-rate-among-high-school-students" target="_blank">FAFSA Student Support Strategy</a>, which has now provided more than “$30 million in funding and counting and has reached more than 180 organizations across the country” in an attempt to get more students to complete the form, according to the <a href="https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-announces-jeremy-singer-fafsa-executive-advisor-office-federal-student-aid" target="_blank">department</a>.</p>
<p>The department also recently announced that Jeremy Singer, current president of the College Board, would serve as the new FAFSA executive adviser.</p>
<p>In late May, U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said the department has <a href="https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/secretary-cardona-outlines-steps-modernizing-office-federal-student-aid" target="_blank">taken steps</a> aimed at “modernizing” the Office of Federal Student Aid, including the department’s search for a new chief operating officer, per a <a href="https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/secretary-cardona-outlines-steps-modernizing-office-federal-student-aid" target="_blank">news release</a>. That person would replace <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2024/04/26/richard-cordray-federal-student-aid/" target="_blank">Richard Cordray</a>, who, in the midst of backlash and criticism toward the department over the botched rollout, said in April he would depart.</p>
<p>Part of the department’s efforts, Cardona said, include conducting a “full-scale review” of the Office of Federal Student Aid’s “current and historical organization, management, staffing, workflow structures, business processes, and operations” and hiring an independent consulting firm.</p>
<p>The department is also reviewing “contracts and acquisition procedures” in an effort to hold vendors accountable, Cardona said.</p>
<p><strong>If I haven’t filled out the 2024-25 FAFSA form, what should I do? </strong></p>
<p>Though students have until <a href="https://studentaid.gov/apply-for-aid/fafsa/fafsa-deadlines" target="_blank">June 30, 2025,</a> to complete the 2024-25 FAFSA form, deadlines vary based on individual colleges and states. (Many colleges, including those in Virginia, have priority deadlines, meaning you&#8217;ll need to meet those to get the best chance at financial aid. Virginia students who are not eligible for FAFSA may qualify for <a tabindex="0" href="https://www.schev.edu/financial-aid/financial-aid/federal-state-financial-aid/vasa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virginia Alternative State Aid, or VASA.)</a></p>
<p>Kvaal encouraged anyone considering college this fall to visit <a href="http://studentaid.gov" target="_blank">Studentaid.gov</a> and fill out the FAFSA as soon as possible.</p>
<p>“If you had been hearing that there were challenges with the form or people were encountering obstacles, we’ve made a lot of progress in making the form work in recent weeks, and most people, their form is getting through in one to three days, and we’re sending information to colleges that they need to make financial aid offers,” he said.</p>
<p>Keller also encouraged families to not give up on completing the form.</p>
<p>“The time is not gone — get your FAFSA filed this summer if you want to go to school this fall,” she said.</p>

(Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Board of Education took another step on Friday to clarify how schools will be rated and student performance measured to better determine how to direct state resources. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The board, on the superintendent’s recommendation, approved </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/55336/638542370775530000" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">four performance descriptors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: “Distinguished,” “On Track,” “Off Track” and “Needs Intensive Support.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schools considered “distinguished” are those that exceed the state’s expectations for growth, achievement, and readiness, while “needs intensive support” schools are those that “significantly” do not meet any of the state’s expectations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “on-track” and “off track” descriptors mean schools are either meeting or not meeting expectations. However, questions surfaced on where the terms came from, the benchmarks, and the descriptions behind the labels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the proposed plan, Virginia will begin collecting data for the new performance framework starting in August. Results will be released during the 2025-26 school year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Board President Grace Creasey, a Gov. Glenn Youngkin appointee, said the department will do more work to flush out the descriptions as the revision of the state&#8217;s accreditation system moves forward. </span></p>

Department of Education begins developing new accountability system&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/18/va-department-of-education-begins-developing-new-accountability-system/embed/#?secret=g1nIoImPIQ#?secret=pqmql4OGbU" data-secret="pqmql4OGbU" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would like to remind us that the purpose here is transparency and understanding on behalf of not just people in schools, not just those of us sitting here in this room, not people who do education every day,” said Creasey on Friday. “This is for people to understand who are parents and families; and so while we&#8217;re deciding what the main categories are, these descriptors have yet to be fully baked at this point.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier in the process of revising the accreditation system, the board considered two different measures to track academic performance: an achievement index and an overall school rating, which raised concerns about the potential impact on low-performing schools and efforts to recruit teachers and influencing parents to seek other school choices for their children.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since April, teachers, parents, students, and education leaders have told the board they support using category descriptions instead of an A-F rating scale.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The category descriptors are part of a larger plan by Youngkin’s administration to overhaul the existing accountability system, which focuses on accreditation and measures schools based on academic achievement, performance gaps, student attendance and graduation and dropout rates, and factors like building safety, student-teacher ratios and licensure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schools are then labeled accredited, accredited with conditions or not accredited.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members of the administration and the board have criticized the current system for being vague and failing to address declines in student performance in subjects such as math and reading.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The administration’s process includes splitting up the state’s accreditation system into two parts: an accreditation system, to assess whether schools meet all requirements laid out in state laws and regulations; and an accountability system, to provide “timely and transparent information on student and school performance.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the new system, schools will be rated based on students’ success, measured by their mastery of subjects and academic growth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stakeholders and the board are split on the weight factors totaling the overall score for each school level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier the board expressed that “mastery” is important to make sure students thoroughly understand the concepts before graduating to the next grade level. Others have urged the board to keep “mastery” and “growth” at an equal weight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The overall score for elementary schools consists of three weight factors: 65% mastery, 25% growth, and 10% readiness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In middle schools, the performance score is weighted 60% mastery, 20% growth and 20% readiness; high schools’ performance score is weighted 50% mastery, 35% readiness and 15% graduation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VDOE staff said the performance descriptors would be in addition to the three federally required support and improvement identification categories: Comprehensive, Targeted and Additional Targeted. The designations are given to schools because a specific group of students may need assistance in catching up to the instruction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schools identified as “comprehensive” receive full federal support for the entire school, compared to “targeted” schools, which receive support for low-performing subgroups.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is all about providing a holistic picture to the public that’s more transparent, more clear about where schools are performing across all the indicators in the system,” said Anne Hyslop, director of policy development for All4Ed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the department contracted with Hyslop to work on changes to the accreditation system along with Chad Aldeman, the Edunomics Lab policy director at Georgetown University. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Board member Anne Holton, former state secretary of education and an appointee of Democratic Govs. Terry McAuliffee and Ralph Northam, was the lone vote against accepting the recommendation, saying she needed more information about the descriptors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are at least a dozen significant decisions, including one of the most important decisions of these ‘where the lines are going to be drawn’ that we haven&#8217;t made yet, even though we&#8217;re implementing the system starting with the school year that starts in six weeks,” Holton said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She added that she’s concerned that the proposed accreditation system has not been “fully thought out” and will have “unintended consequences” on teachers, families and “our neediest students.”</span></p>

(Screenshot from committee webcast)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The only reason John Arthur is able to be a public school teacher is because his wife makes much more money than he does.</p>
<p>Arthur —  the 2021 Utah Teacher of the Year  — testified on Thursday at a hearing in the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions on the challenges facing public school teachers.</p>
<p>Arthur, who is also a member of the National Education Association and holds National Board Certification, pointed to pay as the main reason for both teachers leaving the profession and parents not wanting their children to become teachers.</p>
<p>“The No. 1 solution to addressing the issues we face must be increasing teachers’ salaries,” said Arthur, who teaches at Meadowlark Elementary School in Salt Lake City, Utah.</p>
<p>Gemayel Keyes, a teacher at Gilbert Spruance Elementary School in Philadelphia, told the committee that even as an educator, he still has an additional part-time job.</p>
<p>The special education teacher spent most of his career in education as a paraprofessional. At the time he moved into that role, the starting annual salary was $16,000 and the maximum was $30,000.</p>
<p>“It’s still pretty much the same,” he said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Minimum teacher salary </h4>

	
<p>Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, <a href="https://www.sanders.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/03.09.23-Sanders-Pay-Teachers-Act-text.pdf" target="_blank">introduced a bill</a> in March 2023 that would set an <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/766/all-actions" target="_blank">annual base salary</a> of $60,000 for public elementary and secondary school teachers.</p>
<p>“We understand that the children, young people of this country, are our future and there is, in fact … nothing more important that we can do to provide a quality education to all of our young people, and yet, for decades, public school teachers have been overworked, underpaid, understaffed, and maybe most importantly, underappreciated,” Sanders said in his opening remarks.</p>
<p>“Compared to many other occupations, our public school teachers are more likely to experience high levels of anxiety, stress and burnout, which was only exacerbated by the pandemic,” he said.</p>
<p>Sanders said 44% of public school teachers are quitting their profession within five years, citing “the extremely low pay teachers receive” as one of the primary reasons for a massive U.S. teacher shortage.</p>
<p>For the 2023-24 school year, a whopping 86% of K-12 public schools in the country documented challenges in hiring teachers, according to an October report from the <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/whatsnew/press_releases/10_17_2023.asp" target="_blank">National Center for Education Statistics</a>.</p>
<p>In Virginia, where the <a href="https://www.nea.org/resource-library/educator-pay-and-student-spending-how-does-your-state-rank?utm_medium=paid-search&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_campaign=rankings-estimates-report&amp;utm_content=&amp;ms=ads-rankings-estimates-report-se&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw0MexBhD3ARIsAEI3WHLwd8Qv-rHoH2JAUdRK2yLx0JOW7PQuh_NVgkB-n_mqchU8BZSoYAAaAi8SEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank">average teacher pay is $63,103</a>, there were roughly <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/17/legislation-to-bring-va-teacher-pay-to-national-average-gets-bipartisan-support/">3,600 vacancies in 2023</a>, according to Virginia Department of Education. The state&#8217;s new two-year budget provides for a 3% increase in teacher&#8217;s salaries.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Maryland sets $60,000 minimum </h4>

	
<p>But a minimum annual teacher salary of $60,000 is not far off for every state.</p>
<p>In Maryland, the <a href="https://marylandmatters.org/2024/06/03/blueprint-blues-local-leaders-cite-school-reform-plans-progress-problems/" target="_blank">Blueprint for Maryland’s Future</a> raises the starting salary for teachers to $60,000 a year by July 2026.</p>
<p>William E. Kirwan, vice chair of Maryland’s Accountability and Implementation Board, said the multi-year comprehensive plan, passed in 2021 in the Maryland General Assembly, “addresses all aspects of children’s education from birth to high school completion, including most especially, the recruitment, retention and compensation of high quality teachers.”</p>
<p>Kirwan said the “Blueprint’s principle for teacher compensation is that, as professionals, teachers should be compensated at the same level as other professionals requiring similar levels of education, such as architects and CPAs.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">An &#8216;allocation issue&#8217;</h4>

	
<p>Sen. Bill Cassidy, ranking member of the committee, dubbed Democrats’ solution of creating a federal minimum salary for teachers as a “laudable goal.”</p>
<p>But he noted that “the federal government dictating how states spend their money does not address the root cause of why teachers are struggling to teach in the classroom.”</p>
<p>“More mandates and funding cannot be the only answer we come up with. We must examine broken policies that got us here and find solutions to improve,” the Louisiana Republican said.</p>
<p>Nicole Neily, president and founder of Parents Defending Education, a parents’ rights group, argued that “schools don’t have a resource issue” but rather an “allocation issue.”</p>
<p>“There’s a saying: ‘Don’t tell me where your priorities are, show me where you spend your money, and I’ll tell you what they are.’ Education leaders routinely choose to spend money on programs and personnel that don’t directly benefit students,” said Neily.</p>
<p>Neily pointed to a 2021 report from the <a href="https://www.heritage.org/education/report/equity-elementary-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-staff-public-schools" target="_blank">Heritage Foundation</a>, which found that “standardized test results show that achievement gaps are growing wider over time in districts with (chief diversity officers).” Such staff members commonly encourage efforts at diversity, equity and inclusion in schools.</p>
<p>Robert Pondiscio, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, said “higher pay does not ease the burden we place on teachers or add hours to their day.”</p>
<p>“By all means, raise teacher pay, but do not assume that it will solve teacher shortages or keep good teachers in the classroom. Poor training, deteriorating classroom conditions, shoddy curriculum and spiraling demands have made an already challenging job nearly impossible to do well and sustainably,” he added.</p>

(Getty Images)</p><p>A federal judge has blocked new Title IX rules, including those aimed at protecting LGBTQ+ students from discrimination in K-12 schools, and sided with Republican attorneys general in several states — including Virginia.</p>
<p>Chief Judge Danny Reeves of the U.S. District Court in Eastern Kentucky on Monday issued a ruling siding with Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares and his counterparts in five other states. The ruling prevents the U.S. Department of Education from “implementing, enacting, enforcing, or taking any action to enforce the Final Rule, Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance,” which was set to begin Aug. 1.</p>
<p>Miyares and the GOP attorneys general <a href="https://kentuckylantern.com/briefs/kentucky-attorney-general-leading-gop-effort-against-new-title-ix-rules-over-gender/" target="_blank">filed the lawsuit</a> in April. At the time, they argued the Department of Education “used rulemaking power to convert a law designed to equalize opportunities for both sexes into a far broader regime of its own making” with the new Title IX regulations.</p>

<p>Reeves limited the injunction to the plaintiff-states of Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Virginia and West Virginia.</p>
<p>Miyares <a href="https://x.com/JasonMiyaresVA/status/1802708125746659838" target="_blank">posted on X</a> soon after the ruling that he was &#8220;pleased to announce that a court has stopped the Biden Administration&#8217;s unlawful Title IX regulations from going into effect in Virginia,&#8221; calling the regulation a &#8220;power grab&#8221; by the president that would &#8220;jeopardize half a century of landmark protections for women, violate the First Amendment, and ignore the clear text of the Title IX law passed by Congress. The rule should have never been issued in the first place.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Biden administration introduced the rules to “build on the legacy of Title IX by clarifying that all our nation’s students can access schools that are safe, welcoming, and respect their rights,” U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona said in a statement. The rules also would have rolled back Trump administration changes that <a href="https://kentuckylantern.com/2024/04/19/biden-administration-to-roll-back-the-betsy-devos-title-ix-rules/" target="_blank">narrowly defined sexual harassment </a>and directed schools to conduct live hearings, allowing those who were accused of sexual harassment or assault to cross-examine their accusers.</p>

<p>In their complaint, the state attorneys general said that under the Biden rule, “Men who identify as women will, among other things, have the right to compete within programs and activities that Congress made available to women so they can fairly and fully pursue academic and athletic excellence — turning Title IX’s protections on their head. … And anyone who expresses disagreement with this new status quo risks Title IX discipline for prohibited harassment.”</p>
<p>Established in 1972, <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/tix_dis.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Title IX </a>was created to prevent “discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities that receive federal financial assistance,” according to the Department of Education.</p>
<p>Reeves wrote in his opinion that “the Department of Education seeks to derail deeply rooted law” created by the implementation of Title IX.</p>
<p>“At bottom, the Department would turn Title IX on its head by redefining ‘sex’ to include ‘gender identity.’ But ‘sex’ and ‘gender identity’ do not mean the same thing,” he wrote. “The Department’s interpretation conflicts with the plain language of Title IX and therefore exceeds its authority to promulgate regulations under that statute.”</p>

(Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A handful of Virginia school boards are exiting the Virginia School Board Association, the longest-running organization dedicated to supporting school boards in the commonwealth, over claims that it has failed to meet their needs and doesn’t align with their conservative values.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gina Patterson, executive director of VSBA, established in 1906, said she would not comment on the claims made by the few boards but instead responded that the association’s decisions are based on the school boards’ priorities, not staff’s.</span></p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">School Boards that did not renew VSBA membership</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Bedford County</p>
<p>Isle of Wight County</p>
<p>Orange County</p>
<p>Rockingham County</p>
<p>Warren County</p>
<p><em>*List as of June 14 at 5 p.m.</em></p>
</div>
	</div>
	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we do is based on the decisions of the majority of our members, based on legislative positions and how they want us to lobby for or against something at the General Assembly,” Patterson told the Mercury.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VSBA offers school boards networking opportunities, professional development sessions, optional add-on policy and legal services, governance training, and can assist with superintendent searches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conservative and some newly elected board members, including those from Warren and Orange counties, said the organization wasn’t incorporating their legislative priorities and providing training that mirrors their principles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before they were elected, some of those school boards’ members campaigned on certain parents’ frustration with how school boards operated by allowing “divisive concepts” in schools, endangering students, adopting controversial policies around transgender students and books, and renaming schools and mascots connected to the racist ideals of the Confederacy. Gov. Glenn Youngkin focused his campaign on many of the same issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiffany Van Der Hyde, executive director of We The People, a 501(c)(4) nonprofit organization tracking shifts in school board memberships, said Gov. Youngkin rallying with parents over education issues in 2021 contributed to some Virginia school boards’ political polarization and the exodus of many of their members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s election “empowered a lot of far-right candidates to seek office in this space, and we saw a lot of really great conservative, local school board members across the state decide not to run again,” Hyde said.“ They just didn&#8217;t want to be a part of it and when they left, the more extreme candidates filled those gaps.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Boards exit from VSBA</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some school board members claimed that VSBA, which the boards pay through agreements, has failed to prove its value to their communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warren County Board Member Ralph Rinaldi said during a Sept. 6 vote to leave the VSBA that he believed the school staff and board could govern themselves and implement policies relating to issues like school discipline without the association.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They do provide some services that are worthwhile, but I look at the return for what we&#8217;re putting in and what we&#8217;re getting, then I look at our geographic location, and there are other counties here in the [Shenandoah Valley] that sort of get snubbed by them,” Rinaldi said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Warren County School Board became one of the earliest to decline to renew its membership with VSBA, followed most recently by boards in Orange County and Rockingham County. Rockingham voted to begin its membership with the alternative School Board Member Alliance, but keep VSBA’s policy services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On May 20, board members in Orange County voted not to renew their agreements with VSBA, citing thousands of dollars in costs and saying they could find resources elsewhere. Members are also only attending some training sessions, which carry additional fees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orange County board member Darlene Dawson claimed that the VSBA has been a “monopoly” for a long time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They self-identify as a lobbying organization, and they lobby for many things that I, on principle, stand against, and I&#8217;m not interested in supporting them,” Dawson said in May. “I prefer to take my training from someone who supports my values.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A controversial alternative</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="http://mysbma.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">School Board Member Alliance of Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a conservative-leaning group and nonprofit organization, has emerged as a popular alternative for some of VSBA’s former school board members in the past year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of June 12, the association represents one-tenth of Virginia&#8217;s school boards members and supports parental rights, educational freedom for families and traditional academics. Unlike the VSBA, the Alliance offers individual memberships. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our professional development is based on the powers and duties afforded to school board members under Virginia law,” said Shelly Norden, spokesperson for SBMA. “We believe every child deserves a quality education in a safe and disruption-free environment. School boards have the legal authority to ensure this is happening.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alliance members and leaders have reportedly </span><a href="https://www.wavy.com/news/local-news/york-county-school-board-org-threatened-board-member-ahead-of-vote/#:~:text=YORK%20COUNTY%2C%20Va.,obtained%20by%20WAVY%20News%2010." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">threatened</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a board member in York County (which the SBMA refutes) and </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/virginia-confederate-school-names-26db1b3532208ef8fb1f545c1482b9ff" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rebranded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> two schools with Confederate names in Shenandoah County.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Norden said the alliance’s members were elected to local school boards to serve their constituents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“SBMA launched to give school board members a choice when it comes to professional development,” Norden said in an email to the Mercury. “Our goal is to continue adding professional development opportunities and services that will enable our members to serve their communities effectively.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Keeping the agreement</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some board members have been unsuccessful in swaying their colleagues to retain their membership with VSBA, despite the organization’s long history and track record of advocacy. Others remain optimistic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think you get out of these organizations, what you put into them, and if you choose to attend the professional development conferences and sessions that each organization offers, I think you will get more out of it than you think,” said Robert Hundley Jr., a Hanover County school board member and former VSBA board president, at a June 11 Hanover County School Board meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other members across the commonwealth expressed concern that leaving VSBA could impact whether their school’s policies and procedures would be updated to ensure the division’s compliance with state laws. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That&#8217;s what it does,” said Orange County Board Member Jack Rickett, who voted against leading VSBA. “Can other people do that? Yes, they can … Lawyers are going to cost money, and we will have extensive legal fees when we remove ourselves from the VSBA.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Rockingham County, board member Jackie Lohr pointed out that VSBA’s position as a lobbyist for school boards gives members a way to influence policymakers that they wouldn’t otherwise have.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we&#8217;re no longer members, we no longer have a voice, we no longer have a vote,” Lohr said at the June 10 Rockingham school board meeting. “They are a big, big machine and they will continue to lobby, and they have the ears of a lot of politicians and if we&#8217;re not there to provide the conservative voice, no one else will be.”</span></p>
<p><em>Correction: This story inadvertently published that Warren County Board Member Tom McFadden Jr. voted against renewing the membership instead of Ralph Rinaldi. </em></p>

(Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia NAACP on Tuesday filed a lawsuit against the Shenandoah County School Board for what it called “reaffirming discrimination,” after the school system voted to rebrand schools with Confederate names in May. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit alleges that the school board violated the U.S. Constitution, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Equal Educational Opportunity Act. The plaintiffs seek to remove the Confederate names, mascots and vestiges, and to prevent any future school naming involving Confederate leaders or references to the Confederacy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On May 10, the Shenandoah County School Board </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/virginia-confederate-school-names-26db1b3532208ef8fb1f545c1482b9ff" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reversed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a 2020 decision by a previous board to rename two schools after Confederate Generals Turner Ashby, Robert E. Lee and Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson. In 2021, the schools on the division’s southern campus, which included North Fork Middle, were renamed from Stonewall Jackson High School to Mountain View, and Ashby-Lee Elementary School to Honey Run.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shenandoah County Public Schools responded to a request for comment, but did not immediately provide remarks.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_38925" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1024px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-38925" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2528-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2528-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2528-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2528-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2528-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2528-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A view from outside Stonewall Jackson High School in Shenandoah County. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This backward move has received a negative reaction all over the world, and the world is watching to see if this variety of the seeds of hate and disenfranchisement will take root and return Shenandoah County and the commonwealth of Virginia to the days when racial exclusion was the law of the land,” said Rev. Cozy Bailey, president of the Virginia NAACP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, Bailey, members of the state NAACP and their attorneys gathered with about 45 community members and students in front of the Shenandoah County Circuit Court to announce the legal action against the school board’s decision to restore Confederate names to the schools. It appears to be the first school district in the country to do so. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bailey described the board’s decision on May 10 as “cold-hearted” and reminiscent of the Jim Crow era. He said the organization is not trying to revise history, but is “chartering” a better path for the future by learning from the past and not making the same mistakes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some people, including a portion of Shenandoah residents who support the school names reversal, believe the Confederacy represents a heritage of Southerners’ courage against the federal Union while fighting for the rights of southern states. Others, including civil rights groups and some Shenandoah students and families, view the Confederacy as defenders of slavery and a foundational part of America’s history of racism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between the 1950s and 1960s, local leaders in Shenandoah County named public schools after Confederate leaders.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since that time, a movement to make schools more inclusive and equitable has advanced in courtrooms and through legislation at the state and federal levels. In recent years, localities statewide have made a concerted effort to address the commonwealth’s history of white supremacist ideology and historical practices of creating unfair advantages for white people by implementing policy changes and hosting community discussions on these topics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several Virginia communities renamed roads that bore the names of people connected to slavery and removed signs and symbols of the Confederacy, such as statues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorneys from the Washington Lawyers’ Committee and Covington &amp; Burling LLP are representing the plaintiffs — the NAACP and five current students in Shenandoah County Public Schools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marja Plater, senior counsel with the Washington Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs, said the Confederate generals believed deeply and fought to preserve the ideology of white supremacy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is what these men are known for,” Plater said. “Honoring them is to honor the legacy of discrimination.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Ashley Joyner Chavous, an attorney with Covington &amp; Burling, the community was involved early in the process of pushing back against the renamed schools, before the legal team received assistance from families in the community and their “brave” children who stepped up to share their perspectives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;ve only come to learn more, and we look forward to engaging with the community as we proceed in this meditation,” Chavous said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit was filed Tuesday in the Western District Court of Virginia in Harrisonburg. A judge and court date have not been set.</span></p>

<p>DEI efforts implemented in the schools directs their administrators to violate both the Constitution and <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/statutes/title-vii-civil-rights-act-1964#:~:text=Title%20VII%20prohibits%20employment%20discrimination,Pay%20Act%20of%202009%20(Pub." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Title VII</a> of the Civil Rights Act, which “prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin,” the states argued.</p>
<p>The letter comes a year after the <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2023/06/supreme-court-strikes-down-affirmative-action-programs-in-college-admissions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Supreme Court’s decision</a> in a lawsuit against Harvard College that dictated students must be considered based on their experiences as an individual and not on their race. The decision led higher institutions to stop affirmative action policies, and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/anti-dei-bills-states-republican-lawmakers-map-rcna140756" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many states</a> since then have passed laws restricting DEI programs.</p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia GOP leaders praise affirmative action ruling, schools vow to keep pursuing diversity&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/06/29/virginia-gop-leaders-praise-affirmative-action-ruling-schools-vow-to-keep-pursuing-diversity/embed/#?secret=KChduybi6f#?secret=2ZW7XOIhi2" data-secret="2ZW7XOIhi2" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>The diversity and inclusion standard of the American Bar Association, which is currently under revision, “seemingly asks law schools to defy the Court’s clear directive. In its current form, the Standard all but compels law schools to consider race in both the admissions and employment contexts,” according to the letter <a href="https://tennesseelookout.com/2024/06/06/skrmetti-warns-american-bar-association-over-new-diversity-and-inclusion-rules-for-law-schools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">led by Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti</a>.</p>
<p>The standard establishes that law schools should “demonstrate by concrete action a commitment to diversity and inclusion by providing full opportunities for the study of law and entry into the profession by members of underrepresented groups, particularly racial and ethnic minorities, and a commitment to having a student body that is diverse with respect to gender, race, and ethnicity.”</p>
<p>The same diversity and inclusion commitment should also be extended to faculty and staff.</p>
<p>The issue with this guidance, the attorneys wrote, is that it suggests schools undertake concrete actions such as special recruitment efforts and considerations, in addition to special financial assistance programs. But, the standard and its accompanying recommendations don’t mention how to take those suggested actions without “unlawfully using race-based means.”</p>
<p>“If race-based admissions cannot satisfy strict scrutiny (…), then neither can racially motivated recruitment or financial aid,” according to the letter.</p>
<p>A demand to show a commitment to have a body of faculty and staff that’s diverse with respect to race and ethnicity, is also an “explicit demand to make hiring decisions based on race,” the attorneys argued.</p>
<p>By maintaining the standard, the attorneys continued, the American Bar Association would burden every law school in the country with litigation.</p>
<p>“Further, if American legal culture internalizes the ABA’s determination to ignore unwanted legal obligations, our profession, and our country, may never recover,” the letter reads.</p>
<p>The proposed revisions for the American Bar Association include that the access commitment must be extended to “all persons,” including those who have faced disadvantages or exclusion because of their identity traits.</p>
<p>Faculty and staff should also be diverse with respect to different characteristics, such as race, religion, gender and socioeconomic background, among others.</p>
<p>But, those changes “do little to solve these problems,” according to the letter, as “bundling race with other permissibly considered characteristics does not somehow make (the standard) requirements any more constitutionally sound.”</p>
<p>The issue is concerning, the attorneys said, because accreditation rests “on a tightrope walk between federal law, on one hand, and (the standard) contrary demands on the other.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to documents from the Virginia Department of Education, the private institution in Southwest Virginia joins more than a dozen institutions that are not being considered, some of which have withdrawn their applications including Eastern Shore Community College, Southside Virginia Community College, Hampton University and the University of Lynchburg.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ferrum College President Mirta Martin blamed the state for changes during the review process after it received a nearly $200,000 lab school planning grant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Martin said she </span><a href="https://www.ferrum.edu/news/ferrum-college-receives-virginia-department-of-education-grant-for-partnership-laboratory-school-with-franklin-county-public-schools/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">received</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a call from Secretary of Education Aimee Guidera last month to break the news.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At that point, I told her very candidly, I&#8217;m not going to go down silently into the night because this is not a political issue; this is doing the right thing for some of the most underserved populations in Virginia,” Martin said in an interview last month with the Mercury.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Virginia Department of Education, Ferrum received additional time to respond to questions before ultimately having its application axed by the department from consideration for the College Partnership Laboratory School committee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration has actively sought to establish laboratory schools, much like charter schools, to offer another layer of educational choices with specialized instruction. But opponents, including Democrats, say the schools take away from public school funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the approval process, which involves the Department of Education reviewing elements such as curriculum details and budget assumptions, applicants are welcome to withdraw their applications at any time and resubmit them at a later time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christian Martinez, a spokesman for the governor&#8217;s office, said Guidera and the staff at the Virginia Department of Education have “openly communicated” that the new budget language reduces the available funding for lab school operations, which will impact the evaluation of some proposals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Private institutions, including Ferrum, faced another challenge during the process when the governor and lawmakers agreed to a budget last month requiring them to submit their applications along with a four-year public institution of higher education to handle the financial and administrative duties for each lab school and enact an annual reporting requirement related to financial sustainability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As Virginia continues to emerge as a national leader in lab school development, Governor Youngkin will focus on restoring excellence in education by creating innovative pathways for students to explore potential careers and better prepare for their future in the commonwealth,” said Martinez.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Ferrum’s view of the process</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ferrum officials pointed to the ongoing rule changes as to why its application failed to reach the application committee for review.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The college requested $10.6 million for the initial four years, which is more than schools like James Madison University with a larger enrollment size requested. JMU asked for $7 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Martin said the requested funding is to cover a larger territory compared to other institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to published documents that were later removed from the education department’s website, the agency first received Ferrum College’s Academy for Opportunity and Innovation application on Feb. 1. The proposed academy would have focused on providing high school students interested in employment in public service and health-related fields.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officials also said many of the committee’s questions had already been answered or included in the application.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to college officials, the department asked Ferrum to expand the application from Franklin County High School to 12 school divisions after submitting the first version of its application. Ferrum officials said they made the changes despite the potential commuting challenges in the Southwest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officials also had another challenge when state lawmakers added language into the two-year budget requiring private institutions to partner with public institutions on lab school applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If the rules had been consistent from the beginning of the process, we would have had a fiscal partner out from day one, but that was introduced after we were already waiting in line to get in front of the standing committee,” said Jason Powell, associate vice president of academic affairs and chief innovation and research officer at Ferrum College.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Powell, the administrative costs for those grants are likely to increase, even double, after the budget decision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the projected costs, Martin said Ferrum would be willing to find a four-year public institution partner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were never afforded that opportunity, but if afforded the opportunity, we will comply,” Martin said. “We will find a fiscal agent that will partner with us … to be able to provide this critical education to this underserved population.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Lab schools update</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On May 21, following an hour-long closed session with its legal team, the Board of Education approved two lab school applications: one from Old Dominion University to create a school in Suffolk, the other from George Mason University to create a school in Frederick.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These two lab schools will bring valuable STEM education to the Hampton Roads and Shenandoah Valley communities and bring our total to 14 across the commonwealth,” said Youngkin in a May 22 statement. Lab schools have been a priority education issue for Youngkin’s administration and a sticking point of debate among Democratic legislators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In partnership with higher education institutions, creating the state-approved curriculum, lab schools offer students tuition-free instruction for careers in computer science and technology. Lab school admission is based on a lottery system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Five schools that submitted successful lab school applications — Emory &amp; Henry and Roanoke Colleges, and Mountain Gateway, Paul D. Camp and Germanna Community Colleges — will be </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/education/virginia-lab-schools-youngkin-surovell-department-of-education/article_e8202bfe-17ba-11ef-a75d-2b10360fd953.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">required to resubmit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> them after language in the recently passed state budget emphasized that state code does not allow lab school funding to go to private or two-year colleges, a position Democrats have long held.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Todd Reid, a spokesman with the VDOE, said it would not be able to provide an update on the status of the applications submitted by private institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Youngkin administration, with support from the attorney’s general office, previously said that state law does not prohibit the committee from accepting applications from all institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No new funding for lab schools was included in the two-year budget, after the governor proposed $60 million for them which lawmakers declined to add to the spending plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the committee’s June documents, the state’s current lab school fund balance is $9,647,232. Norfolk State University, and prospective partners Old Dominion and Eastern Shore Community College, are expected to meet with the lab school committee on June 10.</span></p>

(Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officials from Virginia Commonwealth University and VCU Health System told lawmakers on Wednesday they are reviewing an agreement to pay the city of Richmond approximately $2.5 million annually in lieu of taxes for a development that was never built, after the school paid the city, investors and developers nearly $80 million to exit the failed building project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, VCU Health System signed a lease with a developer to construct the Clay Street Project, which included a medical tower, office and retail space and parking on the site of Richmond’s former Public Safety Building at Clay and 10th Streets. At the time, VCU agreed to pay the city a total of $56 million in lieu of taxes for the $325 million project, which was to be paid out in increments of $2.5 million annually, according to the </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/business/real-estate/clay-street-public-safety-building-failed-development/article_454fc558-dfb4-11ee-84ed-9f90d77ad1f2.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond Times-Dispatch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, a year later the partnership ended after the developer and the health system could not agree to terms on the budget due to unsuitable site conditions and increased construction costs. As part of the health system’s plan to cancel the project, it paid $80 million, but the annual $2.5 million payments to the city in lieu of taxes continued. Now, lawmakers and VCU Health leaders are questioning and investigating whether the annual payments are legal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VCU’s health system was directed to terminate the payments, according to </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2024/1/HB30/Introduced/CR/C-14/1c" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">language</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> included in the recently approved state biennium budget. Under that measure, the health system must provide a report to the legislature on the status of that decision by Oct. 1.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Speaking in the past tense, I think at the time that this was agreed to, it was felt to be correct to do that; in the present tense, that’s being reviewed and why we are currently in conversations with the city about that very topic,” said Marlon Levy, interim CEO of VCU Health System.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, which conducts analysis and provides oversight of state agencies on behalf of the General Assembly, VCU Health has made at least one $2.5 million payment to the city.</span></p>
<p>Petula Burks, a spokeswoman for the city of Richmond, said in a statement: “The city believes the guaranteed obligation agreed to by VCUHS needs to be honored. It is a contractual requirement entered into by VCHUS of their own volition.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Jeremy McPike, D-Prince William, said, however, “you can’t tax something that doesn’t exist,” throwing in his support for officials to review the agreement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[VCU] has no controlling interest at this point,” McPike said. “The only way to pass through IRS tax exemption to a leasehold is to have an actionable operation of a leased facility or a component of [one], of which it has none.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, lawmakers directed researchers to conduct the study and review the health system’s response to the Clay Street Project.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officials from VCU addressed lawmakers following a presentation by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, which reviewed the roles and responsibilities of the VCU Health System’s Board of Directors, the system’s governance structure, and the capital procurement process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hal Greer, staff director for JLARC, said the report only focuses on the findings and recommendations to improve VCU’s capital processing infrastructure. No recommendations were made regarding the Clay Street Project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VCU President Michael Rao, who also serves as the health system’s president, said on Wednesday that acquiring the property was important for the system’s future in 2021. But the project became “impossible” with national economic pressures such as inflation intensifying during the pandemic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers said VCU Health had improved its capital process by hiring outside consultants and revising its capital project process. Still, they said, more work is needed to develop a long-term strategic capital plan, strengthen several policies, and increase staffing to handle capital projects that can sustain and expand the system’s operations effectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two key recommendations included eliminating the health system president position and creating two separate positions, VCU Health System CEO and VCU SVP of health sciences, roles that are currently combined. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both recommendations would require changes to the Code of Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers recommended the president’s position be eliminated because it&#8217;s a conflict of interest. The health system president is also the university president.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Board members told the research team that they believe the university president should not be the board chair, should not be able to vote, and supported eliminating the position. According to JLARC staff, the president has the authority to evaluate the performance of the health system CEO and recommend compensation for that person, and can schedule executive committee meetings and modify the order of business for the Board of Directors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rao said he supports the idea of the position being eliminated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These are roles that a lot of my colleagues, regardless of the structure around the nation, do not share with me,” Rao said, adding that it can be confusing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JLARC staff also recommended that the health system’s board members have longer terms, possess expertise in additional topics relevant to  health system governance, and be impartial. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VCU officials said after the presentation that plans to address JLARC’s recommendations are underway.</span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eric Oakes’ voice cracked for a moment when he reflected on the Virginia Hazing Prevention Summit he’d helped host at Virginia Commonwealth University Tuesday. Three years after the death of his son, Adam Oakes, the pain lingers but so does inspiration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was great seeing everybody collaborate and come together,” Oakes told reporters following a day-long gathering on VCU’s campus June 4. “I know Adam’s was the extreme of hazing, but there’s so much physical and mental damage done by hazing. It needs to be eradicated.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oakes was a college freshman when he died of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">alcohol poisoning after a fraternity party hazing event in 2021. While hazing can be broad, it usually entails people seeking to join institutions performing expected actions that can sometimes be dangerous to them — such as drinking excessive amounts of alcohol.  </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_30341" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/adam_oakes.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-30341" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/adam_oakes.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="168" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Adam Oakes, 19, died of alcohol poisoining after a VCU fraternity event. (NBC12)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members of his family went on to create the Love Like Adam Foundation and visit colleges in multiple states to give seminars. The Virginia Hazing Prevention Summit in partnership with VCU was their largest endeavor to date and the first of its kind in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The summit included representatives from various universities, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">brainstorming sessions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and presentations, with groups including the Hazing Prevention Network participating. The family of Stone Foltz also attended. Foltz, a Bowling Green State University sophomore, died from hazing-related alcohol poisoning days after Oakes had. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oakes’ cousin Courtney White had been working on her doctorate degree when the tragedy struck and focused her dissertation on hazing prevention. She points to decades of other </span><a href="https://hazingpreventionnetwork.org/hazing-facts/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about hazing in </span><a href="https://www.alfred.edu/about/news/studies/_docs/hazing-study.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">high school</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and collegiate levels when advocating for law changes at the state capitol and when organizing events like the Hazing Prevention Summit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is real. It’s prevalent,” White said. “I’m hoping with the summit we can really get that message out — but then also tap into all the expertise that’s already in and around our state.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The messages resonated with Dirron Allen, associate president of student life at James Madison University. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are now talking about this in light of a tragedy, but we are in spaces to think deeply,” he told reporters after the event Tuesday evening. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rachel Tully, the assistant dean of students at VCU, noted how strategies to mitigate hazing will look different for each institution but that there are tools to learn from each other. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A portion of the gathering included brainstorming meetups for various student and athletics groups to strategize and interact with each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For universities, part of hazing prevention is already mandated by state law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Passed in 2022, “</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+SB439" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adam’s Law,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” requires people joining student organizations at Virginia colleges and universities to undergo hazing prevention training and for the universities to post reports of hazing misconduct online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb379" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> new law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, set to take effect next month, will also build on those efforts by bringing anti-hazing education into high schools. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will require Virginia’s Board of Education to develop standards and curriculum guidelines for anti-hazing prevention in public schools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The instruction will include examples of hazing and its dangers along with the consequences of alcohol intoxication and laws surrounding hazing — such as bystander intervention. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, the inaugural Hazing Prevention Summit will continue to incubate strategies. White said that other universities have expressed interest in hosting the event in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At one point during the day, White recalled stepping aside to view the crowd at the summit. Seeing people gathered with a common goal was “overwhelming,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s always my goal that more people know about him so that this doesn’t happen to anyone else,” White said. “I hope people can stop seeing us as a grieving family and start seeing us as a catalyst for change.”</span></p>

<p>Nearly all of the clean school buses purchased will be electric, at 92%, according to the administration.</p>
<p>“This announcement is not just about clean school buses, it’s about the bigger picture,” EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan said during a call with reporters on Tuesday, prior to the announcement. “We are improving air quality for our children, reducing greenhouse gas pollution and expanding our nation’s leadership in developing the clean vehicles of the future.”</p>
<p>Low-income, rural and tribal communities — accounting for approximately 45% of the selected projects —  are slated to receive roughly 67% of the total funding, per the administration.</p>
<p>Regan noted how “low-income communities and communities of color have long felt the disproportionate impacts of air pollution leading to severe health outcomes that continue to impact these populations.”</p>
<p>As for business and economic opportunities, Regan pointed to the development of new, well-paying manufacturing jobs and investment in local businesses stemming from the increasing demand for these clean school buses.</p>
<p>“As more and more schools make the switch to electric buses, there will be a need for American-made batteries, charging stations and service providers to maintain the buses supercharging and reinvigorating local economies,” he added.</p>
<p>The Clean School Bus Program has now collectively awarded nearly $3 billion to fund approximately 8,500 electric and alternative fuel buses for over 1,000 communities across the United States, according to the administration.</p>
<p>The program started through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed by Congress and signed by President Joe Biden, which includes $5 billion over five years to transform the country’s existing school buses with “zero-emission and low-emission models,” per the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/cleanschoolbus" target="_blank">EPA</a>.</p>
<p>Among many negative health and environmental effects, especially for communities of color, diesel exhaust exposure can lead to major health conditions such as asthma and respiratory illnesses, according to the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/dera/learn-about-impacts-diesel-exhaust-and-diesel-emissions-reduction-act-dera" target="_blank">EPA</a>.</p>
<p>Exposure to diesel exhaust can also “worsen existing heart and lung disease, especially in children and the elderly,” the agency said.</p>

Board of Education</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ruling, which mandated public school desegregation nationwide, Virginia’s scholarship fund named after the landmark Supreme Court case has gained $2.5 million in federal and state aid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state’s Brown v. Board of Education scholarship fund now stands at more than $3.4 million, after $500,000 in federal funds were awarded in March and $2 million in state funds were confirmed in the commonwealth’s newly passed two-year spending plan, according to the scholarship committee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a Wednesday morning meeting, the committee elected Sen. Angelia Williams Graves, D-Norfolk, as chair. In an email to the Mercury  after the meeting, Graves wrote that she’s “grateful” the committee was able to receive the funds “so that we can continue to contribute to the education of Virginians adversely affected by the Brown v. Board of Education decision and their descendants.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2004, the purpose of the fund has been to support descendants of people denied a public education during Massive Resistance, when Virginia imposed laws to prevent school desegregation and allowed some schools to close to avoid integrating. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ken Woodley, an author and former journalist who originally proposed the fund, urged federal and state lawmakers to make contributions after the committee learned last year it had less than $1 million available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville, and Del. Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, proposed legislation requesting $5 million for the fund in the state budget. On the federal level, U.S. Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine requested $1 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In December, the committee capped the number of awardees at 10 because of uncertainty with the state budget. Once the state and federal funds were confirmed, Woodley wrote in a </span><a href="https://brownscholarship.virginia.gov/pdf/meetings/5-22-24-Meeting/Descendants-scholarship-funding-budget-appropriation.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">May 14 letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that he hoped the funding would allow the committee to increase the number of scholarships</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, the committee approved 40 to 45 eligible applications pending further review, according to Graves&#8217; office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“God’s fingerprints have always been all over this program since it fell into my mind on February 18, 2003. But God’s fingerprints are not alone,” Woodley wrote. “As is so often the case when something of goodness blossoms in this world, human fingerprints join God’s &#8230; in [the] most important ways.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woodley said everyone’s “fingerprints are all over this first Civil Rights-era reparation” in U.S. history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am deeply thankful for all that each of you has done and will do for this healing program,” he said.</span></p>

Education groups still doubt that the state's current spending on teacher salaries is enough to reverse current staffing shortfalls. (Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislation that would have aligned Virginia teachers’ pay with the national average or higher by the 2027-28 school year won bipartisan support but was blocked from the state budget by Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+amd+HB187AG" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">veto</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two-year budget, signed last week, includes $540 million to help pay for 3% salary increases for teachers and state employees in both years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor said he supported the goal of “ensuring that teachers and state-funded education support positions are funded competitively,” but didn’t approve the bill to boost educators’ salaries to the national average because it relied heavily on what he viewed as flawed data from the </span><a href="https://www.nea.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Education Association</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which represents educators across the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his veto, the governor said the legislation does not “accurately reflect” the state of teacher compensation in Virginia and that NEA’s methodology includes substitute teacher compensation and fails to account for supplemental salary expenditures in determining teacher compensation. He added that the legislation does not account for various scenarios, such as an economic downturn or state of emergency, that could impact teacher pay rates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The measure also didn’t include Youngkin’s earlier recommendation to create an annual teacher compensation review.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Consistent, annual reporting of accurate teacher compensation data is essential for lawmakers and the governor to make sound decisions,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor further explained his veto by noting that since 2021, the state has invested $1.6 billion to grow teacher salaries by 23%.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Education Association argued that the governor’s administration is “mistakenly” making comparisons between the estimated national teacher pay average in the National Education Association Rankings and Estimates report and the Virginia estimate in the Virginia Department of Education (VDOE) </span><a href="https://us-west-2.protection.sophos.com/?d=virginia.gov&amp;u=aHR0cHM6Ly9yZ2EubGlzLnZpcmdpbmlhLmdvdi9QdWJsaXNoZWQvMjAyNC9SRDg4L1BERiNwYWdlPTY=&amp;p=m&amp;i=NjE2MDc1YzFjYTYxZmYwZjRhYzYwMzg4&amp;t=SFE4R0lZNUdrNnYreW1VU1hKaHArc0R5TEVRMW1icGZTZzJjTWE2REJ6ND0=&amp;h=5c73f2d4bb9c4437a791f76142735cd0&amp;s=AVNPUEhUT0NFTkNSWVBUSVaWs13c0X3SBALsuplEtI0D38A8K9yJ_5AmE4RH8zYZM9y3m0T6LdZ6_pxqY5vGvdycylk0w7XlKY6v7lRlB6L6" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annual Salary Survey Report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The estimates provided within these two reports are calculated using different data and methodologies and are not comparable,” VEA said in a </span><a href="https://www.veanea.org/vea-statement-on-veto-governor-standing-up-for-confederacy-and-sitting-down-for-teachers/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Friday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to NEA’s recent </span><a href="https://us-west-2.protection.sophos.com/?d=nea.org&amp;u=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmVhLm9yZy9zaXRlcy9kZWZhdWx0L2ZpbGVzLzIwMjQtMDQvMjAyNC1yYW5raW5ncy1hbmQtZXN0aW1hdGVzLXJlcG9ydC5wZGYjcGFnZT00NA==&amp;p=m&amp;i=NjE2MDc1YzFjYTYxZmYwZjRhYzYwMzg4&amp;t=bi9heGFSTzRhNlRnK2trakdIbTFIdXVtc0g4NlN0TDB4YUI4c1BlRnFqUT0=&amp;h=5c73f2d4bb9c4437a791f76142735cd0&amp;s=AVNPUEhUT0NFTkNSWVBUSVaWs13c0X3SBALsuplEtI0D38A8K9yJ_5AmE4RH8zYZM9y3m0T6LdZ6_pxqY5vGvdycylk0w7XlKY6v7lRlB6L6" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Virginia’s salary average is $65,058, which is below the national estimated average of $71,699.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia, like other states, provides NEA data to compile state averages in their </span><a href="https://www.nea.org/sites/default/files/2024-04/2024-rankings-and-estimates-report.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">annual reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, removing non-instructional positions and allowing for an “apples to apples comparison” across all the states, according to VEA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Department of Education’s “Annual Salary Survey Report” includes all salary expenditures, including supplemental pay, for classroom teachers, homebound teachers, guidance counselors, librarians, and instructional technology positions, VEA stated. NEA includes only classroom teachers, substitutes, and homebound teachers and excludes supplemental pay. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While lawmakers debated the actual national average during this year’s session, they agreed compensation must be improved for teachers, as vacancies have grown since the pandemic. Youngkin’s veto magnified some Democratic lawmakers’ concerns with Virginia’s educator shortage.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This school year began with over 4,000 teacher vacancies across our commonwealth, and the governor is not interested in attracting or keeping teachers here. If he was, he would have signed my bill that would have ensured Virginia teachers are being paid at the national average,” said Del. Nadarius Clark, D-Suffolk, one of the bill’s carriers, along with Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clark added that the governor’s veto indicates where he stands on public education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When the governor lets our teachers down, when he doesn’t value them, he is telling the communities they serve and their students that they don’t matter either,” Clark said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Youngkin’s veto coming in the same week as the 70th anniversary of the landmark </span><a href="https://nmaahc.si.edu/explore/initiatives/brown-v-board-70" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown v. Board of Education</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ruling — in which the Supreme Court of the United States mandated states desegregate public schools — Lucas said the inequities the case tried to address decades ago still persist in her community and throughout Virginia, which the governor’s rejection of the bill won’t help resolve.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Governor Youngkin doesn’t care about public education and is determined to hold our students back,” Lucas said. “This is just a small part of his broader agenda to disenfranchise Virginians, and we will not stand for it.”</span></p>

Pictured is a student holding a rainbow flag. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Twenty-six GOP-led states, including Virginia, are suing the Biden administration over changes to Title IX aiming to <a href="https://alabamareflector.com/2024/04/19/biden-administration-to-roll-back-the-betsy-devos-title-ix-rules/" target="_blank">protect LGBTQ+ students</a> from discrimination in schools.</p>
<p>Less than a month after the U.S. Department of Education released its final rule seeking to <a href="https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-releases-final-title-ix-regulations-providing-vital-protections-against-sex-discrimination/" target="_blank">protect against discrimination</a> “based on sex stereotypes, sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex characteristics,” a wave of Republican attorneys general scrambled to challenge the measure.</p>
<p>The revised rule, which will go into effect on Aug. 1, requires schools “to take prompt and effective action when notified of conduct that reasonably may constitute sex discrimination in their education programs or activities.”</p>
<p>The lawsuits hail from Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming.</p>
<p>All of the attorneys general in the 26 states suing over the final rule are part of the Republicans Attorneys General Association.</p>
<p>Various advocacy groups and school boards have also tacked onto the states’ legal actions. The lawsuits carry similar language and arguments in vehemently opposing the final rule. They say the new regulations raise First Amendment concerns and accuse the rule of violating the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/administrative_procedure_act" target="_blank">Administrative Procedure Act</a>.</p>
<p>LGBTQ+ advocates say the revised rule offers students a needed protection and complies with existing law.</p>
<p>“Our kids’ experience in schools should be about learning, about making friends and growing as a young person. LGBTQ+ students deserve those same opportunities,” Sarah Warbelow, vice president of legal at the LGBTQ+ advocacy group Human Rights Campaign, said in an emailed statement. “In bringing these lawsuits, these state attorneys general are attempting to rob LGBTQ+ students of their rights, illustrating a complete disregard for the humanity of LGBTQ+ students.”</p>
<p><strong>GOP states band together against new regulations</strong></p>
<p>In the most recent effort, <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2024/05/14/kansas-ag-sues-biden-administration-over-new-federal-protections-for-lgbtq-students/" target="_blank">Alaska, Kansas, Utah, and Wyoming</a> sued the <a href="https://ag.ks.gov/docs/default-source/documents/title-ix-complaint.pdf" target="_blank">Biden administration</a> on Tuesday, accusing the Department of Education of seeking to “politicize our country’s educational system to conform to the radical ideological views of the Biden administration and its allies.”</p>
<p>The lawsuit claims that under the updated regulations, teachers, coaches and administrators would have to “acknowledge, affirm, and validate students’ ‘gender identities’ regardless of the speakers’ own religious beliefs on the matter in violation of the First Amendment.”</p>
<p>In another lawsuit, a group of Southern states —  <a href="https://floridaphoenix.com/2024/04/30/fl-joins-gop-lawsuit-seeking-to-overturn-biden-administration-protections-for-transgender-students/" target="_blank">Alabama, Florida, Georgia and South Carolina</a> — sued the administration in <a href="https://www.alabamaag.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Title-IX-Complaint.pdf" target="_blank">federal court</a> in Alabama over the new regulations.</p>
<p>Republican Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall <a href="https://www.alabamaag.gov/attorney-general-steve-marshall-files-lawsuit-challenging-biden-rule-to-redefine-sex-as-gender-identity-in-americas-schools/" target="_blank">said</a> President Joe Biden “has brazenly attempted to use federal funding to force radical gender ideology onto states that reject it at the ballot box” since he took office.</p>
<p>“Now our schoolchildren are the target. The threat is that if Alabama’s public schools and universities do not conform, then the federal government will take away our funding,” Marshall said in a press release.</p>
<p>The lawsuit also drew praise from Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who said “Biden is abusing his constitutional authority to push an ideological agenda that harms women and girls and conflicts with the truth.” He added that the <a href="https://twitter.com/GovRonDeSantis/status/1785305760445935764" target="_blank">Sunshine State</a> will “not comply” and instead “fight back against Biden’s harmful agenda.”</p>
<p><strong>Individual states sue the administration </strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, some states have opted to file individual lawsuits against the administration.</p>
<p>In Texas, Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton sued the Biden administration late last month in <a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/images/press/Title%20IX%20Complaint%20FIled.pdf" target="_blank">federal court</a> in Amarillo. Paxton filed an amended complaint earlier this week, with two new <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txnd.389218/gov.uscourts.txnd.389218.12.0.pdf" target="_blank">plaintiffs</a> added.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/attorney-general-ken-paxton-sues-biden-administration-unlawfully-using-title-ix-mandate-radical" target="_blank">April 29 press release</a>, Paxton said the Lone Star State “will not allow Joe Biden to rewrite Title IX at whim, destroying legal protections for women in furtherance of his radical obsession with gender ideology.”</p>
<p><a href="https://oklahomavoice.com/2024/05/06/oklahoma-ag-education-department-sue-biden-administration-over-title-ix-changes/" target="_blank">Oklahoma’s Republican Attorney General</a> Gentner Drummond <a href="https://www.oag.ok.gov/sites/g/files/gmc766/f/documents/2024/24-05-06_complaint_0.pdf" target="_blank">filed a lawsuit </a>against the Biden administration earlier this month in federal court in Oklahoma. The <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.okwd.126842/gov.uscourts.okwd.126842.1.0.pdf" target="_blank">state’s education department</a> also filed a separate suit against the Biden administration.</p>
<p><strong>A hodgepodge of states </strong></p>
<p>In late April, Republican attorneys general in <a href="https://kentuckylantern.com/briefs/kentucky-attorney-general-leading-gop-effort-against-new-title-ix-rules-over-gender/" target="_blank">Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Tennessee, West Virginia and Virginia</a> filed a lawsuit against the <a href="https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/INAG/2024/04/30/file_attachments/2863214/Complaint%20-%20FINAL,1.42.pdf" target="_blank">Biden administration</a> in federal court in Kentucky.</p>

<p>The states argued that the U.S. Education Department “has used rulemaking power to convert a law designed to equalize opportunities for both sexes into a far broader regime of its own making.”</p>
<p><a href="https://lailluminator.com/2024/04/29/louisiana-sues-biden-administration-over-title-ix-rules-that-protect-lgbtq-students/" target="_blank">Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi and Montana</a> also sued the Biden administration in late April, echoing the language seen in the other related lawsuits. Seventeen local <a href="https://www.ag.state.la.us/Files/Article/13219/Documents/11-AmendedComplaint.pdf" target="_blank">school boards</a> in Louisiana also joined the states.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://arkansasadvocate.com/2024/05/07/arkansas-teen-attorney-general-file-federal-lawsuit-over-title-ix-transgender-protections/" target="_blank">Arkansas, Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota</a> also brought a collective <a href="https://arkansasag.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024-05-07-Arkansas-v.-US-Dept-of-Education-Filemarked.pdf" target="_blank">legal challenge</a> to the final rule.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Education Department said the department does not comment on pending litigation but noted that “as a condition of receiving federal funds, all federally-funded schools are obligated to comply with these final regulations.” They added that the department looks forward “to working with school communities all across the country to ensure the Title IX guarantee of nondiscrimination in school is every student’s experience.”</p>
<p>The department has yet to finalize a separate rule that establishes new criteria for transgender athletes. So far, 24 states have passed laws that ban transgender students from partaking in sports that align with their gender identity, according to the <a href="https://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps/youth/sports_participation_bans" target="_blank">Movement Advancement Project.</a></p>

Stonewall Jackson in Richmond in 2020. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proud and satisfied, or sad and embarrassed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However citizens of the commonwealth view Shenandoah County School Board’s recent decision, Virginia appears to be the first in the nation to restore Confederate school names, after years of vigorous community engagement, a controversial renaming process, and a change in board priorities related to race, diversity and inclusion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On May 10, the Shenandoah County School Board </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/virginia-confederate-school-names-26db1b3532208ef8fb1f545c1482b9ff" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reversed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a 2020 decision by a previous board to rebrand two schools previously named after Confederate Generals Turner Ashby, Robert E. Lee and Thomas &#8220;Stonewall&#8221; Jackson. In 2021, the schools on the division’s “southern campus” that included North Fork Middle were renamed from Stonewall Jackson High School to Mountain View, and Ashby-Lee Elementary School to Honey Run.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To some, the Confederacy represents a heritage of Southerners’ courage against the federal Union and fighting for the rights of southern states. Others view the Confederacy as defenders of slavery and a foundational aspect of America’s history of racism.</span></p>
<iframe loading="lazy" 0 id="datawrapper-chart-y4bQG" style="border: none;" title="Shenandoah County Public Schools Enrollment 2023-24" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/y4bQG/1/" width="600" height="591" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" aria-label="Pie Chart" 1="data-external=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&quot;" class="iframe-class"></iframe>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four days after the decision, when Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin was asked by a reporter to comment on the reinstated Confederate school names during a press conference following the passage of the state’s two-year budget, he said he was unfamiliar with the topic. He added that he believes those decisions are at the discretion of the local school districts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve been very clear all along that we need to teach all of our history, the good and the bad, that we can’t know where we are going unless we know where we’ve come from, but to the specifics of the decision, you’ll have to forgive me because I haven’t been very close to them,” said Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, commented on the Shenandoah school names the day after the board made their decision, calling it “outrageous.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to recent data from the Department of Education, white students make up most of the total student enrollment in Shenandoah schools at 73%, ahead of Black students at 2.9% and Hispanic pupils at 17%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I feel really sad for the students, both Black and white and Latino, who have to deal with leadership that is backwards looking and not forward looking, that doesn&#8217;t believe that the Confederate names for those schools are wrong,” Scott said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But we will continue to fight to make sure that the real history is known and that we will get better from it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Beau Dickenson, a former teacher of American History at Shenandoah County’s Stonewall Jackson High School, public schools, particularly high schools, began to be named after Confederate between the 1950s and 1960s, as the Civil Rights Movement swept through the nation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many localities named their schools after Confederate leaders in response to the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education case mandating desegregation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the 1950s, school boards and lawmakers, including Virginia’s U.S. Sen. Harry Byrd, were fighting against the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1954 decision to desegregate schools, a strategic effort known as Massive Resistance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia </span><a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/massive-resistance/#:~:text=An%20attempt%20by%20Massive%20Resistance,than%20desegregate%20in%20September%201959." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pushed back against integration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by cutting off state funds for integrated schools, issuing tuition grants to white children to attend segregated private schools and closing public schools to prevent desegregation in Charlottesville, Front Royal and Norfolk.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dickenson said one of the school closures near Shenandoah was in neighboring Warren County, which he believes made school boards aware of why the schools were closed, adding that the news was also featured in the Northern Virginia Daily newspaper for both communities to read.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During this time, Shenandoah leaders named one of its high schools after Stonewall Jackson, on Jan. 12, 1959. Jackson was famously known for leading Confederate soldiers in Shenandoah County and working under Gen. Robert E. Lee during the Civil War.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Days later, federal and state courts ruled that closing schools was illegal. However, Massive Resistance was not declared illegal by the Supreme Court until 1968, a ruling stemming from the Green v. County School Board of New Kent County case. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The convergence of all those forces makes it abundantly clear, I think, that this naming was politically motivated,” said Dickenson.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last four years, localities statewide have made a concerted effort to address the commonwealth’s history of white supremacist ideology and historical practices of creating unfair advantages for white people by implementing policy changes and hosting community discussions on these topics. Several communities renamed roads that bore the names of people connected to slavery and removed signs and symbols of the Confederacy, such as  statues.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The 2019 candidates’ forum</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Shenandoah County, the controversy around the school names has been discreetly discussed in smaller groups for years. But one of the most notable times the question about changing the Confederate names surfaced publicly was during a District 2 school board candidates’ forum in October 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marty Helsley, who was then a candidate for the Shenandoah County School Board, fielded a number of questions, including ones about his interest in changing the high school’s name from Stonewall Jackson, which he opposed, according to </span><a href="https://www.nvdaily.com/nvdaily/school-board-candidates-make-their-case-for-election/article_906050bc-063e-5305-9a69-e93f20a7f69c.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Northern Virginia Daily</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This valley is rich in Civil War history,” Helsley said during the event. “Stonewall Jackson, if you are an expert in Civil War history, was a fine gentleman. Apparently, the School Board then decided to name the school after Stonewall Jackson for excellent reasons and it should stay that way.”</span></p>
<p>Helsley on Monday, May 20 denied the remarks attributed to him by The Northern Virginia Daily.</p>
<p>&#8220;My response, if I recollect, said &#8216;I will look at the merits when it comes up,&#8217; something to that effect,&#8221; said Helsley.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In November 2019, Helsley was elected to office, joining a group predominantly composed of former educators and parents of school-aged children including Shelby Kline, Andrew Keller, Michelle Manning, Cindy Walsh and Karen Whetzel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walsh said when she joined the board in 2016, the board was focused on addressing local issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But things started to change between 2015 and 2020, she said, after a series of events: a white nationalist killed nine worshippers at a historically Black church in Charleston, South Carolina; hundreds of white nationalists marched through Charlottesville and clashed with counter protesters, killing one and injuring 19; and the killing of unarmed Black man George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gradually I would hear from people more about how inappropriate the names were on the southern campus, but it was still relatively quiet the first couple of years,” Walsh said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said even though Shenandoah County didn&#8217;t have a lot of racial incidents, eventually it “felt like the right thing to do, to nip it in the bud and take care of getting those names off of those schools.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manning said after listening to her board colleagues and school staff talk about the struggles that they observed from dealing with students during a “fragile emotional time” in middle and high school, something needed to be done. She voted in favor of removing Confederate monikers from the schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It just seemed like it was the thing to do and, and I don&#8217;t regret my vote at all, because I still feel to the core of my being that it was the right thing to do for students,” Manning said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a June 2020 resolution, leaders from the Shenandoah County </span><a href="https://www.whsv.com/2020/06/25/board-of-supervisors-pass-resolution-for-continued-support-of-black-lives/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Board of Supervisors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q8SKpcdivlUVqOtOS0PISJluQlAvVwCN/view" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">School Board</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> condemned racism in separate resolutions. The school board did not stop there.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The renaming process</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On July 9, 2020, Whetzel and Walsh, who served at the chair and vice chair on the board, agreed to add an item to the board’s agenda to retire the school names of Stonewall Jackson High and Ashby-Lee Elementary, and the rebel mascot at North Fork Middle School. The measure passed in a 5-1 vote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shenandoah retired the name — </span><a href="https://wtop.com/prince-william-county/2020/06/prince-william-county-votes-to-rename-schools-honoring-stonewall-jackson/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">joining</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Prince William County, which had two schools bearing the same name — in June 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helsley was the only member to vote against renaming the schools, according to minutes from the meeting.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_19824" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-19824 size-medium" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/stoney_Wall_CROP_NBC12-300x181.png" alt="" width="300" height="181" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/stoney_Wall_CROP_NBC12-300x181.png 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/stoney_Wall_CROP_NBC12-1024x619.png 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/stoney_Wall_CROP_NBC12-768x464.png 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/stoney_Wall_CROP_NBC12-696x421.png 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/stoney_Wall_CROP_NBC12-694x420.png 694w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/stoney_Wall_CROP_NBC12.png 1050w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Stonewall Jackson Middle School in Hanover was renamed. (NBC12)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The meeting, which was virtual, created friction between the public over the process and perceived lack of public participation. The board allowed speakers to respond to  the motion, but diverted from its common practice of waiting a month before taking action, according to Helsley. Some community members took issue with that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We had a problem with the lack of process and the lack of public involvement,” said Mike Schiebe, a spokesperson for the Coalition for Better Schools, made up of county residents that formed after the decision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We didn&#8217;t have a chance to really be involved and that upset a lot of people in Shenandoah County,” he added. “So it proved to be very divisive.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During an in-person Sept. 10, 2020 meeting, the board reaffirmed its vote and, in a resolution, outlined a plan for renaming the schools and finding a new mascot for the middle school. The board also added language in the resolution to include public input into the decisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walsh said changing the names cost money beyond the signs outside the school, “things that you wouldn’t think of,” from stationary and uniforms to gym bleachers, to name a few. She said it cost a little over $300,000, much of it from the districts’ savings, not its operating budget.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the resolution stated, “under no circumstances shall this motion be construed as requiring the expenditure of funds that have not been appropriated to the Shenandoah County School Board for the current fiscal year.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opponents of the name change argued that the board said taxpayer dollars would not cover the schools’ name change costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Walsh and Manning said the funds were from the board’s savings and donations collected during the pandemic, when the Shenandoah Valley Regional Program for Special Education program was not in operation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That mirrors the cost breakdown presented in a March 11, 2021 </span><a href="https://go.boarddocs.com/vsba/shenandoah/Board.nsf/files/BYYS996D54FF/$file/School%20Name%20Change%20budget%20amendment%20-%20FINAL.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">board presentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which showed that the costs were covered by $135,000 from unused salary accounts for frozen positions, and $133,284 from residual Shenandoah Valley Regional Program for Special Education tuition. Manning said </span><a href="https://www.shenandoahforward.org/about" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shenandoah Forward</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which she and others founded, raised the remaining amount, under $40,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walsh said it was common for the board to spend funds from the board’s savings on one-time expenses, such as capital projects, and not recurring ones, such as teacher salaries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Jan. 14, 2021, the board accepted the new names of the two schools. The next month, the board selected the </span><a href="https://www.whsv.com/2021/02/17/generals-chosen-as-mascot-for-stonewall-jackson-high-north-fork-middle/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">generals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as the mascot for both Mountain View and North Fork.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the months following the vote to retire the names, board members faced a recall, some received threats by email and phone. Another member expressed that their mailbox was knocked over by a truck.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title24.2/chapter2/section24.2-233/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, elected officials can be removed from office by a circuit court through a petition for “neglect of clear, ministerial duty of the office, misuse of the office, or incompetence in the performance of the duties of the office” when it has a material adverse effect upon the conduct of the office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Board members said it was upsetting to be considered for a recall because it meant that the petitioners — some of whom they knew personally — believed they were not doing their job properly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whetzel, who had just lost her husband after 47 years of marriage, was the only member that received enough signatures for a recall. Her board term ended before any action was taken in court. The case was dismissed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I told myself, some of [the petitioners] just think they&#8217;re signing [a sheet] that they&#8217;re against the name change, and I respect that,” Wentzl said. “So that might have been my way of dealing with it because it&#8217;s not fun to be served petitions for your removal.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schiebe said he’s well aware of the local historic connections to the previous names, but he said the coalition’s main problem was with the board’s approach to retiring the names.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There&#8217;s a lot of people who are really focused on the names and what they are, and in our group, if the public was polled, and if the community as a whole decided we want to change the names or whatever, we would have accepted it,” Schiebe said. “We&#8217;re more focused on the process and our lack of involvement in our own government, which is … one of the cornerstones for our democratic process and of our constitutional rights.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A change</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, the school board’s decision to rename the schools led to a unified effort by county residents to overturn the board’s action. Others made their voices heard at the voting polls, selecting candidates that shared their views. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, four years after the vote to retire the Confederate names, the makeup of the six-member school board has been completely overhauled following two elections. The new members are Dennis Barlow, Kyle Gutshall, Brandi Rutz, Thomas Streett, Gloria Carlineo and Michael Rickard. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of the members of the 2020 board, who started their terms at different times, completed their terms and did not seek reelection.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_33886" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-33886" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG_3633-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG_3633-300x225.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG_3633-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG_3633-768x576.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG_3633-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG_3633-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  &#8220;I Voted&#8221; stickers are displayed at a Richmond polling place during the 2022 midterm elections. (Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022, Barlow, Gutshall and Rutz joined the board for the first time and soon had an opportunity to weigh in on restoring the Confederate names, but a measure to do so failed in a 3-3 vote. The failed measure would’ve included a plan for the school to pay thousands for a community survey about the issue to be conducted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helsley, who initially was not in favor of changing the Confederate names, voted in 2022 to keep the names Mountain View and Honey Run. He said his vote was in the best interest of the students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I saw no need to reverse back to put the Stonewall Jackson [name] back,” Helsley said. “That did not sit well with the group that wanted to put it back.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in 2024, the board’s ability to restore the names changed when three new members joined, replacing the remainder of the 2020 board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schiebe said the Coalition for Better Schools did not endorse any candidates, but some members did support them individually. He said the coalition has had about 20 volunteers working to provide information to the public and has hundreds of supporters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The coalition received overwhelming responses in favor of restoring the Confederate names, Schiebe said, after the group conducted two controversial surveys. Some argued the results came from a portion of the county and not the whole county. The </span><a href="https://go.boarddocs.com/vsba/shenandoah/Board.nsf/files/D4GKB54F9AF2/$file/CBS%20Survey%20Results%20Data.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mail-in survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> produced a response rate of about 13%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the board ultimately voted 5-1 to restore the Confederate names, agreeing to use only private funds for the restoration costs after the meeting extended until the next morning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a </span><a href="https://go.boarddocs.com/vsba/shenandoah/Board.nsf/files/D4GKB24F9AEF/$file/CBS%20Restoration%20Letter.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the board, the coalition said the legacy of Stonewall Jackson, “while complex, remains an important part of our local history,” and described Ashby and Lee as “prominent figures and local heroes.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gutshall, who represents constituents in District 4, which isn’t where the schools are located, said they overwhelmingly supported retaining the school names Mountain View and Honey Run but respected their colleagues’ viewpoints. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don&#8217;t feel like I would be doing my job properly if I sat here and ignored them, even if I didn&#8217;t necessarily agree with what they were expressing to me,” Gutshall said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Board members’ decision was partially informed by the previous board&#8217;s “lack of process” when it changed the school names in 2020. Others argued that the agenda was published over the Fourth of July weekend and did not provide enough time for the public to respond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How it was done in 2020, it was not done right,” said Board member Thomas Street, adding that it was secretive and a “knee-jerk” reaction. “I was very disappointed in that leadership.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">District 3 School board member Gloria Carlineo added “This was not an innocent mistake by some inexperienced school board. No, this was a carefully choreographed machinations of a school board colluding to ignore the people they represented.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schiebe said the coalition was happy with the board’s decision and hopes to help with the fundraising.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Board Chair Barlow said the school board expects the renaming transition to be completed by July 1, but is in no rush, the </span><a href="https://www.nvdaily.com/subscribe/?ref=articleMax" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northern Virginia Daily</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported. The school division retained some items with the Stonewall Jackson name that are in storage.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The blueprint?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the board’s success in restoring the Confederate school names, some lawmakers and supporters are embarrassed and concerned that it could be a regressive blueprint for other localities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It can always happen elsewhere. We are a democracy. No matter how backwards your views are, you can vote… but we&#8217;re gonna continue to do our best to educate and advocate for what&#8217;s right,” House Speaker Scott said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Richmond, lawmakers including Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, said the board’s decision to revert back to the original Confederate names was not a surprise because the candidates being elected have “no commitment” to diversity, equity or inclusion, which “flows from the top of [Virginia’s] gubernatorial administration.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Locke, who serves on the Senate Health and Education committee, said across Virginia school board memberships are changing, resulting in some that are “stuck in time” and are more interested in “revisionist history” than supporting the best interests of children, teachers and the schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This whole revisionist history idea is what is driving renaming schools to the names of Confederate generals and paying homage to a lost cause.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, Locke along with Del. Delores McQuinn, D-Richmond, carried successful legislation that gave localities the authority to remove or relocate war memorials, such as the vaunted Monument Avenue statues of Confederate army leaders. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Candi Mundon King, D-Prince William, who supports ending further reminders of the Confederacy, said the backlash by the Shenandoah board mirrors opposition to legislation she carried this session to repeal the state’s ability to issue special license plates honoring the Sons of Confederate Veterans and Gen. Robert E. Lee. The governor vetoed the measure last Friday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think that this just underscores the importance of local elections and how people are reenergizing the sort of false story of the Civil War to try to hurt people and divide people,” Mundon King said. “They know that these names are divisive and hurtful.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sam Rasoul, chair of the Virginia House Education Committee, added that while this was a “stain” on the nation and the commonwealth, he still believes Virginia has made great progress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are hoping that no other schools go backwards and build on this terrible decision that was made that will be an anomaly,” Rasoul said. “We need to keep moving forward and trying to find ways of embracing the values that truly make us American.”</span></p>

University bigwigs pat themselves on the back for the PR boost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noticeable numbers of graduates then protest at the ceremony, outraged at the luminary – and the university’s tone-deaf selection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s what we witnessed last week as</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2024/05/11/vcu-youngkin-commencement-walkout/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin gave the commencement speech</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also what happened at Howard University more than four decades ago.</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1981/05/10/bush-speaks-at-howard/5723c487-587c-408a-a553-2e920ac590e6/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Then-Vice President George H.W. Bush</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – representing an administration that repeatedly attacked the quest for racial equality – spoke at the historically Black institution in Washington. I was among the 1,000 graduates receiving degrees that sunny day in 1981.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My alma mater’s decision to provide Ronald Reagan’s second-in-command a platform was more egregious than VCU’s – by far. For example, months earlier then-candidate Reagan had campaigned</span><a href="https://www.zinnedproject.org/news/tdih/reagan-speech-at-neshoba/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">near where three civil rights workers had been murdered by Ku Klux Klan members in 1964</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Mississippi. In his 1980 speech, Reagan invoked “states’ rights” – code words for keeping the feds from investigating blatant discrimination, especially throughout the South. Nor did he even acknowledge the previous murders, which had to be investigated by the FBI to achieve justice. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, you have to wonder why VCU officials tapped a guv who’s</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/11/10/orwellian-snitch-line-shuts-down-will-guv-end-assault-on-teachers/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">attacked teachers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/74---eo/74---eo/EO-1---ENDING-THE-USE-OF-INHERENTLY-DIVISIVE-CONCEPTS,-INCLUDING-CRITICAL-RACE-THEORY,-AND-RESTORING-EXCELLEN.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">lambasted critical race theory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and interfered</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/06/thought-policing-va-s-schools-youngkin-consolidates-his-grip-on-educations-ruling-boards/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">with the independence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of public colleges in the state. His administration’s decision to review</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/28/youngkin-administration-reviews-race-dei-syllabi-for-vcu-george-mason-courses/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">syllabi for courses about diversity, equity, inclusion and race</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at VCU and George Mason University – what one faculty member called “hostile state scrutiny” – ultimately led to both universities</span><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/diversity/2024/05/13/vcu-gmu-wont-require-dei-classes-after-youngkins-review" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">announcing course mandates wouldn’t go into effect this fall</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the person you let riff on</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2024/05/11/vcu-youngkin-commencement-walkout/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">musical metaphors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at commencement? I’m wondering if the folks who invited Youngkin would’ve allowed the fox to guard the henhouse, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A VCU spokesman told me that it’s par for the course to invite the state’s chief executive to address the graduating class. Brian McNeill said previous gubernatorial speakers from both parties include George Allen, Jim Gilmore, Mark Warner, Tim Kaine, Bob McDonnell and Terry McAuliffe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We invite varied leaders from different backgrounds and with different perspectives to share their stories with our graduating class,” he said by email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That may be. Though I don’t recall any recent governors as so overtly suspicious – and contemptuous of – the education community as Youngkin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McNeill said a</span><a href="https://president.vcu.edu/media/president-2021/media/docs/ootp2021-documents/HonoraryDegreesandOtherSpecialAwardsPolicy03-22-2019.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">special committee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> annually recommends possible commencement speakers. That panel may include: cabinet members; board, faculty and student representatives; and other people chosen by the president. He didn’t have a list of the group’s members this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wanted to know because it seems students, as on most campuses when such controversies arise, would’ve been the ones most likely to object. Were they outvoted?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some 1,200 graduating students signed up for the main commencement Saturday at the Greater Richmond Convention Center. Dozens walked out during Youngkin’s speech for a variety of reasons, including his crusade against efforts to promote racial equity in education and the teaching of Black history. Another reason students said they walked out was to support Palestinians during the ongoing</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/29/youngkin-says-no-encampments-on-virginia-campuses-supports-peaceful-protests/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Israeli military offensive in Gaza</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I asked a Youngkin spokesman about the guv’s reaction, Christian Martinez replied the day was about “celebrating the students.” That’s what you say when you deflect from the crux of the issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I noted earlier, the incident was a déjà vu moment. My mother had pleaded with me the morning of my graduation in 1981 not to protest. I was lukewarm about making any obvious display of disgust toward Bush.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet I supported others who turned their backs on the vice president, as dozens did that day. Bush, as a chief representative of the Reagan administration, had to answer for its regressive attitudes on race. If there were no public protest, it would’ve been a tacit approval of the administration’s social actions – some coded, some overt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though only in office a few months, some of the administration’s positions and viewpoints were clear:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2004/06/10/1953700/reagan-the-south-and-civil-rights" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The administration opposed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> affirmative action and busing for school integration. It threatened to veto an extension of the</span><a href="https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/civil-rights-act/immediate-impact.html#:~:text=The%20Voting%20Rights%20Act%20of%201965%20provided%20direct%20federal%20enforcement,register%20voters%20and%20observe%20elections." target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Voting Rights Act of 1965</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which had allowed many Blacks – especially in the South – to finally gain access to the ballot box. (</span><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/du-bois-review-social-science-research-on-race/article/reagan-legacy-and-the-racial-divide-in-the-george-w-bush-era/8B1FDB60B5252AE4B81733E78C701731" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reagan had opposed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act during his time in California, where he’d been governor. The landmark laws spurred equality for Black people in America.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plus, Reagan had been fond of relaying a story on the campaign trail about a notorious</span><a href="https://www.salon.com/2014/01/11/the_racism_at_the_heart_of_the_reagan_presidency/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“Chicago welfare queen.”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The undertones suggested Black people were getting unfair advantages at the expense of white people, even though the woman in question wasn’t typical of the average welfare recipient.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why, then, was Bush invited to my campus? Howard is a</span><a href="https://thedig.howard.edu/all-stories/howard-works-meet-operating-expenses-face-unprecedented-inflation#:~:text=As%20a%20federally%20chartered%20HBCU,of%20Howard%20University's%20operating%20budget." target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">federally chartered historically Black university</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and it gets a sizable federal appropriation each year. HU officials were likely currying favor with the new presidential administration – despite the blowback.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least, that’s what I remember from the time when I was more excited to earn my bachelor’s degree in print journalism than show disgust at Bush.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those memories came flooding back after I read about the VCU protest. I doubt most graduates will see the incident Saturday as anything more than a blip on an otherwise joyous day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The person who </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">should </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">be mortified, though, is Youngkin. His actions caused the protest in the first place. If he hadn’t politicized education, no one would even remember his speech – or the walkout.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, the Senate will announce its plans to form a similar committee on Tuesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;ve heard very different scenarios from those who were on the ground and in encampments either as students or as community members that were part of those protests,” Hashmi said. “I think it&#8217;s important to get a very clear picture of what&#8217;s happened.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demonstrators and faculty members have criticized law enforcement and college administrators for their handling of anti-war protests, including using pepper spray to clear encampments. While the majority of the protests in Virginia have called for a cease-fire in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas militants and have drawn attention to the </span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2023/10/9/israel-hamas-war-in-maps-and-charts-live-tracker" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">deaths of thousands</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Israeli and Palestinian citizens, some demonstrators have also claimed that protests have connections to antisemitic activity on campuses, </span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/local-news/richmond/its-overwhelmingly-difficult-to-be-jewish-at-the-moment-jewish-leader-says-vcu-pro-palestinian-protests-are-anti-semitic/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WRIC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reports</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hashmi, who serves as chair of the Senate Education and Health Committee, said on Monday she wants a more precise picture of how the protests unfolded after hearing various reports about the demonstrations that have yielded 80 student arrests at the University of Mary Washington, Virginia Commonwealth University, Virginia Tech and the University of Virginia over the Israel-Hamas war.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, said in a letter that Virginia must understand the policies allowing students to exercise their protected right to free speech while maintaining campus safety.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Approximately 75% of child care programs that received public funding previously did not participate in the state’s voluntary quality measures, according to Del. David Buolva, D-Fairfax, who co-patroned 2020 legislation that led to all publicly funded providers being required to participate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the following year, a pilot system known as the Unified Virginia Quality Birth to Five system, or </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/teaching-learning-assessment/early-childhood-care-education/quality-measurement-and-improvement-vqb5" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VQB5</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, was created to improve children’s school readiness and expand access to parents and support providers. Advocates say the new system is a critical tool for the state, providers and families to gauge the effectiveness of Virginia’s early childhood education programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is always important to have the data to show where young children are so that we can make the right investments moving forward,” said Alison Gilbreath, senior director for policy and programs for Voices for Virginia&#8217;s Children. “We want all children in Virginia to be ready for kindergarten when they reach that age and we also need to know what communities are struggling the most and sometimes the data can really help us understand what is working well and what isn&#8217;t.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kathy Glazer, president of the Virginia Early Childhood Foundation, said in a statement that the organization has been supportive of the system’s developments and implementation throughout the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By focusing on providing feedback to teachers regarding effective interactions with children and use of curricula that is aligned with Virginia’s early learning standards, VQB5 drives increased quality improvement across settings and classrooms,” Glazer said. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The new rating system</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, the Board of Education voted unanimously to adopt the system’s </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/54001/638492791550300000" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">guidelines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which will apply to over 3,200 birth-to-five programs including child care centers, and Head Start and Early Head Start programs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the rating system, a birth-to-five program’s quality of teaching and learning is measured by its interactions between a teacher and child, and a curriculum that is aligned with Virginia’s early learning and development standards. The department said provider profiles, including ratings, will be available online in the fall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guidelines will help the state understand how classroom-level experiences impact school readiness and longer-term child outcomes, and provide accurate and supportive feedback to meet diverse needs of classrooms. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Previous efforts</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The board’s vote builds on Virginia’s efforts, dating back to legislation in 2020, to improve school readiness for children.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Less than half of Virginia’s children enter kindergarten without any literacy, math and social-emotional skills they need for success, and [it’s] even more acute for at-risk children entering kindergarten,” said Bulova during a Feb. 7, 2020 House Appropriations committee hearing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation, which Buolva helped to carry along with then-Democratic Sen. Janet Howell, moved early care and education operations oversight from the Department of Social Services to the Department of Education because the previous system was “fragmented,” Bulova said, lost efficiency and confused providers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill also created the </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/data-policy-funding/virginia-board-of-education/board-committee-meetings/early-childhood-advisory-committee-ecac" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early Childhood Advisory Committee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is required to obtain federal funding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation also established the Early Childhood Advisory Committee (ECAC), which advises the board on all programs, systems and regulations related to Virginia’s unified early childhood system.</span></p>

(Photo by Matthew Holst/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — A congressional watchdog in a new report called on the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights to improve its enforcement of Title IX compliance in college athletics.</p>
<p>The U.S. Government Accountability Office in <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-24-105994" target="_blank">the report</a> issued Thursday appeared critical of the OCR’s oversight in expanding opportunities for women in college athletics, saying the office “conducts few proactive activities.” Women take part in college sports at lower rates than men, even though they enroll at higher rates, the report found.</p>
<p>The criticism also arrives at a time when women’s college sports, particularly basketball, have recently <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/08/womens-sports-could-bring-in-over-1-billion-in-2024-whats-driving-growth.html#:~:text=Deloitte%20forecasts%20that%20in%202024,in%20popularity%20of%20women's%20sports." target="_blank">gained more popularity</a> and viewership. The prominence of <a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2024/03/29/they-feel-seen-and-they-feel-validated/" target="_blank">Caitlin Clark</a>, the former guard for the University of Iowa women’s basketball team who became the <a href="https://www.ncaa.org/news/2024/3/3/features-caitlin-clark-joins-rare-company-to-hold-ncaa-records-across-mens-and-womens-basketball.aspx" target="_blank">NCAA</a> Division I’s all-time leading scorer across women’s and men’s basketball, has helped propel the momentum.</p>
<p>During the more than 50 years since its adoption, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 has prohibited discrimination based on sex in activities or programs receiving federal funding. The <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/ocr-higher-ed-athletic-resource-202302.pdf" target="_blank">federal law</a> also mandates “schools to provide equal opportunity based on sex.” The department’s <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/tix_dis.html" target="_blank">OCR</a> is tasked with enforcing compliance of Title IX.</p>
<p>Virginia Democratic Rep. Bobby Scott, ranking member of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, released the GAO report with U.S. Rep. Suzanne Bonamici, ranking member of the House Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education.</p>
<p>“Every student who wants to play a sport in college should have a fair and equal opportunity to do so,” said Scott.</p>
<p>“Regrettably, today’s GAO report confirms that while female college enrollment numbers outpace male enrollment, opportunities for female athletes significantly lag behind their male counterparts,” he said.</p>
<p>Bonamici, a Democrat from Oregon, said the federal law “sets a standard of equal opportunity that too many schools have failed to meet.” She added that the GAO report “shows that women enroll in college at a higher rate than men but consistently participate in college athletics at a lower rate than men.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Gap in women’s and men’s sports participation </h4>

	
<p>The report highlighted the persistent gap in college sports participation between women and men. Approximately 93% of colleges saw lower athletic participation rates for women relative to their enrollment rate during the 2021-2022 academic year.</p>
<p>Title IX also requires schools receiving federal funding to have participation numbers of men and women in college sports to be “substantially proportionate to their overall enrollment,” according to the <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/interath.html" target="_blank">Department of Education</a>.</p>
<p>Yet, women’s overall athletic participation rate fell 14 percentage points behind their enrollment rate in the 2021-2022 academic year, the GAO found.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Communication delays</h4>

	
<p>The GAO noted that the OCR made “limited use of available data for oversight purposes” and did not “always communicate with colleges in a timely way during monitoring.”</p>
<p>On average, it took half a year for the OCR to respond to colleges after “they submitted their Title IX athletics monitoring reports,” per the GAO.</p>
<p>The congressional watchdog found “years-long delays in communication between OCR and some colleges.” In 10 of 26 cases, it took at least a year or longer for the OCR to communicate with a college. In one case, it took nearly seven years for the OCR to approve the college’s proposed methodology for assessing whether it complied with Title IX athletics requirements, the GAO said.</p>
<p>In response to the report, Catherine Lhamon, assistant secretary for civil rights at the department, said the department is “fully committed to work with GAO to ensure the recommendations are implemented, to the extent possible.”</p>
<p>The attention paid to women’s sports is on the rise, thanks in part to Clark’s popularity on the court. Clark now plays for the WNBA’s Indiana Fever.</p>
<p>In April, the women’s basketball championship garnered more viewers compared to the men’s championship game for the first time in NCAA history, according to <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/news-center/2024/womens-college-basketball-championship-draws-record-breaking-18-9-million-viewers/" target="_blank">Nielsen</a>, which measures media audiences.</p>

(Style Weekly)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">University of Virginia leaders provided an update in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl8-8PsY9Ng" target="_blank">virtual town hall</a> on Tuesday about the protest on campus last Saturday where 27 people were arrested. A dozen were identified as students, three as either former students or employees and four as university employees, according to UVA President Jim Ryan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The remaining eight people were unaffiliated with the university, and one was charged with assault.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Saturday was a terrible and terribly sad and upsetting day,” said Ryan during the video call on Tuesday. “It was traumatic, I know, for everyone involved; it was far from the resolution I or any of my colleagues had hoped for.”</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="j6PoeyHNew"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/06/more-than-125-arrested-at-four-virginia-universities-amid-nationwide-protest-over-israel-hamas-war/">More than 125 arrested at four Virginia universities amid nationwide protests over Israel-Hamas war</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;More than 125 arrested at four Virginia universities amid nationwide protests over Israel-Hamas war&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/06/more-than-125-arrested-at-four-virginia-universities-amid-nationwide-protest-over-israel-hamas-war/embed/#?secret=WfSunE4hed#?secret=j6PoeyHNew" data-secret="j6PoeyHNew" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryan said Virginia State Police, who deployed pepper spray to clear an encampment on campus, became involved after officers met “physical confrontation and attempted assault” from protesters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That&#8217;s when the decision was made to call on the state police, after the protesters were given repeated warnings to leave and didn’t,” Ryan said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to a question sent in from the public about punishments the arrested students were facing, UVA Police Chief Tim Longo said he modified the no trespass orders for those students who were charged following the protest, to allow them “to complete their exams, [and] remain in their dormitory spaces until such time as their academic obligations are over.” After that, the orders will resume throughout the summer and will be lifted at the start of the fall semester, Longo said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryan also addressed questions about why the university’s response to Saturday’s protest over the Israel-Hamas war differed from its response to the Unite the Right rally in August 2017. In that event, hundreds of white nationalists, some carrying torches, marched through Charlottesville and clashed with counter protesters; one person was killed and 19 others injured. University and Charlottesville leaders faced sharp public criticism after the rally, which drew international attention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think, in hindsight, some of the difficulties with 2017 was not reacting quickly enough,” Ryan said. Concerning Saturday’s demonstration and the protesters’ encampment, Ryan said “I was thinking that if we don&#8217;t act and we don&#8217;t move, and we just let this unfold, are we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">going to be faced tomorrow with not 22 tents, but 50 tents, or 75 tents and with 20 outsiders? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then, where will we be? So it&#8217;s risky to act at any particular point, but it&#8217;s also risky to sit back and watch, and wait.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement following the president’s remarks, the American Association of University Professors at the University of Virginia condemned the administration’s actions and made several demands, including that the university drop any criminal and internal charges against students and faculty. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The association also said it found allegations that demonstrators were “unusually disruptive or a source of any danger to others unfounded.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We question the allegation that the demonstrators had clearly violated university policy,” the association wrote. “We further dispute that such violations – if indeed there were any – were anywhere close to sufficient to justify the extraordinary and unprecedented use of force we witnessed on Saturday.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The association wrote that the university’s Board of Visitors </span><a href="https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https://freespeech.virginia.edu/statement-free-expression-and-free-inquiry&amp;data=05%257C02%257C%257C4705e0a151a643894e4a08dc6e3e7495%257C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%257C1%257C0%257C638506461744653152%257CUnknown%257CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0=%257C0%257C%257C%257C&amp;sdata=ZkzX6lXJRuYX40Az3IVt/ysXNwXRIOf+Ip8utOEhDjk=&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has affirmed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that First Amendment protections apply to the University of Virginia and said it found the extreme use of force on University Grounds on Saturday an “inexcusable violation of these fundamental principles.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students have also been arrested on other college campuses in Virginia — the University of Mary Washington, Virginia Commonwealth University and Virginia Tech — as the world watches the raging war between Palestine and Israel that has lasted for over six months, following the Palestinian militant group Hamas’s assault on Israel near the Gaza Strip.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demonstrators in Virginia and across the country are calling for a cease-fire, for America to reject forms of hate and for universities to divest from companies with ties to Israel, which they say makes them complicit in the war.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two days ago, media reported the Hamas militant group has accepted an Egyptian-Qatari cease-fire proposal that could end a seven-month long war.<br />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department Of Education on Monday removed from committee review a lab school application from Ferrum College, a religious and private university, asking the commonwealth to pay $10.6 million for the initial four years of its initiative.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state’s College Partnership Laboratory Schools Committee did recommend three lab school applications to the Board of Education for final approval: Richard Bland College in Petersburg; Old Dominion University in Norfolk; and George Mason University in Fairfax. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The lab school committee had several questions regarding the [Ferrum College lab school] application,” said Todd Reid, a spokesperson for VDOE, adding that State Board President Grace Creasey wanted to ensure the school had more time to prepare responses and clarifications to those questions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reid did not provide a date for when the application would be back for the committee’s review. The next meeting is expected in June.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The attention on lab school applications comes after state Democrats opposed supporting private universities seeking to create lab schools with state funding, concerned that doing so would take away resources from public institutions.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Ferrum’s lab school application</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laboratory schools, which operate like charter schools, offer students tuition-free specialized instruction for high-demand careers like teaching, computer science and technology. Higher education institutions create their own curriculum for the programs, which is reviewed by the state, in partnership with local employers and community organizations. Students are accepted through a lottery system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to documents published on the department’s website, the department first received Ferrum College’s application to create the Ferrum College Academy for Opportunity and Innovation on Feb. 1. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The academy’s focus will be to provide high school students interested in employment in public service and health-related fields with dual enrollment options and industry credentials to get jobs and fast-track their careers by giving them the confidence and opportunity to seek early advancement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Franklin, Henry and Patrick counties expressed interest in partnering with the Ferrum Academy. According to the documents, Virginia Western Community College declined to participate, due to overlaps in programming with their own laboratory school grant applications, resulting in public school systems in Roanoke County and Roanoke City Public Schools declining to participate in the academy. Martinsville schools also declined to participate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ferrum’s application also stated that its academy would be an opportunity to involve homeschooled students, which would be allowed by state law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The stipulation that enrollment in the college partnership laboratory school ‘shall be open through a lottery process on a space-available basis to any student who is deemed to reside within the commonwealth’ … further underscores the opportunity to serve homeschooled students within the region,” Ferrum’s application read.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Ferrum’s application, tuition would be the largest non-personnel annual cost for the academy at $4,530 per pupil.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, the five-member committee did not comment on the application in an amended meeting agenda. Instead, the department removed the application documents before the committee meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lab school applications like Ferrum College’s are receiving more attention after the board approved and awarded funding for two private higher education institutions last month: Emory and Henry received $3.8 million, and Roanoke College received $2.3 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s unclear whether contracts for those applications have been signed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022, the General Assembly adopted </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/get/budget/4623/HB30/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chapter 2 of the 2022 Appropriation Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed, stipulating that a “college partnership laboratory school” means a public, nonsectarian, nonreligious school in the commonwealth established by a baccalaureate public institution of higher education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats said the language was created to keep funding focused on public four-year institutions before expanding to private or religious schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the Youngkin administration, with support from the attorney’s general office, says that definition in state law does not prohibit the committee from accepting applications from all institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee recommended lab school applications from Richard Bland College, ODU, and GMU be approved by the board. The board has already approved 12 lab school applications, including one for VCU, the first university to launch a lab school earlier this year.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virginia’s lab school landscape</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022, lawmakers passed </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB346" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> establishing laboratory schools. They appropriated $100 million to support the Virginia College Partnership Laboratory fund, established 12 years before for colleges and universities with teacher education programs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Out of the $100 million, $5 million was earmarked for planning grants to support eligible entities in the design of lab schools and to assist in drafting and submitting lab school applications to the board. A total of $20 million was designated for initial start-up grants for approved lab schools to make one-time purchases and $75 million for per-pupil operating grants to support ongoing expenses for lab school operation and maintenance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richard Bland College’s Globe Academy proposes creating engineer career pathways in science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM, using art for student vision planning. The academy’s enrollment will be focused on high school students at Petersburg City, Dinwiddie County, Sussex County and Prince George County Public Schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richard Bland’s application estimates first-year expenses will total $1.28 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Suffolk, Old Dominion University’s STEM Academy at Booker T. Washington Elementary School proposes offering hands-on experiences with science, technology, engineering and math to develop proficiency and promote critical thinking and problem-solving skills, prompting a deeper understanding of core subjects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The academy will be focused on serving elementary school students at Suffolk County Public Schools and will cost $1 million in the first year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the northernmost part of Virginia, George Mason University and Frederick County are partnering to develop The Shenandoah Valley Rural Regional College Partnership Laboratory School for Data Science, Computing and Applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The school, which will cost $1 million in its first year, will start with high school students enrolled at Frederick County Public Schools before expanding to other school divisions. In partnership with Laurel Ridge Community College, the lab school will focus on advancing data science, computing and applications for students and teachers through innovative research, education and community engagement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additional funding for Virginia lab schools is still uncertain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin proposed $60 million for lab schools in his budget presented late last year, but lawmakers offered no investments in their budget presented at the close of the legislative session in March. Both sides have traded exchanges over whether to include funding for lab schools in the two-year budget that is expected to be finalized next week, ahead of the current budget’s expiration on July 1.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin said encampments like this one at Columbia University in New York will not be allowed on Virginia campuses. On a growing number of college campuses throughout the country, student protesters are setting up tent encampments on school grounds to call for a ceasefire in Gaza and for their schools to divest from Israeli companies.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the most notable Virginia protests that led to arrests occurred at the University of Mary Washington, Virginia Commonwealth University, Virginia Tech and, most recently, the University of Virginia.</span></p>
<p>Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares said in a Sunday appearance on Fox News that protesters at UVA — where 25 people were arrested Saturday after Virginia State Police deployed pepper spray to clear an encampment that several staff and students described as peaceful — ignored multiple warnings to leave the area and &#8220;blocked and surrounded&#8221; campus officers, and &#8220;that&#8217;s when they had to ask for state police to intervene.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, May 3, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2024-05-03/youngkin-says-college-protests-have-crossed-peaceful" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during an interview with Bloomberg TV that his administration determined that nonstudents are causing “real problems” and inciting hate speech, antisemitism and violence during demonstrations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If they&#8217;re peaceful, then of course, that&#8217;s part of our constitutional right and part of the American fabric, but we can&#8217;t allow hate speech, antisemitism and most importantly, violence and disruption and threats,” said Youngkin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to media reports, multiple arrests have been made on Virginia’s college campuses as the world waits for a resolution in the war between Palestine and Israel that has lasted for over six months, following the Palestinian militant group Hamas’s assault on Israel near the Gaza Strip.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demonstrators across the country are calling for a cease-fire, for America to reject forms of hate and for universities to divest from companies with ties to Israel, which they say makes them complicit in the war.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This weekend, some state colleges and universities will hold their commencement ceremonies, hosting graduates’ families and other guests on campuses. On May 11, Youngkin will speak at VCU’s commencement ceremony at the university&#8217;s convention center. 13 people were arrested during last week’s demonstration on VCU’s campus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Commencement is an official university event and disruptions will not be tolerated,” said Brian McNeill, a spokesman for VCU. “We expect our graduates and their guests will celebrate with behavior that allows everyone to enjoy this milestone occasion. But anyone who engages in a prolonged disruption may be asked to leave the ceremony or could be removed from the Convention Center.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Michael Stowe, a spokesman for Virginia Tech, where more than 80 protesters were arrested last week, no changes are being made to any commencement activities in Blacksburg. He said any updates will be posted on the university’s </span><a href="https://commencement.vt.edu/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">commencement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> webpage.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Demonstrations</h4>

	
<p>On Saturday afternoon, 25 protesters were arrested at the University of Virginia, the culmination of a nearly week-long demonstration that University President Jim Ryan said in a <a href="https://news.virginia.edu/content/message-president-ryan" target="_blank">statement</a> started as &#8220;a peaceful public demonstration&#8221; near the university&#8217;s chapel Tuesday. It is not clear how many of those arrested were UVA students.</p>
<p>&#8220;We hoped and tried to handle this locally,&#8221; Ryan&#8217;s statement read in reference to the efforts of UVA Police Chief Tim Longo to allow protests to continue on campus for most of the week.&#8221;But when UPD’s attempts to resolve the situation were met with physical confrontation and attempted assault, it became necessary to rely on assistance from the Virginia State Police,&#8221; Ryan wrote, noting that people unaffiliated with UVA presented safety concerns at Saturday&#8217;s protest.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reality is that what you had at UVA is students that were warned repeatedly they were violating both the student code of conduct, that it was an unlawful assembly, there was trespassing, there were outsiders that were there,&#8221; Miyares said on Fox News Sunday after Saturday&#8217;s incidents at UVA. &#8220;One thing I want to stress is Virginia is not New York; you have a very different governor, you have a very different AG and we&#8217;re not gonna tolerate that.&#8221;</p>
<p>34 members of the school&#8217;s history department faculty released a <a href="https://twitter.com/ErikLinstrum/status/1787205261322563738/photo/1" target="_blank">statement</a> Saturday afternoon on X as the events on campus continued unfolding, condemning &#8220;the repression of a peaceful protest of our students by armed state police in riot gear.&#8221; The statement said university staff, students, and administrators had been collaborating since April 30 to ensure the protests stayed nonviolent so the educators were &#8220;stunned&#8221; by the university&#8217;s decision to call in state police.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beginning in the evening on Saturday, April 27 protesters in Fredericksburg, including  college students, were arrested by law enforcement amid demonstrations at the University of Mary Washington. Combined with those taken into custody at Virginia Tech and VCU, a total of 107 people were arrested, 68 of them students, at all three campuses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Richmond, demonstrators set up encampment structures that VCU said in an </span><a href="https://news.vcu.edu/article/2024/04/vcu-campus-update" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">April 30 statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> impacted campus operations and safety, and violated the university’s Reservation and Use of Space </span><a href="https://vcu.public.doctract.com/doctract/documentportal/08DA32A740D31FB4D9FC17CC1351AF65" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After law enforcement and university staff asked demonstrators “respectfully and repeatedly” to comply with policies throughout the day, including ones that bar the setting up of tents and other structures, the university said officers provided four mass warnings to individuals who chose not to leave the encampment before declaring an unlawful assembly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some demonstrators who chose not to leave threw objects at officers and sprayed them with unknown chemicals. Law enforcement officials responded using pepper spray to disperse the crowd. VCU Police report that officers did not use other chemical agents, such as tear gas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VCU said 13 individuals were arrested and charged with unlawful assembly and trespassing. Six of those arrested were students; these students will proceed normally through the university’s student conduct process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“VCU will enforce its directive that prohibits encampments, including the installation of structures and stockpiling items that could be used to build a structure or aid an encampment,” the university said in a statement. “This will be done to comply with our policies and to support allowing students, faculty and staff to complete the semester successfully.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Fredericksburg, law enforcement arrested 12 demonstrators, including nine students, for trespassing, according to a </span><a href="https://www.umw.edu/news/2024/04/27/message-from-the-president-jefferson-square/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from University President Troy Paino.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paino wrote that demonstrators were allowed to protest at Jefferson Square, according to the </span><a href="https://students.umw.edu/student-affairs/free-speech/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">university’s policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on expressive activity. But by the late afternoon on April 26, a threat assessment taken by officials determined the encampment was prohibited and tents were not permitted. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Against the guidelines, demonstrators put the tents back up on April 27, leading officials to cancel the remainder of the event.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paino said attendees were instructed to leave, but some remained, resulting in 12 being arrested for trespassing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Events that do not follow instructions, attempt to disrupt classes or activities, or endanger the health, safety, and security of our campus community will not be allowed,” Palino wrote in a letter to the university community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Blacksburg, Virginia Tech reported that 82 individuals, including 53 current Virginia Tech students, were arrested and all were charged with trespassing.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Reaction from legislature</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the aftermath of arrests at Mary Washington, Virginia Tech, VCU and UVA, leaders and lawmakers have reacted to the protests, with most asserting that they value free speech, but responding differently on how to demand change. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats have leaned on President Joe Biden’s </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/03/biden-backs-peaceful-protest-denounces-campus-chaos-over-gaza/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">message</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that states “peaceful protest is protected” in the United States and “violent protest is not protected. It’s against the law.”</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="4bOQfFIiiT"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/03/biden-backs-peaceful-protest-denounces-campus-chaos-over-gaza/">Biden backs peaceful protest, denounces campus ‘chaos’ over Gaza</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Biden backs peaceful protest, denounces campus ‘chaos’ over Gaza&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/03/biden-backs-peaceful-protest-denounces-campus-chaos-over-gaza/embed/#?secret=6I7Pta9ig7#?secret=4bOQfFIiiT" data-secret="4bOQfFIiiT" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville, <a href="https://twitter.com/CreighDeeds/status/1786852013969420324" target="_blank">said</a> Friday on X that UVA&#8217;s protests had been peaceful and questioned the police&#8217;s reaction to the demonstrations.</p>
<p>&#8220;I’m not sure what change provoked this sort of response by the police. Violence is unnecessary. I will be interested in knowing whether the change in tactics was decided in Charlottesville or Richmond.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Others have taken a stance to condemn the policing of the First Amendment, according to a joint statement signed by five Democratic lawmakers: Sen. Saddam Azlan Salaim, D-Fairfax, and Dels. Rozia Henson Jr., D-Prince William, Adele McClure, D-Arlington, Joshua Cole, D-Fredericksburg, and Nadarius Clark, D-Suffolk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Freedom of speech and the right to protest are rights protected by the United States Constitution. Full stop,&#8221; said Henson. &#8220;Arresting students for exercising their constitutionally protected rights to peacefully assemble and protest violence erodes confidence in our own governmental institutions and must be closely scrutinized.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group of lawmakers also urged colleges and universities that have arrested their own students for “participating in constitutionally protected protesting to de-escalate tensions,” to reconsider their actions and re-engage with students to “facilitate a more peaceful path forward.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Minority Leader Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, said his colleagues referenced in the joint statement fail to recognize the “unlawful nature” of some of these protests and associated themselves with the “worst of the bigoted messages” from demonstrators. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As long as these protests remain inside the rules of these universities, they have a right to happen, no matter how nauseating and odious the views on display,” Gilbert said in a </span><a href="https://virginiahouse.gop/2024/04/30/leader-gilbert-statement-on-campus-protests/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> applauding the governor, Attorney General Jason Miyares and law enforcement for the “even-handed way” they have handled the demonstrations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that if demonstrations turn into intimidating Jewish students, trespassing, or other illegal activity, they can be shut down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia’s colleges are not preschools where petulant children need to learn basic rules and manners,” Gilbert said. “Campus officials and law enforcement officers told these young adults the rules. They broke the rules, and now they’ll face the consequences.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The list of new rules designed to protect victims of campus sexual assaults and the rights of LGBTQ+ students has come under attack by Republican attorneys general in several states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares </span><a href="https://www.oag.state.va.us/media-center/news-releases/2727-april-30-2024-attorney-general-miyares-joins-fight-to-preserve-title-ix-student-privacy-and-fairness-for-women-in-education" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">called</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the changes a “dangerous overhaul” of Title IX, and said the new </span><a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/t9-unofficial-final-rule-2024.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rules</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would negatively impact students, families and schools in the commonwealth. The ruling also comes after Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/46509/638252918535370000" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">overhauled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the commonwealth’s transgender student policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Biden Administration&#8217;s unlawful rule would jeopardize half a century of landmark protections for women, forcing the administration’s social agenda onto the states by holding federal funding hostage,” Miyares said in a statement. “They are avoiding Congress and the constitutional process because they know it will not pass. We cannot roll back Title IX in the name of false equity.”</span></p>

(Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorney generals from Tennessee, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio and West Virginia have also signed onto the suit, which was filed in Tennessee. Separate lawsuits have been filed in other states, including </span><a href="https://lailluminator.com/2024/04/29/louisiana-sues-biden-administration-over-title-ix-rules-that-protect-lgbtq-students/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Louisiana</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Texas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Title IX, which has undergone several transformations based on the political party in office, was created to address women’s rights and prohibits any federally funded school or education program from discriminating against any student based on sex since it was established in 1972. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Department of Education said some differences compared to the previous version </span><a href="https://michiganadvance.com/2024/04/19/biden-administration-to-roll-back-the-betsy-devos-title-ix-rules/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">developed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> under the Trump administration, include protections against all sex-based harassment and discrimination, prohibits schools from sharing personal information and supports students and families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Narissa Rahaman, executive director for Equality Virginia, said in a statement that the rule prevents opponents from weakening “crucial” civil rights protections including for LGBTQ+ students by ensuring that pregnant and parenting students have a right to equal education opportunities, protecting student survivors and guaranteeing the rights of LGBTQ+ students to come to school as themselves without fear of harassment or discrimination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Students across races, places, and genders prove every day that they can do great things, especially when there are strong Title IX protections in place, which is why the Biden Administration’s updates to the Title IX rules are essential to ensure every student can thrive at school,” said Rahaman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new rule is slated to take effect on Aug. 1 and will apply to complaints of alleged conduct that occurs on or after that date, according to the Department of Education. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Protections</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the ruling protects students and employees from all sex-based harassment and discrimination, it will also impact LGBTQ+ students and employees, including providing complete protection from sex-based harassment and prohibiting schools from sharing personal information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schools must act “promptly and effectively” to protect and treat all students and staff who make complaints “equitably.” Schools must also provide support measures to complainants and respondents, and act to end any sex discrimination in their programs and prevent any recurrence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rule further clarifies the definition of “sex-based harassment,” which means to treat someone unfairly because of their gender; and the scope of sex discrimination, including schools’ obligations not to discriminate based on sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related conditions, sexual orientation, and gender identity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal agency said the changes will empower and support students and families by requiring schools to disclose their nondiscrimination policies and procedures to all students, employees, and other participants in their education programs so that students and families understand their rights.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final rule also protects against retaliation for students, employees, and others who exercise their Title IX rights, and supports the rights of parents and guardians to act on behalf of their elementary school and secondary school children. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rule also protects student privacy by prohibiting schools from disclosing personally identifiable information with limited exceptions, which is something the Youngkin administration has opposed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advocates say one of the rights students should have is the power to decide who finds out about their transgender status, to protect them from being bullied or harassed.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virginia policies</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, the first model </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/09/12/despite-law-few-virginia-school-districts-adopt-state-model-transgender-policies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">policies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for transgender students were designed under former Gov. Ralph Northam to provide school officials guidance on the treatment of transgender and nonbinary students and to protect the privacy and rights of these students. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, some schools declined to adopt the model policies, and the state law that led to them lacked enforcement incentives or penalties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current policies adopted by the Youngkin administration were revised to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/09/16/youngkin-administration-overhauls-virginia-transgender-student-policies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">require parental approval</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for any changes to students’ “names, nicknames, and/or pronouns,” direct schools to keep parents “informed about their children’s well-being” and require that student participation in activities and athletics and use of bathrooms be based on sex, “except to the extent that federal law otherwise requires.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia schools have also not fully adopted the newly revised policies, and state law has not changed since the policies were overhauled in 2023.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Education faces </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/aclu-sues-virginia-department-of-education-over-transgender-policies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two lawsuits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the policies adopted by the Youngkin administration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All Virginia students, including our transgender and non-binary students deserve to feel safe and welcomed at schools,” said Wyatt Rolla, a senior transgender rights attorney with the ACLU of Virginia. “Accessing restrooms, locker rooms and other facilities that are necessary when you are at school learning is a key part of our schools being inclusive of those transgender [and] non binary students that are part of our community.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Athletics not included</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The provisions under the new Title IX rule did not mention anything about requiring schools to allow transgender students to play on teams that align with their gender identity. Virginia has taken its own shot at banning transgender athletes from competing in sports through legislation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February, the Youngkin administration attempted to challenge the Virginia High School League’s policy on transgender athletes, the </span><a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/government-politics/youngkin-administration-play-to-change-policy-for-transgender-high-school-athletes-falls-short-in-charlottesville/article_0ab1748c-c54c-11ee-9a8f-4745a6f30110.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daily Progress</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed policy would have matched with the administration’s current </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/46509/638252918535370000" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">policies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that students should be placed on teams based on their biological sex rather than their gender identity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia High School League, which oversees interscholastic athletic competition for Virginia’s public high schools, </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OxLAgeE0tBHCgcHBdYoMBDGepYL2fN7W/view" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">allows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for transgender athletes to participate on teams that match their gender identity, but under certain conditions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simultaneously, lawmakers in the Virginia General Assembly controlled by Democrats killed bills, including </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB68" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 68</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, during the previous session that would have essentially banned transgender students from competing in sports.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Tammy Brankley Mulchi, R-Mecklenburg, who carried </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB723" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 723</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, said students like her 6-year-old granddaughter should have a choice to play with their own gender during a Feb. 1 Senate Education subcommittee hearing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mulchi’s bill would have required schools and colleges to have separate sports for boys and girls based on their biological sex. Any dispute would require a note from a doctor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If she [my granddaughter] wants to play an all-girl sport, I want her to play against girls that were born girls and not play against someone that is much stronger than her or can hurt her and take away her chances of a scholarship,” Mulchi said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Sen. Stella Pekarsky, D-Fairfax, argued during the February hearing that whether students are competing with their respective biological sex or not “children of all ages, sexes have different builds and strengths and no children are alike on the same team.”</span></p>

(Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)</p><p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden responded Thursday to weeks of protest on college campuses calling for a ceasefire in Gaza with a brief statement that the right to protest should be protected, but “not the right to cause chaos.”</p>
<p>“We are not an authoritarian nation where we silence people or squash dissent,” Biden said from the White House’s Roosevelt Room. “In fact, peaceful protest is in the best tradition of how Americans respond to consequential issues. But neither are we a lawless country.”</p>
<p>Biden said that the student-led protests have not made him reconsider policy in the Middle East and that he did not believe the National Guard should be authorized in response to protests across the country.</p>
<p>He criticized the protests that have led to classes being canceled.</p>
<p>“Dissent is essential to democracy, but dissent must never lead to disorder or to deny the rights of others so students can finish a semester or finish their college education,” Biden said. “Order must prevail.”</p>

<p>Students have set up encampments to protest the Israel-Hamas war at about 30 college campuses across the country, including <a href="https://lailluminator.com/2024/04/30/protestors-tulane/" target="_blank">Tulane University in Louisiana</a> and the <a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2024/05/01/police-dismantle-uw-madison-anti-war-encampment-protests-make-over-a-dozen-arrests/" target="_blank">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a>. Some have turned violent.</p>
<p>Fights broke out Tuesday night at UCLA when counter-protesters attempted to dismantle an encampment set up by protesters on the university’s campus, according to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/05/01/1248433624/protests-campus-ucla-universities-israel-gaza-palestinians" target="_blank">NPR. </a></p>
<p>“Violent protest is not protected,” Biden said. “Peaceful protest is.”</p>
<p>Student protesters have called for a ceasefire and for their institutions to divest from businesses that are tied to Israel, including companies that make weapons that have been used in the war.</p>
<p>More than 34,000 Palestinians have died in nearly seven months of war, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.</p>
<p>Universities have called in police to sweep the encampments, leading to about 1,300 arrests, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/may/02/where-are-the-us-college-campus-protests-and-what-is-happening" target="_blank">according to The Guardian</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Calls from Congress</strong></p>
<p>Lawmakers have also called on higher education institutions to quell the protests, and have raised concerns about antisemitism.</p>
<p>The House on Wednesday <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-speaker-leading-congressional-push-curb-campus-protests-over-gaza" target="_blank">passed a bipartisan bill</a> that would require the  Department of Education to use the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of antisemitism.</p>
<p>Republicans and some Democratic advocates of the bill have argued that the protests are a form of antisemitism.</p>
<p>Critics of the bill say it could chill freedom of speech at educational institutions.</p>
<p>Nationwide protests began at Columbia University in New York on April 17 after the university’s president, Minouche Shafik, <a href="https://edworkforce.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=410264" target="_blank">testified before</a> the House Education and Workforce committee about antisemitism on college campuses.</p>
<p>Students pitched tents to establish a “Gaza Solidarity Encampment.” A day later Shafik authorized the New York Police Department to sweep the area. NYPD officers arrested 108 students – the largest mass arrest on Columbia’s campus since 1968, <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2024/05/02/timeline-the-gaza-solidarity-encampment/" target="_blank">according to the independent student newspaper the Columbia Spectator. </a></p>
<p>After that sweep, students returned and stayed for two weeks until Tuesday, when hundreds of NYPD officers entered Columbia’s campus and cleared the encampments and Hamilton Hall, which students occupied, <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2024/04/30/nypd-sweeps-occupied-hamilton-hall-arrests-dozens/" target="_blank">according to the Columbia Spectator.</a></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A court hearing in the case had been scheduled for Wednesday. That hearing was called off after the two sides indicated they were trying to resolve the dispute less formally. Court records show the case hasn’t been fully dropped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a news release Wednesday afternoon, Bedford County Public Schools said the lawsuit was “never about collecting money from the parent.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While our lawsuit remains active, as a measure of good faith, we have instructed our attorney to reduce the monetary component of the lawsuit to $1,” the school division said. “If the Communication Plan is adhered to, we intend to dismiss the lawsuit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The school division’s statement said its leaders remain “strongly committed to parents’ rights.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We strongly encourage parents to actively participate and oversee the public education of their children,” the statement said. “However, we also strongly support our many excellent educators and staff. No parent has the right to inappropriately threaten or profanely abuse educators.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the school division’s statement suggested things were being worked out, Rife’s attorney, David Whitehurst, issued his own statement Thursday accusing school officials of backtracking and continuing to malign his client.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These are unsubstantiated allegations made in their lawsuit, which we have refuted, and on which no judge has yet ruled,” Whitehurst said. “To repeat them in a public statement is a continued effort to smear and tarnish Mr. Rife and his reputation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whitehurst also questioned the schools’ claim the suit wasn’t about money, saying the high damages sought from Rife caused “great stress and anxiety to both the parent and his son.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Their claim for damages included $350,000 in punitive damages, the maximum amount allowed under state law,” Whitehurst said. “This does not comport with a suit never being about money.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The school board, which serves a mostly rural county located between Lynchburg and Roanoke, filed the civil lawsuit against Rife in late March, alleging the frequency and tone of his calls, emails and in-person conversations with school employees amounted to unlawful intimidation and harassment. The school system’s court filings listed several examples of Rife using profanity and threatening to call the police on staffers whom he felt weren’t taking his concerns seriously and weren’t adequately educating his son.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, Rife and his attorney acknowledged Rife had used “impolite” language but portrayed the school board’s lawsuit as an effort to punish a parent for “passionately advocating” for their child. Rife’s concerns about how the school was handling his son’s learning disability were partially vindicated after he filed a complaint with the Virginia Department of Education early this year. The state agency ruled Bedford school officials weren’t in compliance with several elements of the individualized education program (IEP) designed to help Rife’s son improve his reading skills. Rife filed his own legal claims against the school division asking the court to require compliance with the IEP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The case sparked blowback locally. After news stories about the litigation were published, a Facebook page dedicated to discussion of Bedford County school issues lit up with questions about why the division felt it had to go as far as suing a parent for more than half a million dollars. Multiple school board members claimed the board wasn’t aware of the suit, according to reporting by </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/04/29/2-bedford-county-school-board-members-say-board-wasnt-aware-of-lawsuit-against-parent/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">regional news outlet Cardinal News</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, the school board itself was listed as the plaintiff bringing the case with assistance from attorneys in the Richmond office of the Sands Anderson law firm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whitehurst said the new rules on how Rife and school staff would interact was a joint agreement by both parties. Despite the board’s statement calling it a “communication plan,” Whitehurst said the two sides had previously agreed not to use that term.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rife’s lawyer also pointed out school officials don’t have the final say on whether the legal fight proceeds or not because Rife has filed competing claims about their failure to comply with the IEP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Two days ago, we felt hopeful that things were moving forward in a positive way in this case,” Whitehurst said. “The statement issued by the board has greatly dimmed that hope.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as many families with a college-bound high school senior know, this isn’t a normal year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delays in processing the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) form have students across the country stressed out, and understandably so. Typically, May 1 is the national college deposit deadline – but this year, many students haven’t yet received need-based financial aid offers from schools because of the federal delays in processing applications. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically, students file their FAFSA forms starting in the fall, meaning that by January or so, schools are receiving those forms and are able to create financial aid packages based on the forms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, the issues with the new forms meant that students couldn’t even start their applications until the end of December. That means schools like VCU are just now receiving financial information we need to process financial aid packages. This week VCU is starting to offer need-based aid packages to new students – nearly four months later than we usually do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without knowing how much financial aid they’ll receive to cover the cost, it could be challenging  for some families to decide which college their student will attend. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At VCU, our message to students is that the most important thing is to remain committed to their college education. This year’s FAFSA issues are stressful, yes – but they’re a glitch in the system, which is not the norm. We want students to understand that VCU and college administrators around the country are working to help them. We’ll get through this! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We applaud the federal government’s intent, which was to make the FAFSA form simpler and easier to use, especially for lower-income and middle-income students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Department of Education, simplifying the form should allow 610,000 more students to qualify for Pell grants, which go to low-income students, and almost 1.5 million more students will qualify for the maximum Pell grant. These are laudable goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is an issue which especially impacts VCU’s students, because so many of them rely on need-based financial aid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the current academic year, about 65% of VCU’s student body, and 71% of our undergraduates, are enrolled with a FAFSA. More than 30% of our student body is Pell-eligible, meaning their families have low incomes, and another third is made up of first-generation students. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FAFSA delay has a greater impact on those groups, but it also impacts middle-income families, who also often rely on need-based financial aid. In addition, the FAFSA is the first step toward other ways of paying for college, such as direct loans.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;FAFSA applicants face ‘minor issues’ during soft launch of new aid process&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/03/fafsa-applicants-face-minor-issues-during-soft-launch-of-new-aid-process/embed/#?secret=i80JFqAWj7#?secret=STNlMuCaLT" data-secret="STNlMuCaLT" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comparing the applications we received last year at this time to the ones we’ve received so far for next year, we’ve seen about 14% fewer FAFSA applications — which is still a better rate than the state and national averages. <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/bill.debaun.national.college.access.network/viz/NCANsFAFSATracker-2024-25FAFSACycle/HomePage?publish=yes" target="_blank">According</a> to the National College Attainment Network, FAFSA submissions are down 23.8% in Virginia and down 29% nationally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our expectation is that we’ll see that number tick up as the federal government processes more applications. While VCU, like many schools, has a May 1 deadline for commitments and financial deposits for the coming academic year, we’ve extended our deposit deadline to May 15. We understand the position our students are in. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, there are </span><b>proactive</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> steps both VCU, other Virginia institutions of higher learning and students can take. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On VCU’s end, we are processing aid packages as quickly as possible for the applications we’ve received. And this year, we’re also awarding merit-based financial aid earlier than we usually do, so students who qualify can use that to start making decisions. We’ve also made additional institutional aid available. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We encourage students – and potential students – to reach out to their financial aid counselors at the college they are considering, via phone or email. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And we encourage students to visit campus if they haven&#8217;t yet, to also speak in person with their financial aid counselor. Incoming students can connect with VCU’s financial counselors face-to-face and get a feel for the school, as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also want students to remember: every student who applies for FAFSA, and every college, are facing the same delays. A lot of students are just like them, waiting anxiously for their forms to process. And that will happen – later than we’d all like, but it will happen. Colleges are working with students to help make this process a little easier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the most important thing is that students not give up on college because of these delays. Their future is too important to let it be sidelined by what is ultimately a temporary timing issue. The FAFSA is just one step toward the bigger goal – getting an education that will allow them to pursue their dreams.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration, which has made </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/teaching-learning-assessment/specialized-instruction/laboratory-schools" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">laboratory schools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a priority since the governor’s term started in 2022, the </span><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1l1D4JcqarSrTO1cevIFiZmv1O-TJufM&amp;ll=39.786194094943916%2C-75.87854405056015&amp;z=7" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">list of applications</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> accepted by the board increased from six to 12 on April 18. The additions are Paul D. Camp Community College, George Mason University, Old Dominion University at Newport News and Chesapeake, and private schools Roanoke College and Emory and Henry College.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In a desperate move to advance his political agenda, the Governor’s administration is recklessly fast-tracking approvals of new lab schools and willfully breaking the law by extending state grant funding to private and two-year universities,” said James Fedderman, president of the Virginia Education Association in a statement. “Although these institutions can launch lab schools, the budget couldn’t be more clear that they are disqualified from receiving state grant funding.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Todd Reid, a spokesperson for the Virginia Department of Education, said in an email that for the past two years the department has been working closely with community colleges, universities, school divisions and communities on their lab school proposals and applications. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is no surprise that we are seeing several applicants now ready for board consideration as many of them have been moving on similar tracks through the planning process for a similar amount of time,” said Reid.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Why lab schools?</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laboratory schools, which operate like charter schools, offer students tuition-free specialized instruction for high-demand careers like teaching, computer science and technology; higher education institutions create their own curriculum, which is reviewed by the state, in partnership with local employers and community organizations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students are accepted through a lottery system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dating back to his campaign, the governor has called for more options for students, including providing more options for students in public education by expanding charter schools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In January 2022, Youngkin proposed in his first budget investing $150 million to kick start 20 new charter schools. During his first month in office, he </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/proclamations/proclamation-list/virginia-school-choice-week.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">signed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a proclamation standing up for school choice during School Choice Week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We must empower parents and students with choice and innovation in K-12 public education,” Youngkin said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But he faced opposition from Democrats on his pledge for school choice because it would siphon funding from already underfunded public schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By mid-February, the administration’s position changed slightly after Democrats killed efforts to add more charter schools. Laboratory schools then became Youngkin’s alternative to public schools. </span></p>

    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A debate over language</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later that year lawmakers passed </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB346" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> establishing laboratory schools and appropriated $100 million to support the Virginia College Partnership Laboratory fund, which had been established 12 years before for colleges and universities with teacher education programs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Out of the $100 million, $5 million was appropriated for planning grants to support eligible entities in the design of lab schools and to assist in drafting and submitting a lab school application to the board. A total $20 million was designated for initial start-up grants for approved lab schools to make one-time purchases and $75 million for per-pupil operating grants to support ongoing expenses for lab school operation and maintenance.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/get/budget/4623/HB30/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chapter 2 of the 2022 Appropriation Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which the governor signed, stipulated that a “college partnership laboratory school&#8221; means a public, nonsectarian, nonreligious school in the commonwealth established by a baccalaureate public institution of higher education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a Senate Finance and Appropriations Committee hearing at the time, then-Sen. George Barker, D-Fairfax, said the language was created to keep the funding for public four-year institutions before any expansion to other institutions of higher education is considered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That language is not squishy,” he said. “That language is very clear.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, however, the administration and legislature have debated which applicants can receive state funds under the definition of lab schools and how much funding should be appropriated over the next two years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s administration says the definition in state law does not prohibit the College Partnership Laboratory Schools Standing Committee from accepting applications from all institutions. In two April 10 letters, Deborah Love, a senior assistant attorney general, agreed, saying: “In my view, there are no legal impediments to the Standing Committee’s consideration of this application.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Love wrote that the office reviewed earlier versions of the </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/53941/638490432877400000" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roanoke</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/53925/638490432828330000" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emory &amp; Henry Colleges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> applications and provided feedback to the department on March 21 and April 4, and Feb. 2 and March 5. However, the feedback the office provided to the department was not included in the committee’s public documents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Democrats and the Virginia Education Association are critical of the education department awarding grants to private colleges such as Ferrum College, the University of Lynchburg and Virginia Union University.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Education Committee Chair Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield, said the administration attempted to rewrite the state code about establishing College Partnership Laboratory Schools prompting Democrats to make sure funding was supporting public education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We put a lot of safety rails on it so that so-called ‘college partnership schools’ would only be delivered through four-year institutions,” said Hashmi. “They would not be open to private actors and they would have to follow a process of approval that included local school divisions and so there has been a lot of effort on the administration’s part to bypass some of those safety rails that we put in.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Sen. Mark Peake, R-Lynchburg, said he hopes the state will support lab schools, public and private, both of which he pointed out benefit public school children.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m not looking at the school that&#8217;s providing it, I&#8217;m looking at students that are receiving it,” said Peake, who sits on the Senate Education committee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think we need to take new looks at how we are educating our children and the opportunities we&#8217;re giving our children, and that is especially the case after the learning shortfalls we have had since Governor [Ralph] Northam shut down our schools during the coronavirus,” Peake said. “When you look at the learning loss our students are facing since the coronavirus shut down, we&#8217;ve got to try everything possible to get our kids caught back up and if it&#8217;s lab schools, I think it&#8217;s a great opportunity.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Funding</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within the past two years, the Board of Education has accepted six lab school applications: Virginia Commonwealth University, James Madison University, the University of Mary Washington, the University of Virginia, and Germanna and Mountain Gateway Community Colleges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VCU’s partnership with </span><a href="https://coderva.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CodeRVA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Regional High School was the first application approved by the Board of Education and awarded $6 million. It opened in January. While VCU is a public university, the decision was criticized because it supported a regional school that was already “fully funded” and “fully staffed.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fedderman of the Virginia Education Association, suggested the money could have gone instead to neighboring Overby-Sheppard Elementary School in Richmond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia is one of the richest states in the country, yet we spend less per student in state funding than states with fewer resources, such as Alabama and West Virginia,” Fedderman said in a statement at the time. “Showering one school with huge amounts of state and local funding might look nice and distract some of the public, but parents of kids in other public schools want and deserve adequate funding for their students, too. Let’s work to fund all our public schools like we fund our lone lab school.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2024/1/HB30/Introduced/CR/125/18c/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reiterated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in budget amendments during the recent legislative session that public funds for lab schools should only be used for public four-year institutions. Youngkin and lawmakers have gone back and forth over whether to include funding for lab schools in the two year budget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After trading proposals, which included Youngkin proposing $60 million and the General Assembly offering no investments for lab schools, the two are at a stalemate before the current budget ends on July 1. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Change in process</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The budget negotiations and disagreements on language are not the only issues plaguing lab school decisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On April 11, Virginia’s College Partnership Laboratory Schools Standing Committee voted 3-2 to adjust the process for approving applications by cutting the number of reviews from two to one before submitting them to the Board of Education for final review. While some members said the move would help, others expressed concern after the process was created a year ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Board member Andy Rotherham, a Youngkin appointee on the committee, said the move would streamline the process for applicants to meet with reviewers and travel to Richmond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think we just need to continue to try to refine it [the process] to maintain the highest bar of quality, but also think about how can we do it as efficiently as possible,” Rotherham said at the meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said if the committee finds any issues with applications, it has options including sending applications to the board with conditions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the notable elements reviewed in applications is a school’s plan for serving all students including those with disabilities, English language learners, and students who are academically behind or gifted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title22.1/chapter19.1/section22.1-349.3/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, all lab schools are subject to “all federal and state and constitutional provisions prohibiting discrimination on the basis of disability, race, creed, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, religion, ancestry, or need for special education services.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applications must also include plans for student recruitment and enrollment, the school&#8217;s financial plan and policies, including financial controls and audit requirements; and assurances that the college partnership laboratory school is nonreligious in its programs, admission policies, employment practices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fundamentally the accountability for actually authorizing these schools lies with the nine members of the state board who it’s incumbent on them to look at everything including the public comment which is still provided in this process,” Rotherham said</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Board Vice President Bill Hansen, a Youngkin appointee, also supported the change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think it&#8217;s the evolution of where we are, where the Department of Education is, where we are in the process and I just really don’t have any concerns whatsoever that we’re going to be stepping away from quality outcomes of what we’re all seeking to achieve here,” Hansen said during the meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Joan Wodiska and Pam Moran, committee chair and vice chair, voted against changing the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moran asked the committee to consider keeping a second review on a case by case basis, but no action was taken.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t want to vote ‘no,’” said Moran. “I&#8217;d like to be able to have these proposals get the support and go through the process if they need to, and [if] there are some that are coming to us that we may say … ‘let&#8217;s send it on,’ I&#8217;m good with that;  but I don&#8217;t want to leave out a piece of the process that gets people something that they need to then get back to the place where they can go to the state board.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wodiska added that she believes having a first and final review is necessary, a historical practice done by the state board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The role of a standing committee as charged under law is to set a process to review applications,” Wodiska said. “That is our role, that is our charge. There are millions of taxpayer dollars at stake in these conversations, but most importantly is the welfare of the students and educational professionals that will be at these lab schools.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Education Committee Chair Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke, who represents a part of Roanoke City near Roanoke College, said he considered the board’s decision presumptive when the budget is not completed and the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission found that Virginia has been underfunding public education for a number of years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lab schools in and of themselves are not a bad idea,” Rasoul said. “The question is, are we going to be diverting funds when we just had a massive report from JLARC, saying how underfunded our public schools are, given that funds for new projects like this seem to divert away from needing to pay our teachers at the national average mental health resources and other critical services.”</span></p>

Sam Rasoul)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the unrest over actions in the Gaza War, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin said Sunday that the commonwealth will permit “peaceful” protests, but will not tolerate intimidation and encampments on college campuses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Saturday, protestors have been arrested at the </span><a href="https://www.fredericksburgfreepress.com/2024/04/27/breaking-umw-students-arrested-after-re-erecting-encampment/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">University of Mary Washington</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Fredericksburg and in Blacksburg at </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/04/29/arrests-virginiatech-gaza-protest-demonstration/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Tech</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During CNN’s “State of the Union” television show on Sunday, Youngkin <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=if4thxLa1GM" target="_blank">said</a> that the First Amendment encompasses freedom of expression and peaceful demonstration. Still, he added it does not allow for intimidating Jewish students, preventing them from attending class and using annihilation speech to express deeply antisemitic views.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The war between Palestine and Israel has lasted for over six months following the assault by the Palestinian militant group Hamas on Israel near the Gaza Strip.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-44124396" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">media reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, about 1,200 people died and more than 250 were taken as hostages to Gaza. In response, more than 33,000 Palestinians died from strikes by the Israeli military.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have been working with our Attorney General Jason Miyares, our university presidents, [and] law enforcement at the state, local, and campus level to make sure that if there are protests, they are peaceful,” said Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added “We will protect the ability to peacefully express yourself, but we&#8217;re not going to have the kinds of hate speech and intimidation that we&#8217;re seeing across the country in Virginia.”</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin said encampments like this one at Columbia University in New York will not be allowed on Virginia campuses.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to asking for a cease-fire and rejecting forms of hate, students across the country including those from Virginia Commonwealth University, George Mason University, the University of Mary Washington, Virginia Tech and the University of Virginia have joined efforts demanding schools to divest from companies with ties to Israel, which they see makes them complicit in the war. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public interest in the movement grew after arrests in other states as students and others were being arrested during protests at Columbia University in New York. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students began gathering last week in Massachusetts, California and around the nation’s capitol in Washington D.C. The protests derive from the decades-old campaign against Israel’s policies toward Palestinians: The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A coalition of student groups at the University of Virginia successfully passed a </span><a href="https://studentelections.virginia.edu/referenda" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">referendum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in March calling for the UVA to provide enhanced support to Palestinian students and divest any and all monies in its $13.6 billion endowment to any companies engaged in or profiting from Israel’s “apartheid regime and acute violence against Palestinians.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The student groups that sponsored the referenda included the Asian Students Union, Dissenters at UVA, DivestUVA, Minority Rights Coalition, Muslim Students Association, Muslims United and Students for Justice in Palestine. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morgan Meyer, a global studies major at UVA, </span><a href="https://jeffersonindependent.com/divest-from-death-uva-coalition-calls-referendum-on-uvas-complicity-in-israeli-war-crimes/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">​​wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Feb. 27 that “the student group is advocating for UVA to stop any role we may have in this massacre. They should be heard in our University’s tradition of civil discourse and debate, not maligned for daring to bring this initiative to the ballot.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Miyares wrote to the UVA Board of Visitors condemning the referendum and urging the board to reject it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares wrote that it was “stunning” that while Hamas continues to hold hostages, the students at the University of Virginia decided to hold a referendum “directly attacking the nation of Israel.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With rampant anti-Jewish bigotry being displayed on college campuses throughout our nation, it is disappointing to see UVA students put forth and then push a referendum that attacks the world’s only Jewish state,” Miyares wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/government-politics/virginia-ag-condemns-uva-student-vote-for-school-to-divest-from-israel/article_8be291c4-d7ff-11ee-a376-1b994c7656b3.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daily Progress</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported that the referendum is nonbinding and has no power over the board or the UVA Investment Management Company, which is responsible for the endowment fund.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, Youngkin signed </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb7" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> protecting Virginians from unlawful discrimination, hate crimes and antisemitism. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation codified a recommendation by the Commission to Combat Antisemitism that Virginia revise its laws to better protect Jewish citizens from hate crimes, along with Muslims, Sikhs and other ethnic-religious groups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke, chair of the Virginia House Education committee, posted Saturday on social media “Virginia Tech is making a statement” during a visit to Virginia Tech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added “Thank you to the students, staff and faculty calling for an end to the genocide and the liberation of occupied people.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In court filings, Bedford resident David Rife insists he’s the one being intimidated, noting that the county school board sued him shortly after he filed a complaint with the Virginia Department of Education saying local school officials weren’t following the individualized education program, or IEP, designed to accommodate his son’s learning disability and improve his reading skills. When he filed the complaint, Rife told state officials he feared he would face retaliation locally, according to court documents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The school board filed its lawsuit against Rife on March 26, roughly two months after Rife sent his complaint to state education officials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a March 29 letter responding to Rife’s complaint, state education officials ruled Bedford school officials were out of compliance in several policy areas and ordered the division to take corrective action in regards to Rife’s son by April 29.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his answer to the lawsuit, Rife suggested the timeline “suggests the possibility” the suit may have been retaliation and argues it’s school officials who are in the wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court case highlights ongoing disputes over parents’ rights in K-12 schools, <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/03/20/feds-identify-significant-ongoing-concerns-with-virginia-special-education/">spotty compliance with special education rules</a> and how public officials should handle unpleasant or hostile speech from critics.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="vSiKIUEfZk"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/29/virginia-adopts-regulatory-changes-for-special-education-amid-federal-review/">Virginia adopts regulatory changes for special education amid federal review</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia adopts regulatory changes for special education amid federal review&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/29/virginia-adopts-regulatory-changes-for-special-education-amid-federal-review/embed/#?secret=Bs4jpPvQkG#?secret=vSiKIUEfZk" data-secret="vSiKIUEfZk" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The case was brought on behalf of the Bedford School Board by attorneys in the Richmond office of Sands Anderson, a law firm that handles a variety of local government issues. A Sands Anderson attorney didn’t respond to a request for comment on Rife’s claims about the motivations for the suit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bedford School Board Chairman Marcus Hill didn’t respond to requests for comment Monday. The school board itself is the plaintiff suing Rife.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In court filings responding to the suit, Rife and his attorney contend he had good reason to be frustrated with Bedford schools over the lack of consideration for state and federal special education laws. Rife’s defense contends he only used “impolite” language while “passionately advocating” for his son, who suffers from anxiety and was reading at a fifth grade level as a sophomore in high school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is highly ironic that BCPS, whose School Board members have emphasized repeatedly and strongly the importance of protecting parental rights, have now sued a parent for a total of $600,000.00 because the school personnel did not like how he has advocated for his son,” said the response filed on Rife’s behalf by Bedford attorney David Whitehurst.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The civil suit claims Rife used “obscene, vulgar, profane, lewd, lascivious and/or indecent language” when interacting with school staff in person, over the phone and via email. The lawsuit lists several examples of Rife threatening to call the police, have people arrested, file lawsuits or initiate investigations over what he believed to be mistreatment of his son.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The filing recounts conversations in which Rife allegedly said the school principal should “get her head out of her ass” and said her “bullshit” was putting his son at risk. Documents filed in court also suggest Rife used the terms “asshole,” “jerk” and “jerkoff” to refer to school staff members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bedford school officials tried to put Rife on a communications plan in early 2023 that limited his contact with staff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Bedford County Public Schools expects parents to be respectful and civil when interacting with school staff members,” Deputy Superintendent Karen Woodford wrote to Rife last July in a letter filed with the lawsuit. “We will no longer tolerate your profanity to staff, threats, dishonest communication about people losing their jobs, yelling and speaking badly about staff members. If you cannot abide by this plan, I will limit your interaction with staff even more than it is at this time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the $600,000 the school board is seeking from Rife for “personal injury, lost profits, increased operating expenses and legal fees,” the board is asking the Bedford Circuit Court to order Rife to stop using vulgar language and follow the communications plan the school division laid out for him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Putting an end to the abuse of government resources is plainly in the public interest,” the school board’s lawyers wrote in a motion seeking an emergency injunction against Rife.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rife’s attorney has argued that nothing he said rises to the level of criminal conduct under the laws the school board pointed to dealing with using a computer or phone for harassment and “abusive language to another.” The communication plan the school division is asking the court to enforce states that Rife can only use email to contact the school principal and the division’s director of special education and says they “will not communicate through phone unless there is an emergency.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a competing motion asking the court to order Bedford County Public Schools to comply with the IEP plan, Rife’s side argued the injunction school officials were seeking would infringe on free speech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It would serve as a ‘lesson’ to other parents that advocating for their children could </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">result in being sued,” Rife’s motion says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The communications the school divisions objected to, Rife’s attorney argued in legal filings, should be understood in the context of a parent trying to help their child but getting little assistance from school officials. Many of the interactions school officials spotlighted involved Rife complaining about bullying by other students or behavior by teachers that he felt was adding to his son’s difficulties at school, according to court records.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One example is that Mr. Rife has been restricted from speaking directly with his son’s case manager or the reading specialist for over three years outside of IEP meetings,” Rife’s court filings say. “As would most parents in such a situation, this has caused him to become frustrated and upset, and that frustration has at times been expressed to school employees, but never with malice or threat.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The specific language school staff found offensive would “generally be considered fairly mild in today’s culture,” Rife’s court filings argue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State officials ruled Bedford officials were not in compliance with several sections of the student’s IEP calling for him to receive specialized instruction and assistance. For example, the plan called for the student to receive at least 45 minutes of reading services five times per week in a special education setting, but state officials determined he wasn’t always getting that level of instruction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state ordered Bedford school officials to reexamine the student’s IEP, discuss whether he needed extended school year services and review what “compensatory” assistance was necessary to address the impact on the student’s “access to a free appropriate public education.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorneys for the school board portrayed the lawsuit as a necessary step to safeguard the school division after less formal efforts to improve relations with Rife failed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The courts requiring Rife to communicate with school officials in a particular manner, the school board’s lawyers wrote, won’t impede his ability to have “reasonable, good faith communications with BCPS about his child’s education.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A hearing has not yet been scheduled in the case.</span></p>

(Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two Virginia school divisions are slated to launch a pilot program intended to help reduce youth involvement in gangs and violent behaviors with guns but it’s unclear if the initiative will be fully funded, as lawmakers go back to the drawing board to work up a new state spending plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On April 2, Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB626" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to create the Community Builders Pilot Program that will start with Roanoke and Petersburg City Public Schools students entering the eighth grade.  Pupils in both districts face high rates of </span><a href="https://www.wdbj7.com/2024/02/21/teen-injured-nw-roanoke-shooting/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gun violence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and cases of students </span><a href="https://www.progress-index.com/story/news/2022/03/28/petersburg-steps-up-security-high-school-after-gun-found-friday/7197148001/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bringing firearms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bill carriers Sen. Lashrecse Aird, D-Petersburg, and Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke, said unlike other community violence intervention efforts centered around getting weapons off the streets, their legislation takes a different approach because it centers students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re hoping by involving young people that perhaps it helps in other ways,” said Aird, adding that such a program could also have a “residual impact” on children facing disciplinary trouble in school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But ultimately, [this legislation] is specifically trying to make sure that when they are no longer in school, they have another outlet that&#8217;s pouring into them and they&#8217;re not getting involved in things that can be harmful to themselves and others when they are outside of the school walls,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the program is successful, Rasoul — who serves as the chair of the House Education Committee — said he hopes it will expand to other schools and grade levels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a great way to keep students focused, especially through the summer, and to build some healthy habits with a very specific curriculum that then follows them throughout their eighth grade year,” said Rasoul.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the pilot program legislation, the initiative will provide community engagement, workforce development, postsecondary education exploration, social-emotional education and development opportunities to students during the academic year after regular school hours and during the summer months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schools will collect data and report the program’s progress to the governor’s administration and General Assembly every November for the next two years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public interest in youth gun violence prevention has increased, most notably after a then-six-year-old student brought a firearm from home to his Newport News elementary school last year and shot his teacher. The teacher, Abigail Zwerner, was seriously injured but survived. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Community Builders program might have scored a legislative win, but funding for the program will remain unclear until the governor and leaders from the General Assembly determine the final budget before the June 30 deadline.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="rYZhcekC4b"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/17/virginia-legislature-will-consider-reworked-state-budget-in-may-13-special-session/">Virginia legislature will consider reworked state budget in May 13 special session</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia legislature will consider reworked state budget in May 13 special session&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/17/virginia-legislature-will-consider-reworked-state-budget-in-may-13-special-session/embed/#?secret=ZlRTGv9cyy#?secret=rYZhcekC4b" data-secret="rYZhcekC4b" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The General Assembly backed the pilot program with $800,000 in dedicated funds over the next two years. However, the governor amended the budget, cutting the request to $400,000. It’s an example of the governor’s and the General Assembly’s differing opinions on how the commonwealth should be funded for the next two years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Mike Cherry, R-Colonial Heights, who supported the Community Builders legislation, said during the Jan. 30 House Education subcommittee hearing that he believes it to be a “great model program” and would work well with </span><a href="https://ceasefirevirginia.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ceasefire Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in supporting communities facing high levels of crime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022, Ceasefire was launched as a multi-jurisdictional approach to address violent criminal activity among serious and repeat offenders in partnership with Virginia’s attorney general’s office, elected officials and law enforcement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The purpose of the initiative is to reduce violent crime through partnerships and investments into gang prevention and community policing. Ceasefire has been implemented in 13 cities statewide, including Petersburg and Roanoke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When you ask high school students &#8216;When did things start to go wrong?&#8217; many times they will point to the middle school level,&#8221; Verletta White, superintendent of Roanoke City Public Schools, said during a Jan. 30 House Education subcommittee hearing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We want to target our rising eighth graders and show them not only the detrimental effects of violence on a community, but their responsibility and how they can be community builders instead.&#8221;</span></p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="RvgH3za8Bq"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/29/virginia-senate-passes-bill-to-let-localities-increase-sales-tax-to-pay-for-school-construction/">Virginia Senate passes bill to let localities increase sales tax to pay for school construction</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia Senate passes bill to let localities increase sales tax to pay for school construction&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/29/virginia-senate-passes-bill-to-let-localities-increase-sales-tax-to-pay-for-school-construction/embed/#?secret=5qflIyor3a#?secret=RvgH3za8Bq" data-secret="RvgH3za8Bq" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the bill, local governments could only impose the 1% sales tax if voters approved the tax  in a referendum. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Youngkin said school construction is a “worthy cause,” Virginia has taken significant measures to address school construction costs, he added, and citizens should not be paying additional taxes — especially $1.5 billion annually that would be generated from the 1% sales tax.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The commonwealth should pursue a tax policy that unleashes economic development and prioritizes job and wage growth through innovative reforms,” said Youngkin in his </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+amd+SB14AG" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">veto</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “These reforms must allow hardworking Virginians to keep more of their money, not less; any proposal that increases the cost of living and the cost of business is not a policy we should pursue.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Virginia is a Dillon rule state, local governments are only allowed to exercise powers the legislature has specifically authorized them to have. While localities have control over adjustments to their property tax rates, they aren’t allowed to change the sales tax rate without explicit permission from the General Assembly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, state law only allows nine localities —  the counties of Charlotte, Gloucester, Halifax, Henry, Mecklenburg, Northampton, Patrick and Pittsylvania and the city of Danville — to impose a 1% sales tax to fund school construction and renovation projects. Similar legislation to add the city of </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB616" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Newport News</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the counties of </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB60" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prince Edward</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB193" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stafford</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the list failed during the last legislative session. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Education determined through a </span><a href="https://studiesvirginiageneralassembly.s3.amazonaws.com/meeting_docs/documents/000/000/979/original/Needs_and_Conditions_of_Virginia_School_Buildings_6.3.21.pdf?1622733329" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that over half of Virginia’s schools are over 50 years old, with replacement costs for each in the millions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor said the proposal would have given some localities a combined sales tax rate of eight percent, with no additional offsets, such as reduced income tax or property tax. Youngkin also pointed out that the bill would’ve allowed localities to use the sales tax revenue for purposes beyond funding school improvements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While the tax is dedicated to school capital costs, such as information technology, the new source of revenues would indirectly release funding for other purposes, supplanting other revenues without necessarily increasing education spending,” he said.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2022 state budget, the governor said, supported more than $3 billion in school construction projects through targeted assistance, formula-based school construction and modernization grants, and low-interest loans  — all achieved while providing citizens over $5 billion in tax relief.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s proposed “Common Ground” budget, which he </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Monday, supports a $1.2 billion increase in K-12 appropriations over the biennium and makes available substantial construction loan and grant funding for school construction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Jeremy McPike, D-Prince William, and Del. Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke, the 1% sales tax bill’s carriers, were displeased with the veto after garnering support from other lawmakers including Del. Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, who carried similar </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB600" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that was incorporated into Rasoul’s bill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McPike posted on </span><a href="https://twitter.com/JeremyMcPike" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">X</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that when students go to school, they’re not going to a Democratic or Republican school. They’re going to a school with a leaky roof.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This bill had remarkable bipartisan support from all corners of the state, and while schools all across the commonwealth continue to suffer from crumbling infrastructure, the governor continues to play political football,” McPike said. “Our kids deserve better.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rasoul said he learned about the decision late Monday night and was surprised, since the bill had significant support in both chambers and from the public.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So many localities in and around my region were happy to have this latitude to be able to raise funds for school construction, and the governor vetoing this bill that had such broad bipartisan support surprised so many,” Rasoul said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Association of Counties and Virginia Municipal League, representing local governments across the commonwealth, also supported the legislation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Without this permissive option, many counties and cities will have to fund school construction and modernization by increasing other taxes – such as the real estate tax – which places a greater burden on their residents,” said Josette Bulova, policy communication coordinator for VML.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeremy Bennett, director of intergovernmental affairs for VACO, said the association is still optimistic about the 1% sales tax bill and is focused on helping to maintain bipartisan support for it when lawmakers return for the reconvened session on April 17. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our folks view this as a tool to help their communities,” Bennett said. “It’s about giving parents and citizens a voice in their community and how they fund their schools, and yes, we are still hopeful that we can get this over the finish line, and our members want us to keep fighting for it.”</span></p>
