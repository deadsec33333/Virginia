<p>But have you never wondered how he became a man of so many names? From St. Nick to Santa to Kris Kringle, it’s a marvel that Rudolph isn’t completely confused about whom exactly he is working for.</p>
<p>So, <a href="https://www.valeriefridland.com/" target="_blank">as a linguist</a> who studies the social and historical paths that deliver the words we use, the season’s festive lights and boughs of holly inspired a deep dive into Santa’s past to uncover what name we should really be using for the man in red.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Ho, ho, ho</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>It might feel like he has been around as long as the North Pole, but the Santa Claus name so frequently mentioned by Americans to refer to old Saint Nicholas come Christmas Eve is a surprisingly recent moniker.</p>
<p>The first written citation for “Santa Claus” does not appear in the U.S. until the late 18th century, where it was alluded to in a mention of a religious event in the New York Gazette: “Last Monday the Anniversary of St. Nicholas, <a href="https://www.oed.com/dictionary/santa-claus_n" target="_blank">otherwise called St. A Claus</a>, was celebrated at Protestant-Hall.”</p>
<p>The fact that the first citation appeared in New York is not unusual, given New York’s history until 1664 <a href="https://www.nps.gov/mava/learn/historyculture/new-netherland.htm" target="_blank">as a Dutch colony</a> and the ongoing presence of Dutch settlers in that area. This Dutch background is key because Santa Claus is in fact <a href="https://www.oed.com/dictionary/santa-claus_n?tab=etymology" target="_blank">a borrowing into English of the Dutch </a>name Sinter Klaas, which sometimes dialectally appeared as Sante Klaas.</p>
<p>Still, before the 1830s, the substitution of Santa Claus for St. Nick was not in frequent use. In fact, prior to vastly increasing in general popularity toward the latter half of the 1800s, its use earlier that century was often to invoke Dutch heritage and culture, as in the <a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/oa-edit/10.1201/9781315225340-37/contested-representation-dutch-americans-washington-irving-history-new-york-baga-budianta" target="_blank">satirical writings of Washington Irving</a>.</p>
<p>For instance, a <a href="https://archive.org/details/salmagundiorwhim00irvi/page/n9/mode/2up" target="_blank">New York-based satirical magazine</a> of the era had this to say in 1808: “The noted St. Nicholas, vulgarly called Santa claus − of all the saints in the kalendar the most venerated by true hollanders, and their unsophisticated descendants.”</p>
<p>But, by the 1820s, <a href="https://collections.library.yale.edu/catalog/2014510" target="_blank">a children’s book</a> introduced Sante Claus in a sleigh pulled by reindeer, suggesting that his modern reputation was established by then. His iconic attire, though, didn’t become his standard uniform until a <a href="https://www.coca-colacompany.com/about-us/history/haddon-sundblom-and-the-coca-cola-santas" target="_blank">Coca-Cola advertisement</a> depicted him in red-suited splendor over a century later in 1930. Before then, Santa’s outfits had spanned the range from green and yellow to even <a href="https://www.scrippsnews.com/life/holidays-and-celebrations/why-is-santa-claus-dressed-in-red" target="_blank">patriotic stars and stripes</a>.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Old Saint Nick</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The popular term for Santa prior to this period was Saint Nicholas, a name known from the religious observance of the Feast Day of St. Nicholas on Dec. 6. <a href="https://theindoproject.org/celebrating-sinterklaas-part-of-our-dutch-culture/" target="_blank">The Dutch name, SinterKlaas</a>, is actually a derivative of the name Saint Nicholas.</p>
<p>Historically speaking, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Saint-Nicholas" target="_blank">the namesake of Saint Nicholas</a> was the highly charitable bishop of a Roman town called Myra during the fourth century. He had become the patron saint of children and was known as a man of great generosity. His background made him an easy candidate for later becoming associated with Christmas, even though he originally was celebrated on an entirely different day and for a different reason.</p>
<p>Whether going by St. Nick or Santa Claus, the man’s enormous celebrity as the grantor of tangible wishes also turned out to be another legacy of the Dutch, for it was their tradition <a href="https://www.stnicholascenter.org/around-the-world/customs/netherlands" target="_blank">to give small gifts or sweets</a> on St. Nicholas Day. And so, this Dutch tradition inspired the American mythologizing of a man with a sack of presents on his back to be delivered to children throughout the land.</p>

<div class="enlarge_hint"></div><figcaption><span class="caption">Saint Nicholas was likely based on the fourth-century Christian saint Nikolaos of Myra, seen here in an 1860 illustration, whose secret gift-giving gave rise to the traditional model of Santa Claus.</span> (<span class="attribution"><a class="source" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/coloured-woodblock-illustrations-showing-st-nicholas-news-photo/871956728?adppopup=true" target="_blank">Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)</a></span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The Kringle wrinkle</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Another name for Santa Claus that grew in popularity in the 1800s was the name Kris Kringle. While Santa Claus was Dutch, Kris Kringle <a href="https://www.wordorigins.org/big-list-entries/kris-kringle" target="_blank">came by way of the Germans</a> who first settled in Pennsylvania and <a href="https://mki.wisc.edu/exhibits/virtual-exhibits-2/how-german-is-american-3/how-german-is-american-settling-in-america/#:%7E:text=According%20to%20the%20U.S.,as%20America's%20%22German%20Belt.%22" target="_blank">then spread out</a>, particularly in the late 1800s.</p>
<p>The name Kris Kringle, though, was unrelated to Saint Nicholas. Instead, it came from the <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/Kriss%20Kringle" target="_blank">German word Christkindlein</a>, meaning “Christ child,” referring to the baby in the manger. So, unlike St. Nicholas, Kris Kringle is more directly related to the Christian celebration of Christ’s birth.</p>
<p>Over time, however, the feast of St. Nicholas, also celebrated by German immigrants, became increasingly merged with the celebration of Christmas in the U.S. Given the German influx into the United States was much greater than the Dutch during the 1800s, it is not surprising that the German name competed with the Dutch term during much of that period before Americans eventually decided to settle mainly on Santa Claus.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A man of many names</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In the end, whether it’s St. Nick, Santa or Kris Kringle who rides his sleigh into the holidays, the history of how he got his name is one that illustrates a wonderful melding of languages and cultures – a reminder of how differences can merge into a rich and varied part of a culture, celebrated by many.</p>

(Ty Jackson/Laaces Ouut Media)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Newport News task force, one of two recently established groups in Virginia investigating the historic displacement of Black communities by the state’s public universities, is facing allegations that it has not been open about its operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The six-member local government and university </span><a href="https://cnu.edu/news/2024/04/03-cnu-city-joint-task-force/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">joint initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, along with a separate nineteen-member statewide </span><a href="https://studies.virginiageneralassembly.gov/studies/720" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">panel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is seeking potential redress for Black residents that were uprooted to make way for university expansion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the state commission’s first meeting in August, Joni Ivey, a member of both bodies, appeared to address public criticism calling for “greater transparency” of the local working group. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It seems as if we&#8217;re quiet, but we&#8217;re working deeply to get knowledgeable about the information,&#8221; Ivey said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Newport News task force, which began working in April, is reviewing decisions made by city and university officials that led to the destruction of a Black middle-class community. These decisions were the focus of an </span><a href="https://vcij.org/stories/how-virginia-college-expanded-by-uprooting-black-neighborhood" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">investigative series</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Virginia Center for Investigative Journalism at WHRO and ProPublica, which examined the widespread displacement of Black residents by American colleges and universities. In the 1960s, an all-white Newport News council seized 60 acres to halt the Black community’s growth and build what is now Christopher Newport University (CNU). The university’s expansion overtime led to the acquisition of remaining homes. Today, only five remain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly all of the local task force members appointed by Newport News Mayor </span><a href="https://www.nnva.gov/2965/Mayors-Office" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phillip Jones</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and CNU President </span><a href="https://cnu.edu/whoweare/administration/president/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bill Kelly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are current city council and university officials. The lone citizen representative is Ivey, community leader and </span><a href="https://bobbyscott.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/house-floor-scott-honors-his-chief-staff-joni-ivey-her-retirement" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">retired Chief of Staff</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va. Task force meetings are also closed to the public. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ivey’s remarks follow a Daily Press editorial </span><a href="https://www.dailypress.com/2024/08/10/letters-for-aug-11-transparency-is-needed-from-cnus-newport-news-task-force-on-the-shoe-lane-neighborhood/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from a Newport News interfaith group, </span><a href="https://standrews-episcopal.org/pastoring-the-city/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pastoring the City</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which also criticized the task force for lacking ”direct representation” of the impacted community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were unhappy that no resident of Johnson Terrace or other representative of the Shoe Lane neighborhood were named to the task force,” their editorial stated. Pastoring the City demanded a timeline reflecting task force activities, Shoe Lane neighborhood appointments, and “assurances that CNU’s 2030 expansion will not include any more neighborhood homes.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Mercury sent Jones, Kelly and the task force a list of detailed questions about its appointments and operations. Neither answered questions directly, but responded with a Sept. 17 statement from CNU chief spokesperson Jim Hanchett indicating the local group is currently focused on “documenting all properties that once existed” on CNU’s main campus and “as we are able, meeting with the families currently living in that area of land and families who formerly lived in that area of land.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We continue our work, and will report on our progress as it is made,” the statement read.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vice Mayor </span><a href="https://www.nnva.gov/465/Elected-Officials" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Curtis Bethany</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and CNU Provost </span><a href="https://cnu.edu/people/qkidd/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quentin Kidd</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> told the Virginia Mercury in a separate statement on August 20th that the task force is in the process of scheduling interviews with impacted families.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The families will inform the ultimate recommendations and final report this task force produces,&#8221; Bethany and Kidd wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like the interfaith group, Minerva Douglas, who owns one of the remaining homes in the neighborhood displaced by CNU, questions their exclusion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why didn&#8217;t they include at least one person from (our) group to be on the task force?” Douglas asked. “It looks like they just overlooked us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest call for transparency highlights the lack of clarity on the broader Newport News community’s role in task force proceedings. Multiple statements have indicated that the city would “collaborate closely” with the community as well as CNU students, faculty, staff, alumni and administration. However, what remains unclear is whether community collaboration includes plans to consult with the city’s larger population while investigating the matter. Letters provided to the Virginia Mercury also suggest that at least two requests to Jones and Kelly for community or citizen appointments to the task force have gone unanswered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Audrey Perry Williams, a Newport News </span><a href="https://www.hamptonroadsasalh.org/about" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">historian</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who participated in a November 2023 CNU-sponsored </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rCpfFljGBw" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">panel discussion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about the displaced community, provided a letter dated February 5th, that she said she sent to Jones and Kelly after the task force’s announcement, advocating for resident appointments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I do hope the task force will invite the members of the affected community that are still living in the area,&#8221; wrote Williams, &#8220;and those that are no longer living there.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Williams told the Virginia Mercury she hasn’t received a direct response from Jones or Kelly, though she says the Mayor’s office sent a receipt acknowledging her letter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April, a week after Jones and Kelly </span><a href="https://cnu.edu/news/2024/04/03-cnu-city-joint-task-force/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">named</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> final members to the task force, concerns about the absence of a public process for membership were raised at a </span><a href="https://cnu.edu/ccejrp/conference/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">social justice conference</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on CNU’s campus. Pastoring the City hosted that discussion. According to their editorial, they sent letters afterwards to Jones and Kelly requesting a “public call for citizen participation” and a task force appointment from their organization.  Andrew Millard, who penned the editorial on behalf of the group, told the Virginia Mercury those requests also went unanswered. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to make sure this task force doesn&#8217;t ignore the residents, because they&#8217;re the ones who&#8217;ve been most impacted by this,” Millard said in an interview. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neither the cIty of Newport News nor Christopher Newport University would confirm if Jones or Kelly responded to letters from Williams or Pastoring the City. Additionally, they did not clarify if the two would consider adding new task force members. Questions about whether public participation or review of task force proceedings would be offered were similarly not addressed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a joint statement, the city and university reiterated the task force’s focus on researching the ”removal of the Shoe Lane community” and the expansion of CNU’s campus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Task Force</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> members are hard at work fulfilling this charge,” their Sept. 17 statement read. Hanchett further clarified with the statement provided that “neither the City or the University are involved in its day-to-day activities.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior statements from the task force have noted that the research of the group is the first of a three-phase plan that includes developing recommendations and implementing them. Amidst recent frustrations, the task force sent an </span><a href="https://cnu.edu/news/2024/08/19-cnu-nn-shoe-lane-task-force/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">update</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to reporters on Aug. 15 and posted an update on Aug. 19 stating the group was constructing a research timeline. The group or its co-chairs did not answer questions about when or if they would make a research timeline publicly available. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Bethany and Kidd’s update indicated that the task force has not yet completed its first phase, which they described as the “longest and most robust” and would include interviews with families as well as historians, policy makers and experts. The task force leaders also stated that the research would inform recommendations and they would seek feedback from families to refine them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The task force has not addressed questions seeking information on the number of family interviews the group has confirmed. The Virginia Mercury reached out to the five remaining households. Two households reported speaking to a member of the task force informally. Three said they have not received any correspondence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A member of one of those families, Dwayne Johnson, said he and his relatives have not heard from the task force. Johnson suggested that the city and university offer more oversight and open task force meetings to the families as a gesture of good faith.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There&#8217;s a lot of mistrust there because of how they&#8217;ve handled things in the past,” Johnson added. “Are we going to be trusting of them? They have to really show us something to even earn a little bit of it,” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gail Guynn, a remaining homeowner, also told the Virginia Mercury that the community as a whole hasn’t received official communication informing them of the task force’s plans and she’d like to see more details on its “members, its mission, action steps, how our input would be incorporated.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the Newport News group is working independently of the state commission, at some point their work may overlap, as the statewide group plans to consult with Virginia universities for its own research. The Virginia commission will assess what forms of compensation, if any, might be appropriate for impacted families or their descendants</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

McQuinn also underscored the commission&#8217;s commitment to repair harm caused to Virginia’s Black families.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Across this nation this has happened,&#8221; said McQuinn. “I&#8217;m hoping that as Virginians and (the) General Assembly, that we could say we’re ready to take on the challenges. We’re ready to stand in the face of this and address it.”</span></p>

(Library of Virginia)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;re moving soon and our new house sits on land that&#8217;s been in my family for generations. Wanting a clearer picture of the ancestors who passed the property down to us, my husband and I asked my aunts, our family historians, to do some genealogical sleuthing. They identified our long-dead relatives who settled the land after the Civil War but, just as interestingly, they uncovered a deed for a nearby family parcel that contained a </span><a href="https://mappingcville.com/2019/01/20/racial-covenants/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">racial covenant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The white parties in the 1940 deed agreed &#8220;not to sell the above described real estate to any one not of the caucasian race for the period of twenty-five (25) years from this date, with the exception of five acres thereof situated in the Northwest corner of the above described real estate which may be sold to Sally Bowles (colored).&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sally Bowles was my great-great-aunt and a Black woman entrepreneur in western Hanover County. White people in the area paid her to do their laundry and that&#8217;s probably why they deigned to sell her five measly acres of the 272 acres they were selling. Besides being proof of the historic, systemic exclusion of Black families from wealth building in Virginia and other southern states, my lingering questions about who my people were presents an opportunity to visit the Library of Virginia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Library, founded in 1823, is the state&#8217;s deepest trove of Virginia&#8217;s cultural history and includes over 130 million books, maps, periodicals and other materials that tell the story of who we were and are. Since 2014, the Library has offered a genealogy workshop series to teach people how to use its records and other resources to research their heritage and family lineage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We really began the series by focusing on beginning genealogy and then began expanding it to more specific types of records over the years,&#8221; Ginny Dunn, the Library&#8217;s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Archives &amp; Library Reference Services Manager, emailed me. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our military records, African American genealogy, and immigration records workshops have been among the most popular workshops.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I understand exactly why the African American genealogy workshop draws a lot of interest; although Black history doesn’t begin with slavery, that brutal institution robbed many Black families of being able to trace their roots beyond its reaches. That longing for our family, for knowing who we truly are and where they came from, has never left some of us. But finding out more about one&#8217;s familial past is a curiosity nearly everyone will experience at some point in their life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About &#8220;one-in-seven U.S. adults (15%) say they have ever used a mail-in DNA testing service from a company such as AncestryDNA or 23andMe,&#8221; a Pew Research Center </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2019/08/06/mail-in-dna-test-results-bring-surprises-about-family-history-for-many-users/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">survey </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">found in 2019. Eighty-seven percent of people who have used one of the kits said they did it to &#8220;learn more about where their family came from,&#8221; while 36% did it to &#8220;get information about their health or family medical history&#8221; and another 36% wanted to &#8220;connect with relatives they might have but didn&#8217;t know about.&#8221; People are getting to know themselves like never before and in our state, the Library of Virginia can aid those inquiries.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_38457" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:235px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/records-ledger-for-the-Bradshaw-family-of-Virginia_Library-of-Virginia.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-38457" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/records-ledger-for-the-Bradshaw-family-of-Virginia_Library-of-Virginia-235x300.jpg" alt="" width="235" height="300" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/records-ledger-for-the-Bradshaw-family-of-Virginia_Library-of-Virginia-235x300.jpg 235w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/records-ledger-for-the-Bradshaw-family-of-Virginia_Library-of-Virginia.jpg 728w" sizes="(max-width: 235px) 100vw, 235px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A records ledger for the Bradshaw family of Virginia is an example of the types of items Library of Virginia staff help patrons use to research their family histories. (Library of Virginia)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Many times when people come to the Library, they’ll say to us, ‘I want to search for my family,’ but they don&#8217;t know how to do it or what to do,” Dunn said. “We lead them through the steps, help them figure it out, and tell them you always start with yourself and work your way back through the records.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year’s series kicked off March 1 with a workshop that introduced 22 beginners to genealogical research, led by Dunn and education and program specialist </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anne McCrery. Dunn said the attendees enjoyed the experience and “asked a lot of questions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In mid-April, the Library hosted the second workshop, “How to Trace Your Virginia Roots,” and the series will continue May 3 with a workshop on how to use little-known records — including “Virginia penitentiary records, Prohibition Commission records, state mental hospital records, court order books” — to trace Virginia genealogy. The series runs through October. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The things we find out about our kin when we dig into our family history may surprise us. I learned, for instance, that my great aunt Lillian — niece of Sally, mentioned above —  was a nightclub singer and pianist who performed frequently in Richmond’s historic haven of Black culture, Jackson Ward, in its heyday. How glamorous she sounds! I’d been researching (often at the Library, sometimes assisted by legendary historian/then</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">-director of educational and outreach services Gregg Kimball)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://richmondmagazine.com/news/features/a-leader-from-leigh-st/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">writing</span></a> <a href="https://richmondmagazine.com/news/richmond-history/reflections-of-the-past/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">about</span></a> <a href="https://richmondmagazine.com/news/features/coming-home/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackson</span></a> <a href="https://richmondmagazine.com/news/features/still-standing/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ward</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for years without realizing I had a personal connection to the area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Others may find themselves similarly shocked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We had a patron find that her grandmother&#8217;s real name was different than she thought and also that she was married a different year than she had been told,” Dunn told me. “Another interesting thing that people have found is that a physical description of an ancestor (often found on a military pension record) is very similar to a living descendant.” She’s also seen “people who found something about their ancestry that is very emotional, and they&#8217;ll start crying. You just don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s crying in a good way or something upsetting.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the best work of my career I wrote on assignment for the Mercury, then under the leadership of Robert Zullo. I chronicled the plight of </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2018/12/04/growing-forward-facing-historic-and-modern-challenges-virginias-black-farmers-look-to-bolster-ranks-and-grow-their-communities/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black farmers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Virginia who faced discrimination from the federal government, and investigated the state’s </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2019/03/05/birthing-while-black-african-american-women-face-disproportionate-risks-during-pregnancy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">disproportionate maternal mortality</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rates. I appreciated the chance to write about environmental justice issues around the state, like the implications of a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2018/09/26/its-not-right-cumberland-residents-say-planned-landfill-will-disturb-historic-school-burial-grounds/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">planned landfill in Cumberland</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for example, and why alumni of a Rosenwald school within the area&#8217;s historic Black community objected to the facility. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My relationship with the Mercury gave me the chance to make connections with communities that still inform my work and understanding of the state’s dynamics. I met </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2018/11/08/state-board-will-decide-permit-for-buckingham-compressor-station-virginias-biggest-environmental-justice-debate/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">members of the Union Hill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> community who were waging an all-out war against the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, and tried to show the yearslong, statewide pattern of economic development at the expense of communities like the one I grew up in, where most people are Black, working class, good-hearted but tired of industry encroaching on them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They are putting this [compressor station] in this neighborhood because we are black,” I remember Ms. Ella Rose telling me when I was reporting on Union Hill for the Mercury back then.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was anxious thinking the pipeline&#8217;s compressor station would excise her &#8220;bear friend&#8221; and other animals from the woods surrounding her home. She and other residents asked hard questions — namely, why was it OK to put the compressor in a historic Black neighborhood but not in an affluent white one? — that I couldn&#8217;t answer. But I did ask decision makers to answer those inquiries; that kind of accountability seeking is an essential point of local journalism and remains one of my top goals as a journalist. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am and have always been interested in the problems and possibilities in Virginia. In why things are the way they are politically and culturally in this Southern state, a bedrock of American history that’s slowly transformed from red to purple to blue, reflecting the shifting sensibilities of its citizens.

Here, across 10 acres that rooted Richmond as the nation’s second-largest flesh market of the American slave trade, a new story seems about to begin, built on the old.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a splashy ceremony inside the cavernous upper level of Main Street Station last week, Richmond leaders unveiled before an audience of hundreds the Shockoe Project, a sprawling memorial pavilion dedicated to the hundreds of thousands of African Americans bought, sold and held there in the 19th century and their experiences as currency in Richmond’s prosperous slave economy. To call it ambitious is an understatement: The $265 million project is slated to take nearly 15 years to complete and will feature seven components that reveal the history of the site, and give it new meaning fit for a 21st century Virginia defined as much by its future as it has always been by its past.</span></p>

(Baskervill)</p></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are choosing to move forward by telling Shockoe’s complete story and by honoring and memorializing the lives of enslaved Africans,” outgoing Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney said Tuesday evening, placards of each of the project’s sites curving in a half circle along the front of the airy, glassed-in space, trains leaving and arriving at the outdoor platform a stone’s throw away. The plan proposes a 62,000 square foot National Slavery Museum, the Shockoe Institute, billed as the park’s introductory gateway housed inside Main Street Station, communal and green spaces, and then a restaurant and retail pavilion. All this, combined with existing elements including the African Burial Ground, the Trail of the Enslaved, Lumpkin’s Jail and Winfree Cottage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stoney said the Shockoe Project already has about $38 million in funding: $25 million stemming from the </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-05-09/richmond-budget-fiscal-2024-3billion-tax-housing-revenues" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capital Improvement Plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ensconced in the city’s 2024 fiscal year budget; $13 million in state dollars from the Virginia General Assembly, and an </span><a href="https://www.mellon.org/grant-details/shockoe-heritage-campus-center:-transforming-richmond's-core-commemorative-landscape-20451741" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$11 million grant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Mellon Foundation. “We’re choosing to embrace its complete history and use its unique position to tell a national and even global story of how slavery was intricately connected to this nation’s history, economy, culture and complexity,” Stoney said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That sounds like a very worthy endeavor; yet, much of this plan we’ve heard before, expressed through various, disjointed efforts by historians, politicians, racial justice advocates, preservation organizations and local and state entities. Stoney admitted that it has been at least a decade since the first plans to illuminate Shockoe’s dark history on a grander scale were proposed. People have been debating what to do with Shockoe Bottom for much longer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former Gov. L. Douglas Wilder </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/two-decades-later-donors-wondering-what-happened-to-plans-for-slavery-museum/2012/01/27/gIQAbEPe6Q_story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first pitched</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the National Slavery Museum idea in the 1990s, slated for completion in 2004, with Wilder elucidating his vision of historic grandeur over and over. Not only was it never built, but the organization filed for bankruptcy in 2012 and the former governor, the grandson of enslaved people and America’s first Black governor, </span><a href="https://www.wtvr.com/2014/05/08/wilder-slavery-museum" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">then suggested</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> moving the location of his elusive entity to Shockoe Bottom, where it was also never built. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.rva.gov/slave-trail-commission/richmond-city-council-slave-trail-commission" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond Slave Trail Commission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, founded in 1998, oversaw the installment of a </span><a href="https://www.rva.gov/sites/default/files/2022-06/Slave%20Trail%20Brochure.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">walking path</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that winds up from Manchester Docks through the bowels of Richmond’s slave market, allowing modern Virginians and visitors to follow in the footsteps of the bound, passing such horrors as Lumpkin’s Jail – the human holding pen appropriately nicknamed “the Devil’s Half Acre” – and the African Burial Ground (which was until, very recently, coated over with asphalt, a 20th century developmental disrespect to the sacred space which also bore witness to the </span><a href="https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=15116" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">execution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of enslaved blacksmith and literal freedom fighter </span><a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/gabriels-conspiracy-1800/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gabriel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). The commission’s longtime chair, Del. Dolores McQuinn, D-Richmond, said at Tuesday’s unveiling that the group’s yearslong effort to more fully pay homage to Shockoe’s history – including plans to build a museum at the Lumpkin’s Jail site, excavated in 2008 –  has at times seemed “insurmountable.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2013, former Richmond Mayor Dwight Jones put forward a monstrous plan to build a </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/richmond-mayor-plans-ballpark-near-site-slave-cemetery-prompts-outcry-flna2d11594917" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hybrid ballpark-slavery memorial</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Shockoe Bottom; thankfully, this very bad idea prompted public outcry and never made it off the bench. You should be sensing a theme by now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The memorial park, a foundational aspect of the Shockoe Project, comes courtesy of the </span><a href="https://www.sacredgroundproject.net/p/contribute.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sacred Ground Historical Reclamation Project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which proffered a community-led proposal for a nine-acre memorial park in 2015. Ana Edwards, a public historian, assistant professor in Virginia Commonwealth University’s African American studies department and Sacred Ground’s chair, is part of the Shockoe Project’s curatorial team. Among this esteemed group of historians whose job it is to “get the story right,” Edwards said she’s an accountability partner who has every reason to believe that this time, Shockoe’s story will be fully, finally told.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s different is, all of these elements have come together into a comprehensive plan,” Edwards said in a phone interview. “That&#8217;s never happened before. There’s never been so much collective cooperation on this effort before, and much of it comes directly from [the] community.” The intention that the space will emotionally, spiritually, economically and socially benefit Black people, who have so often endured social injustice in this state and country, is another key piece that is starkly different from past endeavors, said Edwards.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This Black cultural resource is for humanity, but it cannot come into being and generate revenue for the city without it benefitting the Black community. That is baked into this.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By incorporating the Trail of the Enslaved, McQuinn depicted the Shockoe Project as a new way to “leave … a legacy of truth, narrated by the living and by those who we cannot see, but who see us. Narrated from the grave.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many may doubt that the Shockoe Project can be manifested from renderings and grand pans into reality; given the history, it’s understandable if they do. But I want to believe that this project will come to fruition. I would love to take my family there, not to wallow in the suffering of our ancestors, but to show my sons part of our historic narrative as the descendants of free and enslaved Black Virginians. I want to reflect on our peoples’ strength in a space specifically designed to imbue those ancestors with the dignity they were denied in life.</span></p>

The first phase of the project, the Shockoe Institute, is scheduled to open next summer; may the climb continue.</span></p>

Robert E. Lee was taken off its pedestal Wednesday on Monument Avenue in Richmond. (Scott Elmquist/ Style Weekly)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislation that would end Virginia’s issuance of two license plates that honor Robert E. Lee as “The Virginia Gentleman” and spotlight the Sons of Confederate Veterans is headed to Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s desk. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB812" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the second attempt by Del. Candi Mundon King, D-Prince William, to get rid of the Robert E. Lee plate, which was approved virtually unanimously by the General Assembly in 2007 but has become increasingly unpalatable to Democrats eager to cut ties between the modern state and its Confederate past. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This bill is needed to help us end the false narrative of the Lost Cause and help us embrace the fact that General Lee was anything but a gentleman,” Mundon King said on the House floor earlier this month. “He was a traitor to this country, a brutal enslaver and not worthy of being celebrated on our license plate.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, Mundon King’s legislation failed in the Republican-controlled House of Delegates. But since then, Democrats have won narrow control over both legislative chambers, and on Tuesday, the Senate voted 21-17 to forward the proposal to Youngkin. The Republican governor will now have to decide whether to allow it to become law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked about the governor’s plans, Youngkin spokesperson Christian Martinez said only that Youngkin “will review any legislation that comes to his desk.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It won’t be the only bill dealing with Virginia’s Confederate history that the governor will have to make a decision on: On Monday, the Virginia House took a final vote on legislation that would strip the United Daughters of the Confederacy of a unique tax exemption written into state code that has allowed the organization to pay no property taxes on its Richmond headquarters for decades.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans have largely opposed both measures, although a few in the House have backed the license plate bill, including Dels. Amanda Batten, R-James City; Rob Bloxom, R-Accomack; Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield; and A.C. Cordoza, R-Hampton, the chamber’s only Black Republican. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland, said getting rid of the license plates would violate constitutional free speech protections because the license plate program overseen by the state Department of Motor Vehicles “is a modern-day courthouse square” where people can share their views. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If we pass this bill, a citizen will sue Virginia, and they will use this debate to show the intent of this bill is to kill speech because some in this body did not like the message,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Tim Griffin, R-Bedford, similarly argued in a House committee debate that the legislation constituted “viewpoint discrimination.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The reason that we have First Amendment protections of speech in general is so that we protect speech that not everybody likes,” he said. “There’s an abortion plate on there that I find disgusting personally, but I’m not going to move to remove it just because I don’t agree with it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Mundon King noted the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled states have the right to regulate license plates because they represent government speech, not private speech. That case, Walker v. Sons of Confederate Veterans, freed up Virginia to enforce a law prohibiting specialty Sons of Confederate Veterans license plates </span><a href="https://www.arlnow.com/2015/07/31/judge-rules-in-favor-of-removing-confederate-flag-from-va-license-plates/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">from displaying the Confederate battle flag</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those plates were </span><a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/local/virginia/with-redesign-va-lowering-confederate-flag-plate/291-221410074" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">replaced with a new design</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that bore the group’s name and the silhouette of three soldiers on horseback. Under Mundon King’s legislation, the state would also stop issuing that design, although holders of both the SCV and Robert E. Lee plates would be free to use them until their expiration date. The changes would affect about 2,300 people: According to the DMV, there were 1,783 Robert E. Lee plates and 543 Sons of Confederate Veterans plates in circulation as of Feb. 27.</span></p>
<p>The Virginia Division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We also make decisions on these plates all the time,” said Mundon King. “And what I’m simply asking is that we make a decision to leave the Confederacy in history books and not on license plates and not continue to venerate someone who is not worthy of being honored.” </span></p>

A National Historic Landmark, visitors may now visit the building that became a museum in 1896. (Matthew Brady/National Archives)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a move prompted by a persistent Virginia Beach teenager, the Virginia Senate this week advanced a bill to remove the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) from the list of nonprofit and charitable organizations exempt from real estate, deed recordation and personal property taxes in Virginia state code. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fantastic. As </span><a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/united-daughters-of-the-confederacy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lost Cause devotees and American traitor venerators</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the UDC should never have been on that list to begin with. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/02/07/virginia-assembly-confederate-tax-exemption/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington Post&#8217;s Greg Schneider reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Virginia Beach high schooler Simone Nied, 17, started advocating for the UDC&#8217;s tax exemptions to be stripped two years ago. Her requests culminated in </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB568" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House of Delegates </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB517" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bills to do just that. The loss of the tax exemptions, as Schneider noted, could mean a yearly tax payment to the state of at least $50,000, if the measures are approved by Gov. Glenn Youngkin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 1890s when the UDC was founded, America was in the final throes of Reconstruction, the process of putting our fractured nation back together again after the Civil War. For a short time, it seemed the country would make good on its promises of life and liberty to millions of Black Americans who had been freed from slavery and were eager to enjoy the full benefits of citizenship. They bought land and started farms, educated themselves and even pursued </span><a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/african-american-legislators-in-virginia-1867-1899/#:~:text=%E2%80%931878%2C%20Republican.-,John%20Robinson%20(1825%20or%201826%E2%80%931908)%2C%20from%20Cumberland,%2C%201869%E2%80%931871%2C%20Republican." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">political power</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then </span><a href="https://www.history.com/topics/early-20th-century-us/jim-crow-laws" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jim Crow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> came, which rolled back most of that progress and all but stamped out the fledgling embers of advancement Black people had strived so hard to achieve. As Black Virginians entered the nadir of 20th century racial terror and socioeconomic disenfranchisement, the UDC was founded under the banner of honoring the Confederate soldiers who had fought for the right to continue enslaving those same Black Virginians’ parents, grandparents and ancestors. The daughters and descendents of Confederates in Virginia and elsewhere in the South were determined to restore the social dichotomies and disparities of the “good old days,” when African Americans had no civil or human rights and when white people wielded power in all aspects of society. It is no coincidence that most of Virginia’s Confederate monuments and memorial societies were </span><a href="https://www.splcenter.org/20190201/whose-heritage-public-symbols-confederacy" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">created</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as the nation reenacted a legal system of segregation and discrimination designed to put Black folks back in their place and keep white folks on top. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UDC has continued to cling to this mission, often disguised with flowery phrases about honoring Southern sacrifice and bravery while never acknowledging the white supremacist ideals that intertwine that mindset. The hate such a stance represents cannot be separated from its heritage — I don’t care how many tepid anti-racism statements UDC adds to their largely-inaccessible-to-the-public </span><a href="https://hqudc.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or how much bunk they get unnamed advocates to spew in newspapers alleging their group </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“only does good in its community.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s with all of this in mind that I commend Ms. Nied and Virginia’s senators and delegates for trying to stop public dollars from subsidizing an organization inextricably rooted on the wrong side of history. It’s a nice companion to other </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB132" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and resolutions focused on righting wrongs, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB32" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">improving lives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SJ16" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">acknowledging</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — if not repairing — harms endured by Virginians of color for centuries. The Senate and House legislation on ending UDC’s tax breaks needs to be reconciled, and then the ball will be in Gov. Youngkin’s court.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An aside: I don’t know if our governor will accept the Assembly’s proposal, but it would be hard to imagine any modern-day presidential hopeful successfully ascending to the White House trailing the scent of moldy Confederate memorials. If the top job of leading an increasingly multicultural 21st century America is his ambition, he’d do well to sop up his </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/12/16/confederate-memorial-arlington-cemetery/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">disappointment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the removal of mementos commemorating the most divisive period of the nation’s history from public spaces, and he probably shouldn’t buck the proposed end of the UDC’s tax-free days either.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we’re considering organizations that don’t deserve to skip out on paying taxes, I’d suggest some Virginia churches be next up for review. Specifically, the ones that </span><a href="https://www.christianpost.com/news/judge-rejects-churches-challenge-to-virginia-lgbt-antidiscrimination-law.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">discriminate against LGBTQ+ people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, allow </span><a href="https://www.timesnews.net/news/education/church-rally-focuses-on-political-participation/article_a7526f66-f0d9-11eb-94f9-377865f0f2d4.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">politics to infiltrate the pulpit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and destroy </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/style/wp/2018/06/25/feature/former-members-say-calvary-temple-splits-families-what-happens-to-those-who-leave/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">family relationships</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The point is not to persecute religious organizations, most of which I believe provide foundational support to many citizens’ spiritual and emotional wellbeing and strengthen communities in ways more valuable than mere money ever could. But just as legislators’ proposal to end the UDC’s tax-free days exemplifies, reexamining the activities of wayward churches would be another opportunity to seriously consider if we’re using our state’s fiscal resources the best and fairest way we can. Can I get an amen? </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Untold and uncelebrated, until very recently, were the stories of our nation’s birth and evolution that featured people who looked like me and my family, Black people whose sacrifices, smarts and strengths built a solid foundation for the country and then carried it forward on their backs. Instead, these people were cast as minor supporting characters in the Virginia story, often nameless beyond the inherently degrading title of “slaves.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ones whose names we will never know — including most of the first Africans who landed on Virginia’s shores and were cast into a life of forced servitude and the millions of Black Virginians whose enslavement stretched across almost 250 years — far outweigh the few whose names we do: </span><a href="https://virginiahistory.org/learn/affidavit-1693" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anthony and Mary Johnson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who were brought here in 1620, eventually worked their way out of slavery, became landowners and raised free children; </span><a href="https://www.lva.virginia.gov/public/dvb/bio.asp?b=Key_Elizabeth_fl_1655-1660" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elizabeth Key</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who in 1656 set a precedent as the first Black female Virginian to sue for her freedom and win it; </span><a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/turners-revolt-nat-1831/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nat Turner</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a 19th century enslaved preacher and Southampton County freedom fighter; and select others whose names and deeds are usually relegated to Black History Month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was all the more momentous to me, then — a seventh generation Black Virginian descended from enslaved people and freedmen in Hanover County — to see <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2024/01/10/historic-display-of-racial-gender-diversity-marks-the-start-of-2024-general-assembly-session/" target="_blank">history made this week</a> by Del. Don Scott, who became the first-ever Black speaker of Virginia’s House of Delegates when the legislature opened Wednesday. His words upon his ascension both hearken back and press forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every time I look around this room I see this: I see the ghosts of those people who worked here, those Black folks who were enslaved here, whose dignity and humanity was discounted right here in this room. I see those people. And I know we, not just I, we carry their hopes and dreams.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott is a husband, father, son, attorney and a former federal prison inmate. Some would say he’s an unlikely hero in Virginia’s story — which, after 400 years, is still being written — only now with more than just white men as the central stars. Scott is one member of arguably the most racially diverse Virginia General Assembly since Reconstruction, evidenced by a record number of Legislative Black Caucus members, composed of 32 elected leaders in the House and Senate. There are also more women serving in the statehouse, too, with 15 women in the Senate, the most ever. Additionally, this session saw the first Bangladeshi-American and first trans Virginia senators sworn in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of this shows that we’re living in transformative times; Black Virginians and others of color now see themselves reflected in state politicians who champion policy and issues that impact their daily lives. All this, even as diversity has become a bad word, depending on who you ask. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we truly believe in the founding ideals of liberty, justice and freedom that undergird our nation, we can’t focus only on Virginia’s historic firsts without a mind to protect the progress they represent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a very real and sustained effort to censor and diminish Black history education in America right now, and Virginia school districts are at this moment </span><a href="https://www.dnronline.com/news/rockingham-county-school-board-votes-to-temporarily-remove-list-of-55-books/article_2c60d75f-7022-5ec9-8ecd-201afec3939b.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">removing</span></a> <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/richmond/2023/11/20/virginia-hanover-county-book-ban-wicked-handmaids-tale" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">books</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Black authors from library shelves, and ones that broach sexuality.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each one represents a chance to author a more inclusive narrative of the commonwealth and to ensure all its citizens have an opportunity to be governed by a legislature that’s historically diverse and progressive, in appearance, words and deeds. Virginia’s story, our story, continues. </span></p>

(Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homeownership is a key factor in building wealth and achieving the American dream but it has never been accessible to all Americans. Recent reports of racial disparities in mortgage loan lending at Navy Federal Credit Union – the largest credit union in America, based in Virginia – demonstrate the persistent challenges people of color face in the quest to buy homes and create financial legacies for their families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This present-day disparity, </span><a href="https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/how-local-differences-race-and-place-affect-mortgage-lending#:~:text=Black%20applicants%20were%20between%201.8,white%20applicants%20across%20neighborhood%20types." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pervasive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> within lending institutions and neighborhoods nationwide, reflects America’s historically inequitable economic systems and social practices, which intentionally excluded Black people and others of color from some of the most basic but most critical aspects of American liberty and progress.</span></p>

    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Racial disparities in home lending</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/14/business/navy-federal-credit-union-black-applicants-invs/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNN analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that Navy Federal approved over 75% of conventional mortgage loan applications by white borrowers, but approved less than 50% of Black borrowers seeking the same loan. It was “the widest disparity in mortgage approval rates between White and Black borrowers of any major lender,” CNN reported. The deep disparity persists</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “even when more than a dozen different variables – including income, debt-to-income ratio, property value, down payment percentage, and neighborhood characteristics – were the same.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Navy Federal denied that its lending practices are discriminatory against Black borrowers, with the credit union’s spokesperson telling CNN its analysis excluded factors like “credit score, available cash deposits and relationship history with lender.” Yet they wouldn’t provide data about those factors to CNN, and, as the media outlet noted, “most of the Navy Federal applications that were denied are listed as being rejected for reasons other than ‘credit history.’” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This news touched off strong responses from fair lending advocacy groups and civil rights organizations and prompted a </span><a href="https://bencrump.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/231217-Oliver-et-al-v-NFCU-Complaint.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">class action lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filed in Virginia’s Eastern District Court Dec. 17, on behalf of Black applicants who had been denied home loans, despite their high incomes and stellar credit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edward Barnes of Portsmouth told 13 News Now that Navy Federal inexplicably denied his mortgage refinance loan last October, a shock to the credit union’s customer of 34 years. Using the same information on his application, Barnes was approved for a loan with another lender two months later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re in 2023. They should be past this. Stuff like this shouldn’t be happening,&#8221; Barnes said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He is right; it seems reasonable to expect this type of discrimination to become less potent as the years go by and the country progresses. Unfortunately, in many aspects of homeownership access and wealth building, America has, shamefully, regressed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022, the Black homeownership rate was 45%, according to the National Association of Real Estate Brokers’s 2023 “State of Housing in Black America” </span><a href="https://www.nareb.com/site-files/uploads/2023/11/SHIBA-Report-2023.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Even though the percentage of Black homeowners has slowly increased since the passage of the 1968 Fair Housing Act, the gap in homeownership rates between Blacks and Whites is larger than it was more than half a century ago,” the report stated. Covertly biased mortgage lending practices help widen the <a href="https://homeofva.org/research-policy/exhibits/credit-inequality/exhibit/" target="_blank">gap</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://dmz1.dhcd.virginia.gov/HB854/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB854 Statewide Housing Study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a January 2022 report </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">commissioned by the Virginia General Assembly, found that 48% of Black households in the commonwealth owned homes, compared to 73% of white households. “The history of </span><a href="https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=5/39.1/-94.58&amp;text=intro" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">redlining</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and race-based federal mortgage programs, </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/15/us/racist-deeds-covenants/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">deed restrictions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> based on race, </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-foreclosures-race/racial-predatory-loans-fueled-u-s-housing-crisis-study-idUSTRE6930K520101004" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">predatory lending programs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2021/08/09/when-it-comes-to-the-racial-wealth-gap-home-appraisals-are-part-of-the-problem/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">discriminatory property appraisals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> contribute to many inequities that the Commonwealth must continue to address,” wrote the study’s authors, Virginia Housing and the Department of Housing and Community Development.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Blacks, others shouldn’t have to obliterate their presence to receive fair home value&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/08/23/blacks-others-shouldnt-have-to-obliterate-their-presence-to-receive-fair-home-value/embed/#?secret=U2EeEmNUwR#?secret=zSnnt7fMhi" data-secret="zSnnt7fMhi" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several federal agencies oversee financial institutions’ compliance with fair lending laws. The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Credit Union Administration monitors Navy Federal’s and other institutions’ “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">financial performance, risk management practices, payment systems, and compliance with laws and regulations,” NCUA’s Ben Hardaway told me in an email. They don’t handle lending or other consumer financial protection-related matters and instead pass on any complaints they receive about these issues from the public to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Since 2019, Hardaway said, the NCUA has referred 2,405 complaints involving Navy Federal to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the same timeframe, the Bureau’s Consumer Complaint Database shows 691 complaints about Navy Federal, concerning either applying for a mortgage loan or a refinance loan (like Barnes’) or problems with an existing mortgage. Of those, 50 came from Virginia; several of them mention Navy Federal’s suspected </span><a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/search/detail/5653655" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">violation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the Fair Housing Act as the basis of the complaint. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last year referred five fair lending matters to the Department of Justice, it said in its annual </span><a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_fair-lending-report_2023-06.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Congress, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">involving discrimination on the basis of race and national origin in mortgage lending (redlining).”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I believe this represents a snapshot of a wider problem; how many would-be Virginia borrowers, denied loans by Navy Federal or other banks, didn’t file a report with the Bureau?</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Equitable solutions</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 10 years since founding <a href="https://www.tealhousecompany.com/tealvilleusa" target="_blank">Teal House Company</a>, a real estate firm servicing central Virginia and Rhode Island, Damon Harris said he has “often” encountered Black people whose mortgage loan applications have been rejected, seemingly without good reason.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s tricky because no one is ‘denied’ for a mortgage; technically [lenders] can&#8217;t say ‘no.’ They can say ‘not right now because of these factors.’ So it&#8217;s hard to nail down those factors, but these classic problems – redlining, the wealth gap, wage inequality – still play a part today.&#8221;</span></p>

(Teal House Company)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His company also offers real estate strategy and homebuyer education classes, as well as pathways to responsible home-selling and community development. In addition to the challenges of finding fair lending, Harris said people of color face barriers like wage inequality and disproportionate student loan debt in their quest for homeownership. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And, we have a dire affordable housing shortage in the country and this state, which makes it harder for everyone to find safe, decent homes. Housing is a right and many people are being blocked from that right now.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Education, self-advocacy and dogged persistence are keys to navigating these issues, Harris, a native of Petersburg, Va., said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone needs a buying strategy. You can&#8217;t just wake up Monday and say, let me go buy a house Wednesday. Start the process 12 months in advance, or as soon as you can. Determine what you need and what you want in a home, and how much you can afford.” Would-be buyers can also partner with companies like Harris’, state agencies and housing nonprofits to boost their home buying knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Especially if you&#8217;re a first-time buyer, a partner can explain things you don’t know so you&#8217;re prepared when you talk with a lender. They can also help you find a lender”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you apply for a home loan and are denied, lending institutions “have to send paperwork that explains why,” Harris said. “They are supposed to tell you the specific reason for the rejection; hold them accountable for that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most importantly, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Believe and don&#8217;t be discouraged. It’s a process that can take time but if you keep at it, you will get there.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homeownership may be, to riff off Harlem Renaissance poet Langston Hughes, a dream deferred. A deferred dream, though, is better than no dream at all and gives us an aspiration to focus on as we work to make homeownership not only a bright vision for some, but a waking reality for all. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Readers of the nonprofit organization’s annual calendar, though, would learn just how savagely this country has treated the powerless, who often have been Blacks, Latinos and Native Americans. The day-to-day bloodshed and savagery cannot be ignored.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s why, even today, we should all fight racial stereotypes and scapegoating.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jan. 3, 1895: Nineteen Hopi leaders are imprisoned on Alcatraz Island for opposing government assimilation efforts.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jan. 13, 1904: A mob of white men lynches General Lee, who’s Black, for allegedly knocking on the door of a white woman’s home in Reevesville, S.C.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The calendar recounts events of naked terrorism. They usually were committed by whites who knew they wouldn’t be punished. The capacity for hate will shock those ignorant of America’s past – and present.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chronology also has mini-essays detailing acts of second-class treatment, lynchings of children and</span><a href="https://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/infant-mortality-and-african-americans" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Black infant mortality rates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><a href="https://www.history.com/news/gi-bill-black-wwii-veterans-benefits" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.history.com/news/gi-bill-black-wwii-veterans-benefits" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 1944 G.I. Bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for example – designed to help military veterans with housing, education and jobs – left the administration of the law’s provisions to the states. That meant Southern states, especially, were free to discriminate against Black veterans and deny them a chance to improve their lives and enter the middle class.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feb. 23, 2020: Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man, is pursued and fatally shot in a south Georgia neighborhood. No one is arrested until the lack of charges sparks widespread protests nationwide.</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m writing about the calendar produced by the Montgomery, Ala., nonprofit for two reasons:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One, folks who castigate Blacks and others for failing “to pull themselves up” should understand the multitude of actions – by legal code or common practice – that prevented racial equality in America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such steps were taken to promote white supremacy. They frequently occurred through extrajudicial terror or were promulgated through legislative action.</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/17/blacks-live-every-day-with-hurdles-that-former-health-chief-tried-to-diminish/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Vestiges of those incidents</span></a><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/08/23/blacks-others-shouldnt-have-to-obliterate-their-presence-to-receive-fair-home-value/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">have not been extinguished</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia-based </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/14/business/navy-federal-credit-union-black-applicants-invs/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Navy Federal Credit Union</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for example, has the widest disparity in mortgage approval rates between white and Black borrowers of any major lender, according to a CNN analysis</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Second, the recounting is a reminder to people of color of how much they’ve achieved in this land </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">despite</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the huge number of events designed to kill them, steal their property or break their spirit. The fact so many people have overcome so many obstacles is a testament to resilience – and excellence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The calendar is a history of who we have been – and what we, sadly, still grapple with. We must acknowledge those incidents and work ceaselessly to do better. </span></p>

People can </span><a href="https://rvalibrary.libcal.com/space/140197" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">book a time slot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the library&#8217;s website to come in to record oral histories of their families or neighborhoods, digitize photographs, transform VHS tapes into digital videos or transfer their music from cassettes and CDs to cloud storage (don&#8217;t forget to bring a USB or digital storage device), all for free. There&#8217;s room for one person to work on a project at a time, and the library offers technical assistance to those attempting to preserve their mementos and memories.</span></p>

(Samantha Willis/The Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the near future, the Memory Lab will offer even more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our goal is to lead classes, workshops and programs on how to digitize physical materials and to encourage folks who have materials relating to Richmond&#8217;s history to consider donating to our collection,&#8221; said Chloe McCormick, Main Library&#8217;s senior special collections librarian. &#8220;For example, someone may have childhood photos of the neighborhood they grew up in, which has changed a lot over the years. We want to see those photos, and other people want to see those photos.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McCormick, who is also a trained folklorist, just completed a one-year role as a Memory Lab fellow. Much of her work during the past year involved staffing the Memory Lab and assisting people who used it, reorganizing the local history collections, overseeing oral history projects and helping prepare the library for its </span><a href="https://rvalibrary.org/rpl-100/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">centennial anniversary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which it celebrated from November 2022 through November 2023. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The library, said McCormick, helps to fill a niche in a city that values its history and is largely defined by it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think in Richmond, we&#8217;re so lucky to have so many large-scale historical institutions at our disposal. And that&#8217;s amazing, but I think what we excel at in the library is helping people who walk in off the street looking for that grassroots social history of Richmond or other underrepresented history that&#8217;s not always easily accessible at other institutions,&#8221; she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an example, McCormick cites a sustained interest in Richmond&#8217;s Black history, evidenced by African American residents dropping in frequently to seek information about their genealogical and family records. Finding such information is a unique challenge Black Americans face, often due to the country&#8217;s legacy of slavery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In 1860, nearly 4 million enslaved individuals lived in the United States but they didn’t appear on federal census records,&#8221; </span><a href="https://blogs.loc.gov/loc/2021/04/african-american-genealogy-searching-for-yesterday/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ahmed Johnson, a reference librarian in the Library of Congress Researcher and Reference Services Department. &#8220;Therefore, you have to search for other records to help you locate family names and push your family history back further.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McCormick and the Richmond Main Library staff can help uncover such records.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;On an almost daily basis, I&#8217;m helping Black patrons find something about their community or family history,&#8221; McCormick said. &#8220;We do run into those walls all the time, where there isn&#8217;t easily accessible information about the topic they&#8217;re looking for, or the trail of their family members goes cold.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Memory Lab can bring these histories, which have perhaps only prevailed previously as family lore, into public view. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This stuff exists in living memory, so our goal is to access that and make it more widely available,&#8221; McCormick said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Main Library — which already engages with several Black heritage groups including the </span><a href="https://www.aahgs.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Afro-American Historical and Genealogical Society</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — is hoping to work with more historic Black churches in Richmond and throughout the state to tap into their member records and archives. Perhaps in this way, descendants may find their ancestors, and the public record of local Black history be made richer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The grant, the largest in the library’s history, will also enable the library to create personal archiving kits, offering the tools and opportunity to capture precious memories to those who can&#8217;t come to the library. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The kits could contain cameras, audio recording equipment, lights, scanners and other devices,&#8221; McCormick said. &#8220;So if you have family members who can&#8217;t make it to the library and you want to record them sharing an oral history, or if you have materials that you can&#8217;t bring here, you can use these tools in your own homes and communities.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond&#8217;s revamped Memory Lab is expected to be complete by the end of 2024. That gives you plenty of time to think of what knowledge you&#8217;d like to preserve representing your life, family, heritage or community, and to decide if other Virginians can share in that knowledge too. </span></p>

(U.S. Army photo)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tomorrow is Thanksgiving.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a day that popular culture is quick to ascribe to early settlers who landed in Massachusetts sometime in the autumn or early winter of 1621. We see it in perennial promotions for the Black Friday shopping orgy manifest in cliché, cartoonish representations of pilgrim hats, square-toed shoes with big buckles and gobblers that resemble Virginia Tech’s sports mascot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginians respond with patient bemusement, knowing that a service of thanksgiving to God was observed by British settlers two years earlier, in December 1619, along the James River in what was then known as Berkeley Hundred. The occasion was the successful completion of a harrowing trans-Atlantic passage to Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the</span><a href="https://virginiahistory.org/learn/first-thanksgiving" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Museum of History and Culture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a ship named the Margaret, helmed by Capt. John Woodlief, had sailed from Bristol, England, with a crew of 37 men. They were so delighted to land in Virginia after three distressing months at sea that they conducted the first known organized expression of gratitude for the blessings of divine providence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What a happy story!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were other crossings. Most have enjoyed far less acclaim and ritualistic celebration over the centuries in the United States. Let’s focus on one that found Virginia’s shores the same year as the Berkeley Hundred celebration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It landed in late August of 1619 in what is now Hampton, on the present day site of Fort Monroe. At the time, it went by the name Point Comfort. And the story of that voyage is the stuff of Hollywood adventure films.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ship, a Dutch-flagged vessel named the White Lion owned by an</span><a href="https://www.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/rmgc-object-14553" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">English nobleman</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, carried</span><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2674531" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">about 20 Africans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who had been kidnapped by Portuguese slave traders in Angola on Africa’s west coast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a</span><a href="https://time.com/5653369/august-1619-jamestown-history/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Time magazine summary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the White Lion and a sister privateer, the Treasurer, had commandeered the captives in an act of high seas piracy from the San Juan Batista, a Portuguese slave ship carrying an estimated 350 Angolans bound for the Spanish colony of Vera Cruz. Running low on food and supplies, the White Lion reached Point Comfort first and bartered its enslaved cargo for “victuals” from George Yeardley, the governor of the 12-year-old colony that had gotten a foothold at Jamestown, and Abraham Piercey, the colony’s head of trade. The Treasurer followed two days later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The landing at Point Comfort was significant as the first sale of human beings as slaves in what is now America. For nearly 250 more years, the slave trade was an evil that flourished in the United States. It made many whites wealthy and led the nation to disunion that culminated in what remains its bloodiest war.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 1619 landing, however, was </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the first time enslaved Africans had been brought to America against their will as forced laborers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to</span><a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/misguided-focus-1619-beginning-slavery-us-damages-our-understanding-american-history-180964873/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Smithsonian Magazine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Africans were part of a Spanish expedition that landed in present-day South Carolina to establish a colony in 1526, an odyssey that was abandoned after the Africans rebelled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conditions for African captives — ripped away from their homes and families in several sub-Saharan nations in Africa, shackled and packed like firewood within the filthy, cramped, airless wooden ship’s hulls for months at sea — still horrify and haunt us. Their lives of backbreaking compulsory servitude in the New World, supporting the agrarian economies of antebellum southern states, were equally brutal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Union victory in the Civil War brought legal emancipation to enslaved Black people, but not an end to systemic victimization. Advances such as access to the ballot, desegregation of public facilities and the right to marry people of their choice, would take another full century, gains that would be slow and paid for with blood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The contributions and innovations of those enslaved people and their progeny — from building much of this nation’s infrastructure to music and the arts, to cuisine, to science and an indispensable role in creating the world’s most productive font of food and fiber — struggle for mere acknowledgement, much less an expression of thanks and suitable compensation. And the past two years, it’s gotten even harder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve even gone so far as to proscribe unhappy facts like these from history and social sciences curricula in our public schools. The 1619 Point Comfort landing and the history of all the pain and conflict that has flowed from it risks being labeled an “inherently divisive concept” that might discomfit white pupils. Virginia’s governor, Glenn Youngkin, was so intent on reining in such history that</span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/74---eo/74---eo/EO-1---ENDING-THE-USE-OF-INHERENTLY-DIVISIVE-CONCEPTS,-INCLUDING-CRITICAL-RACE-THEORY,-AND-RESTORING-EXCELLEN.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">an executive order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to banish it from the commonwealth’s classrooms was literally his first official action as governor, done the afternoon he was inaugurated and announced with fanfare.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, this isn’t a classroom. And last time I checked, the First Amendment still hadn’t been repealed, so I can </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and will</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> note these culturally discomfiting truths.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the most illuminating conversation I’ve had on the topic was with the grandson of enslaved people who made history of his own by becoming the nation’s first elected Black governor, L. Douglas Wilder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The problem we have is that American history has never been taught to Americans,”</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/06/05/removing-monuments-can-open-the-dialogue-but-coping-with-our-painful-history-is-necessary-for-reconciliation/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Wilder told me in June 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the start of a summer of protests that followed the murder of George Floyd, a Black man, by a white Minneapolis cop. “I am not talking about adding a Black history course. I am talking about telling the damn truth in all our history about what has happened for the 400 years Black people have been here!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without that shared understanding of historical truth, Wilder said, Black America and white America will remain estranged. We get no closer when we designate a day in November to celebrate one historical event 404 years ago and try to hide or diminish another one just as old.</span></p>

(City of Harrisonburg) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before 1960, Harrisonburg&#8217;s Northeast neighborhood was a vibrant, predominantly Black community filled with homes, businesses and families striving toward a brighter future during the height of America&#8217;s Civil Rights Movement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But starting in the 1960s, the dreams and progress of many of those Northeast families were crushed by </span><a href="https://www.wmra.org/wmra-news/2020-02-11/the-legacy-of-harrisonburgs-urban-renewal" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the city&#8217;s urban renewal projects</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which destroyed dozens of Black-owned homes and businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What the all-white city leadership saw as removing blight and improving aesthetic appeal, residents saw as the wholesale demolition of their community. For some, it permanently severed their trust in their hometown government.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, some 50 years later, there&#8217;s an opportunity to repair some of the physical and emotional damage, to reconnect Northeast to the city&#8217;s downtown and to strengthen the fragile bonds that hold the community together. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Northeast disconnected</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A lot of times we focus on the homes that were demolished, whereas when I think about urban renewal, it&#8217;s about the community and sense of community that was lost,&#8221; said Monica Robinson, a Harrisonburg City Council member, Northeast resident and executive director of the </span><a href="https://valleyblackheritage.org/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shenandoah Valley Black Heritage Project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Maybe your home wasn&#8217;t burned or razed, but by the community changing and other buildings and markers moved, that collective memory and sense of self was lost,” she continued. “Ms. So and So&#8217;s house who watched you as a child, the homes of people you knew, that was all lost. &#8230; When you lose everything that&#8217;s familiar to you, when you lose that sense of safety that allows you to be able to live freely in that area, you don&#8217;t have to lose your house to lose everything.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robinson is one of the community leaders who will help determine how grant funds from </span><a href="https://smartgrowthamerica.org/program/community-connectors-grants/#custom-collapse-0-7" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smart Growth America</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that are intended to &#8220;repair the damage of divisive infrastructure in small and mid-sized cities&#8221; will be used. Harrisonburg is one of 15 cities nationwide to be selected for the organization&#8217;s Community Connectors program, which will provide money, technical knowledge and other forms of assistance to communities whose transportation and socioeconomic growth has been hindered by past urban renewal projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, the specter of government-ordained urban renewal has haunted many communities of color for decades. Richmond&#8217;s &#8220;Black Wall Street,&#8221; </span><a href="https://reconnectjacksonward.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackson Ward</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, was split in half by the construction of Interstates 95 and 64 in the 1950s. Charlottesville&#8217;s oldest center of Black business and homeownership, </span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/video/raisedrazed-bg0gek/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vinegar Hill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, was razed to make way for parking lots during the same time period. Roanoke&#8217;s </span><a href="https://www.wsls.com/features/2020/08/06/urban-renewal-redlining-still-have-lasting-effects-on-roanokes-black-communities/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gainsboro</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> neighborhood once brimmed with cultural spaces and homes, until redlining in the 1930s reduced economic investment. It&#8217;s a familiar, sad pattern seen not only in Virginia, but across the country. It&#8217;s also why the Community Connectors program is so needed and welcome in Harrisonburg.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I live in Northeast, the same community I grew up in,&#8221; said Harrisonburg Mayor Deanna Reed, the first Black woman to inhabit the role. &#8220;This was a community that went through the hardships of urban renewal in the 60s.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That included the construction of North Mason Street, which is now an infrastructure barrier that separates Northeast from the heart of the city. Harrisonburg&#8217;s R-4 Project in the 1960s delineated Northeast — a part of the city bounded by Broad, Johnson, North Main and Rock streets — as blighted and subsequently, under the auspices of eminent domain, tore or burned down homes and businesses there. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With federal funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the city &#8220;demolished those homes, just put the people out. Some folks moved away, but some folks moved into what we call the projects,&#8221; said Reed, referring to the public housing communities built by the Harrisonburg Redevelopment and Housing Authority in 1955.</span></p>

(City of Harrisonburg)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I have aunts who remember that time. I remember them talking about the smell of houses burning; it was very traumatic. It is a piece of our history that we&#8217;ve never healed from,&#8221; Reed said. She envisions the Community Connectors grant as a tool for healing those deep wounds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exact scope of the Community Connectors project in Harrisonburg remains to be determined: Its details will be worked out in a process to be led by community groups like the Shenandoah Valley Black Heritage Project, the </span><a href="https://www.nenava.org/history.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northeast Neighborhood Association</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Harrisonburg Downtown Renaissance. </span></p>
<p>Steve Davis, assistant vice president of transportation strategy at Smart Growth America, said Harrisonburg was selected for the Community Connectors grant from a pool of 80 cities nationwide largely because of its goal to repair harm the city had done to parts of its community by its urban renewal projects.</p>
<p>A major challenge of Community Connector-style projects, which “retrofit, repair, or remove a road or highway, is that they are most often controlled or owned by state departments of transportation, requiring a major amount of cooperation, buy-in, and complexity,” Davis said in an email. “The fact that the city controls the major road in question” made Harrisonburg a great fit for the grant, he continued. “They’ve got a good group of stakeholders involved so they can rebuild trust, engage the community on a forward-looking plan, and then carry it out without needing to bring higher levels of government to the table.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harrisonburg Director of Communications Michael Parks said the city&#8217;s Department of Public Works applied for the grant and wants to base everything on what the community wants, the opposite mindset of city leadership in the past. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We want to go into the community and have these difficult conversations, and help our residents feel comfortable talking with us,” he said. “Maybe the grant funds will allow us to contract with a third-party facilitator to lead those dialogues. Our goal is to try to repair the ruptures between some families and city government as it pertains to history, and whatever the city can do to address those, that&#8217;s what we want to do. Those conversations will be the driving force behind what action we take.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parks said that in present-day Harrisonburg, the city sees four-lane North Mason Street as &#8220;an overbuilt roadway that is a significant barrier between Northeast and downtown. We want people to be able to walk to shops or even City Hall from Northeast, and they can&#8217;t do that presently.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Possible solutions include creating walking and biking paths to reconnect Northeast to the city&#8217;s center. While Parks said the city doesn&#8217;t yet know the exact amount of the grant funds, it will be up to $130,000.</span></p>
<p>Davis added that the grant money is meant to permanently establish the city’s capacity for this project and others of its kind in the future. It can be used for “staff salaries, consultant fees, data collection and analysis, meetings, supplies, funding support for community-based organization participation, initiative-related travel, other direct expenses,” and other costs the city will determine with Smart Growth America. For Harrisonburg and the other 14 cities in the Community Connectors cohort, Smart Growth America will “connect them with resources available in state and federal transportation programs, providing support tailored to each project&#8217;s need.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Harrisonburg is setting an example that other localities in Virginia should follow</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is heartening to see the city take such steps to repair past harms, however overdue. Other cities and towns should take note, if they hope to contribute to the creation of a more equitable commonwealth where everyone’s heritage and identity is honored and respected. It would also be a wise course for cities and counties if they don’t want to repeat the history of officially sanctioned, destructive land use and eminent domain decisions that have harmed Virginians of color for generations — and over which they have prevailed, against all odds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next steps for the Community Connectors rollout in Harrisonburg will be a meeting between funders Smart Growth America, Mayor Reed and the community groups, to be held in Atlanta in November. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city will seize the chance to move forward, said Reed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is just a piece of our past that we need to acknowledge, understand and heal from,” she said. “Harrisonburg is a place for everyone; it used to not be that way, but we are now.&#8221; </span></p>

Thomas/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than a half-century ago, several colleges in Virginia benefited by usurping the onetime properties of Black people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cruel irony? Those African Americans whose homes were snatched, often legally by utilizing eminent domain, weren’t welcomed at those same universities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those property seizures are a stain on the commonwealth. They were racist in result – and often in intent, too,</span><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/how-virginia-college-expanded-by-uprooting-black-neighborhood" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">according to some published accounts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They destroyed Black middle-class communities or prevented those locales from gaining such status.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Eminent domain and Virginia institutions of higher learning</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eminent domain allows governments to take private property for public use, even if the landowners don’t want to sell. (This was far different from the vigilante terror that destroyed places like</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/05/24/us/tulsa-race-massacr" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Wall Street</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Tulsa, Okla., in 1921.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People saw black neighborhoods as bad neighborhoods that should be cleared,” said Dana Berliner, litigation director and senior vice president of the</span><a href="https://ij.org/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Institute for Justice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s a libertarian, nonprofit public-interest law firm based in Arlington County.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The whole structure of how eminent domain works, and what is allowed to justify it,” Berliner told me, “is very much stacked against African American neighborhoods.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mid-20</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century was a time when African Americans had limited options of where they could live and run businesses. Redlining, </span><a href="https://mappingcville.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">restrictive covenants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://detroitmi.gov/sites/detroitmi.localhost/files/2022-12/Historical%20Account_Ossian%20Sweet_0.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">white hostility</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and violence crammed many Black people into ghettos. African Americans had few ways to challenge the abusive land takings because they lacked political clout in the South before the</span><a href="https://virginia.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/0fde9f85-004d-42f1-a841-37182ef82c89/0fde9f85-004d-42f1-a841-37182ef82c89/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Voting Rights Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> became law in 1965.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are reminded of this sordid history about colleges in the commonwealth – or for folks like me, initially learned about it – because of two recent articles by the Virginia Center for Investigative Journalism at WHRO, a public radio station in Norfolk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first story covered</span><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/how-virginia-college-expanded-by-uprooting-black-neighborhood" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the creation of the campus of Christopher Newport University</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Newport News.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seizure of properties for what became CNU was an “egregious wrong,” Anthony Santoro, the university’s president from 1987 to 1996, told the news outlet. “Historically, the city (of Newport News) has to own up to the fact that this was a deliberate attempt to get rid of a Black community, because there were many places that the school could have been built.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar events occurred at ODU and U.Va., where the use or threat of eminent domain removed thriving areas. The former’s expansion in the 1960s and ’70s swallowed up much of the middle-class Black community of Lamberts Point in Norfolk, including houses, grocery stores and churches. The latter’s growth obliterated several Black neighborhoods in Charlottesville. Meanwhile, the city itself seized communities like Vinegar Hill, a Black section of commerce, under the banner of proposed urban renewal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cities and housing authorities had to prove part of a neighborhood was “blighted” to exercise eminent domain, but the level of proof was woefully low. Property owners rarely got fair value for the parcels and homes they lost. They had to move to areas without the same amenities and services. Gone was the support system that helped make their neighborhoods their own pride and joy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Americans suffered disproportionately nationwide, too, from the condemnations – and not just by universities. Local and state governments often used them to build highways, K-12 schools and other public projects.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://ij.org/report/eminent-domain-african-americans/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eminent Domain and African Americans,”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a 2007 report for the Institute of Justice, found that between “1949 and 1973 … 2,532 projects were carried out in 992 cities that displaced one million people, two-thirds of them African American.” That made Blacks “five times more likely to be displaced than they should have been given their numbers in the population.” Blacks were about 12% of the population then.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was not a coincidence.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Lasting impact, widening wealth gap</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Passing real estate down to heirs is one of the key ways families accumulate wealth. The seizing of properties decades ago stunted a path to prosperity for many African Americans, who already faced the legacies of slavery, Jim Crow, lynchings and second-class citizenship designed to crush their souls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s no surprise, then, that the wealth gap between whites and Blacks remains so wide today: In 2019, the median wealth of Black households</span><a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/eliminating-black-white-wealth-gap-generational-challenge/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in the United States was $24,100, compared with a whopping $189,100 for white households</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Those figures help explain why many African Americans continue to struggle to get ahead today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across Virginia, eminent domain–related decisions involving capital projects have nearly obliterated memories of many Black communities:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To build the Pentagon in 1942,</span><a href="https://historyfortomorrow.org/story/eminent-domain-and-the-displacement-of-black-communities/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the federal government condemned East Arlington</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, giving residents there less than a month to move.</span><a href="https://historyfortomorrow.org/story/eminent-domain-and-the-displacement-of-black-communities/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Queen City, another nearby Black community</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, was razed to help provide commuter access. A</span><a href="https://boundarystones.weta.org/2018/03/23/right-out-our-front-door-pentagon-east-arlington-and-queen-city#footnote-14" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">highway consultant said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the time the new road network “takes out some troublesome darkey slave cabins” and “cleans up that strip.”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Construction of Interstate 95 in the 1950s through Richmond</span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-03-07/reconnect-jackson-ward-interstate-95-cap-grant" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">ran through Jackson Ward, displacing thousands of Black residents</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The completion of I-464 in Chesapeake in the 1980s</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2016/02/13/roger-chesley-an-ominous-echo-in-south-hill/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">cut off the South Hill neighborhood from its surroundings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even as recently as 2017, a small community of freed slaves’ descendants </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/as-data-centers-bloom-a-century-old-african-american-enclave-is-threatened/2017/07/02/f33db65a-5502-11e7-a204-ad706461fa4f_story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">had faced removal from their land in Prince William County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because of the proposed development of a 38-acre computer data center. The plan eventually was jettisoned.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steven Woolf was lead author of a 2021 study titled “Deeply Rooted: History’s Lessons for Equity in Northern Virginia.” It included a section on eminent domain and the displacement of Black communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We take the position [that] the majority of this was systemic racism,” said Woolf, director emeritus and senior advisor at the Virginia Commonwealth University Center on Society and Health. The study also focused on topics including education and jobs.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Next steps</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though eminent domain is still legal, “It’s not being done in the draconian way it was done [before] with the wholesale destruction of black neighborhoods,” he added. However, several U.S. policies continue to contribute to the racial wealth gap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what should happen now, decades after the worst abuses of eminent domain occurred?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woolf said he and his colleagues did suggest the “R” word – reparations – for the loss of property.</span><a href="https://historyfortomorrow.org/resources/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mentions a program in</span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/27/us/evanston-illinois-reparations-housing-discrimination-expand/index.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CBlack%20Residents%20that%20lived%20in,their%20direct%20descendants%20are%20eligible.%E2%80%9D" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Evanston, Ill., that awarded $25,000 to a specific, limited number of Black households</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to use for home repairs or as down payments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a loaded topic. That doesn’t mean it should be ignored.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We must acknowledge the property seizures that took place throughout Virginia’s history as ugly and racist, as they indeed were. The use of eminent domain had an outsized impact on African Americans, who have constantly struggled against a stacked deck. The loss of homes and communities reversed Black progress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nor should the discussion end there. Justice and equity require nothing less. </span></p>

(Roger Chesley/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The descendants of Virginia-born miracle woman Henrietta Lacks finally won a major </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/henrietta-lacks-hela-cells-thermo-fisher-scientific-bfba4a6c10396efa34c9b79a544f0729" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">settlement with a biotechnology company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that profited billions from Lacks&#8217; ever-reproducing cells; I congratulate them. The hard-won settlement is a glimmer of justice flashing within a dark facet of America&#8217;s medical and scientific progress, fields fueled by racist, unethical practices in the past and present that have taken so much from Black people and given very little in return.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://edu.lva.virginia.gov/changemakers/items/show/30" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lacks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, born in the rolling hills of Roanoke and raised in Halifax County tobacco country, changed the course of medical and scientific history without ever knowing it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers at Johns Hopkins University Hospital harvested cells from Lacks&#8217; body without asking her or telling her they were doing so while she was being treated for cervical cancer there in 1951. They did so because they discovered Lacks’ cells lived on and on, never dying and instead, astonishingly, reproducing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cells, which scientists dubbed HeLa after Lacks, became a foundational force in research into diseases like polio, cancer and COVID-19. Lacks&#8217; cells were the first human cells sent into space, and the first human cells to be successfully cloned. Scientists used them to study the effect of radiation on humans. It is no understatement to say that many of the </span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/who-was-henrietta-lacks-heres-how-hela-cells-became-essential-to-medical-research" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">medical breakthroughs of the 20th century</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, progress that increased the quality of life for untold millions of Americans and others worldwide, would not have been possible without Lacks&#8217; cells. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also became an engine for others’ profit. Companies worldwide have for decades been reproducing and marketing HeLa cells, raking in billions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet Lacks herself never saw any benefit from the use of her cells in her lifetime, nor did her family, which struggled with chronic illnesses and financial insecurity after her October 1951 death. Where is the fairness in that? The settlement the family reached with the biotech company Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., whatever the amount of money, is not enough to compensate for the incalculable benefit to humanity that Lacks’ cells provided, but I’m glad they got something. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What about the other Black Virginians and Americans who have also contributed to medical and scientific progress? What is their reward and legacy?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sepia-skinned victims of </span><a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/uva/grave-robbing-detailed-in-final-uva-slavery-report/article_ccdf6a26-9822-11e8-9818-6b7678744ccc.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond grave robbers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – the unidentified Black people whose bodies were stolen and dissected so that physicians at Virginia medical schools could better study anatomy – what payment did they or their relatives get for giving their bodies into the hands of white medical professionals? None.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What about the thousands of </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-31654546" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">African Americans who were forcibly sterilized</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sometimes without their knowledge, under the state’s 1924 Eugenical Sterilisation Act — legislation that wasn’t outlawed until 1979? For the destruction of their</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">reproductive abilities, sterilized Virginians may now, after </span><a href="https://dbhds.virginia.gov/developmental-services/victimsofeugenics/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">applying for a program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and enduring screening by an advisory panel, be eligible for $25,000 compensation, itself “contingent on the availability of funding,” through a </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/admincodeexpand/title12/agency35/chapter240/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state compensation fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> created in 2017. That little bit of money doesn’t come close to balancing the unknowable loss of these peoples’ potential progeny, but it’s apparently the best Virginia can do.</span></p>

Marion Sim</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">s, the so-called “father of gynecology,” ever get their due, or will their families be rewarded for their foremothers’ sacrifices? Probably not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, today’s Black Virginians are largely descended from enslaved laborers, builders, cooks, craftsmen, businesspeople and thinkers whose unpaid efforts laid the foundation for this state and this nation. </span><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-we-need-reparations-for-black-americans/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reparations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, though, the idea of paying Black people for centuries of their ancestors’ free labor, work upon which most American industries were built, is still a bad word in many circles. Even among people more open to the possibility, the “how” outweighs the “why,” and year after year, we do nothing to make right so much that was and is wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can and should celebrate the victory of Lacks’ family’s settlement, but we must understand that she is but one Black person whose contributions counted for a lot while they themselves benefited maybe just a little – or not at all. With Lacks in mind, we must endeavor to correct the harms of the past – yes, sometimes with cash –  in order to forge a more equitable future for all of us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beginning with the Revolutionary War, almost 1.4 million Americans have died in our nation’s wars, including about 667,000 killed in combat. We remember, honor and mourn those gallant souls every year on Memorial Day – May 29 this year. Those Americans who have served in or near war zones carry their memories throughout the year. It should not be just a once-a-year observance for everyone else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The country’s more recent conflicts, starting with Vietnam, have seen a blurring of the battle lines, where American service personnel have teamed up with local forces to fight a common enemy. For those who have worked hand-in-hand with local forces – South Vietnamese, Iraqis or Afghans – it is hard to forget those local troops who died in the common cause. Although our Memorial Day is for commemoration of our war dead, I think it would also be appropriate to honor those foreign partners on this special day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For most of my tour in Vietnam, I lived and worked beside South Vietnamese soldiers (ARVNs), mostly Roman Catholics or members of the Cao Dai Church. As human beings, they had the same hopes and aspirations as most Americans. I trusted them with my life, and I believe most of them felt the same. I can’t think of America’s fallen without thinking of them. Almost 300,000 ARVNs died in the war, and we left many more of them to a horrible fate. They deserve remembrance and respect. I know that many Americans who served in Iraq and Afghanistan feel the same about their foreign partners. When you form trusting bonds in wartime, it is hard to break them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although our bonds with the people of Ukraine are at a different level, where we are mostly non-combat partners providing moral support and weaponry from the sidelines, I have that same feeling about those valiant humans. The Ukrainians are fighting and dying in a war that serves the vital national interests of the United States and NATO, as well as our allies on the other side of the planet. Ukraine is the proverbial point of the spear that protects freedom and democracy from the despotic regimes in Russia, China and Iran.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we allow Russia to prevail, it will give great encouragement to the autocrats, quite possibly leading to a spread of hostilities to Taiwan and any number of Asian, African and South American nations in the sights of Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although I rarely find issues upon which I totally agree with U.S. Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, Ukraine is one such issue – an exceedingly important one. The senator realizes that it is essential to America’s strategic interests that Ukraine prevail in Putin’s genocidal war. I agree with his view that the U.S. needs to increase and expedite the supply of war materiel to Ukraine. Sen. Risch has observed that “the Ukrainians are fighting today for what our founding fathers fought for in 1776.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incidentally, that observation was made when the senator recently recalled his meeting in Ukraine with a former Green Beret from Boise, Nick Maimer, who had been volunteering to train Ukrainian civilians in how to defend their country. Maimer was reported to have been killed by Russian artillery fire earlier this month. God rest his soul. He joins thousands of Ukrainians who have died in the fight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ukraine has reportedly suffered 124,500-131,000 total casualties, including 15,500-17,500 killed in action and 109,000-113,500 wounded. Because their fight is largely our fight, it would be most appropriate to remember and mourn them, along with our war dead and our foreign partners who died in supporting American troops. On Memorial Day, I’ll be remembering my 58,220 brothers and sisters who died serving their country in Vietnam. I’ll also be thinking of Lieutenants Dinh and Tanh, Captain Thanh and interpreter Tom, who were with us all the way until we abandoned them to their ugly fate in 1975.</span></p>

(Samantha Willis/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most days, James Douglas would be on the water by 5:30 in the morning, on the hunt for oysters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’d push off in his small boat from his family’s wharf on the Yeocomico River in Westmoreland County, the birthplace of the nation’s first president, George Washington, and, since 1824, of Douglas’ family, the Wilsons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Douglas’ family has owned their waterfront property in Virginia’s Northern Neck since 1877. This is an astounding feat, considering few Black people were able to purchase land back then, and those that did were sometimes bullied by whites to give up their property or sell it for a pittance.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mitchell Wilson number one, he got a white fellow to buy it for him, and he split it up between all of his children and descendants,” said Douglas, sweeping his hand toward a ring of homes perched near the riverbank. “Those descendants, my family, are still here now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Douglas is one of Virginia’s last living Black watermen, a culture and profession that was the backbone of the Chesapeake Bay’s seafood industry as early as colonial times. These African American men, some enslaved, some free, fished for menhaden, dug for clams, harvested oysters and caught crabs that they sold to white-owned processing facilities, which sold and shipped the brackish water delicacies to restaurants and homes in Maryland, Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, New York and beyond. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this tradition has over the past few decades been disappearing. The Black watermen culture is fading, Douglas said, largely due to the seafood industry itself shrinking and watermen leaving their small-town birthplaces seeking better economic opportunities in cities like Washington, D.C., Philadelphia and Richmond. In early May, Preservation Virginia named “African American Watermen Sites of the Chesapeake Bay” one of the state’s </span><a href="https://preservationvirginia.org/our-work/most-endangered-historic-places/?mc_cid=f8ac8f9308&amp;mc_eid=69330060b7" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most endangered historic spaces</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The renowned seafood industry of the Chesapeake Bay would not have been possible without the contributions of generations of African Americans,” the Virginia Department of Historic Resources </span><a href="https://www.dhr.virginia.gov/news/african-american-watermen-project/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote in its announcement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the agency’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">African American Watermen Project in 2021. That effort to survey, study and preserve sites of significance to Black watermen culture spans three states – Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania – under the purview of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, National Park Service Chesapeake Bay and Chesapeake Conservation Partnership. Norfolk-based Commonwealth Preservation Group is leading the Virginia arm of the project and has identified about 80 sites where Black watermen lived, worked and contributed to the cultural fabric of the commonwealth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Women were predominantly in the crab picking and oyster shucking houses, while men were on the water,” said Kayla Halberg, manager of the project, who co-authored its </span><a href="https://www.dhr.virginia.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/500-0007_African_American_Watermen_MPD_2023_NRHP_Final.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multiple Property Documentation form</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that her group submitted to the National Park Service for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These are real people and real communities; we [were able] to go out to their homes and see where they live and talk to them,” Halberg said. “What we want to preserve about these communities is their culture — the songs, the tools, the expertise, the lifestyle of the watermen communities. It was a thriving, rich culture that is unfortunately fading away; that’s why it’s essential to preserve what remains.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Douglas’ wife Daisy, a gifted storyteller and retired educator who used to drive an hour and a half each way each day to teach in Richmond City Public Schools, recalled the dangers and the joys of her husband’s long career.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“James and those watermen before him, they were extremely strong, with powerful legs that they stood up on all day in the boats while they were hunting oysters. A lot of them ended up on disability because their arms gave out, after they spent years lifting those heavy tongs in and out of the water all day, catching up oysters. Some of them drowned; sometimes they would get lost in a storm. You remember the snowstorm, Jim?” she asked her husband, before describing the time he had come home with a “completely frozen” beard and eyelashes after braving a surprise bout of wintry weather. He didn’t leave the water when other oystermen did, he recalled with a sheepish grin, because he had a strong feeling that he was about to find a big oyster bed; he was right.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was not an easy profession at all, but they took great pride in it, great pride, because they had a certain level of independence working on the water,” Daisy continued.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_35326" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/DSCF5195-scaled.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-35326" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/DSCF5195-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/DSCF5195-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/DSCF5195-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/DSCF5195-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/DSCF5195-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/DSCF5195-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/DSCF5195-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Daisy Douglas holds a photo of oystermen, including Captain Billy Smith and Douglas&#8217; husband James Douglas, tonging in the Nomini River. (Samantha Willis/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is heartening to see the significance of African American water workers recognized. Not only did these people embody Black self-determination, collaboration and entrepreneurship, even when some of them were in bondage, but the Chesapeake Bay’s maritime and seafood industries could not have developed or been sustained without these skilled tradesmen and women. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are the stories that Virginia schoolchildren and citizens should learn. Some might label them “divisive concepts,” but actually, they are factual accounts of local African Americans who worked tirelessly to overcome systemic, structural racism that plagued every facet of their lives for the better part of the state’s existence. The Black history of these communities is Virginia history and American history that might be lost to time if not for efforts like Halberg’s project and the Douglases&#8217; determination to keep their stories alive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was good while it lasted, but it’s just about over with now,” James Douglas said, looking out over the river to Northumberland County on the other shore. He has lived the entirety of his 85 years here; the water is in his blood, he said. “It’s up to us now to tell people about it, to teach it to young people, to keep it going.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a series of emails, Vincent T. Brooks, senior local records archivist at the Library of Virginia, said the Mercury’s coverage prompted staff to scour county records. They retrieved several boxes from a separate facility, and a member of the local records staff, Mary Ann Mason, found Noah Cherry&#8217;s inquest along with three others filed within a box of constable&#8217;s warrants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This inquest, along with the inquest into the death of Alice Powell – whose murder triggered Cherry’s lynching – had been missing from the </span><a href="https://ead.lib.virginia.edu/vivaxtf/view?docId=lva/vi03358.xml" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Princess Anne coroner’s records</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cassandra Newby-Alexander, Endowed Professor of Virginia Black History and Culture at Norfolk State University, said John Mitchell Jr., a former enslaved person who edited the Richmond Planet, investigated how law enforcement officials in Virginia often hid their responsibility for lynchings by blaming unruly mobs, which they did little to control.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No arrests were ever made of anyone,” she said, “including people who did these crimes in plain sight.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, Library of Virginia staffers uncovered a notation of an $11.50 charge for </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/105Cb0Geb0WPLcPwwiMBE6VvKRl2uBlV2/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">summoning the coroner’s jury</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a $7 charge for </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KrLd_bM4aLQhLIzt7hQI02DEZP0Eo0F9/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">making Noah Cherry’s coffin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a $1 charge for </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FIpLCwuUIFQxsrXLpn5ApC5Do4VMNVAs/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">digging his grave</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The inquest had a notice from the coroner, E.W. Eaton, that Cherry’s estate was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">too poor to pay for the costs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of his inquest. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staffers also found a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$25 charge for Charles H. Ferrell’s services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a detective for “working up the case against Noah Cherry for the murder of daughter of Mr. C.D. Powell.” A notation on the document says the county only allotted $15 for the service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Library staff did not find the actual inquest into Powell’s death, or any records of payment for the jurors who would have taken part in it, after an extensive search. Brooks said the inquest should have led to Cherry’s arrest and called it “odd” that the documents were missing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re pretty much out of obvious (and not so obvious) places to look,” he said. “We&#8217;ve looked at every conceivable box of records around the 1884-1886 time frame. Unless it is wildly misfiled in some random year, it is not in the Princess Anne Co. materials here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mercury&#8217;s investigation of the case found two state newspapers, the Norfolk Virginian and the Richmond Dispatch, put together timelines of Alice Powell’s murder that didn’t agree with each other or the county’s death registry. The story of this murder, widely circulated in the press, incited the lynching and scapegoated Cherry as the chief suspect in the murder, an accusation that has persisted, without solid proof, for more than a century.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The publishers of the newspapers were actively involved in a rising political movement aimed at curtailing the civil and voting rights of non-white people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brooks said his staff worked on a </span><a href="https://www.jmu.edu/africana/racial-terror.shtml" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lynching documentation project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at James Madison University, and the library’s </span><a href="https://lva.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?vid=01LVA_INST:VU" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Untold project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> highlights Black history before 1870.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Part 2 of a two-part series that looks at the ways Virginia newspapers powered political disenfranchisement and brutalization of Black people. <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/05/02/new-information-in-135-year-old-virginia-beach-lynching-shatters-the-states-genteel-veneer/" target="_blank">Part 1</a>, on how the lynching of Noah Cherry refuted Virginia’s carefully curated image as a moderate and genteel commonwealth, was published yesterday, May 2.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When 10-year-old Alice Powell was mysteriously killed in 1885, the Norfolk Virginian and the Richmond Dispatch put together a timeline of her murder, which they blamed on Noah Cherry, a Black man who was lynched soon after the newspapers published the story. But the timelines didn’t agree with each other, or with the county’s death registry. The newspapers said coroners held two separate inquests to sift through evidence in the deaths. There is no record that those inquests ever happened. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why would these newspapers distort the facts of the case? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The year of the deaths, 1885, might provide a clue. The mid-1880s was a liminal space between the end of Reconstruction and the rise of Jim Crow, when Black and white political leaders struggled for power, sometimes violently. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The publishers and editors of newspapers including the Norfolk Virginian and the Richmond Dispatch were actively involved in these struggles and used their platforms to sway public opinion and disseminate misinformation in an effort to bolster their political ideologies, which were often racist and designed to limit the rights and privileges of non-white people. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A push for power</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The media sources that told the story that fueled Noah Cherry’s 1885 killing were connected to a white supremacist political movement that had revived the Democratic Party in Virginia and taken control of both the governor’s mansion and the General Assembly </span><a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/democratic-party-of-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the same year the lynching occurred</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after </span><a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/conservative-party-of-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than a decade of struggle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A </span><a href="https://eji.org/report/reconstruction-in-america/a-truth-that-needs-telling/#chapter-6" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Equal Justice Initiative said this movement was intent on using violence and political suppression to restore white-led rule in the South after the Civil War. But it had not completely consolidated its hold in the mid-1880s. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There was this transitional period to eliminating … the political voice of African Americans,” said Cassandra Newby-Alexander, Endowed Professor of Virginia Black History and Culture at Norfolk State University. As they grasped for power, she said, the leaders of this movement needed to project a moderate, law-abiding image to be considered socially acceptable during that time. In the case of Cherry’s lynching, which does not appear to have been fully investigated, the newspapers helped craft a narrative that authorities abided by the law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What was done was illegal. [Authorities were] bound by law to investigate,” said Newby-Alexander. When that didn’t happen properly, the media worked to “simply create a paper trail … to cover the fact that [authorities] didn&#8217;t investigate it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the time of Cherry’s lynching, Michael Glennan edited the Norfolk Virginian. A Confederate veteran, he owned the paper and was active in Democratic politics, serving for several years as chair of the party’s congressional committee for the district and as an elector for President Grover Cleveland.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to “Richmond Times-Dispatch: The Story of a Newspaper” by longtime city editor Earle Dunford, the Dispatch’s stated position during the time was &#8220;no Negro is fit to make laws for white people.” It criticized one Black politician in stark racial terms, saying he was “still a Negro, with all of a Negro&#8217;s conceit, pomposity, credulity and stupidity.'&#8221; A September 19, 1889, article in the paper encouraged Black people to </span><a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85038614/1889-09-19/ed-1/seq-2/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vacate the South and migrate west</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both newspapers only identified by name one person in the search party that found Powell’s disfigured body: Dr. L. R. Chiles of Kempsville. A former state senator, Chiles was a political activist in the Democratic Party in Princess Anne during the mid-1880s, when Glennan was in the party’s leadership. Norfolk Virginian articles show Chiles was responsible for canvassing on behalf of the party in that county in 1883, two years before the deaths of Powell and Cherry.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Race reporting</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gianluca De Fazio, an associate professor at James Madison University who </span><a href="https://sites.lib.jmu.edu/valynchings/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">researches</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lynching, said white newspapers in Virginia during the era were often sympathetic to lynchings and even helped organize them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“White newspapers were part and parcel of … the lynching as a spectacle,” he said. “They were providing not just the reporting, but also the justification for it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time the 1885 lynching took place, the Dispatch and the Virginian had already developed a clear record of covering racial violence in a way that aimed to disenfranchise Black people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One striking example of this is found in a report by the </span><a href="https://merrill.umd.edu/articles/umd-howard-center-begins-publishing-printing-hate-project-historic-role-newspapers-fueling" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at the University of Maryland</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> detailing how the Dispatch covered deadly white supremacist violence on the eve of the 1883 state election in Danville. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Howard Center </span><a href="https://wordinblack.com/2021/10/in-the-1880s-election-fraud-and-a-massacre-stopped-black-progress/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">found </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that an armed mob took to the streets that year, killing six Black men and threatening Black people who tried to vote. The Dispatch painted the deadly, racist violence as a learning opportunity for the town’s Black citizens: “These negroes had evidently come to regard themselves as in some sort the rightful rulers of the town. They have been taught a lesson — a dear lesson, it is true … but nevertheless a lesson which will not be lost upon them, nor upon their race elsewhere in Virginia.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1878 in Kempsville, seven years before Alice Powell’s death, </span><a href="https://whro.org/news/local-news/10503-the-monument-and-the-murder-the-1878-election-night-riot-and-the-confederate-monument" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Virginian covered</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an election riot in which dozens of white and Black political leaders traded gunfire outside a polling place amid accusations that the white politicians were engaged in election fraud.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several eyewitnesses said a white man rode into the crowd on horseback and shot a Black preacher named Thomas Elliott in the back, killing him. A grand jury brought charges against the Black political leaders for rioting, and a coroner’s inquest indicated Elliott’s killer may have been the father of one of the white election judges. Authorities dropped the case against the Black leaders on the condition they leave the state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If I am guilty of a crime try me and punish me,” Noah Lamb, one of the accused Black activists, told his attorney, according to a </span><a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/data/batches/dlc_java_ver01/data/sn83030214/00206531344/1879022201/0380.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">news article in a Northern paper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “If not, I want to be protected in my home. I don’t want to leave the State.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reporting on these events, the Virginian misidentified the victim, did not report the claims of election fraud or the inquest identifying the killer and blamed the violence on Black agitators and a personal argument between two people over a hunting rifle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Black-owned newspapers nationwide, though few, continually used their editorial power to expose lynchings and other racial terrors. </span><a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/mitchell-john-jr-1863-1929/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Mitchell Jr.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, born enslaved in 1863, wrote scathing rebukes of Virginia lynchings as editor of the Richmond Planet. Armed with just two pistols and facing a possible mob, Mitchell traveled to Charlotte County to confront death threats he had received for writing about a lynching that occurred there in the 1880s.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A new century and an old story</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the beginning of the 20th century, the state would have a new constitution that </span><a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/constitutional-convention-virginia-1901-1902/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">disenfranchised large numbers of Black people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=EDSmpkwThtEC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=virginia+vote+white+1902+constitution+electorate+%2B%22cut+in+half%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NfiJyTtELr&amp;sig=ACfU3U3FC8vrXHmayXtLKXQ4NTIA9QtsPA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjn09XWuobqAhV1hHIEHTRTBEAQ6AEwAHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=virginia%20vote%20white%201902%20constitution%20electorate%20%2B%22cut%20in%20half%22&amp;f=false" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">effectively cutting the electorate in half</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. News coverage of race issues also changed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Norfolk Virginian joined with another paper, the Daily Pilot, in 1898 to create the Virginian-Pilot. The Pilot’s editor, Louis Jaffé, </span><a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/jaffe-louis-i-ca-1888-1950/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">won the first Pulitzer Prize</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> garnered by a Virginia journalist in May 1929 for editorial writing against lynching. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few weeks later, in June of that year, on the same corner of Holland Road where Alice Powell had vanished, an intruder entered the home of her 73-year-old brother, A.W. Powell, and shot him to death.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_35163" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_3344-scaled.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-35163" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_3344-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1920" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_3344-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_3344-300x225.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_3344-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_3344-768x576.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_3344-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_3344-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Holland Road in present-day Virginia Beach, near the site of the Powell family home and where 10-year-old Alice Powell was killed in 1885.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Negro Suspected In Princess Anne Murder-Robbery” the front-page headline of the June 21, 1929 issue of the Pilot read, reflecting the longstanding pattern of negative media portrayals of Black people when violent crimes occurred. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police told reporters the suspect in A.W. Powell’s murder was a Black employee of the white family, like Noah Cherry had been before his lynching. They suspected this employee, eventually identified as Lewis Lawson, because he had a key to the house, and a key was found in the door. The paper continued its front-page coverage about the hunt for Lawson for several days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within the week, the Pilot reported police had interviewed others in connection with the crime, including a boy named Claude Moss and a man named Linwood Land, but the paper said they were released after convincing police they weren’t involved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The paper also mentioned that police questioned Powell’s nephew, Charles D. Powell, who was </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bg09EPNXTBDLWj6IaWEXMDlRdk8wkfAQ/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">listed as the informant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the death certificate. The paper failed to mention Charles Powell had been convicted of second-degree murder in the shooting death of a local man about nine years before (a conviction that was later overturned by the state Supreme Court after reviewing evidence the killing had been done in defense of Charles Powell’s father). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In July 1929, a month after A.W. Powell’s murder, his heirs offered $500 for the arrest and conviction of his murderer in announcements that ran several times in the Pilot, which reported that the hunt for Lawson, the Black employee, still continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In September authorities arrested Land and Moss, the two men who had been questioned previously and released, along with another man named Lloyd Moritica; there was no mention of Lewis Lawson. The case against the three defendants collapsed in December when a key witness refused to testify. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1940, a decade after A.W. Powell’s murder, his relative Charles D. Powell </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Fjm6db_GSKzBW2zCPkrApqVcvq1dAJdA/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">died in a violent quarrel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a neighbor in which he reportedly fired a gun into the man’s home, and the man killed him with a shotgun. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Pilot reported the death in a single-column story on the </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ETv_tvFRcqiJng0QVLl3UhFUbc4mcrAr/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lower half of the second page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, granting it significantly less coverage than it had provided of the Black suspect in A.W. Powell’s murder.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The aftermath</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Mercury made multiple attempts over several weeks to find and convince descendants of the Powell and Cherry families to comment on this report, without success. Norfolk resident William Cherry, 82, said it was possible he was related to Noah Cherry, but he wasn’t sure. He was born on London Bridge Road, the area newspapers reported as the homeplace of Noah Cherry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">William Cherry said he had not heard the story of the lynching until recently. He had fond memories of growing up in Princess Anne and said he wasn’t threatened or harassed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The only thing that kept us separated from whites was the law,” he said. “All of us got along.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historical records of lynchings show </span><a href="https://lynchinginamerica.eji.org/explore" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">84 reported lynchings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> occurred in Virginia between 1877 and 1950. The data doesn’t include other acts of violence that may not have been widely reported. The Princess Anne Coroner’s Files in the Library of Virginia in Richmond contain </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">records</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gZ286Atz-6C0Lm3bUTcSIOJ24-C0A2ic/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unidentified</span></a> <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JRj0NOrbWwtgGO-4D00O8_f3cKugaD1F/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_sUBaLFRo7PmQREBudU8qYxGue2v59h6/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">color</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> killed by unknown assailants with minimal investigation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, </span><a href="https://www.vpa.net/articles/the-virginian-pilot-wins-virginia-press-associations-highest-award/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Virginian Pilot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the </span><a href="https://www.poynter.org/business-work/2021/virginia-columnist-earns-pulitzer-prize-for-columns-challenging-white-supremacy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond Times-Dispatch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have won awards for coverage of civil rights and systemic racism in Virginia. A 2021 </span><a href="https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/when-writing-about-race-abuse-follows-especially-for-journalists-of-color-and-women/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">article in Poynter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> detailed how journalists of color at the Pilot and other newspapers faced abuse when covering issues like the protests against Confederate monuments in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Molly Work, one of the authors of the Howard Center report on the Danville violence, said she was stunned by coverage in the era after Reconstruction, saying “it almost read like propaganda to me.” She added that the experience of writing this story highlighted the continuing need for reporters to question and examine what they’re told.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Accuracy is king, of course, in journalism,” she said. “And I think we&#8217;ve learned that you can&#8217;t rely necessarily on, quote unquote, expert sources.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The murders of the two Powells were never solved. A.W. Powell is buried next to Alice Powell and their parents in Forest Lawn Cemetery in Norfolk. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one has located Noah Cherry’s grave.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Part 1 of a two-part series on the lynching of Noah Cherry, whose violent death at the hands of an enraged mob refuted Virginia&#8217;s carefully curated image as a moderate and genteel commonwealth.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></div>

	</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a news story, Medora Alice Powell was singing a Christian hymn, “The Sweet By-and-By,” as the 10-year-old girl left for school early in the morning on Friday the 13th of November in 1885. She took a solitary path through a portion of the rural area then known as Princess Anne County where Holland Road now snakes past a paint store, a tattoo shop and a Starbucks in southside Hampton Roads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the day&#8217;s end, following a violent thunderstorm, she didn&#8217;t return home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A search party gathered and combed through the piney woods near the child’s home, retracing her steps. Late that night they came upon the scattered remains of her lunch before discovering Powell’s mutilated body in a gruesome crime scene within the dark scrub just a half-mile from her home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When people found what had been done to Powell, it triggered deadly mob violence that escalated into the only </span><a href="https://lynchinginamerica.eji.org/explore/virginia" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">publicly recorded lynching</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in what is now Virginia Beach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two Virginia newspapers, the Norfolk Virginian</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and the Richmond Dispatch, gave the first accounts of Powell’s death and were among the first to report the subsequent lynching of her alleged killer, a Black employee of the family named Noah Cherry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same weekend the Dispatch and Virginian’s accounts came out, Cherry was murdered by an angry crowd not far from the </span><a href="https://www.dhr.virginia.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/134-5299_Virginia_Beach_Courthouse_Village_HD_2017_NRHP_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Princess Anne jail</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> near the intersection of Princess Anne and North Landing roads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two deaths became a nationwide story, reported by newspapers from Maine to California. The account continues to surface </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/projects/pilot-150/article_a685e579-6d5a-5c23-9b2b-d22886c36822.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in</span></a> <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/life/article_65bd4a26-aa9e-558b-9172-e4c9ea806650.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">articles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in a </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hampton-Roads-Murder-Mayhem-Sheppard/dp/1467140422" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">book</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and on a </span><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5UKoofnhrpFm6FakcAs8tE" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">true crime podcast</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Alice Powell’s entry on the </span><a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/63554420/medora-alice-powell" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Findagrave.com database</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> says, “This child was murdered by a young black man who had a grudge against her father.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reports of this case have made Noah Cherry the chief suspect in Powell’s murder for more than 135 years. They cast his lynching as an act of vigilante justice. But the reports of the timeline of when this crime occurred, and how authorities blamed Cherry for it, do not match a review by the Virginia Mercury of official records in the Library of Virginia in Richmond and files at the Virginia Beach Municipal Center.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All this comes to light at a time when Virginians are arguing over what to teach about the state&#8217;s history of systemic racism, as lawmakers in other states wonder if “hanging by a tree” could be added to official execution methods and amid </span><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/06/22/when-it-comes-to-public-opinion-on-race-its-not-1968-anymore/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shifting public sentiment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about </span><a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/changing-attitudes-about-racial-inequality/?doing_wp_cron=1681757218.3192389011383056640625" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">racism</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/08/12/deep-divisions-in-americans-views-of-nations-racial-history-and-how-to-address-it/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">racial history</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in America.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Lynching and its secrets</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://eji.org/reports/lynching-in-america/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2017 report by the Equal Justice Initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (EJI) shows more than 4,400 lynchings occurred between 1877 and 1950 nationwide. Virginia documented 84 of them within its borders. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EJI makes a distinction between “frontier lynching” in the West and racial terror lynchings that occurred in the South. In frontier lynchings the subject was accused of a serious crime and given “some form of process and trial.” Southern lynchings were largely “extrajudicial” – without court proceedings – and racialized: The ratio of Black victims to white victims in Southern states was 4-to-1 from 1882 to 1889, increasing to more than 17-to-1 after 1900. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lynching in Virginia was commonly triggered by allegations that Black people committed violence against white people, according to Gianluca De Fazio, an associate professor at James Madison University who directs a </span><a href="https://sites.lib.jmu.edu/valynchings/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">research project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that has collected almost 600 historical news accounts of lynching across the state.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s very helpful … to think of some kind of racial terrorism in which these lynchings are not just about punishing an alleged or perceived criminal,” De Fazio said, adding that the lynchings were often meant to send a message to the community not to violate laws or the racial hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cassandra Newby-Alexander, Endowed Professor of Virginia Black History and Culture at Norfolk State University, described how historically Virginia “managed the publicity” around racial violence to project a moderate, genteel image that wasn’t supported by facts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia crafted a very specific narrative that they publicized internationally,” Newby-Alexander said. “They were keeping the more violent and extremist elements from impacting race relations and the state. But in fact the opposite was actually true.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Two murders in 1885</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Norfolk Virginian, Alice Powell left her house near what is now the corner of Holland Road and Rosemont Road at 7:40 a.m. on Friday, Nov. 13, 1885. She walked west through a wild country landscape dotted with pine trees toward her school in Kempsville, then just a village of about 20 wooden houses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The story said that when Alice didn’t come back after school, her parents assumed she’d taken shelter from a storm that had blown through the area that afternoon. But one of her brothers went looking for her and discovered she’d never made it to school. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Alarm turned to fear,” according to the Virginian’s account. A crowd of people searched for the little girl and found her body about a half-mile away from her home. The Virginian’s description of her corpse was graphic:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“On the right side of her neck was a terrible gash, large enough to insert a man’s hand. … [H]er underclothing was torn, showing that the murderer had also attempted an outrage before the murder.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wound on her neck was allegedly so deep that when searchers picked up her body, Alice’s head nearly dropped off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginian said someone in the crowd remembered Noah Cherry had had an argument with one of Alice’s brothers and had sworn to get even. A constable arrested Cherry Saturday morning, and authorities gathered evidence against him through the weekend, finding Cherry’s blood-spotted clothing and Powell’s school books in a bundle near Cherry’s home. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginian and the Dispatch both said a coroner&#8217;s inquest found Noah Cherry killed Alice Powell with an ax or hatchet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Alice Powell’s funeral that Sunday, newspapers reported that the clues found near Cherry’s house were “noised about the county,” and talk of lynching intensified. But both the Virginian and the Dispatch had already mentioned the possibility of lynching in their very first accounts of Powell’s death. The Virginian’s story came out before the funeral and publicized it as well as the possibility of a lynching. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://merrill.umd.edu/articles/umd-howard-center-begins-publishing-printing-hate-project-historic-role-newspapers-fueling" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2021 report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the University of Maryland’s Howard Center for Investigative Journalism found news accounts after Reconstruction often fueled racial hate and drove lynchings with their coverage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to an account from the Virginian, on Sunday night a crowd of masked people assembled near the jail. They marched to the jail at 11 p.m., forced the jailer to flee and seized Noah Cherry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They marched him down the road to a nearby pine tree. According to the newspaper, moments before his death, surrounded by that angry mob, Cherry confessed to killing Alice Powell. The crowd then hung him and shot him more than a dozen times.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_35151" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1190px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-01-at-4.20.05-PM.png" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-35151" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-01-at-4.20.05-PM.png" alt="" width="1190" height="1418" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-01-at-4.20.05-PM.png 1190w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-01-at-4.20.05-PM-252x300.png 252w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-01-at-4.20.05-PM-859x1024.png 859w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-01-at-4.20.05-PM-768x915.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1190px) 100vw, 1190px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  The November 19, 1885 edition of The Virginian included an article about Noah Cherry&#8217;s lynching. (America&#8217;s News archive)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The day after the lynching, a Princess Anne County judge ordered Cherry’s body to be taken down, according to the Virginian, that said a second coroner’s inquest found that he’d been killed by unknown people. The Dispatch had fewer details, but also mentioned this second inquest. Cherry was buried near the Princess Anne jail, somewhere around the Virginia Beach Municipal Center.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What really happened?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginian and the Dispatch published the first stories about Powell’s death in the Sunday, Nov. 15, 1885 editions of their papers. This was the day of her funeral and Noah Cherry’s lynching. Other Virginia publications followed with stories that Monday, and then coverage exploded across the country in hundreds of papers later in the week, according to a news archive search.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the Virginian and the Dispatch </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">disagree with each other, and the county record, on the timeline of Alice Powell’s death. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dispatch said Alice Powell disappeared Thursday, Nov. 12 and was murdered that afternoon or evening. The Virginian reported she was murdered Friday morning, Nov. 13. The Virginian’s account is more precise, anchoring the timeline to a storm witnesses remembered. But the Virginian&#8217;s timeline doesn&#8217;t agree with Alice Powell&#8217;s gravestone, which says she was murdered Nov. 12.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s more, neither paper agrees with the Princess Anne death registry, a document in the archives of the Virginia Beach Municipal Center (</span><a href="https://cdm16450.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p15419coll3/id/6" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">and republished online</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), which says Alice Powell died Nov. 1. Her immediate family reported the death, according to the registry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That registry said Alice Powell died more than 10 days before the story of her murder appeared in newspapers, just as authorities arrested Noah Cherry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, while t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he newspapers that led coverage of Alice Powell’s death and Noah Cherry’s lynching describe authorities gathering the evidence that made Cherry the suspect, there’s no indication in the court record that authorities did any of that. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two coroner’s inquests mentioned in news accounts – which were supposed to sift through evidence in the deaths – are not in the collection of </span><a href="https://ead.lib.virginia.edu/vivaxtf/view?docId=lva/vi03358.xml" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">coroner&#8217;s records for Princess Anne</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the Library of Virginia. The Minute Book of Princess Anne County during the time period, which recorded jury proceedings and payments for jurors and coroners, also has no record of the investigations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Newby-Alexander, it’s common for criminal charges against lynching victims to be thinly sourced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is no ‘there’ there when you dig deeper into the story,” she said. “It&#8217;s almost as if all the racists in the nation got the same memo: &#8216;Blame Black men regardless of whether or not an actual crime existed. … You don’t even need to conduct a supposed investigation. All you need is the allegation.&#8217;”</span></p>

(Samantha Willis/The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having devoted the latter part of his life to preserving Pocahontas Island in Petersburg, </span><a href="https://www.jmwilkersonsince1874.com/obituary/richard-stewart" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richard A. Stewart</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the island’s honorary mayor, is gone, dead at age 79. In the wake of the stalwart community historian’s death, though, the island lives on, primed for its second wind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it did during his lifetime, Stewart’s presence looms large on Pocahontas Island, a community of some 70 acres bordered on three sides by the Appomattox River, just over the bridge from mainland Petersburg. The</span><a href="https://www.nps.gov/articles/pocaisla.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> island’s roots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reach back to 1732, when enslaved people were first brought there to work in tobacco warehouses; by 1800, over 300 free Black people lived and worked there, making it one of the largest communities of its kind in America. Stewart owned and operated the island’s Black history museum, founded in 2006. The two-story yellow clapboard house trimmed in brown today is stuffed to the gills with artifacts he collected during his lifetime, including old-fashioned agricultural tools, 19th-century horseshoes, photographs and art, a Ku Klux Klan robe and a set of shackles likely used in the restraint of enslaved people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stewart’s funeral was observed at Petersburg’s Tabernacle Baptist Church on April 22. The day before, a balmy Friday afternoon, a “Sorry, we’re closed” sign hung above the green chalkboard where Stewart had previously scrawled the museum’s tour hours. It felt like he had just stepped away and would be back any minute, eager to educate anyone who’d listen about Pocahontas Island’s history. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That history is evident in more than just the museum. The island is home to the </span><a href="https://preservationvirginia.org/saving-petersburgs-jarratt-house/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jarratt House</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, built in 1820 and at one time a stop on the Underground Railroad; Stewart and other island residents led the push for the house to be preserved, rightly recognizing it as a portal to freedom for Blacks fleeing bondage in the Petersburg area before the Civil War.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stewart also </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nucCygfhj_c" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">consistently spoke</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the area’s days as a manufacturing and railroad hub, and as a haven for free Black tradespeople, artisans and farmers in antebellum Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stewart’s neighbor Dorothy Kelley, who has lived on the island for over 50 years with her husband and his family — who were born and raised there — said the museum was one of several buildings Stewart owned on the island. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And he made sure that grass stayed cut, too,” she said. “I don’t know what’s going to happen with the museum now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What happens next?” is a fair question to ask, both about the museum and about the island itself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, the number of residents living on Pocahontas Island has steadily shrunk down to about 100 people, Kelley said. Several of the homes there are dilapidated and in need of repair; some stand vacant. There are no employment prospects on the island, and nearby Petersburg faces a </span><a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LAUCN517300000000003A" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">10.5% annual unemployment rate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of the younger people are gone; we don’t have as many children around,” said Kelley, 76, but spry and chatty as she led me around the island on an impromptu tour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She showed me the community’s tiny chapel, which had to be rebuilt after a </span><a href="https://www.weather.gov/akq/severe_Aug061993" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tornado tore through the island</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in August 1993, damaging or destroying 80% of the homes there. She introduced me to Mrs. Mary Bragg Cox, 98, the daughter of a man who, before Stewart took up Pocahontas Island’s banner, advocated for the paving of the neighborhood’s streets and the laying of its sidewalks. Cox later donated land to create a park in her father’s honor, up the street from her home. She nodded in agreement as Kelley told me what she sees as the solution to sustaining the island for the next generation: “What we need is for families, for people to come back here, help us build this place up again.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter Marlo Green.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, Green broke ground on the first in a series of homes she’s developing on the island, slated to be priced right for area families looking to settle down. A certified public accountant and first-time developer who works at Virginia State University, Green has lived in Petersburg since 2016 and believes the homes will simultaneously bring more people to Pocahontas and help local Black families build wealth through homeownership.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her vision is to “help close the wealth gap locally and bring more resources to the island,” she said as she showed me the first home of the project, which she will live in when it is completed in another few months; as we spoke, workers were nailing on its siding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Green began the effort by purchasing an acre plot from the city and plans to buy more soon. Before she started, she introduced herself to her future neighbors on the island, including Kelley, who said she feels “completely positive” about the undertaking. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another neighbor took a little more convincing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the first people I met was Mr. Stewart. He was kind of skeptical because he had seen a lot of people come to the island with a lot of hopes and dreams, but nothing had been done,” Green said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One such dream was the much-hyped </span><a href="https://wilder.vcu.edu/media/wilder/murp-studio-plans/ursp762/pdfs/s14/S14_JGriffiths_Pocahontas_Island.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pocahontas Island Neighborhood Pla</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">n, a complex set of social, economic and aesthetic goals for the island with suggested strategies on how to meet them prepared by the Wilder School of Government at Virginia Commonwealth University in 2014. Residents participated in the creation of that and other plans but have yet to see much of it brought to reality, Green explained. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite his initial caution, Green said, Stewart came to support her vision for revitalizing the island and was working to help her realize it before his death.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Green’s project unfolds, other recent developments are reasons to hope Pocahontas Island and the surrounding area will soon see better days. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced the “Partnership for Petersburg,” </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/08/26/innovative-partnership-for-petersburg-shouldnt-be-judged-by-politics/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a set of 42 initiatives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> designed to boost the economic and social outlook of the city that is no stranger to struggle. Though some correctly pointed out that most of these initiatives were already underway thanks to General Assembly action or federal funds, a bipartisan group of state and local leaders welcomed the fresh attention Youngkin’s plan placed on Petersburg. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Business </span><a href="https://www.virginiabusiness.com/article/economic-healing/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year that work had begun to make Petersburg</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “a pharmaceutical manufacturing hub and ingredient reserve, bringing economic investment, jobs and ancillary investment to the long-distressed area.” A </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/04/17/petersburg-maternal-hub-opening-reignites-discussion-over-commercial-doula-benefits/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">maternal and infant health center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> opened in Petersburg a few weeks ago, offering support to expecting and new parents as well as early childhood education opportunities. Multiple efforts are underway to </span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/local-news/the-tri-cities/a-petersburg-man-is-bringing-together-his-community-through-teaching-kids-a-unique-skill/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fight food insecurity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the area and </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2022-11-23/new-youth-urban-farm-helps-heal-petersburg-community" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">teach kids how to grow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their food. Green is also creating a nonprofit to support the future renovation of homes in need on the island.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It will mean so much to have our elders age in place more comfortably,” said Green, who grew up in public housing in Henrico County. “I saw firsthand how neighborhoods like Church Hill and Jackson Ward [in Richmond] will gentrify and push out the residents that have been there all along. That’s the polar opposite of what we’re trying to do here.”</span></p>

(Courtesy of Ben Crump Law)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Irvo Otieno departed this life on </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/21/us/irvo-otieno-virginia-police-video.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">March 6</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sprawled on the floor of Central State Hospital, his hands and feet shackled. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otieno died from asphyxiation after Henrico sheriff&#8217;s deputies and Central State Hospital employees took turns kneeling on him for almost 11 minutes. Earlier this week, a Dinwiddie County grand jury indicted seven deputies and three hospital staff on second-degree murder charges in relation to the incident.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Somehow, the presence of the hospital workers and the fact that the tragedy took place in a mental health facility didn’t prevent Otieno from being treated like a violent criminal instead of who he was: a sick person who needed help. In a way, that isn’t surprising. Otieno’s death represents Virginia’s historic legacy of mistreating and criminalizing Black people with mental illness</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Central State Hospital was first known as Howard’s Grove Hospital, a former Confederate facility that was designated for “colored” patients in 1869. In 1870, the hospital transformed into the segregated </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Central Lunatic Asylum for the Colored Insane, making it the nation’s first mental hospital for Black people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During and after the Civil War, a leading discourse among medical professionals held that Black people freed from slavery were bound to become “insane” if they were no longer engaged in forced manual labor. These founding fathers of American medicine ascribed an enslaved person’s natural, human desire to be free to an unsound mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Antebellum southern physician and open racist Dr. Samuel Cartwright famously concocted the term </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">drapetomania</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a fictitious mental disorder he claimed caused enslaved people to run away. Cartwright said in an 1851 report that drapetomania and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">dysaesthesia ethiopica</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – another nonsense condition he said made Black skin less sensitive to pain – </span><b> </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">“is the natural offspring of negro liberty – the liberty to be idle, to wallow in filth, and to indulge in improper food and drinks.” He recommended hard work and institutionalization as the remedy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Horrifyingly, Cartwright’s sensibilities formed the basis of his time’s accepted medical ideology and practice. Sadly, those views still persist in some forms today. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, a </span><a href="https://batten.virginia.edu/about/news/black-americans-are-systematically-under-treated-pain-why" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">University of Virginia study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that medical students and residents “who endorsed biological differences between Black and white people also believed that [a] fictional Black patient felt less pain.” A 2016 </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4843483/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Library of Medicine report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> included evidence that “false beliefs about biological differences between blacks and whites continue to shape the way we perceive and treat black people — they are associated with racial disparities in pain assessment and treatment recommendations.” The </span><a href="https://www.minorityhealth.hhs.gov/omh/browse.aspx?lvl=4&amp;lvlid=24" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Health and Human Services Office of Minority Health has found</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Black adults are more likely than white adults to report persistent symptoms of emotional distress like feeling sadness, hopelessness and worthlessness, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">but have less access to mental health care and medications. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The roots of this medical racism and bias stem from Cartwright’s era, but bear fruit as modern tragedies like Otieno’s senseless death. The 28-year-old Black man, an aspiring</span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/reel/738282947699145/?s=single_unit" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rap artist</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Henrico resident, was in mental distress when he was taken into police custody March 3, </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/23/us/irvo-otieno-videos-virginia.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to his mother</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Initially, he had been taken to a hospital, but instead of staying there, where presumably he’d have been able to get the medical help he needed, he was thrown in jail and subsequently bum-rushed by officers, apparently beaten and carried limp to a transport van.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why was Otieno treated more like a criminal than an ill person who needed aid? The past provides a clue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“From the beginning, insanity – a medical condition – has been criminalized in Black people,” said </span><a href="https://news.vcu.edu/article/2022/09/documentary-the-history-of-the-first-psychiatric-facility-for-african-americans" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Shawn Utsey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a clinical psychologist and Virginia Commonwealth University professor whose 2022 film </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzpr2Yvy2yw" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Central Lunatic Asylum for the Colored Insane”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> uncovers the harsh reality of life for Black patients at the facility that’s now Central State Hospital. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn&#8217;t seen as a health condition, it was seen as a criminal disposition of Black people. So that&#8217;s where it starts.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Utsey’s research and interviews for the film revealed accounts of patient abuse and neglect by hospital workers, Utsey doesn’t wholly fault the staffers, who, like those at many mental institutions nationwide, were doing what they could with limited personnel and resources in an atmosphere tainted by pervasive racism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don&#8217;t blame the workers for a culture that prescribes that Black people are basically criminals, and insanity is basically a symptom of criminality, not mental illness,” he said. “‘Mental illness in Black folks is a reflection of their criminality,’ that was the thought process.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">March 6 video shows deputies pinning Otieno to the floor of Central State’s admission area for 11 minutes as hospital staffers watched. What’s so striking and so damning from that footage is how Otieno was criminalized. He couldn’t even get help in a facility designed to treat people like him – a son, a brother, a person living with mental illness. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our system failed Irvo Otieno because it is built on a legacy of bias. Until we root out that root cause, it will most certainly fail many others. </span></p>
