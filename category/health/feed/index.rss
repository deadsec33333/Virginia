Dozens of media outlets republished our stories, too, which helped us reach new readers inside and outside the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, our readers were especially hungry to learn more about blue catfish and the invasive species&#8217; culinary potential, the state&#8217;s most stately trees and why preserving them is vital, a local school board that made history as the first in the nation to re-name schools after Confederate figures and another that sued a special needs student&#8217;s parent for $600,000. Here&#8217;s a recap of those stories and our other most-read reports and commentary of 2024.</span></p>

<p><strong>From the story: </strong>Proud and satisfied, or sad and embarrassed. However citizens of the commonwealth view Shenandoah County School Board’s recent decision, Virginia appears to be the first in the nation to restore Confederate school names, after years of vigorous community engagement, a controversial renaming process, and a change in board priorities related to race, diversity and inclusion. <strong><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/20/virginia-school-board-restores-confederate-names/">Read more.</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>From the story:</strong> Of the roughly 2 million Virginians who’d been enrolled in Medicaid before the COVID-19 pandemic, over 480,000 of them have been disenrolled as of this August. Typically eligibility determinations are made annually, but they’d been on pause nationwide amid the pandemic due to federal policy. That’s changed over the past year in what’s colloquially referred to as “Medicaid Unwinding” as provisions of federal law have expired. <em><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/nearly-500000-virginians-in-medicaid-have-been-disenrolled/"><strong>Read more.</strong></a></em></p>

Last Monday, Youngkin awarded a $250,000 grant to Sea Farms, a family-owned and -operated aquaculture and seafood processing business with operations in Gloucester and Mathews counties, that among other uses will pay for a blast freezer that will increase the amount of blue catfish the company can buy and sell. </span><em><strong><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/05/blue-catfish-are-invasive-in-virginia-the-state-is-paying-to-get-more-of-them-on-peoples-tables/">Read more.</a></strong></em></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>From the column:</strong> Data centers are making the transition (to zero-carbon energy sources) harder, but so is local resistance to building solar. General Assembly members mostly understand the connection, leading to a lively debate in last year’s legislative session over whether to override some local permit denials for solar projects – and if so, how to ensure the localities still have some say. Though none of the legislative proposals moved forward last year, the topic has become a central one for the recently revamped Commission on Electric Utility Regulation (CEUR). </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/03/data-centers-approved-solar-farms-rejected-what-is-going-on-in-rural-virginia/"><b>Read more.</b></a></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Jasmine Storrs took the stage Tuesday, she didn’t hold back: She nearly died after childbirth because she ignored her body’s warning signs. Now, she wants other women to listen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Storrs, who suffered a heart attack after days of chest tightness, shared her harrowing experience before Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced a slate of investments aimed at improving maternal health outcomes in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Time is muscle,” she recalled her doctor saying before nine hours of open-heart surgery — words that saved her life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The message was echoed by Sen. Emily Jordan, R-Suffolk, who ignored eclampsia signs after the birth of her third child in September. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think a lot of women feel guilty going through the birthing process or pregnancy process because they have other responsibilities,” Jordan said. “We have to be empowered to ask the right questions at the right time.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both women joined Youngkin who wants to invest $2.5 million in perinatal health hub pilot programs, $1 million to expand support for doulas and community health workers in local health districts, $500,000 for a public awareness campaign on life-threatening pregnancy complications, and additional funding for OB-GYN and psychiatric medical residencies in the state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposals are part of Youngkin’s broader budget request, which he will present to the state legislature’s finance committees on Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visibly emotional during the announcement, Youngkin reflected on his mother’s career as an OB-GYN nurse practitioner, calling the moment a “chance to speak for her.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also issued an </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/executive-actions/ED-11---Maternal-Health-FINAL-12.17.24.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executive directive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the state health department to include pregnancy-related data on its Maternal and Child Health Data dashboard. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s latest efforts  build on previous work to strengthen  maternal health, including his support for</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expanding </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/04/17/petersburg-maternal-hub-opening-reignites-discussion-over-commercial-doula-benefits/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">maternal health hubs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Petersburg and signing a bill earlier this year  requiring health insurance </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/youngkin-doulas-black-maternal-health-general-assembly/article_34a9f222-f379-11ee-8dc9-e36a8194fce6.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">coverage for doulas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s announcement comes as Democrats prepare their own push to address maternal disparities through a comprehensive “</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/momnibus-package-aims-to-close-maternal-health-gaps-across-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">momnibus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” package of bills and budget proposals — a riff on the term omnibus.  The effort follows an October summit in Richmond that brought together lawmakers and medical experts to tackle maternal health challenges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bipartisan rural healthcare committee has also highlighted maternal health gaps in its legislative recommendations following a statewide tour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the 2025 legislative session set to convene on Jan. 8, improving maternal healthcare is emerging as a shared priority, offering a rare opportunity for bipartisan action in Richmond.  </span></p>

He highlighted that these pharmacists will serve the areas of the state that national chains sometimes won’t. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers criss-crossing rural Virginia this year heard a common refrain: Rural communities are struggling with healthcare workforce shortages and transportation challenges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After months of meetings and site visits, the bipartisan  House Select Committee on Advancing Rural and Small Town Health Care on Tuesday released its report with a slate of legislative and budgetary recommendations aimed at tackling those challenges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the proposals are state-funded grants to help rural healthcare providers recruit professionals and increased investments in nursing education programs to build a stronger workforce. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To improve transportation access, the report proposes  a new program to provide rides to free clinics and federally qualified health centers. Lawmakers point to Virginia’s existing non-emergency transportation program for Medicaid patients, run by the Department of Medical Assistance Services, as a potential model. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve got something that’s at least serving some people,” Committee Chair Rodney Willett, D-Henrico, said during a September meeting on the Eastern Shore. “Can we leverage that? Is there a way to expand that for non-Medicaid folks who have certain income levels or live in certain areas? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee also recommends requiring insurers to cover audio-only telehealth services. Willett previously told The Mercury that it would be a lifeline for people with limited broadband access, as well as older patients or those without computers who rely on phones for remote medical care.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Support for rural parents-to-be</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A key section of the report focuses on maternal healthcare, aligning with a recently announced “</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/momnibus-package-aims-to-close-maternal-health-gaps-across-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">momnibus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” package of bills and budget proposals from Democratic lawmakers. Gov. Glenn Youngkin has also outlined his own plans to address maternal health, setting the stage for a bipartisan push in the 2025 legislative session. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With about 30% of Virginians living in areas with limited or no maternity care services, rural patients are often forced to travel long distances  for care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Midwives have become essential in filling these maternal care gaps providing perinatal care in homes, birth centers and rural hospitals. To bolster this workforce, the report recommends increased Medicaid reimbursement rates for midwives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Midwives are often rooted in the communities they serve and more likely to stay, compared to some OB-GYN medical residents that may work in rural areas for a time before leaving for work elsewhere. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Youngkin has committed to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/17/virginias-state-budget-will-fund-ob-gyn-medical-residencies-amid-obstetrics-closures/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">continuing funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for OB-GYN and family practice medical residencies — which are critical as rural hospitals close obstetrics units — the report calls for broader investment in medical residencies statewide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, Youngkin on Tuesday announced his support for legislation to streamline out-of-state midwives seeking to practice in Virginia, further strengthening the maternal health workforce. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report further recommends boosting funding for community college doula training programs, recognizing the critical role doulas play in supporting parents-to-be and improving health outcomes. This support is especially impactful for patients of color, who face disproportionate risks during pregnancy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black women are significantly </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/maternal-mortality/2021/maternal-mortality-rates-2021.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more likely to die </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">from pregnancy complications when compared to white women. Studies point to </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7384760" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">racial bias</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a contributing factor to poorer health outcomes for women of color, where doulas have been key advocates for patients’ needs and care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, Youngkin signed a bill supporting health insurance </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/youngkin-doulas-black-maternal-health-general-assembly/article_34a9f222-f379-11ee-8dc9-e36a8194fce6.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">coverage for doulas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, acknowledging their role in maternal health. But he </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/20/youngkin-vetoes-bills-on-contraception-access-skill-games-confederate-heritage-rollbacks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a separate measure that would have required unconscious bias training for nursing license renewals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bias training remains a key recommendation from the rural health committee, though it has faced resistance from some Republicans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Committee member Del. Otto Wachsmann, R-Sussex, clarified the hesitation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The problem isn’t that Republicans are against cultural awareness training — I think everybody is really for that —  but it’s putting another burden on the providers,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier in the day, when Youngkin outlined maternal health policies that he supports, The Mercury asked what changes might make him reconsider the unconscious bias bill if reintroduced, he acknowledged the disparities in health outcomes for patients of color compared to white patients, but didn&#8217;t specify if he would support the bill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think the right way to address it is to use the data that we gather and analyze to put forth really specific initiatives,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin was referring to an </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/executive-actions/ED-11---Maternal-Health-FINAL-12.17.24.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executive directive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the state’s health department to include pregnancy-related data on its Maternal and Child Health Data dashboard.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Looking forward</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As lawmakers discussed the recommendations from their report, many reflected on the bipartisan companionship built during their work on the committee — a spirit of collaboration they hope to carry into the 2025 session. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These were overnight trips,” Wachsmann said. “We found a lot of camaraderie together just breaking bread at the table and spending time together.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Representing a rural district, Wachsmann has firsthand experience with the challenges highlighted in the report. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve watched as our areas have lost pharmacies,” Wachsmann said. “I’ve seen our grocery stores leave.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that it was “refreshing” to see lawmakers  from both rural and urban districts come together to focus on the unique struggles facing  rural communities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Willett, the committee chair, emphasized that while the proposals aren’t a complete solution, they represent important steps toward improving healthcare access. </span></p>

Glenn Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers say that targeted training is critical in addressing preventable deaths and complications during childbirth, marking it as a vital step in the broader push for maternal health reform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reveals a stark disparity in maternal health: Black women are significantly </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/maternal-mortality/2021/maternal-mortality-rates-2021.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more likely to die</span> </a><span style="font-weight: 400;">from pregnancy-related complications than white women. Research also highlights that women of color often face worse  health outcomes, partly due to </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7384760" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">racial bias</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in healthcare settings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, emphasized the urgency of addressing these inequities, stating that the proposed legislation aims to tackle the “broken systems and lack of resources” contributing to poor maternal health outcomes, particularly for Black parents. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “momnibus” package — a play on the term omnibus — also includes proposals to enhance healthcare monitoring and expanded Medicaid coverage to improve maternal health outcomes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One key initiative by Del. Amy Laufer, D-Charlottesville, seeks to pilot remote monitoring for conditions like hypertension and diabetes. This approach is designed to assist expectant parents, particularly those in rural areas with limited access to hospitals or healthcare providers, by ensuring their conditions are closely monitored during pregnancy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 30% of Virginia counties lack a birthing center within a 30-minute drive, according to the March of Dimes, a non-profit that works to enhance the health of mothers and babies. In Southwest and Southside Virginia, recent years have seen the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/17/virginias-state-budget-will-fund-ob-gyn-medical-residencies-amid-obstetrics-closures"><span style="font-weight: 400;">closure of several obstetrics units</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> However, the latest state budget includes funding to support OB-GYN residencies in hospitals, aiming to bolster care in underserved areas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The momnibus package also includes proposals to expand Medicaid coverage to include diapers and limited baby supplies, as well as legislation to establish a women’s health commission focused on developing targeted maternal health policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers and maternal health experts first previewed the momnibus package during a Black Maternal Health </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/18/momnibus-bill-plans-announced-at-virginias-black-maternal-health-summit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Richmond in October, where public health professionals and legislators from around the country gathered to collaborate on solutions to improve maternal health outcomes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Candi Mundon King, D-Prince William, on Monday expressed optimism about bipartisan support for the upcoming maternal health proposals, noting that Republicans have previously supported and even co-sponsored some Democrat-led maternal health initiatives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re hoping that when these bills get before them, they will continue that support,” Mundon King said.</span></p>

Tuck&#8217;s statements were substantiated through interviews with mental health professionals with knowledge of her family&#8217;s situation. </i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With books, toys and artwork strewn about, Asheley Tuck’s son’s room is the typical sort one might expect from an 11-year-old boy. What is less typical: a piece of notebook paper taped to his door labeled “safety plan.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The paper outlines how sudden mood shifts, loss of interests, isolation or a racing heart could be warning signs of anxiety, so that he can better recognize when an attack might be coming on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuck’s son also has notes that outline techniques — like listing types of Pokemon in alphabetical order — which can help him cope with swelling negative emotions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The notes are relics from crisis response and follow-up counseling he received this past summer after he and some friends encountered an online predator during a sleepover.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuck said that she and her wife didn’t know how to best comfort their son when he called to be picked up from the sleepover and confided in them what had happened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“(The person) scared them and asked them to do some things that were not appropriate for anyone, much less, you know, an 11-year-old,” Tuck said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her son expressed feeling like “his life was ruined” and he was worried he would be “plastered on the internet and what the repercussions would be,” Tuck recalled. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He was devastated.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having known people who were social workers, Tuck realized she could call Richmond’s Crisis Response and Stabilization Team (CReST). Within less than an hour, a clinician arrived at their house to provide immediate counseling to the family. After the initial visit, CReST arranged follow-up visits for a few weeks and referred the family to additional counseling services if needed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The fact that he got services that quickly was a game changer for how he&#8217;ll be able to navigate his life going forward,” Tuck said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the clinician who responded to Tuck’s son was part of CReST through the Richmond Behavioral Health Authority, there are similar programs around Virginia, colloquially referred to as mobile crisis units. These professionals and teams are part of Virginia’s ever-expanding landscape of mental health resources and have played a role in keeping patients in their homes rather than hospitals or, in escalated cases, jails.</span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Erin DeLizzio, a program manager at CReST, explained that while some staff are located in the downtown Richmond office, others have take-home cars to be dispatched from around the region, from Hanover to Farmville to Emporia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said that her area, Region 4, was able to provide services to over 1,500 people in the 2024 fiscal year. Most of those people were diverted from hospitals and jails and were able to get help at their homes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’ve got to be able to meet people where they are,” said Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a longtime champion for bolstering mental health resources in Virginia who supported the 2021 legislation that paved the way for mobile crisis units and other services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CReST’s responses to calls for help can range from de-escalating situations over the phone to dispatching clinicians to meet with people directly. Sometimes patients need immediate counseling and connections to follow-up resources like therapists or psychiatrists. Sometimes they might need to be admitted to crisis receiving centers — which operate like emergency rooms in hospitals, but focus on mental health. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clinicians can be dispatched when people call the regional mobile crisis line directly or when routed through emergency calls to 911 or 988, a national mental health crisis hotline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the national mental health emergency hotline transitioned to the easier-to-remember 988 system, Virginia </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+ful+CHAP0248" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2021 funded expanded call centers and listed the deployment of mobile crisis units as part of 988’s responsibilities. The service has been </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/local/richmond/2024/09/25/virginia-988-hotline-mental-health-crisis" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on the rise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Virginia, which Gov. Glenn Youngkin has said he sees as a success because it means people are connected to resources before a crisis can escalate further. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s three-year </span><a href="https://www.hhr.virginia.gov/12-14-2022-Two-Page-BH-Plan-Summary.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right Help, Right Now</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> plan entails budget proposals from the governor and legislative actions by state lawmakers focused on mental health care. Youngkin recently celebrated the two year anniversary of the initiative.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right Help, Right Now is working,” he declared excitedly at a press conference on the two year anniversary of the initiative, Dec. 11. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The initiative’s bipartisan efforts build on a decade’s worth of work spearheaded by Deeds and the Behavioral Health Commission he helped establish. Outside of legislative sessions, the commission undertakes studies and hears from experts around the state to craft or endorse legislation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent years have seen new solutions born from local tragedies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bill dubbed “Irvo’s Law” allows families access to their loved one if they are taken into custody by law enforcement during a crisis. Its inspiration stemmed from the death of Henrico resident Irvo Otineo, who died in a mental health hospital while constrained by law enforcement officers and staff, and whose mother was denied access to him there.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2020 law called the “</span><a href="https://dbhds.virginia.gov/human-resource-development-and-management/health-equity/mdpa/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marcus Alert</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” stems from the death of Richmond resident Marcus-David Peters, who was killed by police in 2018 during a mental health crisis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a growing number of Virginia localities implement the law, it enables coordination between 911 and regional call centers to triage the best response from law enforcement and trained clinicians when handling mental health situations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A main goal is to not hospitalize someone if we can,” said Abigayle Hodges, a mobile crisis unit team leader at CReST. </span></p>

Glenn Youngkin listens to featured speakers during the two year anniversary of the Right Help, Right Now mental health support initiative on Dec. 11, 2024. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often, law enforcement officers are the first responders to crises and  escort people to hospitals where they sit waiting with them. Other times, people may be subject to emergency custody orders, which is when a magistrate orders that someone needs to be evaluated by health professionals because they could be a harm to themselves or others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consensus has been building between some lawmakers and members of law enforcement that officers and deputies aren’t always the best people to take point or remain with people in crises for longer periods of time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not only should there be less police interactions with someone who’s going through a crisis, but when you’re looking at rural areas such as the county where I’m from and small police departments throughout the region, then taking just one person off patrol can hurt a community,” said Tazewell County Sheriff Brian Hieatt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent </span><a href="https://bhc.virginia.gov/documents/BHC%20Staff%20-%20ABLEO.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">presentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Virginia’s Behavioral Health Commission also noted how arrests of people in mental health crises have a “devastating impact” on those in crisis and that it can “stress local and state resources.” People in crisis can also be more prone to lashing out and assaulting an officer, regardless of their coherence or intent, and end up facing jail time as a result. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his forthcoming budget presentation for 2025, Youngkin hopes that $35 million can be invested into creating “</span><a href="https://www.dcjs.virginia.gov/licensure-and-regulatory-affairs/special-conservators-peace" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Special Conservators of the Peace</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” he said this week. These are both armed and unarmed positions authorized by courts to carry out limited law enforcement duties. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While resources like 988 and mobile crisis units can help prevent people from going to the hospital, Youngkin believes the conservators can help improve the outcomes of those who are taken to hospitals by law enforcement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“(Officers) are brought into many of these circumstances that not only distract them from so many other responsibilities, but then have an individual who&#8217;s in crisis enter the criminal justice system unnecessarily — we need to address both of those,” Youngkin said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While state lawmakers will still need to collaborate with Youngkin throughout the first few months of 2025 to decide how the state’s budget will be allocated, Youngkin sees the conservator program as a temporary solution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We should see a reduction in hospital admittance, and therefore a reduction in the law enforcement needs around the hospital,” Youngkin said. “But for the time being, having our cops in place that allow this transfer of custody is really important.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anna Czaplicki Ryan, a program supervisor at CReST, described how some transfer of care is already happening between law enforcement and clinicians.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A ‘warm handoff’ is the terminology we use,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CReST staff and law enforcement already have some experience working together in instances where police are at the scene of an emergency first and ask for assistance or for clinicians to take over care, Czaplicki Ryan explained. When officers and clinicians demonstrate the transfer of care to patients, it can help them feel supported and know they are “not abandoned.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deeds, who serves on the Senate’s finance committee, said that he’s “fine with” Youngkin’s conservator proposal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I just think that our focus should not necessarily be on the moment of crisis,” Deeds said. “Our focus also needs to be on prevention, on keeping people out of crisis.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Asheley Tuck, whose son experienced a trauma, she said that she’s glad she knew that 988 and CReST existed in their moment of need. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If a friend had not mentioned that this program exists, I may not have known about it at all,” she said. “I think it should be regular public knowledge.”</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce for The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parents in Virginia who don’t vaccinate their young children,</span> <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/richmond/2024/11/20/school-vaccine-exemptions-virginia" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a percentage that’s grown over the past decade</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, are making a risky bet with their kids’ health – and maybe even their lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a dangerous trend, perhaps attributable to the bleats of vaccine deniers who elevate misinformation, emotion and quackery over science.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some adults may be unaware of past scourges where children frequently became ill before vaccines were available. Many decades ago, polio sufferers had to depend on metal apparatuses called</span> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/10/25/1047691984/decades-after-polio-martha-is-among-the-last-to-still-rely-on-an-iron-lung-to-br" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">iron lungs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> just to help them breathe. Today, because of vaccines, polio is</span> <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/An-important-moment-in-the-fight-against-polio" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly eradicated worldwide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and iron lungs are primarily an eerie part of my youthful subconscious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vaccines work. More Americans should know that fact. Refusal of vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic,</span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0250123" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">often along partisan lines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, makes the current challenge tougher.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.axios.com/local/richmond/2024/11/20/school-vaccine-exemptions-virginia" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Axios Richmond</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently noted the number of parents in Virginia now opting out of getting their children vaccinated. It reported the percentage of kindergartners with vaccine exemptions has quadrupled over the past 10 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CDC statistics show 2.4%, or about 2,050 children out of 85,374 kindergartners in the commonwealth, had either medical or nonmedical vaccine exemptions in the 2023-24 school year. In 2014, that figure was 0.6%. (Nonmedical exemptions often involve religious reasons, though I suspect parents often cite them merely to refuse the injections.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s rate of exemptions was still below the national average of 3.3%, Axios reported. Parents nationwide also overwhelmingly support childhood vaccinations,</span> <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2023/05/16/americans-largely-positive-views-of-childhood-vaccines-hold-steady/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to the Pew Research Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those positive facts could be altered, however, because</span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/12/03/nx-s1-5198506/rfk-jr-anti-vaccine-chd-lawsuits" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is set to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under President-elect Donald Trump. Kennedy is a prominent anti-vaxxer and has been criticized as a</span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/10/rfk-jr-faces-trouble-in-the-senate-00193579" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“denier of science.”</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s another example of Trump</span><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-trumps-washington/the-scandal-of-trumps-cabinet-picks-isnt-just-their-personal-failings" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">using his picks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to undermine the health and safety of everyday Americans, while at the same time awarding his sycophants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vaccine refusal disturbs epidemiologists like Carrie Dolan, an associate professor of kinesiology and public health at William &amp; Mary. She said the benefits of vaccines far, far outweigh the risks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They’re effective,” Dolan told me. “They’re safe. They’re reliable.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When people aren’t vaccinated, she added, the chance for an infected person to spread a contagious disease to someone else increases. Getting a little wonky – at least for me – Dolan explained something called an</span><a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/25/1/17-1901_article" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“R0,” or basic reproduction number</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Measles has an R0 of 12 to 18, meaning one infected person could spread it to up to 18 others in an unvaccinated population, she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Before the vaccine, measles caused widespread outbreaks, often leading to complications like pneumonia and, in rare cases, brain swelling,” Dolan said by email. “Thanks to vaccination programs, measles cases have been drastically reduced worldwide. However, when vaccination rates drop, outbreaks can quickly return.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whooping cough, or pertussis, has an R0 of 12–17 and is especially dangerous for infants, who can have severe coughing fits that make breathing difficult. “Vaccination has greatly reduced the risk,” she said, but without it, “this disease could spread more easily, putting vulnerable groups like babies and the elderly at greater risk.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vaccinations also help protect children who, paradoxically, can’t take them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. John Harrington, a general pediatrician at Children’s Hospital of The King’s Daughters in Norfolk, told me that young oncology patients chronically on steroids are “unlikely to mount a response” to certain vaccines. In those instances, vaccines could be harmful.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_41481" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:150px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/13/vaccines-protect-your-children-and-others-too/harringtonjohn2015/" rel="attachment wp-att-41481"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-41481" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/HarringtonJohn2015-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Dr. John Harrington, general pediatrician at Children&#8217;s Hospital of The King&#8217;s Daughters in Norfolk, said vaccine-hesitant parents are often willing to listen to their doctors&#8217; advice about whether to get their children vaccinated. (Photo courtesy of CHKD)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The assumption is if everybody else is vaccinated, that protects” children with serious health problems, Harrington said. (This is also another way to define</span><a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22599-herd-immunity" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">herd immunity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vaccine-hesitant parents tend to have heard or seen things on the internet or social media that influence their thinking, he said. Many, though, are willing to listen to their pediatricians or primary care physicians about the issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, vaccines are overwhelmingly safe and effective, even if the total risk can’t be ruled out. Children are more likely to be protected, though, from diseases than if they hadn’t gotten the shots, Harrington said.</span></p>

		<p style="font-size:13px"><b>– Erica Hunter, immunization data and outreach manager in the Virginia Department of Health</b></p>
	</div>
	</div>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Erica Hunter, immunization data and outreach manager in the Virginia Department of Health,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">told me the recent trends on refusing vaccines for young children “certainly raise concerns.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most Virginians do vaccinate their children,” Hunter said, adding she had no information on what role vaccine denialism might have in contributing to the statistics. “We just try to provide the best and most accurate information we can.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She noted the state’s Vaccines for Children program provides free immunizations and has done so for decades. “These viruses have not gone anywhere,” Hunter said. “They can resurface when vaccination rates decline.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Non-COVID outbreaks have occurred in Virginia from time to time. For example, since June 2022,</span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/surveillance-and-investigation/meningococcal-disease-outbreak-response/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">41 confirmed cases</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of meningococcal disease associated with an outbreak of a specific bacterium have occurred. It killed eight people of all ages.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nationwide, 283 measles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cases were reported this year through Dec. 5, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. Virginia had one reported case. Some 89% of the total cases were listed as unvaccinated or unknown.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not vaccinating children exasperates Dolan, the Willam &amp; Mary epidemiologist. She helps run an immunization project in Kenya, and this summer, she had just 14 vaccines to fight HPV.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some 300 girls sought the precious supply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In America, she said, we forget how lucky we are to have access to vaccines. “It’s been weaponized politically,” Dolan noted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please vaccinate your children. Your actions will protect them and may help others, too.</span></p>

As a pediatric rheumatologist, I’ve witnessed families making hard choices when their prescriptions become too expensive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why I find it incredibly upsetting when some Virginia hospitals and healthcare systems exploit and profit from federal programs intended to provide underserved patients with financial relief while serving as a safety net for those struggling to afford medications. Increased transparency and oversight are required to ensure that these programs directly benefit patients – not increase the profits of hospitals and other health care corporations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 340B Drug Pricing Program, or 340B, was created by Congress in 1992 to help low-income and uninsured patients living with conditions requiring costly outpatient medications access these necessary treatments and is a prime example of an essential safety net program. Through 340B, qualifying hospitals and clinics serving a large number of vulnerable patients can purchase deeply discounted medicines directly from pharmaceutical manufacturers with the expectation that they use these savings to help patients to afford and access their necessary medications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past few years, many large hospitals and other corporations have turned the well-intentioned program into a profit-making scheme to improve their own bottom lines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At 340B hospitals, the average cost per prescription is more than </span><a href="https://phrma.org/Blog/New-year-same-exploitation-of-the-340B-program" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">150%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> higher for patients than at non-340B hospitals. Meanwhile, </span><a href="https://340breform.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Charity-Care-Report-Final-1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly 70%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 340B hospitals that care for many vulnerable patients are providing below-average levels of lower-cost or free care. What was once a little-known program intended to help our community’s most vulnerable has now ballooned into the </span><a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/posts/subcommittee-chair-griffith-opening-remarks-at-oversight-hearing-on-the-340-b-program" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">second largest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> federal prescription drug program nationwide, with more and more hospitals profiting from 340B discounts. It has become a critical income source for hospitals — rather than an essential source of medications for eligible patients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While many of the 340B entities — including federally qualified health centers (</span><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2824253?utm_source=costcurve.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=some-personal-news-i-m-going-to-start-working-with-tufts-cevr&amp;_bhlid=91205a215554a61da0f85920c70fb7faac7e3ea1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FQHC)s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Ryan White AIDS clinics, and other federal grantees — do an incredible job at caring for some of our state’s most vulnerable patients, patients and their physicians, including many of my Virginia colleagues, are concerned about ongoing abuse of the 340B program by large disproportionate share hospitals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These hospitals, which make up </span><a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/opa/updates/2023-340b-covered-entity-purchases?" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">78% of the entire program’s spending</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, purchase and significantly profit from discounted 340B medications. Large hospital systems are increasingly acquiring pharmacies, practices and smaller health centers, such as oncology and infusion clinics, to further capitalize on 340B discounts without lowering patients’ costs or providing higher quality care. In fact, between 2016 and 2022, larger 340B hospitals were responsible for </span><a href="https://avalere.com/insights/characteristics-of-hospitals-undergoing-mergers-and-acquisitions" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">about 80%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of hospital acquisitions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These troubling incentives for hospital acquisitions and cost-shifting are leading to small clinic closures and less health care options for patients across the country — even in our own backyard. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As reported by </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/24/health/bon-secours-mercy-health-profit-poor-neighborhood.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York Times</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2022, Bon Secours Mercy Health, a prominent nonprofit health system, acquired Richmond Community Hospital, a cash-strapped community hospital, in 1995. In the following decades, Bon Secours abused its ownership of Richmond Community Hospital and took advantage of 340B discounted purchases while cutting services at Richmond Community Hospital, according to The New York Times. Medications purchased using the 340B program were given to commercially insured patients throughout the region while billing the commercial rates, thereby pocketing the price differences. Meanwhile, Bon Secours has one of the highest profit margins of any hospital in Virginia, generating as much as </span><a href="https://www.vhi.org/Bon%2520Secours%2520Richmond%2520Community%2520Hospital.html?tab=&amp;?=h9880/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$100 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This program, originally intended to serve the most vulnerable patients, is now growing due to rampant abuse from hospital systems and for-profit corporations. In 2023 alone, 340B covered entities used the program to purchase over </span><a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/opa/updates/2023-340b-covered-entity-purchases" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$66 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in outpatient drugs — an over 23% increase from the year before. Much of this growth is due, in part, to 340B hospitals’ ability to also contract with an unlimited number of pharmacies — including those out-of-state — many of which are owned by the nation’s largest pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and insurers. As a result, PBMs and 340B contract pharmacies share in the massive profits from discounted 340B medicines. In fact, </span><a href="https://www.drugchannels.net/2023/07/exclusive-for-2023-five-for-profit.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than half</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the entire U.S. pharmacy industry is contracted to dispense steeply discounted 340B drugs. But hospitals are not required to share these discounted prices with patients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The numbers are clear — 340B has become less about helping vulnerable patients and their families access the care they need and more about hospital systems and other corporations capitalizing on these federally mandated discounts to improve bottom lines, or </span><a href="https://www.adapadvocacy.org/pdf-docs/2024_ADAP_RW_340B_Project_Asset_6_ExecComp_FInal_Report_06-05-24.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">even boost</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> executive compensation at hospitals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While 340B is an important safety net in Virginia, it is in dire need of federal action to improve transparency and accountability measures to ensure it works as intended. Any proposed 340B policy that allows hospitals and other corporations to continue their rampant abuse must be reconsidered. Without action from Congress, hospitals, and corporations will continue to profit, while Virginia’s financially vulnerable patients and families are left without a functioning safety net to catch them. </span></p>

<p>More than 3 million adults in nine states would be at immediate risk of losing their health coverage should the GOP reduce the extra federal Medicaid funding that’s enabled states to widen eligibility, <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/medicaid-expansion-is-a-red-and-blue-state-issue/" target="_blank">according to KFF</a>, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News, and the Georgetown University <a href="https://ccf.georgetown.edu/2024/11/27/federal-funding-cuts-to-medicaid-may-trigger-automatic-loss-of-health-coverage-for-millions-of-residents-of-certain-states/" target="_blank">Center for Children and Families</a>. That’s because the states have trigger laws that would swiftly end their Medicaid expansions if federal funding falls.</p>
<p>The states are Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah, and Virginia.</p>
<div class="datawrapper-embed block--datawrapper-embed "><iframe id="datawrapper-chart-NzypI" title="Which States Have Medicaid-Expansion Trigger Laws?" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/NzypI" height="578" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" aria-label="Interactive DataWrapper Embed" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></div>
<p>The 2010 Affordable Care Act encouraged states to expand Medicaid programs to cover more low-income Americans who didn’t get health insurance through their jobs. Forty states and the District of Columbia agreed, extending health insurance since 2014 to an estimated 21 million people and helping drive the U.S. uninsured rate to record lows.</p>
<p>In exchange, the federal government pays 90% of the cost to cover the expanded population. That’s far higher than the federal match for other Medicaid beneficiaries, which averages about 57% nationwide.</p>
<p>Conservative policy groups, which generally have opposed the ACA, say the program costs too much and covers too many people. Democrats say the Medicaid expansion has saved lives and helped communities by widening coverage to people who could not afford private insurance.</p>
<p>If Congress cuts federal funding, Medicaid expansion would be at risk in all states that have opted into it — even those without trigger laws — because state legislatures would be forced to make up the difference, said Renuka Tipirneni, an associate professor at the University of Michigan’s School of Public Health.</p>
<p>Decisions to keep or roll back the expansion “would depend on the politics at the state level,” Tipirneni said.</p>
<p>For instance, Michigan approved a trigger as part of its Medicaid expansion in 2013, when it was controlled by a Republican governor and legislature. Last year, with the government controlled by Democrats, the state eliminated its funding trigger.</p>
<p>Six of the nine states with trigger laws — Arizona, Arkansas, Indiana, Montana, North Carolina, and Utah — went for Trump in the 2024 election.</p>
	<div class="newsroomSidebarContainer ">
	<div class="newsroomSidebar">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia became the 33rd state to expand Medicaid in the summer of 2018, which allowed more people to be eligible. Following months of legislative debate that year, it passed with bipartisan support. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medicaid is a state and federal program that provides insurance coverage to low-income people or people with disabilities. Prior to the expansion taking effect in 2019, childless adults were not eligible in Virginia and parents were only eligible for up to 38% of the federal poverty level. According to a 2022 National Library of Medicine </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9134455/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Virginia had one of the highest uninsured rates of non-elderly adults below 138% of the federal poverty level. The study also found that people were less likely to delay medical care since the expansions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s the benefits to Virginians that Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, said she is focused on amid possible changes in the federal landscape. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said that the Senate’s finance committee discussed the matter at a recent retreat and she hopes lawmakers with higher concentrations of people who have benefitted from Medicaid in their districts will think about protecting the expansion. Boysko finds it “disturbing” that Medicaid funding could be on the federal “chopping block” and is concerned what a federal GOP trifecta might mean for the Affordable Care Act overall. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Boysko noted that Virginia’s state health insurance exchange — also made possible by the ACA—  could be a way to “absorb” some patients if need be and said that lawmakers may also need to “get creative” with some of its surplus. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, Virginia and the nation are also experiencing a Medicaid “unwinding,” as eligibility checks are underway to determine who still meets criteria to remain covered and who does not. In recent months, over 500,000 people have been </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/nearly-500000-virginians-in-medicaid-have-been-disenrolled/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">disenrolled </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">while about 2 million have been </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/va-dept-of-medical-services-to-tap-reserve-fund-to-cover-delayed-payments-amid-medicaid-unwinding/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">redetermined</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to data from the Department of Medical Assistance Services.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We will address whatever we have to in the General Assembly to do the best we can to help protect our residents,” Boysko said. “But we&#8217;ve still got to see how this all pans out.” —Charlotte Rene Woods, Virginia Mercury reporter</span></div>
	</div>
	
<p>Most of the nine states’ triggers kick in if federal funding falls below the 90% threshold. Arizona’s trigger would eliminate its expansion if funding falls below 80%.</p>
<p>Montana’s law rolls back expansion below 90% funding but allows it to continue if lawmakers identify additional funding. Under state law, Montana lawmakers <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/montana-medicaid-expansion-renewal-2025/" target="_blank">must reauthorize its Medicaid expansion</a> in 2025 or the expansion will end.</p>
<p>Across the states with triggers, between 3.1 million and 3.7 million people would swiftly lose their coverage, researchers at KFF and the Georgetown center estimate. The difference depends on how states treat people who were added to Medicaid before the ACA expansion; they may continue to qualify even if the expansion ends.</p>
<p>Three other states — Iowa, Idaho, and New Mexico— have laws that require their governments to mitigate the financial impact of losing federal Medicaid expansion funding but would not automatically end expansions. With those three states included, about 4.3 million Medicaid expansion enrollees would be at risk of losing coverage, according to KFF.</p>
<p>The ACA allowed Medicaid expansions to adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level, or about $20,783 for an individual in 2024.</p>
<p>Nearly a quarter of the 81 million people enrolled in Medicaid nationally are in the program due to expansions.</p>
<p>“With a reduction in the expansion match rate, it is likely that all states would need to evaluate whether to continue expansion coverage because it would require a significant increase in state spending,” said Robin Rudowitz, vice president and director of the Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured at KFF. “If states drop coverage, it is likely that there would be an increase in the number of uninsured, and that would limit access to care across red and blue states that have adopted expansion.”</p>
<p>States rarely cut eligibility for social programs such as Medicaid once it’s been granted.</p>
<p>The triggers make it politically easier for state lawmakers to end Medicaid expansion because they would not have to take any new action to cut coverage, said Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families.</p>
<p>To see the impact of trigger laws, consider what happened after the Supreme Court in 2022 struck down <em>Roe v. Wade</em> and, with it, the constitutional right to an abortion. Conservative lawmakers in 13 states had crafted trigger laws that would automatically implement bans in the event a national right to abortion were struck down. Those state laws resulted in restrictions taking effect immediately after the court ruling, or shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>States adopted triggers as part of Medicaid expansion to win over lawmakers skeptical of putting state dollars on the hook for a federal program unpopular with most Republicans.</p>
<p>It’s unclear what Trump and congressional Republicans will do with Medicaid after he takes office in January, but one indicator could be a recent recommendation from the Paragon Health Institute, a leading conservative policy organization led by former Trump health adviser Brian Blase.</p>
<p>Paragon has proposed that starting in 2026 the federal government would phase down the 90% federal match for expansion until 2034, when it would reach parity with each state’s federal match for its traditional enrollees. Under that plan, states could still get ACA Medicaid expansion funding but restrict coverage to enrollees with incomes up to the federal poverty level. Currently, to receive expansion funding, states must offer coverage to everyone up to 138% of the poverty level.</p>
<p>Daniel Derksen, director of the Center for Rural Health at the University of Arizona, said it’s unlikely Arizona would move to eliminate its trigger and make up for lost federal funds. “It would be a tough sell right now as it would put a big strain on the budget,” he said.</p>
<p>Medicaid has been in the crosshairs of Republicans in Washington before. Republican congressional leaders in 2017 proposed legislation to cut federal expansion funding, a move that would have shifted billions in costs to states. That plan, part of a strategy to repeal Obamacare, ultimately failed.</p>

(Brett Kelman/KFF Health News)</p><p>KINGSPORT, Tenn. — Jerry Qualls had a heart attack in 2022 and was rushed by ambulance to Holston Valley Medical Center, where he was hospitalized for a week and kept alive by a ventilator and blood pump, according to his medical records.</p>
<p>His wife, Katherine Qualls, said his doctors offered little hope. In an interview and a written complaint to the Tennessee government, she said doctors at Holston Valley told her that her husband would not qualify for a heart transplant and shouldn’t be expected to recover.</p>
<p>Defiant, she insisted he be transferred hours away to a hospital in Nashville. Within days of leaving Holston Valley, Jerry Qualls was awake and sitting upright, his wife said, and he ultimately received a lifesaving heart transplant.</p>
<p>“How many families don’t know how to get a transfer and their loved one dies?” Katherine Qualls wrote in <a href="https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/health/documents/copa/Master-PDF-of-Public-Hearing-comments.pdf" target="_blank">her complaint to the state</a>. “My husband would have been dead within a few days if I didn’t get him out when I did.”</p>
<p>Holston Valley Medical Center is a flagship of <a href="https://www.balladhealth.org/" target="_blank">Ballad Health</a>, a 20-hospital system in northeastern Tennessee and southwestern Virginia that is the only option for hospital care in a large swath of Appalachia. Ballad formed six years ago when lawmakers in both states, in an effort to prevent hospital closures, <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/appalachia-ballad-health-copa-monopoly-charity-care-quality/" target="_blank">waived federal antitrust laws</a> so two rival health systems could merge. The merger created the largest state-sanctioned hospital monopoly in the nation.</p>
<p>Since then, Ballad has largely kept those hospitals open. But the monopoly has also fallen short of about three-fourths of the quality-of-care goals set by the states over the last three fiscal years, including failing to meet state benchmarks on infections, mortality, <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/ballad-health-er-wait-times-copa-monopoly-appalachia-hospitals/" target="_blank">emergency room speed</a>, and patient satisfaction, according to <a href="https://www.tn.gov/content/tn/health/health-program-areas/health-planning/certificate-of-public-advantage/redir-copa/copa-reports.html" target="_blank">annual reports</a> from the Tennessee Department of Health and Ballad itself.</p>
<p>Some local residents have become wary, afraid, or unwilling to seek care at Ballad hospitals and must drive over an hour to reach other options, according to written complaints to the Tennessee government and state lawmakers, public hearing testimony, and KFF Health News interviews conducted over the past year with patients, family members, local leaders, and some officials who once publicly supported the monopoly, including a former government consultant and one state lawmaker. Many of those who submitted complaints or were interviewed allege that paper-thin staffing at Ballad hospitals and ERs is the root cause of the monopoly’s quality-of-care woes.</p>
<p>In a two-hour interview vigorously defending the company, Ballad Health CEO Alan Levine said the hospitals are rapidly recovering from a quality-of-care slump caused by COVID-19 and a subsequent rise in nursing turnover and staff shortages. These issues affected hospitals nationwide, Levine said, and were not related to the Ballad merger or the monopoly it created.</p>
<p>Levine declined to discuss specific complaints from patients. But he said that each of the complaints referenced in this article took issue with medical decisions made by doctors in Ballad hospitals — not “any policy or practice at Ballad.”</p>
<p>“I can understand if the patients, if the wife, was upset about the medical decisions they made if it turned out to be wrong,” Levine said. “But that has nothing to do with the merger, OK? That’s a completely different issue, and it happens in hospitals all over the country.”</p>
<p>In the interview with KFF Health News and in the days that followed, Levine flexed considerable connections to officials in the Tennessee government. As Levine spoke in a boardroom at Ballad’s hilltop headquarters, he was flanked by three local mayors who voiced support for the hospitals and said complaints came from a vocal minority of their constituents. Days later, Levine got two Tennessee state agency directors and a former state health commissioner to provide emails or text messages supporting statements he made during the interview.</p>
<p>Logan Grant, executive director of the Tennessee Health Facilities Commission, which processes complaints against hospitals for the state, said in a statement prompted by Levine that Ballad hospitals are “not an outlier in terms of substantiated survey findings.”</p>
<p>Joe Grandy, the mayor of Tennessee’s Washington County, where Ballad is headquartered, said most residents consider the quality of care in the area “about as good as it gets.”</p>

(Brett Kelman/KFF Health News)</p></figure>
<p>Brenda Getaz certainly doesn’t.</p>
<p>Getaz, 76, who spent three decades as a hospital official specializing in quality standards before retiring to Washington County, said she plans to move to Atlanta if state governments do not take action to fix Ballad in the coming year. Getaz said local medical professionals she trusts have urged her to move away so she does not have to rely on Ballad for care.</p>
<p>“I’m frightened to be taken to a Ballad facility,” she said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Glimpses of government concern</h4>

	
<p>The Tennessee Department of Health, which has the most direct oversight over Ballad Health, over the past year has declined multiple interview requests to discuss the hospital monopoly. Department emails reviewed by KFF Health News, some of which were obtained through public record requests, offer glimpses of concern inside the agency.</p>
<p>Emails show the health department has attempted <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/tennessee-ballad-health-copa-hospital-monopoly-quality-of-care/" target="_blank">to hold Ballad more accountable</a> for its quality of care in closed-door negotiations and is investigating Holston Valley’s treatment of a recent heart patient after receiving detailed complaints from his family. In <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25444995-ballad-alvarado-ouch-email/#document/p1" target="_blank">a 2023 email</a>, Tennessee Health Commissioner Ralph Alvarado reacted to a news story about low job satisfaction among Ballad nurses by writing: “Ouch. … What are they doing to address this?”</p>
<p>In another email from the same year, Alvarado praised an informal report submitted at a public hearing that concluded Ballad’s monopoly had caused more harm than good. The report was written by Wally Hankwitz, a retired health care executive who once led a physician management company in Kingsport. The report levied pages of criticism against Ballad’s “sub-par” performance and called for the monopoly to end.</p>
<p>“THIS <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25355986-alvarado-email-and-hankwitz-report-from-record-request" target="_blank">communication from the COPA hearing</a> is particularly good,” the health commissioner wrote to some of his staff. “Totally based on data. I would almost like to hear Ballad’s response to this.”</p>
<p>When asked to respond to the Hankwitz report, Levine said it was “full of errors” and that “no credible institution would pay attention to it.”</p>
<p>Despite concerns, Tennessee and Virginia have each year determined that the benefits of the Ballad monopoly outweigh any negative impacts, issuing stamps of approval that allow the monopoly to continue. This has occurred, at least in part, because both states grade Ballad against <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/tennessee-a-grade-ballad-health-hospital-monopoly/" target="_blank">scoring rubrics</a> that do not prioritize quality of care.</p>
<p>Larry Fitzgerald, a retired Tennessee consultant who monitored the monopoly for the state for more than five years and always <a href="https://www.tn.gov/content/tn/health/health-program-areas/health-planning/certificate-of-public-advantage/redir-copa/copa-reports.html" target="_blank">gave Ballad high marks</a>, said in an interview that his hands were tied by the state’s lenient grading system, which allowed Ballad to succeed on paper even when it failed to meet the state’s quality-of-care goals.</p>
<p>Fitzgerald said he is unconvinced that the state-sanctioned monopoly had prevented any hospital closures and said the merger had “probably not” benefited local residents overall.</p>
<p>When asked where he would get medical attention if he lived in northeastern Tennessee or southwestern Virginia, Fitzgerald immediately responded, “I’m not going to a Ballad hospital.”</p>
<p>In his interview, Levine alleged Fitzgerald had “basically defrauded the state” by not raising these criticisms of Ballad in his public reports on the monopoly and said it was “irresponsible” and “obscene” to express his concerns about quality of care after retiring.</p>

    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Horror stories’ from Ballad patients</h4>

	
<p>Tennessee House member Bud Hulsey, <a href="https://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/legislatorinfo/member.aspx?district=H2" target="_blank">a Republican from Kingsport</a>, wrote in a 2023 letter to the state health department that he “was an avid supporter of the merger” that created Ballad but since then had become “concerned” and “saddened” by the state of the local hospitals.</p>
<p>In a recent interview, Hulsey said that while his family has received excellent care from Ballad, his constituents have told him “horror stories” for years.</p>
<p>“I had people call me from the waiting room after they’ve sat there for 12 or 14 hours,” Hulsey said. “The scales have far more complaints on them than accolades.”</p>
<p>Others have soured on the monopoly, too. Joe Macione, who for years was on the board of Wellmont Health System, one of the rival companies that became Ballad, once publicly advocated for the merger.</p>
<p>In an interview, Macione said state leaders should have admitted years ago that the monopoly was a mistake.</p>
<p>“It has not worked,” said Macione, 87. “All my family knows that, if I have the time, I want to go to a highly graded hospital, either in Asheville or Knoxville.”</p>
<p>Ballad Health was created in 2018 after Tennessee and Virginia officials waived federal anti-monopoly laws and approved the nation’s biggest hospital merger, based on what’s called a <a href="https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/health/documents/copa/Executed-COPA.pdf" target="_blank">Certificate of Public Advantage</a>, or COPA, agreement. Ballad is now the only option for hospital care for most of the approximately 1.1 million people in a 29-county region at the nexus of Tennessee, Virginia, Kentucky, and North Carolina.</p>
<p>In the years since, there have been multiple signs of discontent with and within Ballad hospitals. In 2019, protesters gathered daily for eight months outside Holston Valley to oppose the closure of the neonatal intensive care unit and the downgrading of a trauma center. (Ballad has said the NICU closure was <a href="https://www.balladhealth.org/saving-lives/nicu-updates" target="_blank">necessary and benefited patients</a>, and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38551609/" target="_blank">a study published this year</a> said the trauma changes saved lives.)</p>
<p>In 2020, Bristol Regional Medical Center CEO Greg Neal <a href="https://www.wjhl.com/news/local/ballad-health-brmc-ceo-resigns-after-scrubbing-in-on-procedure-performing-initial-incision-under-doctors-supervision/" target="_blank">resigned after it was discovered</a> he made the initial incision in a heart surgery despite not being a doctor, according to <a href="https://apps.health.tn.gov/DisciplinaryExclusion/boardorder/display/1606_61049_092722" target="_blank">Tennessee state records</a>. (Levine said in his interview that the resignation shows Ballad is holding employees accountable.)</p>
<p>In 2022, <a href="https://www.wjhl.com/news/local/karing-hearts-cath-lab-approved-over-ballad-opposition/" target="_blank">14 cardiologists signed a letter</a> warning of “severe limitations” in the Bristol Regional cardiac catheterization lab that were affecting patient safety and delaying procedures for weeks or months. (Ballad said in a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25293819-ballad-response-to-2024-monitor-report" target="_blank">letter to the Tennessee government</a> that it worked with the cardiologists, who it said were partly to blame, to make the lab more efficient.)</p>
<p>In 2023, Ballad Health was ranked last among 200 large health care organizations in <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/nursing-satisfaction-index/#interactive-launcher" target="_blank">an analysis of nurse satisfaction</a> published by an MIT business magazine. (Levine dismissed this analysis as unscientific.) This year, the Federal Trade Commission <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/in_copa_comment_9-5-24_public_redacted.pdf" target="_blank">cited Ballad</a> as a cautionary tale while opposing a similar hospital merger under consideration in Indiana, and a longtime Kingsport doctor took <a href="https://www.hamlettdobson.com/obituaries/woodrow-wilson-reeves-jr" target="_blank">a parting shot at Ballad</a> in his obituary. (Ballad declined to comment on either topic.)</p>
<p>And in August, the widow of a Tennessee sheriff filed a lawsuit alleging that Ballad caused her husband’s death and intentionally understaffed hospitals “to save money.” Brenda Tester, the wife of Johnson County Sheriff Eddie Tester, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25260132-brenda-tester-lawsuit" target="_blank">alleged in that lawsuit</a> that Ballad put her husband on blood thinners and then gave him an unnecessary liver biopsy, causing “life ending internal blood loss” that led to “his cardiac arrest and ultimately his sudden death.”</p>
<p>Ballad has yet to respond to the Tester lawsuit in court. Levine said in his interview that the doctors who treated the sheriff were not employed by Ballad but merely contracted to work in its hospitals.</p>
<p>Some of Ballad’s most determined critics are family members of Anton Maki Jr., a former Holston Valley doctor who returned to the hospital as a patient in February. The family has filed complaints with multiple Tennessee agencies and the federal government and provided emails to KFF Health News showing that Tennessee is investigating Maki’s case.</p>
<p>In an interview and in those complaints, Maki’s family members allege Holston Valley gave Maki improper treatment, even though his symptoms and lab tests made it obvious that he was having a serious heart attack that required urgent attention.</p>
<p>The improper care did “permanent damage” to Maki’s heart, the family’s complaints allege. That damage required him to have a <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/medical-device-heart-lvad-fda-database-abbott-thoratec/" target="_blank">permanent mechanical heart pump</a> surgically implanted at a non-Ballad hospital, said one of his daughters, Alexandra Maki, who is a surgeon in Kentucky. She said her father died after a fall three months later while still in a weakened state.</p>
<p>Alexandra Maki said that her father had been alarmed by the Ballad monopoly for years but that she didn’t fully appreciate his warnings until she witnessed his care at Holston Valley firsthand.</p>
<p>“I filed these complaints because it is my duty as a doctor to report what I saw,” Alexandra Maki said. “That was not care. It is a facade of a hospital. It is a well-oiled death machine.”</p>

																						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1024" height="683" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pharmacist_GETTY.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="" style="margin-bottom: 10px;" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pharmacist_GETTY.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pharmacist_GETTY-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pharmacist_GETTY-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pharmacist_GETTY-696x464.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pharmacist_GETTY-630x420.jpg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p style="font-size:12px;">A Publix pharmacy manager retrieves medication.  (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Southside Virginia resident Wendy Oliver’s body might be frail amid her struggle with Lupus — an autoimmune disease that has rendered her disabled — but her spirit is strong as she and her husband navigate accessing her pain medication amid national drug shortages. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This (disease) is something I have to deal with, but I don&#8217;t need to deal with the uncertainty on whether I&#8217;m going to be able to acquire my medications,” she said. “That&#8217;s a stress that nobody should have to go through.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Lupus, a person’s immune system attacks healthy organs and tissues. In Oliver’s case, it has targeted her bones the most.  She had to give up a veterinarian technician career and her husband has had to be her main caregiver in recent decades. Oliver sustains her quality of life through a few 4 milligram doses of hydromorphone per day. The drug, commonly marketed as Diluadid, is a type of opioid that at a low dose, plays a key role in managing her pain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it’s been increasingly difficult for her to obtain in the past six months. Based near Farmville, the couple has had to place calls and make drives within hours of their home to get her medication. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stress can also trigger flare ups with her disease, worsening its symptoms. Between the efforts to get medication lately and concerns about potentially igniting withdrawal symptoms should she miss doses, she’s “terrified.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frustrated, she reached out to U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia, as well as various federal agencies to relay her concerns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine, along with U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, might be able to help Oliver and others with new legislation they are both proposing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They introduced the </span><a href="https://www.cotton.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/cotton1204.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protecting Our Essential Medicines Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Tuesday to help address shortages in the drug supply chain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would work by requiring the Secretary of Health and Human Services to maintain a list of the country of origin of certain critical drugs marketed in the United States. The agency would work through a task force with other federal agencies to identify drugs for which a shortage could affect people with chronic conditions, as well as those which might be critical for epidemics or pandemics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal agencies that would be directed into a task force are “the ones you would expect,” Kaine said, like HHS, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, the Department of Defence and Department of Homeland Security are also included, even though they are “not the ones you would necessarily see” participating in such an effort, he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“(Sen. Cotton) and I are seeing this as more than just a public health thing,” Kaine said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine said that approach stems from some lessons learned amid the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, where China, as the country of origin, had to prioritize its people over whatever drug or equipment contracts it had abroad. Likewise, when he was previously the governor of Virginia, he recalled how there was a moment of concern about having enough of a drug that alleviates influenza symptoms at a time when the bird flu was looming. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new bill also builds on a recent related bipartisan and bicameral bill that included U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Prince William. The</span><a href="https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/kaine-cotton-spanberger-and-smith-introduce-bipartisan-bicameral-end-drug-shortages-act" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> End Drug Shortages Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aims to improve communications between hospitals, manufacturers and pharmacies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine used an environmental analogy to further explain that measure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We often put river monitoring gauges on rivers, and the farther upstream you put them, the sooner you know when there might be a flood downstream,” he said. “It&#8217;s really about information sharing early on, so that we can predict when there may be spikes in demand that would require more production.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a Virginia-specific note, he believes that pharmaceutical companies clustered in Richmond and Petersburg may have important roles to play in U.S. manufacturing of medicines. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the new bill he introduced with Cotton hopes to address the challenges through an international lens, with a keen focus on national security and public health. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If we get the whole federal family around the table to do these listings of drugs — where they come from, which of these drugs would be really deleterious to public health if there were shortages  — that can give us information that might lead us to make certain decisions about production,” Kaine said. </span></p>

(Photo credit: NIH)</p><p dir="ltr">WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump said Tuesday he has selected a Stanford University professor of health policy and skeptic of COVID-19 precautions to run the National Institutes of Health, the sweeping federal agency tasked with solving many of the country’s biggest health challenges.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Dr. Jay Bhattacharya will require Senate confirmation before taking over the role officially, but assuming he can secure the votes next year when the chamber is controlled by Republicans, he’ll have significant sway over where the federal government directs billions in research dollars.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Dr. Bhattacharya will work in cooperation with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to direct the Nation’s Medical Research, and to make important discoveries that will improve Health, and save lives,” Trump wrote in the announcement. Kennedy is Trump’s <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-taps-vaccine-skeptic-rfk-jr-lead-department-health-and-human-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pick to lead</a> the Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bhattacharya <a href="https://x.com/DrJBhattacharya/status/1861586856590320071" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted on social media</a> that he was “honored and humbled” by the nomination and pledged to “reform American scientific institutions so that they are worthy of trust again and will deploy the fruits of excellent science to make America healthy again!”</p>
<p dir="ltr">In addition to Kennedy, other Trump nominees for health-related positions include former TV personality and onetime Pennsylvania U.S. Senate candidate Mehmet Oz <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-picks-dr-oz-run-mammoth-centers-medicare-and-medicaid-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to lead</a> the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, former Florida Congressman Dave Weldon <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-unveils-his-lineup-fda-cdc-and-surgeon-general" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to run</a> the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Marty Makary for commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration and Fox News medical contributor Dr. Janette Nesheiwat as the next surgeon general.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Together, Jay and RFK Jr. will restore the NIH to a Gold Standard of Medical Research as they examine the underlying causes of, and solutions to, America’s biggest Health challenges, including our Crisis of Chronic Illness and Disease,” Trump wrote in his announcement.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Health economist</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Bhattacharya received his undergraduate degree from Stanford University in 1990 before earning his medical degree from its School of Medicine in 1997 and a Ph.D. from the university’s Economics Department in 2000.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He focuses his research on health economics and outcomes, according to <a href="https://fsi9-prod.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/cv-jay-march2016.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his curriculum vitae</a>, the academic version of a resume.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bhattacharya’s <a href="https://healthpolicy.fsi.stanford.edu/people/jay_bhattacharya" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biography</a> on Stanford’s website says that in addition to being a professor of health policy, he runs its Center for Demography and Economics of Health and Aging, in addition to working as a research associate at the National Bureau of Economics Research.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Dr. Bhattacharya’s research focuses on the health and well-being of vulnerable populations, with a particular emphasis on the role of government programs, biomedical innovation, and economics,” according to the biography. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Among his research areas is the “epidemiology of COVID-19 as well as an evaluation of policy responses to the epidemic.”</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">‘A fringe component’</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Bhattacharya <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/roundtable/preparing-for-the-future-by-learning-from-the-past-examining-covid-policy-decisions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">testified</a> before the U.S. House Oversight Committee’s Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic in February 2023 that he believed there was “near universal agreement that what we did failed.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Official counts attribute more than one million deaths in the United States and seven million worldwide,” he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bhattacharya was one of three authors of The Great Barrington Declaration in October 2020, arguing that younger, healthy people should have gone about their normal lives in an effort to contract COVID-19, since they were somewhat less likely to die than at-risk populations. </p>
<p dir="ltr">The brief declaration says that “(a)dopting measures to protect the vulnerable should be the central aim of public health responses to COVID-19.” But it doesn’t list what those measures should include and never brings up masking, physical distancing, or vaccination.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Several public health officials and researchers rejected the declaration, noting that it didn’t cite any research, data or peer-reviewed articles.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Former NIH Director Francis S. Collins, who ran the agency from 2009 through 2021, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/covid-herd-immunity/2020/10/10/3910251c-0a60-11eb-859b-f9c27abe638d_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told The Washington Pos</a>t in October 2020 that the Barrington Declaration authors’ beliefs were not held “by large numbers of experts in the scientific community.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This is a fringe component of epidemiology. This is not mainstream science. It’s dangerous. It fits into the political views of certain parts of our confused political establishment,” Collins said in the Post interview. “I’m sure it will be an idea that someone can wrap themselves in as a justification for skipping wearing masks or social distancing and just doing whatever they damn well please.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">One of the many reasons public health experts recommended masking, working from home and physical distancing before there was a COVID-19 vaccine was to prevent patients from overwhelming the country’s health care system.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There were concerns during some of the spikes in COVID-19 infections that the country would have so many ill people at one time there wouldn’t be enough space, health care professionals or equipment to provide treatment.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Wide-ranging agency</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The NIH is made up of <a href="https://www.nih.gov/institutes-nih/list-institutes-centers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">27 different centers and institutes</a> that each focus on health challenges facing Americans.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, formerly run by Dr. Anthony Fauci, became one of the more well known institutes during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially when he would regularly appear beside Trump at press briefings.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Other components at NIH include the National Cancer Institute, National Institute on Aging, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and the NIH Clinical Center that’s also referred to as America’s research hospital.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Congress approved $48 billion in discretionary spending for NIH during the last fiscal year, continuing a broadly bipartisan push that for years has increased funding to the agency to provide grants to research some of the most challenging diseases and illnesses facing Americans.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The current NIH director, Monica M. Bertagnolli, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/nih-targeting-rare-diseases-director-tells-us-house-funding-panel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">testified before Congress </a>in early November about how the agency was working to rebuild trust following the pandemic.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bertagnolli told U.S. House lawmakers the NIH was focusing some of its research on finding cures for rare diseases, since for-profit companies often don’t have the financial incentive to do so.</p>
<p dir="ltr">She also rejected the notion that NIH leaders have allowed politics to interfere with the agency’s mission.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“First and foremost, NIH concentrates on science, not on politics,” Bertagnolli said. “We actually have an integrity mandate against political interference in our work. That is the law for us and we abide by that completely.”</p>

(Gary Cifers/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, central Virginia’s district of the state health department reported a cat in Lynchburg tested positive for rabies, following at least four cases in the Lynchburg area and </span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/content/uploads/sites/208/2024/10/2024-3rd-QTR-POS.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">272 positive rabies tests </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in animals statewide so far this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the full year’s numbers haven’t been reported yet,</span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/content/uploads/sites/208/2023/07/Yearly-Positives-2023.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 381 animals tested positive for rabies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Virginia last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rabies is a fatal viral disease that can spread to people and pets through bites and scratches of animals that are infected. It causes brain swelling and other symptoms like delirium, seizures and hallucinations before leading to death, according to the </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/about/index.html#:~:text=Rabies%20is%20a%20fatal%20but,not%20received%20before%20symptoms%20start." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. About 60,000 people are treated for rabies each year in the United States; fewer than 10 deaths are reported each year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Although </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rabies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is almost 100% fatal once symptoms develop, timely treatment in the U.S. seems to be 100% effective,” said Jim Bowles, a health manager in the Central Virginia Health District. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CDC notes that while preventable, rabies still poses a public health risk because of how deadly it is and its prevalence in many wildlife species. Nearly three in four Americans live in communities where there are racoons, skunks or foxes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state tests between 3,000 and 4,000 animals per year for rabies. Of the 272 total infected animals statewide this year, racoons, skunks, foxes and cats had the most positive tests. Fairfax County had the most positive tests, with 27 of its 38 coming from racoons. Loudoun County had 15 positive tests, 9 of which stemmed from raccoons. Both localities had higher tests </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/07/20/some-good-news-virginias-2023-rabies-numbers-are-looking-normal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in recent years as well</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bowles said this is why local health departments follow up on reports of animal bites to humans and all reports where housepets may have been exposed to rabies. In cases where a person is bitten by a housepet, the owner is instructed to confine the animal for 10 days to be monitored, Bowles said. In instances where a person is bitten by a wild animal and it’s able to be confined, it will be tested for rabies. Should a wild animal not be able to be confined and tested or the animal does test positive, the bitten person may need to receive treatments to prevent the development of rabies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other animals tested statewide include dogs, beavers, bobcats, cows, foxes, goats, groundhogs, horses and opossums.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the CDC outlines that the incubation period between the time of a bite and the appearance of symptoms can range from weeks or months (and depends on the person’s vaccination status, age and how close a bite is to their brain), once symptoms appear the disease is almost always fatal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bowles stressed two points for aiding in prevention of rabies cases: “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure that your pets are vaccinated and report to the local health department when people are bitten by animals.”</span></p>

<p>Hospitals around the country are conserving critical intravenous fluid supplies to cope with a shortage that may last months. Some hospital administrators say they are changing how they think about IV fluid hydration altogether.</p>
<aside class="block--sidebar alignright ">
<div class="wp-block-kaiser-health-news-partner block--partner"></div>
</aside>
<p>Hurricane Helene, which hit North Carolina in September and ravaged parts of Southwest Virginia, wrecked a Baxter International facility that <a href="https://www.aha.org/system/files/media/file/2024/10/aha-to-president-urging-the-administration-to-take-immediate-action-to-address-iv-solution-supply-shortage-as-a-result-of-helene-letter-10-7-2024.pdf" target="_blank">produces 60%</a> of the IV fluids used in the U.S., according to the American Hospital Association.</p>
<p>The company was forced to stop production and is rationing its products. In an <a href="https://www.baxter.com/baxter-newsroom/hurricane-helene-updates" target="_blank">update posted Nov. 7</a>, Baxter said its North Cove facility had resumed producing some IV fluids. In an email to KFF Health News, the company wrote that customers will be able to order normal quantities of “certain IV solutions products” by the end of the year, but there is no timeline for when the North Cove facility will be back to prehurricane production levels.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, hospitals are facing seasonal strains on their already limited IV fluid resources, said Sam Elgawly, chief of resource stewardship at <a href="https://www.inova.org/" target="_blank">Inova</a>, a health system in the Washington, D.C., area.</p>
<p>“We’ve been very aggressive in our conservation measures,” Elgawly said, stressing that he does not believe patient care has been compromised. He told KFF Health News that across the system IV fluid usage has dropped 55% since early October.</p>
<p>Elgawly called the shortage a crisis that he expects to have to continue managing for some time. “We are going to operate under the assumption that this is going to be the way it is through the end of 2024 and have adopted our demand/conservation measures accordingly,” he said.</p>
<p>At the end of the calendar year, many patients with insurance hurry to schedule surgical procedures before their deductibles reset in January. Elgawly is eyeing that typical surgical rush and the impending peak of respiratory virus season as he tries to stockpile IV fluid bags. Hospitals such as Inova’s are using different ways to conserve, such as giving some medications intravenously, but without a dedicated IV fluid bag, known as a push medication.</p>
<p>“You don’t even need a bag at all. You just give the medication without the bag,” he said. “There has been increasing literature over the last 10 to 20 years that indicates maybe you don’t need to use as much. And this accelerated our sort of innovation and testing of that idea.”</p>
<p>Monica Coleman is a nurse at a <a href="https://www.va.gov/lovell-federal-health-care-va/locations/captain-james-a-lovell-federal-health-care-center/" target="_blank">Department of Veterans Affairs hospital</a> in North Chicago. She said using push medications takes more time out of a nurse’s already hectic schedule because then they need to monitor the patient.</p>
<p>“This could increase adverse effects within the patient, because we’re giving the medication at a faster rate,” she said.</p>
<p>Elgawly is also interested in retooling electronic health records to question doctor orders for more IV hydration.</p>
<p>“Does the patient actually need that second bag? How did they do today with eating or drinking water or juice? They did well? They don’t need the bag. So it’s little conservation mechanisms like that that, when you add them across, you know, the 2,000-patient system that Inova is, make a significant dent,” he said.</p>
<p>Simpler conservation measures could become common after the shortage abates, said <a href="https://www.pipelinehealth.us/leadership/" target="_blank">Vince Green</a>, chief medical officer for Pipeline Health, a small hospital system in the Los Angeles area that serves mainly people on Medicare and Medicaid.</p>
<p>First, Green would like to see data showing that patient outcomes aren’t affected. But for now, some of the new strategies just make sense to him. He has directed hospital staff to use up the entire IV bag before starting another.</p>
<p>“If they come in with IV fluids that the paramedics have started, let’s continue it. If it saves half a bag of fluids, so be it, but it adds up over time,” he said.</p>
<p>Patients may be asked to take more accountability for their hydration, by drinking Gatorade or water rather than the default of hydrating through an IV, he said.</p>
<p>“From an environmental aspect, we don’t need to have this much waste and fill up our landfills. If we could reduce stuff, I think it’d be wise,” he said.</p>
<p>But he’ll feel better when his hospitals receive a full order, which could be weeks away. Green said they are down to a two-week supply, with an expected increase in hospitalizations due to respiratory virus season.</p>
<p>“We’re purchasing every IV fluid bag that we can get,” he said.</p>

<p>President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming administration could try to remove fluoride from drinking water, according to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</p>
<aside class="block--sidebar alignright ">

</aside>
<p>Kennedy, who was tapped last week by Trump to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, called fluoride an “industrial waste” and linked it to cancer and other diseases and disorders while campaigning for Trump.</p>
<p>“On January 20, the Trump White House will advise all U.S. water systems to remove fluoride from public water. Fluoride is an industrial waste associated with arthritis, bone fractures, bone cancer, IQ loss, neurodevelopmental disorders, and thyroid disease,” Kennedy <a href="https://archive.is/qQKgT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote Nov. 2 on X.</a> Kennedy linked to a video from an attorney who recently <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/epa-fluoride-drinking-water-federal-court-ruling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">successfully sued</a> the Environmental Protection Agency to take additional measures to regulate fluoride in drinking water.</p>
<p>Kennedy, who <a href="https://www.biospace.com/the-children-s-health-defense-team-fluoridation-must-end" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has long advocated</a> ending water fluoridation, <a href="https://x.com/NPRinskeep/status/1854190865763405861" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">persisted with his pledge</a> following Trump’s election win. When asked before the election whether his administration would remove fluoride from drinking water, <a href="https://x.com/DashaBurns/status/1853102116899860590" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trump said</a>, “Well, I haven’t talked to him about it yet, but it sounds OK to me. You know it’s possible.”</p>
<p>Kennedy is an influential vaccine skeptic whose campaign of conspiracy theories earned PolitiFact’s 2023 “<a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2023/dec/21/robert-f-kennedy-jrs-campaign-of-conspiracy-theori/" target="_blank">Lie of the Year</a>.”</p>
<p>Longtime research has found that adding fluoride to U.S. drinking water is a safe way to boost children’s oral health. Since 2015, the recommended level in the U.S. has been 0.7 milligrams per liter. Public health organizations, including the<a href="https://www.ada.org/resources/community-initiatives/fluoride-in-water" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> American Dental Association</a>, the <a href="https://www.aap.org/en/patient-care/oral-health/fluoridation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Academy of Pediatrics</a>, and the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00056796.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>, support the practice.</p>
<p>Recent studies, however, have shown possible links between fluoride and bone problems and children’s IQs, particularly when fluoride is above the U.S. recommended levels.</p>
<p>“There is evidence that fluoride exposure has been associated with the diseases [and] disorders that RFK listed, but with caveats,” said Ashley Malin, who is an assistant professor in the University of Florida’s Epidemiology Department and has studied fluoride’s effects in pregnant women.</p>
<p>Malin referred to studies showing that higher fluoride exposure, particularly during pregnancy, is associated with reduced child IQ, and that prenatal exposure also is linked to decreased intellectual functioning and executive function. For high exposure in pregnancy, the studies showed symptoms associated with other neurobehavioral issues, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.</p>
<p>However, many of these studies took place in countries other than the U.S. and looked at fluoride in drinking water at sometimes twice the United States’ recommended level. Also, some of the other ailments that Kennedy listed, such as an association with bone cancer, have less robust evidence and need more study.</p>
<p>“Aside from fluoride’s impacts on neurodevelopment, I think that there is more that we don’t know about health effects of low-level fluoride exposure than what we do know, particularly for adult health outcomes,” Malin said.</p>
<p>David Bellinger, a Harvard Medical School neurology professor and professor in Harvard School of Public Health’s Environmental Health Department, said the risk-benefit calculation of added fluoride differs depending on whether typical fluoride exposure levels cause health problems, or if problems occur only when recommended levels are exceeded.</p>
<p>“In toxicology, ‘the dose makes the poison’ is a long-standing principle,” he said. “So a general statement that fluoride is associated with diseases X, Y, and Z is not very helpful unless the dose that might be responsible is specified.”</p>
<p>PolitiFact contacted Kennedy through his Children’s Health Defense organization but received no reply. The organization sued PolitiFact and Meta related to a 2020 fact check. That lawsuit was <a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2024/aug/13/federal-appeals-court-rules-in-favor-of-politifact/" target="_blank">dismissed by a federal court</a>. The dismissal was upheld on appeal, and the case is pending a possible appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What is fluoride and what are its benefits?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/11195-fluoride" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fluoride</a> <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/faq/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is a mineral</a> naturally occurring in soil, water, and some foods that helps prevent tooth decay and cavities. It strengthens tooth enamel that acid from bacteria, plaque, and sugar can wear away.</p>
<p>Water fluoridation has been happening in the U.S. since 1945.</p>
<p>The federal Public Health Service first recommended fluoridation of tap water in 1962, but the decision still lies with states and municipalities. Around 72% of the U.S. population, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/about/statement-on-the-evidence-supporting-the-safety-and-effectiveness-of-community-water-fluoridation.html#:~:text=1%20In%202022%2C%20more%20than,25%25%20in%20children%20and%20adults." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">or about 209 million people</a>, had access to fluoridated water in 2022, the CDC reported. Fluoride also has been added to oral care products such as toothpaste and mouth rinse.</p>
<p>In 2015, U.S. health officials <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2015/04/27/u-s-updates-water-fluoridation-guideline-for-the-first-time-in-53-years/?itid=lk_inline_manual_24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lowered the recommended amount</a> of fluoride in drinking water to 0.7 milligrams per liter, saying a higher level was less necessary given other sources of fluoride, and that the lowered amount would still help protect teeth without <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2020/february/fluorosis.html#:~:text=reducing%20tooth%20decay.-,While%20low%20levels%20of%20fluoride%20help%20strengthen%20and%20protect%20tooth,mottled%20enamel%20and%20poor%20mineralization." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">staining them</a>.</p>
<p>Pediatric <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fluoride-safe-drinking-water-cities-ban-rcna143605" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dentists note</a> that applying fluoride with toothpaste and rinses is beneficial, but small amounts circulating in the body via water consumption helps younger children who still have their baby teeth, because it can benefit the developing permanent teeth.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ada.org/resources/community-initiatives/fluoride-in-water" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Dental Association</a> says studies have shown that fluoride in community water systems prevents at least 25% of tooth decay in children and adults and that “for more than 75 years, the best scientific evidence has consistently shown that fluoridation is safe and effective.”</p>
<p>The association says <a href="https://www.ada.org/resources/community-initiatives/fluoride-in-water" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on its website</a>: “It’s similar to fortifying other foods and beverages — for example, fortifying salt with iodine, milk with vitamin D, orange juice with calcium, and bread with folic acid.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/about/statement-on-the-evidence-supporting-the-safety-and-effectiveness-of-community-water-fluoridation.html#:~:text=Expert%20panels%20consisting%20of%20scientists,in%20fluoride%20from%20any%20source" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to the CDC</a>, health experts and scientists from the U.S. and other countries have so far “not found convincing scientific evidence linking community water fluoridation with any potential adverse health effect or systemic disorder such as an increased risk for cancer, Down syndrome, heart disease, osteoporosis and bone fracture, immune disorders, low intelligence, renal disorders, Alzheimer’s disease, or allergic reactions.”</p>
<p>The agency says risks of water fluoridation are limited to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/oral-health/about/about-dental-fluorosis.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dental fluorosis</a>, which can alter dental enamel and cause white flecks, spots, lines, or brown stains on the teeth when too much fluoride is consumed.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Do studies show fluoride posing any other risks?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Some studies have said that excess fluoride exposure, often at higher levels than the recommended U.S. limit, can harm infants’ and young children’s developing brains and that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/19/health/fluoride-neurotoxin-canada-study/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">higher levels of fluoride exposure</a> during pregnancy were associated with declines in children’s IQs.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2818858" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study published in May</a> that Malin led with University of Southern California and Indiana University researchers suggested that fluoride exposure during pregnancy was linked to an increased risk of childhood neurobehavioral problems and <a href="https://keck.usc.edu/news/fluoride-exposure-during-pregnancy-linked-to-increased-risk-of-childhood-neurobehavioral-problems-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said more studies</a> were “urgently needed to understand and mitigate the impacts in the entire U.S. population.”</p>
<p>Experts noted prenatal fluoride exposure is most strongly linked to children’s IQ loss, and said timing of fluoride consumption might need to be considered when making recommendations.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/whatwestudy/assessments/noncancer/completed/fluoride" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">federal review</a> of dozens of studies published in August by the Department of Health and Human Services’ National Toxicology Program concluded that higher levels of fluoride exposure were linked to lower IQs in children. But the report was based primarily on studies in countries such as Canada, China, India, Iran, Mexico, and Pakistan and involved fluoride levels at or above 1.5 milligrams per liter, twice the recommended U.S. limit. The authors said more research is needed to understand whether lower exposure has any adverse effects.</p>
<p>In the report, researchers said they found no evidence that fluoride exposure adversely affected adult cognition.</p>
<p>Bellinger, of Harvard, pointed to the review as an example of how the amount of fluoride matters. He noted how researchers concluded that a very small percentage of people in the U.S. are exposed to levels that correlate with IQ loss.</p>
<p>“Second, the fact that there are now multiple pathways of exposure to fluoride besides fluoridated water (toothpaste and other dental products, etc.) makes it really difficult to attribute a particular adverse effect to the fluoride added to the water,” he wrote via email. “It is the cumulative exposure from all sources that contribute to any adverse health effects.”</p>
<p>In September, a federal judge ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to further regulate fluoride in drinking water because of the potential risk that higher levels could affect children’s intellectual development.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Edward Chen wrote that the court’s finding didn’t “conclude with certainty that fluoridated water is injurious to public health,” saying it’s unclear whether the amount of fluoride typically added to water is causing children’s IQs to drop. But he wrote that there was enough risk to warrant investigation and that the EPA must act to further regulate it. The ruling did not specify what actions the agency should take, and the EPA is reviewing the decision.</p>
<p>After the ruling, the American Association of Pediatrics <a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/30299/AAP-ADA-stand-by-fluoride-recommendations?autologincheck=redirected" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issued a statement</a> that fluoride in drinking water is safe for children and said the policy is based on a robust foundation of evidence.</p>
<p>Besides dental fluorosis, experts say that fluoride exposure over many years above the U.S. recommended amount can cause <a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Fluoride-HealthProfessional/#en57" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">skeletal fluorosis</a>, a rare condition that causes weaker bones, stiffness, and joint pain. Although the Public Health Service recommends a fluoride concentration of 0.7 milligrams per liter for community water systems, the EPA, under the Safe Drinking Water Act, sets enforceable standards for drinking-water quality. Currently, to prevent skeletal fluorosis, the EPA requires that water systems not exceed 4 milligrams of fluoride per liter of water.</p>
<p>Malin said she and her research team are investigating a potential link between fluoride and bone fractures. She said that although several studies have found high fluoride exposure associated with increased risk of bone fractures, and some have linked fluoride with thyroid disease, rigorous, U.S.-based studies haven’t been done.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/TSP/ToxFAQs/ToxFAQsDetails.aspx?faqid=211&amp;toxid=38#:~:text=damage%20the%20heart.-,How%20likely%20are%20fluoride%2C%20hydrogen%20fluoride%2C%20and%20fluorine%20to%20cause,to%20humans%20is%20not%20classifiable." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CDC concluded</a> that recent research found no link between cancer risk and high levels of fluoride in drinking water.</p>
<p>The American Cancer Society <a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/chemicals/water-fluoridation-and-cancer-risk.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reviewed a possible link</a> between water fluoridation and cancer risk. An organization spokesperson pointed PolitiFact to its review and said it has no data showing a definitive answer.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides the financial management issues within the department, the report pinpointed a lack of sufficient and well-trained staff, and suggested that legislative intervention can help the agency get back on track.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ETe4MUR4t6"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/state-emergency-department-audit-finds-33-million-deficit-4-million-embezzlement/">State emergency department audit finds $33 million deficit, $4 million embezzlement</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JLARC, which conducted the study the report is based on, and VDH commissioner Dr. Karen Shelton attributed some of the departments’ issues to the COVID-19 pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020 and 2021, before Shelton joined VDH, the department had to place much of its focus on the state’s response to the global pandemic. Additional contractor staff were brought on board to help with things like contact tracing and vaccine rollout. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flash forward to 2024, and JLARC identified that the department was over-reliant on contractors in lieu of permanent staff positions, with contract employees making up over a third of the department’s workforce.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surveys also found that staff felt inadequately trained. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid staffing turnover, the report also outlined a “protracted and inefficient process of prolonged hiring, leading to unfilled vacancies,” said JLARC analyst Drew Dickinson. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Anne Ferrell Tata, R-Virginia Beach, asked if the overall healthcare industry workforce shortages that have been affecting Virginia were a factor in the vacancy issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dickinson said VDH is still actively posting jobs but the process is “just taking too long and it’s causing these issues.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, the average duration for hiring lasted about 100 days (roughly a third of a year), so over 400 qualified applicants had moved onto other job opportunities, according to Dickinson. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that a third of staff surveyed felt there was little accountability for people’s job performances. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lack of accountability is contributing to low morale and high turnover,” Dickinson said.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond staffing, the department’s challenges include  financial management, a process VDH relies on to secure numerous federal grants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After repeated issues procuring one from the Environmental Protection Agency, for example, the federal agency decided to no longer dispense it up front to Virginia’s health department. Now the department has to front the cash for related expenses and then seek reimbursement from the EPA in lieu of a traditional grant funding format. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report also noted numerous incidents of delayed and duplicate payments to vendors, and that VDH has struggled to pay its bills promptly. This has created backlogs for other state agencies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tata called the report “sobering” while Del. Charniele Herring, D-Alexandria, referred to it as “shocking” and “disturbing.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The JLARC study went on to outline over 30 recommendations for how VDH can better function. Suggestions include the state legislature funding recruitment positions that can help scout and hire permanent staff in the department, and establishing a requirement that the commissioner report on progress of implementing recommendations semi-annually to the Joint Subcommittee on Health and Human Resources Oversight through December 2026. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dickinson agreed, and said VDH’s issues “warrant attention from the state legislature, at least temporarily.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another suggestion is for Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s office to direct the Office of the State Inspector General to assign waste, fraud and abuse hotline investigations relating to VDH to its own staff, rather than VDH’s internal audit staff. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokesperson for Youngkin did not answer when asked if the governor would take the OSIG recommendation but did stress the efforts that have already been underway to help resolve VDH’s issues. One such example was the appointment of VDH’s chief operating officer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Through proper management review and oversight, the VDH team has already made significant progress to address many issues within the JLARC report,” press secretary Christian Martinez said in a text Thursday afternoon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commissioner Shelton presented an optimistic follow up to the JLARC report, confirming actions the department has already taken to course correct.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After starting as commissioner in the summer of 2023, Shelton  noted that she oversaw the creation of regional health director roles to “increase communication and accountability across health districts.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shelton explained that VDH is placing emphasis on filling vacancies in financial and human resources divisions as well as the internal audit team. Shelton also created the Office of Grants Management specifically to take point on the grants VDH relies on. Additionally, a reshuffling in the department assigned a chief financial officer to oversee finances. She added that Chief Operation Officer Christopher Lindsey has been leading frequent operating reviews since joining the agency in late 2022. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are rebuilding a culture of accountability,” Shelton said. </span></p>

																						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1024" height="683" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/hands.jpeg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="" style="margin-bottom: 10px;" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/hands.jpeg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/hands-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/hands-768x512.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p style="font-size:12px;">(Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services and the Medical Society of Virginia announced a new resource line Thursday to  support adults struggling with substance use disorders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The</span><a href="https://www.msv.org/programs/apal/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Adult Psychiatric Access Line</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, dubbed APAL, is a resource for providers to better cater to the needs of their patients. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Primary care providers who connect with the program will be directed to regional hub operators to provide intake information for patients battling addiction, to help them access other resources and mental health professionals or social workers that specialize in addiction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deltaville-area doctor Sterling Ransone said it’s a needed resource for  primary care physicians statewide and will allow them to offer better care to their patients.. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The problem we get is that we don’t have the psychiatric and behavioral health resources in our office or right next door,” he said. “It’s nice to be able to have some backup.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DBHS Commissioner Nelson Smith explained that Virginia has a shortage of mental healthcare workers. This means that potential patients can sometimes struggle to navigate finding a therapist who can help them talk through solutions or a psychiatrist who can prescribe medications for those who need it. People may also wait months to schedule appointments, due to these challenges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smith said primary care providers like Ransone can be a first point of help in many cases because patients may have already established trust with their PCP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People might go in for a sprained ankle and end up divulging more,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though PCPs have training across multiple types of care, the Adult Psychiatric Access Line can help them connect patients with substance disorders to other specialists. PCPs can also receive additional educational support to better be able to prescribe medications when that form of therapy is needed to treat addiction disease. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ransone recalled how one of his patients was a single mother coping with addiction while juggling work and motherhood. She used to have to wake up very early to drive more than an hour in order to receive the methadone that she needed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">APAL will allow more local doctors to be able and comfortable with prescribing medications like methadone so patients like his wouldn’t have to travel as far in their daily lives for treatment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meeting patients where they are more often can prevent some people from needing to go to the emergency room and ultimately prevent addiction-related deaths, Smith said. In 2022, there were over 22,000 ER visits stemming from substance use disorders and over 2,400 such deaths, </span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/drug-overdose-data/#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20there%20were%3A&amp;text=2%2C490%20drug%20overdose%20deaths%20among,a%205%25%20decrease%20from%202021.&amp;text=Almost%20eight%20out%20of%2010,%2C%20fentanyl%20analogs%2C%20and%20tramadol." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Virginia Department of Health. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smith pointed to how the resource hub launch stems from the </span><a href="https://www.hhr.virginia.gov/12-14-2022-Two-Page-BH-Plan-Summary.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right Help Right Now</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> initiative that Gov. Glenn Youngkin has spearheaded. Virginia is in the second year of Youngkin’s three-year plan, which entails budget proposals from him and legislative actions by state lawmakers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A national survey from this year found that 38% of Americans think mental health isn’t adequately treated, but </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/10/about-38-of-americans-think-mental-health-isnt-adequately-treated-va-s-working-to-change-that/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is working to change that</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and model solutions.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;About 38% of Americans think mental health isn&#8217;t adequately treated. Va.&#8217;s working to change that.&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/10/about-38-of-americans-think-mental-health-isnt-adequately-treated-va-s-working-to-change-that/embed/#?secret=Z54nSs5cFM#?secret=J2E085l2dR" data-secret="J2E085l2dR" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ransone also noted a synergy between federal and state government when it comes to helping out. Bipartisan legislation from 2021 called the</span><a href="https://tonko.house.gov/uploadedfiles/mat_act_fact_sheet_117th.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Mainlining Addiction Treatment Act,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> eliminated a waiver requirement that had prevented some physicians from being able to prescribe a type of opioid addiction treatment. This, in part, helps make APAL possible in Virginia for doctors like him.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smith pointed to the building blocks the Medical Society of Virginia already had in place that paved the way for APAL. The new program for adults is modeled after the society’s state and federally-funded </span><a href="https://vmap.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Mental Health Access Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which PCPs can use to support pediatric patients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while APAL is focused specifically on substance use disorders for now, Nelson and MSV CEO Melina Davis said there are plans to expand it in the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ransone said he’s already thinking about how the program may benefit his patients and potential future patients who struggle with things like bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or depression and anxiety. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We decided to start with substance abuse and then eventually we&#8217;ll expand into (more) mental health care,” Davis said.</span></p>

The only difference from the insects? Pesky scammers strike every year, with nary a respite.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medicare is the government-sponsored health insurance program for</span><a href="https://www.cms.gov/cms-guide-medical-technology-companies-and-other-interested-parties/getting-started/overview-medicare" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> people ages 65 and older</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as well as for those under 65 with specific disabilities. President Lyndon Johnson signed the legislation establishing Medicare (and Medicaid) into law in 1965.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AARP Virginia recently alerted seniors that Medicare con artists are back at it. Frankly, I doubt they ever lay dormant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Medicare scams spike during open enrollment season with criminals posing as insurance providers calling and emailing about free gifts or limited-time offers,”</span><a href="https://states.aarp.org/virginia/aarp-virginia-fraud-alert-medicare-open-enrollment-scams#:~:text=Be%20suspicious%20and%20don't,an%20existing%20relationship%20with%20them" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the nonprofit organization said in a news release</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “These scams are all designed to steal your money, Medicare information, or your identity.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t share sensitive personal information with anyone who calls, emails or visits promoting a Medicare plan. “Legitimate Medicare plans can only contact you if you’ve requested information or if you have an existing relationship with them,” the release added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Seniors are inundated with ads” this time of year, said Jane Constantineau, marketing director for Senior Services of Southeastern Virginia. Elderly Virginians often are looking for help to navigate their options, but that sometimes leaves them vulnerable to individuals and</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/12/17/world/asia/myanmar-cyber-scam.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">scam labor camps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, often overseas, trying to cash in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Martin Bailey volunteers with AARP Virginia, giving anti-fraud presentations to seniors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Scammers can ‘spoof’ a phone number,” Bailey told me.</span><a href="https://www.fcc.gov/spoofing" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Spoofing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> means your caller ID picks up numbers that disguise where the call is actually coming from.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t recognize the call, let it go to voicemail, he advised. Scammers don’t usually waste their time leaving a message. Even when they do, Bailey said, don’t return the message: Find another listing for the so-called company, and dial that number to see whether it’s real.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you receive a text message on your phone from unknown senders, don’t click on the attached links. They could download a virus on your device.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why do con artists go through all this trouble and subterfuge? “Money,” Bailey said simply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Trade Commission’s</span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/reports/consumer-sentinel-network-data-book-2023" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumer Sentinel Network</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> collects information about problems that Americans encounter for all types of fraud, not just Medicare.</span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/CSN-Annual-Data-Book-2023.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The data book for 2023</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, released earlier this year, tallied 2.6 million fraud reports costing $10.3 billion in total losses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The median loss was $500. People ages 70 and over, though, had a higher median loss compared to younger Americans. Imposter scams and identity theft in government benefit programs were key areas of monetary losses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia ranked ninth-highest among the states in fraud reports per 100,000 people. The commonwealth had nearly 98,000 incidents, and Virginia reported $205 million in losses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A FTC spokesman told me that in 2023, the agency received 743 reports from Virginians of suspected Medicare imposters. Four people reported losses totaling $63,680.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Various news articles suggest</span><a href="https://wvpublic.org/medicare-fraud-costs-taxpayers-creates-problems-for-seniors/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Medicare loses $60 billion annually</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to fraud nationwide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This topic is personal to me because I turn 65 this year. I’m officially old. My thinning hair and arthritic knees had already been clues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had to delve into my Medicare options after decades of employer-sponsored health care. The different parts of</span><a href="https://www.medicare.gov/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Medicare</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (A, B and D, plus Advantage or supplemental) can be confusing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You would’ve thought, however, that I’d advertised my date of birth. I received dozens of unsolicited – and sketchy – phone calls this year. Many came to my cell phone with the note, “Spam Risk.” Here are just two. (I answered them, in part, because I figured they would be fodder for a future column.)</span></p>
<p><b>April 18</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Call originates from an 804 area code, supposedly)</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caller: I’m Christina at the Health Care Center.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Me: What city and state are you in?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Click.)</span></p>
<p><b>April 23</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caller: I’m Olivia. I’m calling from the Healthcare Information Center. We’re calling with the latest Medicare info.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Me: Olivia, where is the center located?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Click. Why is that question a problem if the caller is legit?)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What can Virginians do to protect themselves?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One resource is the</span><a href="https://virginiasmp.com/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Senior Medicare Patrol</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a grant-funded program from the feds that helps protect against and detect Medicare fraud and abuse. It does outreach and education. Call 800-938-8885. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The patrols are in all 50 states and Washington, D.C.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also find a wealth of information at</span><a href="https://www.medicare.gov/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">medicare.gov</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Are you more comfortable talking to a program representative one-on-one? Then call 1-800-633-4227. The site is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, except for some federal holidays.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protect yourself. Don’t get cheated. Prevent scammers from cashing in at your expense – and the government’s.</span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia lawmakers plan to introduce a “momnibus bill” in each chamber next year to help enhance maternal healthcare access, reduce mortality rates and address racial and unconscious bias. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A play on the term, “omnibus,” the forthcoming legislation will be able to address a series of factors that contribute to negative maternal health outcomes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Too many mothers, especially Black mothers, are facing preventable risk in childbirth,” said Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth. “We must invest in comprehensive maternal care that ensures every woman, regardless of race or income, receives the quality health care she deserves.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucas and House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, had assembled the Black Maternal Health Summit to bring together a coalition of lawmakers from various states, healthcare professionals and maternal healthcare advocates. After an initial gathering in the morning, people split off into breakout groups for roundtable discussions through the afternoon. Lawmakers from other states like Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas were present, who will also press for related policy in their home states. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“​​We’re facing this issue in 2024 because of a lack of implementing policy,” said Georgia state Senator Tonya Anderson. “The system was designed for failure, for a ‘superior’ and an ‘inferior’ class — we’re changing it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among Virginia’s omnibus packages will be an effort to require </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/virginia-black-maternal-health-carroll-foy-youngkin/article_4608fd84-d1ae-11ee-8379-138efdfc34c7.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unconscious bias training</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for nursing license renewals. The bipartisan bills cleared the state legislature earlier this year before </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/20/youngkin-vetoes-bills-on-contraception-access-skill-games-confederate-heritage-rollbacks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed them</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers say that more targeted training will be an important piece of the puzzle when it comes to preventable deaths or complications from childbirth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that Black women are </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/maternal-mortality/2021/maternal-mortality-rates-2021.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more likely to die </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">from pregnancy complications than white women. Studies have also shown that women of color are more likely to have negative health outcomes, in part, </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7384760" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">from racial bias by healthcare providers.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Being Black is not a risk factor — racism is,” Noelene Kimiko Jeffers, a certified nurse-midwife and professor at John Hopkins School of Nursing, said during a discussion panel earlier in the day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than the unconscious bias training, advocates and lawmakers view the omnibus package as another chance to revive other maternal health bills that either failed to advance last year or were vetoed by the governor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, House Majority Leader Charniele Herring’s bill to reestablish a maternal mortality data task force was </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/27/youngkin-to-reestablish-maternal-health-data-task-force-after-vetoing-bill-that-would-have-done-so/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed by Youngkin </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in May before he announced the formation of his own version of a force a month later.  Other maternal and fetal health-related bills were continued to next year and could become part of the omnibus package. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Youngkin has supported expanding </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/04/17/petersburg-maternal-hub-opening-reignites-discussion-over-commercial-doula-benefits/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">maternal health hubs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as part of targeted economic and public health initiatives in the Petersburg area, and this year he </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/youngkin-doulas-black-maternal-health-general-assembly/article_34a9f222-f379-11ee-8dc9-e36a8194fce6.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">signed a bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to require health insurance coverage for doulas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a panel at the start of the day, Birth in Color founder Kenda Sutton-El stressed how state legislatures can support community-based organizations. This is because existing organizations like hers — which provides doula care for clients and has a policy advocacy wing that engages the state legislature — already have built-in trust with different communities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certified nurse-midwife Nichole Wardlaw also noted how lawmakers can support this type of healthcare worker with access to hospitals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Help us get credentialed,” she said, as not every midwife has ease of access to clinics and hospitals around the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wardlaw explained how some patients that may have wanted a home birth find that they need to go to a hospital for an epidural to manage pain, but “I can’t always go with them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/17/virginias-state-budget-will-fund-ob-gyn-medical-residencies-amid-obstetrics-closures/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">closures of obstetrics units</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at hospitals in rural areas of the state, midwives and doulas have played a role in bolstering maternal healthcare and patient advocacy. Certified nurse-midwives — who specialize in pregnancy, childbirth and postpartum care — have helped fill gaps in areas where there are shortages of other healthcare professionals with these specialties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A survey commissioned by Virginai’s Department of Medical Services revealed this past summer that </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/state-survey-shows-barriers-to-prenatal-care-access-for-medicaid-patients/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">long enrollment periods</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for new Medicaid patients pushes them further into their pregnancies before they can get routine care and a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/18/virginias-rural-healthcare-committee-considers-unique-challenges-possible-solutions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rural health committee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been convening around the state to compile a list of legislative recommendations — to include maternal healthcare issues — ahead of next year’s General Assembly session. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On what’s to come from Friday’s summit, Del. Candi Mundon King, D-Prince William, said some of the bills lawmakers want to reintroduce will come back as standalones or in the omnibus package, and that more policy will stem from coordination and brainstorming across states. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are working across the South with different legislators to look at bills to go even further than we have,” she said.</span></p>

<p>WASHINGTON — The presidential debate in early September included just one mention of Social Security and three references to Medicare, making the safety net programs a minuscule part of the policy discussion, despite their importance to tens of millions of Americans.</p>
<p>Democratic nominee Kamala Harris and Republican candidate Donald Trump have both mentioned the programs numerous times during appearances, though neither campaign has sought to elevate the financial stability of the two programs as a core issue.</p>
<p>More often than not, Harris and Trump rebuke their opponent, while committing to “save” Social Security and Medicare — skipping over the details or the role Congress must play in the discussion.</p>
<p>How to address projected shortfalls for both the Social Security and Medicare trust funds will become an increasingly important topic for the president and Congress during the next decade.</p>
<p>The latest Social Security <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/trsum/" target="_blank">trustees report </a>expects the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and the Disability Insurance trust funds will be able to pay full benefits until 2035, after which, without action by lawmakers, benefits would drop to about 83%.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cms.gov/oact/tr/2024" target="_blank">trustee report </a>for Medicare shows the funding stream for the hospital insurance trust fund can cover all of its bills through 2036 before it would only be able to cover 89% of costs.</p>
<p>There are currently 67.5 million people <a href="https://data.cms.gov/summary-statistics-on-beneficiary-enrollment/medicare-and-medicaid-reports/medicare-monthly-enrollment" target="_blank">enrolled in Medicare</a>, which provides health insurance and prescription drug coverage for people over the age of 65 as well as younger people who have certain severe illnesses or disabilities.</p>
<p>Nearly 68 million people receive some level of benefit from Social Security each month, accounting for about $1.5 trillion in spending by the federal government annually, according to a <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/news/press/factsheets/basicfact-alt.pdf" target="_blank">fact sheet</a>.</p>
<p>While the issue is somewhat less pressing for Trump, who would be term limited to another four years, Harris could theoretically spend the next eight years in the Oval Office, making the solvency of the trust funds an issue she would likely need to address with Congress.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Protecting seniors</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>During the September debate, Harris brought up Social Security and Medicare following a question about how her policy beliefs on fracking, assault weapons and border security have changed over time.</p>
<p>“My work that is about protecting Social Security and Medicare is based on long-standing work that I have done. Protecting seniors from scams,” Harris said as part of a longer answer. “My values have not changed. And what is important is that there is a president who actually brings values and a perspective that is about lifting people up and not beating people down and name-calling.”</p>
<p>Harris later brought up Medicare again, noting that legislation Congress approved during Biden’s term in office allowed program administrators to negotiate certain prescription drug prices for the first time. That law, known as the Inflation Reduction Act, also capped the cost of insulin for Medicare enrollees at $35 per month.</p>
<p>Trump didn’t broach the subject of Social Security or Medicare during the September debate with Harris, but he did speak about the two programs during an earlier summer debate with President Joe Biden, before he stepped aside as the Democratic nominee.</p>
<p>During that debate, Trump claimed the Biden administration was going to “destroy” the two programs by allowing noncitizens to draw down benefits.</p>
<p>FactCheck <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2024/04/posts-misrepresent-immigrants-eligibility-for-social-security-numbers-benefits/" target="_blank">notes on its website</a> that comments and viral posts about noncitizens receiving Social Security benefits don’t always represent reality and sometimes confuse different programs.</p>
<p>“Immigrants who are lawfully living or authorized to work in the U.S. are eligible for a Social Security number and, in some cases, Social Security benefits. But viral posts make the false claim that ‘illegal immigrants’ can receive Social Security numbers and retirement benefits, and they confuse two programs managed by the Social Security Administration.”</p>
<p>KFF <a href="https://www.kff.org/faqs/medicare-open-enrollment-faqs/can-immigrants-enroll-in-medicare/" target="_blank">writes on its website</a> that whether legal immigrants are eligible for Medicare depends on several factors, including how long they’ve paid into the system.</p>
<p>“New immigrants are not eligible for Medicare regardless of their age. Once immigrants meet the residency requirements, eligibility and enrollment work the same as they do for others.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump on entitlement programs</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Trump’s comments on entitlement programs haven’t always been consistent or entirely clear, but his campaign and he both maintain they will “save” the program.</p>
<p>During an <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/03/11/former-president-donald-trump-on-entitlements-theres-tremendous-numbers-of-things-you-can-do.html" target="_blank">interview with CNBC</a> in March, Trump said that there are numerous things lawmakers could do to address solvency.</p>
<p>“There is a lot you can do in terms of entitlements, in terms of cutting and in terms of also the theft and the bad management of entitlements,” Trump said, declining to list any of those policy proposals.</p>
<p>Trump’s campaign website <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/agenda47/we-must-protect-medicare-and-social-security" target="_blank">posted a video</a> of him back in January 2023, saying Republicans “should not cut a penny” from Medicare or Social Security to pay for other legislation.</p>
<p>The problems facing Social Security and Medicare aren’t related to Congress reducing the amount of tax dollars flowing into the programs. Rather it is the structure for the programs lawmakers set up previously.</p>
<p>Without action by Congress, the trust funds won’t be able to account for benefit payments in the long term.</p>
<p>So the challenge for the next president won’t be preventing lawmakers from taking action related to Social Security and Medicare, but helping find a bipartisan path forward on legislation to change revenue, spending, or both.</p>
<p>Trump does want to end taxes on Social Security benefits, <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/112881452914352595" target="_blank">writing on social media</a> in July that “SENIORS SHOULD NOT PAY TAX ON SOCIAL SECURITY!”</p>
<p>Henry Aaron, the Bruce and Virginia MacLaury Chair and senior fellow in the Economic Studies Program at the Brookings Institution, wrote in a <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/a-voters-guide-to-social-security/" target="_blank">detailed </a>analysis of the platform that Trump’s proposal to end income tax on Social Security benefits “would accelerate trust fund depletion by about two years and deepen the long-run funding gap by more than 7%.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Harris policies</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Harris’ <a href="https://kamalaharris.com/issues/" target="_blank">campaign website</a> says she would “protect Social Security and Medicare against relentless attacks from Donald Trump and his extreme allies.”</p>
<p>“She will strengthen Social Security and Medicare for the long haul by making millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share in taxes,” the policy page states. “She will always fight to ensure that Americans can count on getting the benefits they earned.”</p>
<p>Harris <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/harris-rolls-out-broad-medicare-plan-provide-long-term-care-home" target="_blank">announced in early October </a>during an appearance on “The View” that if elected she would work toward including long-term home care for seniors enrolled in Medicare.</p>
<p>“There are so many people in our country who are right in the middle: They’re taking care of their kids and they’re taking care of their aging parents, and it’s just almost impossible to do it all, especially if they work,” Harris said during the live interview. “We’re finding that so many are then having to leave their job, which means losing a source of income, not to mention the emotional stress.”</p>
<p>The proposals would likely need partial, if not complete, buy-in from Congress to move forward and could come with a $40 billion annual price tag, though the campaign noted in <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25196234-harrismedicareathomeplan" target="_blank">a fact sheet </a>that there are pay-fors.</p>
<p>“These new benefits will be fully paid for and extend the life of the Medicare Trust Fund by expanding Medicare drug price negotiations, increasing the discounts drug manufacturers cover for certain brand-name drugs in Medicare and addressing Medicare fraud,” it states.</p>
<p>A Harris administration would also “crack down on pharmaceutical benefit managers (PBMs) to increase transparency, disclose more information on cost, and regulate other practices that raise prices” and “implement international tax reform” to pay for the changes.</p>

Enrollment in the program has more than doubled since Medicaid expansion, leading to rising demand for mental health services. (Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 35,000 Virginians are still waiting to find out if they remain eligible for Medicaid, as Virginia’s Department of Medical Services projects it will use its $95 million reserve fund to cover delayed payments for fiscal year 2025, according to a presentation agency leaders made to the state Senate Finance Committee Tuesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This also means that until it’s sorted out, the state is paying capitation fees, fixed amounts of money to healthcare providers, in order to cover healthcare for those patients. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medicaid is a state and federal program that provides insurance coverage to low-income people or people with disabilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pending redeterminations are part of ongoing national efforts to sort out who should stay on Medicaid and who is no longer eligible. Typically eligibility determinations are made annually, but they’d been on pause nationwide amid the pandemic due to federal policy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s changed over the past year in what’s colloquially referred to as “Medicaid Unwinding,” as provisions of federal law have expired. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A top reason for unenrolling people from Medicaid is that they no longer meet the financial requirements to be eligible — such as income at or below 80% of federal poverty levels. While the ineligibility data could signal higher incomes, which can be a good thing for people, policy analysts at The Commonwealth Institute cautioned over the summer that this is not always the case when it comes to health insurance coverage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, someone could hold a combination of part time jobs that contribute to their overall income — which wouldn’t entail employer-sponsored insurance.  Others might have a temporary spike in income through seasonal work that kicks them off eligibility for Medicaid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, more than 2 million Virginians have been redetermined, according to DMAS director Cheryl Roberts, and over the next year the remaining 35,000 people will be sorted out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process is not always swift, said DMAS chief financial officer Chris Gordon.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the Tuesday</span><a href="https://sfac.virginia.gov/pdf/committee_meeting_presentations/2024%20Interim/October/No5_DMAS_MedicaidYE_101524.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> presentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, he told members of the Virginia Senate Finance Committee that “some of those folks are easier to be redetermined and decide if they qualify to remain on Medicaid” but that other demographics take more time, such as people in nursing facilities or who are in home-care. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Those people take longer because it&#8217;s a paper application,” he said. “It&#8217;s 14 pages, and we have to determine if their assets and resources allow them to continue to be members in our Medicaid population.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that the Centers For Medicaid and Medicare Services have indicated the unwinding process should be completed by the end of next year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though total enrollment trended higher than DMAS had forecast for much of the year, it is now lower, totaling 1.97 million people as of Oct. 1.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DMAS receives quarterly pharmacy rebates from drug manufacturers to offset the overall cost of prescription drugs in the Medicaid program. DMAS then returns those rebates to federal and state-share accounts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, Gordon said, after the previous fiscal year closed and DMAS received details from Virginia’s pharmacy benefit manager, “we learned that $41 million out of the $60 million we applied in the state actually should have been applied — instead of being dropped into the state general fund — should have been applied to the coverage assessment fund.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said that meant DMAS didn’t have enough money at the end of the fiscal year to resolve it in that year, which ended June 30.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We only ended with $22 million in state general funds, at the lowest this agency has ever had in state general funds ever in the history of this agency,” Gordon said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said that DMAS needs to correct overpayment to the general fund and underpayment to coverage assessment and federal accounts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The department may also have some funding aid from $88.5 million earmarked specifically as a “Medicaid Contingency,” </span><a href="https://www.finance.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/secretary-of-finance/pdf/Aug-JMC-w-appendix-08.14.FINAL.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to a presentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to both the Senate and House finance committees this past August. The overall presentation reviewed 2024’s fiscal year revenues and the financial condition of the state. Gov. Glenn Youngkin has until mid-December to present any amendments to the 2024-2026 budget to both committees. </span></p>

</aside>
<p>Current enrollees who do not update their information or select an alternative will be automatically reenrolled in their current plan or, if that plan is no longer available, into a plan with similar coverage.</p>
<p>Last year marked a record enrollment of about 21 million people. This time around, consumers will find a few things have changed.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Don’t fall for advertising scams</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>While some health plans offer small-dollar gift cards or other incentives to encourage participation in wellness efforts, they would not offer cash cards worth thousands of dollars a month to help with groceries, gas, or rent. Even so, social media and online sites are rife with such promises.</p>
<p>Such ads are among the avenues allegedly used by unscrupulous brokers who enroll or switch plans without the express permission of consumers, <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/federal-lawsuit-unauthorized-aca-obamacare-plan-enrollment-switching/" target="_blank">according to a lawsuit filed in Florida</a>.</p>
<p>Also, be cautious about the websites you use to search for coverage.</p>
<p>Type “Obamacare” or “cheap health insurance” into a search engine and often what pops up first are sponsored private sector websites unaffiliated with the official state or federal government marketplaces for ACA coverage.</p>
<p>While they may try to look official, they are not. Many such sites offer various options, including non-ACA coverage with limited benefits, <a href="https://georgetown.app.box.com/v/the-perfect-storm-august-2023" target="_blank">a “secret shopper” study found in 2023</a>. Such non-ACA coverage would not qualify for federal subsidies to help consumers pay premiums.</p>
<p>The fine print on some websites says that consumers who provide personal information automatically consent to be contacted by sales agents via phone calls, emails, text messages, or automated systems with prerecorded messages.</p>
<p>When exploring plans, always start with the official federal marketplace’s website, <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/out-of-pocket-maximum-limit/" target="_blank">healthcare.gov.</a></p>
<p>Even if you don’t live in one of the <a href="https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/state-indicator/state-health-insurance-marketplace-types/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7Dhttps://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/state-indicator/state-health-insurance-marketplace-types/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D" target="_blank">29 states served by the federal marketplace</a>, its website provides the link to your official enrollment site when you select your state, or the District of Columbia, from a drop-down list. The federal and state marketplaces also have call centers and other ways to get enrollment assistance. The “find local help” link on healthcare.gov, for example, gives consumers a choice of finding assisters or sales agents near them.</p>
<div class="wp-block block--newsletter " data-type="kaiser-health-news/newsletter" data-align="center">
<form class="kaiser-hubspot-mini-signup-form" action="https://kffhealthnews.org/email-signup/" method="post"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Is it real insurance?</h4>

	</strong><br />
<label class="kaiser-hubspot-mini-signup-form__label--email" for="kaiser-hubspot-mini-signup-form-email"></label></form>
</div>
<p>Another concern: Regulators are seeing an increase in complaints from consumers about offers of health coverage requiring consumers to join a limited liability corporation, or otherwise attest they are working for a specific company. Indeed, at least two states — <a href="https://insurance.maryland.gov/Consumer/Documents/publications/ConsumerAdvisory-Beware-of-Unauthorized-Health-Insurance-Plans-in-MD.pdf" target="_blank">Maryland</a> and <a href="https://www.maine.gov/pfr/insurance/press/insurance-superintendent-warns-mainers-about-self-funded-health-plans-offered-to-individuals" target="_blank">Maine</a> — have issued warnings, saying that instead of comprehensive ACA coverage, these are often non-ACA products, amounting to a hodgepodge of discount cards, for example, or limited-indemnity plans. This type of plan pays a flat-dollar amount — say, $50 for a doctor visit or $1,000 for a hospital stay — and is meant to buttress more comprehensive coverage, not replace it.</p>
<p>“Unlike major medical plans, some of these self-funded plans only cover preventive services such as a yearly check-up or annual health screening,” the warning from the Maine Bureau of Insurance says.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Premiums might be higher … and other new things</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Some insurers will lower premium rates for 2025, but many others are increasing them.</p>
<p>Although final numbers are still being crunched, experts estimate a median increase of 7% for premiums, <a href="https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/press-release/marketplace-insurers-are-proposing-a-7-average-premium-hike-for-2025/#:~:text=ACA%20Marketplace%20insurers%20are%20proposing,change%20during%20the%20review%20process." target="_blank">according to an analysis by KFF</a>, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. Most people who buy ACA coverage are eligible for a subsidy to help with the premiums, which is likely to offset much of the increase, although the higher cost means the government will be paying out more for those subsidies.</p>
<p>Rising health costs — including for hospital care and the new class of weight loss drugs — are contributing to the increase.</p>
<p>Some other changes this open season:</p>
<ul>
<li>People often referred to as “Dreamers” because they qualified for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals — a federal program offering some protection to those brought to the country as children without proper immigration documentation — can now enroll in ACA coverage and are eligible for subsidies.</li>
<li>Short-term plans, which are technically not ACA coverage and not subject to its benefit rules and preexisting benefit protections, can be issued for, at most, only four months of coverage, based on a Biden administration action that took effect with plans starting Sept. 1. It walks back a Trump administration rule that loosened requirements to allow insurers to offer coverage that ranged up to 364 days, and allowed insurers the option of renewing the policies for up to two additional years. Existing plans and those issued before Sept. 1 don’t <a href="https://www.healthinsurance.org/blog/finalized-federal-rule-reduces-total-duration-of-short-term-health-plans-to-4-months/" target="_blank">fall under the new rules</a>. But consumers who relied on the longer periods need to check their plans’ details and consider enrolling in an ACA plan instead to avoid a situation in which their short-term plan expires early or midyear, potentially leaving them unable to get coverage elsewhere for the remainder of the year.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The sign-up process might take longer, too</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Federal regulators this year wrestled with a growing number of complaints — <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/biden-administration-aca-obamacare-rogue-agents-cms-new-rules/" target="_blank">200,000 in the first six months alone</a> — from consumers who were being enrolled into or switched from ACA plans without their express permission by agents seeking to gain commissions.</p>
<p>To thwart such efforts, they put new rules in place.</p>
<p>What does that mean for most consumers? If you are working with a new agent — one who wasn’t already listed on your ACA plan — you will likely need to get on a three-way call with the federal marketplace to confirm that you are, indeed, authorizing that agent to make changes to your policy for the coming year. Plan on this taking additional time. No one knows how busy the call lines will get during open enrollment.</p>
<p>You don’t need to use a broker to enroll. But sorting through the dozens of options on the marketplace is challenging, so most people do seek assistance. Consumers need to weigh not only the monthly premium cost, but also variations in deductibles and copayments for such things as doctor visits, hospitalization, and drugs.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Shop around</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Experts say another consideration when choosing a plan is to check whether its network includes the doctors and hospitals you typically see, as well as whether its formulary covers your prescription medications, and how much it charges for them.</p>
<p>To help with making comparisons, rules kicked in two years ago requiring insurers to include some “standardized plans” as options, which must all have the same deductibles, and costs for such things as doctor visits, emergency room care, and other consumer cost sharing.</p>
<p>Even so, many people have dozens of options available, which can be daunting.</p>
<p>But one piece of advice remains constant: Whether you are enrolling for the first time or have an existing plan, it’s always worth it to shop around. Even if you don’t change plans, you can make sure the one you have is still your best option.</p>
<p>In most states, consumers must enroll by Dec. 15 to get coverage that begins Jan. 1. Heads up in Idaho, where open enrollment starts earlier — Oct. 15 — but also ends sooner, closing on Dec. 15. In California, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and the District of Columbia, residents can enroll through Jan. 31.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, much of the data Forbes used in its analysis was from 2020 or 2021, and in recent years Virginia’s legislature has passed several laws bolstering access to care. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is in the second year of a three-year plan called </span><a href="https://www.hhr.virginia.gov/12-14-2022-Two-Page-BH-Plan-Summary.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right Help, Right Now </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">— which entails budget proposals and goals from Gov. Glenn Youngkin and legislative actions by state lawmakers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, when the national mental health emergency hotline transitioned to the easier-to-remember 988 system, Virginia </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+ful+CHAP0248" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> funded expanded call centers and listed deployment of mobile crisis units and community care teams as part of their responsibilities. Use of 988 has </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/local/richmond/2024/09/25/virginia-988-hotline-mental-health-crisis" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">been on the rise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Virginia. </span></p>
<p>This week, Youngkin announced several million in grants to community service boards around the state that will be used to help with crisis response.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Governor Youngkin is committed to building on ongoing efforts to develop innovative solutions that address the challenges within our behavioral health care system and ensure that Virginians in crisis receive the appropriate care and support they need,” said Youngkin spokesman Christian Martinez. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some building on those efforts occurred this past legislative session when the governor signed </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb601" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bipartisan bills</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to require insurance coverage for mental health services provided through mobile crisis units, crisis receiving centers and crisis stabilization units. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the hallmarks of the 2024 session was </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title37.2/chapter8/section37.2-808/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Irvo’s Law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which allows families members or guardians to be present to provide support and decision-making when someone in a mental health crisis is being considered for temporary detention orders. The legislation stemmed from the 2023 death of Irvo Otineo, who was </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/18/scathing-report-calls-for-a-ban-of-prone-restraint-tactics/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">killed while restrained by sheriff&#8217;s deputies and workers in a state-run psychiatric hospital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. His mother, Carolina Ouko, had been denied the ability to see him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our families are part of our mental health and we need them beside us in those tough times,” Ouko </span><a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/virginia-governor-signs-mental-health-bills-irvo-otien-june-15-2024" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said earlier this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as Youngkin signed the law named for her son. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previous law to stem from mental health related tragedies is the </span><a href="https://dbhds.virginia.gov/human-resource-development-and-management/health-equity/mdpa/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marcus Alert</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, named for Marcus-David Peters, who was killed by police in 2018. The alert, which has so far only been implemented by a handful of localities in Virginia, creates coordination between 911 and regional call centers to triage best response from law enforcement and trained clinicians when handling mental health situations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://bhc.virginia.gov/documents/BHC%20Staff%20-%20ABLEO.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent Behavioral Health Commission presentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> noted that arrests of people in mental health crises have a “devastating impact” on people in crisis and “stress local and state resources.” Despite Virginia having a prevalence of crisis intervention-trained law enforcement officers, the report stated that crisis response should include or be led by clinicians. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instances where someone assaults an officer who responds to their crisis are more common the longer people are held waiting in hospital emergency rooms under temporary detention orders, BHC policy analyst Claire Pickard Mairead told lawmakers at the meeting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mairead’s presentation noted how law enforcement leaders and research literature found that CIT has improved officers’ confidence in handling mental health crises, but there is little evidence of such officers being able to reduce arrests of people in crisis or injuries that might arise to the affected individuals or the officer if interactions turn forceful. The study did find that officers in Virginia expressed interest in CIT “refreshers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislation from 2020 directed the Department of Criminal Justice Services to develop a CIT training program that includes recertification and advanced training. Those new standards await approval from Youngkin’s office. From there, they can be open to public comment and go through final regulatory stages, the report read. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a desire for co-responder models, the report stated, as “effective ways to include clinicians when safety risks exist.” However, lack of funding and mental health workforce shortages have limited implementation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while lawmakers continue to explore how to improve mental health crisis response and law enforcement’s role in those, Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville, said “our focus needs to be on keeping people out of crisis.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After losing his son, Gus, to a mental health crisis a decade ago, Deeds has been </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/11/18/virginia-creigh-deeds-mental-health/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a leader in reforming mental health access</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the state and chairs the Behavioral Health Commission, which conducts studies and explores legislative proposals each year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On future goals, Deeds said that continued support for community service boards — a public health resource — can help, but that the state should explore how private sectors can become more robust too. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We also have to be looking at the private sector providers to find out what kind of barriers we have to building the workforce, and what kind of barriers are out there that prevent effective mental health care in every part of the commonwealth,” Deeds added</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help address some of the workforce shortages, Sen. Tara Durant, R-Stafford, carried a </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB403" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that will help create pathways for people with community college degrees to enter mental health professions as technicians and technician assistants. Del. Rodney Willett, D-Henrico, introduced </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB1499" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that can make it easier for people with master’s degrees in psychology to practice independently. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harrison Hayes, the director of the Virginia Health Workforce Development Authority, also pointed to a </span><a href="https://www.vhcf.org/boost200/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> funded by the state government and the Virginia Health Care Foundation that’s aimed at helping accelerate the licensure of social workers and counselors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite Virginia’s various efforts to better fund mental health resources in recent years, Deeds said there’s still more work to do. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The reality is, we’ve chronically underfunded mental health over such a long period of time,” he said. “It’s going to take a lot of years to get this right.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nursing homes are currently required by Congress to provide eight hours of continuous registered nurse staffing per day. The new CMS rule would increase that requirement to 24 hours per day in phases — starting May 2026 for urban facilities and May 2027 for rural facilities. The rule also stipulates that nursing homes meet additional reporting requirements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares and others in the suit allege the CMS rule will be difficult and costly for long-term care facilities to meet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This new rule is yet another example of Washington bureaucrats imposing sweeping mandates without considering the devastating impact on our communities,” Miyares said in a statement. “Nursing homes in Virginia and across the country already face challenges, and this policy will force them out of business.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Virginia </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/30/virginia-nursing-homes-say-theyre-limiting-admissions-due-to-a-lack-of-staff/#:~:text=By%3A%20Graham%20Moomaw%20%2D%20October%2030%2C%202023%203%3A10%20pm&amp;text=A%20recent%20survey%20of%20Virginia,to%20accommodate%20everyone%20seeking%20care."><span style="font-weight: 400;">survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from last October found that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly half nursing home or long-term care facilities have limited new admissions because they don’t have enough workers to accommodate everyone seeking care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A rural healthcare committee composed of Virginia delegates has been touring the state since April, where healthcare </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/18/virginias-rural-healthcare-committee-considers-unique-challenges-possible-solutions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">workforce shortages were noted in meetings </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">from Southwest Virginia to the Eastern Shore. The cohort will deliver a report with legislative and state budget recommendations by the end of this year. Addressing workforce shortages may be part of that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the federal rule outlines a “hardship exemption” for some nursing facilities that may be unable to meet the new requirements. Qualifying facilities would post notice of their status on site and the exemption information would also be available on </span><a href="https://www.medicare.gov/care-compare/results?searchType=NursingHome&amp;page=1&amp;city=Richmond&amp;state=VA&amp;zipcode=&amp;radius=25&amp;sort=closest&amp;tealiumEventAction=Result%20Page%20-%20Search&amp;tealiumSearchLocation=search%20bar&amp;tealiumSearchInputType=manual%20search%20term" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medicare’s website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for transparency. </span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods /Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Affordable Care Act saved my life,” said Laura Packard, a Virginia resident, Stage 4 Hodgkin’s Lymphoma survivor and health advocate who joined other advocates and state and federal Democratic lawmakers on Monday as part of a national bus tour highlighting Democrat-led efforts to expand health care access.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dubbed “Care Force One,” the bus is making stops around Virginia and 16 other states over the next few weeks featuring speakers from Congress and state legislatures, alongside people sharing stories of how they benefited from the Affordable Care Act and the Inflation Reduction Act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A hallmark of Democratic President Barack Obama’s administration, the ACA established a public insurance marketplace and prevented insurance companies from denying coverage based on preexisting conditions. Currently, over 20 million people utilize it nationwide and nearly 400,000 Virginians could pay more for health insurance if it were repealed. Amid this year’s congressional and presidential election where Trump hopes to win a second term in the White House, Democrats caution he will again seek to undo the ACA. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around the time of Packard’s 2017 diagnosis, Republicans in the U.S. Congress and then-President Donald Trump were </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-gop-leaders-take-victory-lap-after-house-passes-trumpcare-n754896" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">celebrating steps towards repealing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the now 14-year-old federal policy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump’s campaign hasn’t formally rolled out plans for healthcare policy if re-elected. But speakers at Monday’s event pointed to his past actions — like his </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trump-to-propose-big-cuts-to-safety-net-in-new-budget-this-week/2017/05/21/62c01f44-3e34-11e7-adba-394ee67a7582_story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">budget proposals to cut Medicaid funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> —  along with statements his running made made in recent media interviews and statements Trump made during his debate with Vice President Kamala Harris as clues to his intentions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his debate with Harris in early September, Trump said that there are “concepts and options” for a cheaper system than the ACA that he will outline in the “not-too-distant future.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent interviews vice presidential candidate Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance indicated the administration would </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/vance-says-future-trump-administration-defund-planned-parenthood-rcna174211" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">end federal funding to organizations like Planned Parenthood</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and suggested a plan to </span><a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2024/09/18/vance-targets-inflation-immigration-at-raleigh-event/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">separate patients into different health insurance pools based on individual risks.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are not going to let their ‘concepts of a plan’ happen where insurance companies get to pick and choose who they want to cover,” Packard said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Democratic 1st Congressional District candidate Leslie Mehta, Medicaid helped her family cover additional expenses for her disabled daughter Brooke. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before her death, Brooke lived with a rare neurological disorder called Rhett’s Syndrome that severely limits motor skills and language. Mehta said Monday that initially, she was denied Medicaid coverage for her daughter’s condition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once covered, the family was able to get a device that helped them communicate with her. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Medicaid allowed me to be able to hear the words ‘I love you’ from my oldest daughter,” Mehta said. “When we talk about Medicaid, and we talk about the ability to have it for so many in our country, this is what it means.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement last week, Trump’s campaign said that more concrete outlines are forthcoming with a goal of reducing health care costs by other methods. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He will release more details, but his overall position on healthcare remains the same: bring down costs and increase the quality of care by improving competition in the marketplace,” national campaign secretary Karolina Leavitt said in a statement sent to The Mercury. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, noted how Democrats in Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022 — which included price caps on insulin and the ability to negotiate the prices of other popular prescription medications. At the state level and prior to being elected to congress, McClellan helped pass a bill to create Virginia’s state healthcare exchange. And in 2018, a few Virginian Republicans backed Democrat-led efforts to expand Medicaid eligibility. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speakers, including McClellan, also pointed to the “Project 2025” policy guidebook from conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation as a reason for caution. Trump has distanced himself from the blueprint, which outlines cuts to Medicaid, despite his ties to several of its authors and the organization having </span><a href="https://www.heritage.org/impact/trump-administration-embraces-heritage-foundation-policy-recommendations" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">praised him for tapping into previous their proposals in his first term</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Donald Trump, J.D. Vance, and Project 2025 are coming for our healthcare,” McClellan said. “We have a lot of work to do to build on the progress we have already made.”</span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><em>Editor&#8217;s note:</em> <em>The Virginia Mercury is not using the last names of the women in this article to protect their privacy and safety. The accounts of all three women have been verified with medical records and by a medical professional with knowledge of their experiences.</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nisa knew her third pregnancy was a non-starter. She didn’t know that she would fear death for 18 days while trying to get an abortion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I felt like I had a ticking time bomb inside of me,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is because Nisa has Von Willebrand Disease, a genetic blood disorder that prevents clotting. It puts her at higher risk for bleeding to death during things like injuries, surgeries, or if she were to have a miscarriage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her first two pregnancies had been challenging and once she had been diagnosed with the blood disorder, she’d decided not to have more children for fear of complications or passing the disease onto others. By the time she became unexpectedly pregnant last summer, she was also in the throes of Stage 4 endometriosis symptoms — a diagnosis that would later lead to her having a hysterectomy. She&#8217;d also had an endometrial ablation to treat endometriosis symptoms before finding out she was pregnant last summer — placing her in a more at-risk pregnancy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under 10 weeks of gestation at the time, Nisa said she otherwise would have been able to take abortion medication. With her disease, she couldn’t. Surgical abortions also posed challenges because she needed to have specific medications and extra blood on standby. The procedure was denied by her local providers in coastal Virginia, she said, and the local Planned Parenthood facilities didn’t have the resources. A hospital was her best bet for completing the procedure, but it took 18 days to sort out an abortion at VCU Health in Richmond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite Virginia’s status as the least-restrictive Southern state for abortion access, Nisa wonders how many others may be falling through health care gaps as she did. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia is not safe. We think we’re safe, but we’re not,” she said. “How do you treat a person who isn’t the standard in this post-Roe world?”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virginia’s barriers</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade two and a half years ago, states around the country have shored up their protections or enacted various bans and restrictions. And though Virginia is the least restrictive Southern state — and a bastion for out-of-state patients — a </span><a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA3324-2.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioslocal_richmond&amp;stream=top" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> indicates some hurdles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, abortion is </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title18.2/chapter4/article9/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legal for any reason until around 26 weeks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with limited exceptions for later abortions. In those cases, three physicians must attest that someone’s physical or mental health would be “irremediably impaired” if a pregnancy were to continue. Conversely, surrounding states have </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/florida-abortion-ban-six-weeks-virginia-susan-swecker/article_e5c13ac8-0708-11ef-9bfa-831eade60f7b.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">near-total bans or limits as low as 6 weeks on the procedure.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key findings from the RAND Corporation report noted how abortion law is currently housed in Virginia’s criminal code (a Class 4 felony for unlawfully conducted abortions), the three-physician threshold for some abortions, and lack of clarity on the “ability to provide second-trimester abortions in non-hospital settings.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. William Fitzhugh, who runs clinics in Richmond, Newport News and Roanoke, said he’s seen a flux of out-of-state patients over the past two years. But sometimes, he’s had to refer patients elsewhere. For example, by the time a Tennessee patient had made it to one of his clinics, she was 28 weeks along, he said, so he referred her to Maryland where there are no gestation limits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I worry for other women in gray areas like mine,” Nisa said. “I had family that could help watch my kids and I didn’t have to travel far, but I still had to travel in my own state. There are women who can’t take time off work or have childcare.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">North Carolina resident Kishia ended up having to take time off work and her children had to miss school for a few days so they could travel to Fitzhugh&#8217;s Richmond clinic for her 14-year-old daughter to get an abortion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She called the experience “H-E-double-L.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More important, Kishia said, is the fact that her daughter Myasia has been in pain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At 19-weeks of gestation, she couldn’t legally obtain an abortion in North Carolina and being further into gestation means a more invasive abortion procedure. In these cases, small rods are typically placed in the cervix to prepare it for an abortion to occur the next day. Kishia said the family would have sought an abortion sooner if they could have. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Myasia has had regular menstrual cycles, her mother said, and with </span><a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/22044-bleeding-during-pregnancy" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bleeding in early gestation common in 15% to 25% of pregnancies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Myasia hadn’t realized right away that she was pregnant. By the time she did and told her mother, when they visited a clinic in Charlotte they were told she was too far along for the state&#8217;s 12-week limit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People get abortions for different reasons,” Kishia stressed as she noted that people can have medical issues, or be young and not emotionally or financially ready to care for an unplanned child. In Myasia’s case, she is still technically a child herself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a smile, Kishia said that she is grateful her family was able to connect with an abortion fund to offset travel costs. She said she doesn’t plan on having to go through their ordeal again. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kishia said she’s somewhat tuned in to state, congressional, presidential and gubernatorial elections. As her chance to vote in North Carolina this fall approaches, she’ll be thinking about abortion access and other reproductive rights. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t think this should ever be banned,” she said. </span></p>
	<div class="newsroomSidebarContainer ">
	<div class="newsroomSidebar"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abortion laws had been a flashpoint in Virginia’s state legislative elections last year as Democrats promised to place protections in the state’s constitution and many Republicans proposed capping most abortions at 15 weeks of gestation. Their idea, approved by Gov. Glenn Youngkin, noted exceptions for rape, incest and life-threatening situations for the pregnant person but </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/two-women-two-pregnancies-two-agonizing-decisions/article_24e5d5fc-742d-11ee-984d-6befc702d5d0.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lacked provisions for severe fetal anomalies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (which are often detected at or after 15 weeks). Ultimately, Democrats retained control of the Senate and gained control of the House of Delegates.</span></div>
	</div>
	
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Legal challenges</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another finding in the RAND report noted local-level abortion hurdles when it comes to city, town and county governments in the state. Such is the case in  parts of Southwest Virginia, where local governments have </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/florida-abortion-ban-six-weeks-virginia-susan-swecker/article_e5c13ac8-0708-11ef-9bfa-831eade60f7b.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ordinances</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to deter the establishment of abortion clinics. A clinic in Bristol has been embroiled in </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2023/04/03/owner-says-abortion-clinic-in-bristol-is-here-to-stay-regardless-of-the-outcome-of-a-lawsuit-seeking-to-terminate-her-lease/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lawsuits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with its building’s landlords that threaten its existence. Conversely, Alexandria passed an </span><a href="https://www.alxnow.com/2023/04/13/zoning-change-that-makes-abortion-clinics-easier-to-open-in-alexandria-draws-ire-of-local-catholic-leadership/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioslocal_richmond&amp;stream=top" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ordinance to make it easier for clinics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to open and Richmond recently </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2024-07-23/planned-parenthood-richmond-clinic-city-council-land-transfer" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">transferred land for cheap to Planned Parenthood to set up another clinic in town.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the state level, democratic  lawmakers still plan to strengthen Virginia’s abortion access laws. In 2025, they plan to introduce a proposed constitutional amendment. It will need to pass two years in a row with a House of Delegates election in between before appearing on statewide ballots for voters to approve or reject. Placing protections in the constitution would make them less susceptible to partisan shifts in the legislature over time. Even Republican-leaning states have approved similar ballot measures in recent years, showing that it is not a totally partisan issue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wouldn’t be the first time Virignia has tried to enshrine abortion access in its constitution. </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/house-panel-votes-down-abortion-rights-amendment-extradition-bill/article_aad3cc5a-af07-11ed-8954-a369717bdbc1.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar proposals have failed </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the two previous legislative sessions. A sticking point had been language that GOP lawmakers alleged was too broad and would go further than Roe’s legal framework.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The language, much like language in other states’ passed </span><a href="https://legislature.vermont.gov/Documents/2022/Docs/BILLS/PR0005/PR0005%20As%20adopted%20by%20the%20Senate%20and%20the%20House%20Official.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">amendments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, would declare people have a right to abortion unless there is a “compelling state interest.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where Roe balanced the right to obtain an abortion and health of the pregnant person with the potential life of a fetus, constitutionally protecting access within a state would operate similarly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s unclear what the language of the next attempted abortion amendment  would be but Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield — who plans to co-sponsor it again — said there will be more to discuss later this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are still working on the language to ensure that our constitutional amendment effectively protects safe and legal access to abortion in Virginia.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of Trump’s other actions as president illustrate his opposition to a long-debated topic between Republicans and Democrats: the Affordable Care Act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often referred to as “Obamacare” by its opponents, the ACA was a hallmark of former democratic president Barack Obama’s administration. The act established a public insurance marketplace and prevented insurance companies from denying coverage based on preexisting conditions.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Trump’s first day as president in 2017, he issued an </span><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/24/2017-01799/minimizing-the-economic-burden-of-the-patient-protection-and-affordable-care-act-pending-repeal" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executive order to prompt its repeal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He also </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-gop-leaders-take-victory-lap-after-house-passes-trumpcare-n754896" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">celebrated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a repeal effort that passed the House before it failed in the Senate. In 2020 he also </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/politics/obamacare-trump-administration-supreme-court.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">supported a lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before the U.S. Supreme Court that sought to tear down ACA. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, over 20 million people </span><a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/marketplace-2024-open-enrollment-period-report-final-national-snapshot" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">utilize it </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">nationwide and nearly 400,000 Virginians could  pay more for their health insurance if the ACA were repealed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an example of what could be lost, the Harris campaign’s Virginia-based team used a Kaiser Family Foundation </span><a href="https://www.kff.org/interactive/subsidy-calculator/#state=va&amp;zip=23450&amp;income-type=percent&amp;income=325&amp;employer-coverage=0&amp;people=4&amp;alternate-plan-family=&amp;adult-count=2&amp;adults%5B0%5D%5Bage%5D=45&amp;adults%5B0%5D%5Btobacco%5D=0&amp;adults%5B1%5D%5Bage%5D=45&amp;adults%5B1%5D%5Btobacco%5D=0&amp;child-count=2&amp;children%5B0%5D%5Bage%5D=10&amp;children%5B0%5D%5Btobacco%5D=0&amp;children%5B1%5D%5Bage%5D=8&amp;children%5B1%5D%5Btobacco%5D=0" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">calculator tool</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to show how a middle class family based in Virginia Beach is currently eligible for about $9,000 per year as a premium tax credit to offset their coverage costs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his debate with Harris in early September, Trump said that he has “concepts of a plan” when it comes to health care policy if re-elected. He added that there are “concepts and options” for a cheaper system that he will outline in the “not-too-distant future.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report also takes aim at Trump’s “concepts” quote and the fact that he’s yet to fully articulate what his plans are. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“(Trump and Vance) may not want Americans to see the details of their plan, but Vice President Harris and Governor Walz won’t let them get away with hiding its effects,” Harris campaign senior policy advisor Brian Nelson said in a release. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But formal outlines should be on the horizon, Trump’s team said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As President Trump said, he will release more details, but his overall position on health care remains the same: bring down costs and increase the quality of care by improving competition in the marketplace,” Trump’s national campaign secretary Karolina Leavitt said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report was released ahead of a vice presidential debate on Tuesday where Harris’ running-mate Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minnesota, will face off against Vance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When pressed about their healthcare proposals on a recent episode of “Meet the Press,” </span><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/4880616-jd-vance-donald-trump-health-care/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vance said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “a lot of it comes down… to deregulating the insurance market so that people can choose a plan that actually makes sense for them.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a recent event in North Carolina, Vance also suggested a plan to </span><a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2024/09/18/vance-targets-inflation-immigration-at-raleigh-event/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">separate patients into different health insurance pools based on individual risks.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leavitt, of Trump’s campaign, accused Harris of showing “support for a socialist government takeover of our healthcare system that would force people off their private plans and result in lower quality care.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The accusation stems from Harris’ previous co-sponsorship of a “Medicare For All” bill when still a U.S. Senator as well as her </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/kamala-harris-wants-end-private-health-insurance-new-democratic-litmus-n964241?_nlid=QjzdJemnN7&amp;_nhids=PolxhrO3Xn" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">embrace of it </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">during her 2019 bid for president. </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/19/medicare-for-all-harris-progressives-2024-elections-00174447" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">She has since moved away from that stance </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">which has been popular with the more progressive wings of the Democratic party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris’ recent health care proposals have included protecting the ACA and continuing price negotiations on medications that started as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, a measure for which she cast the tie-breaking vote to proceed. A price </span><a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/4829873-trump-biden-insulin-price-cap/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cap on insulin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has emerged as a debate within a debate for Trump, as his administration had implemented a temporary cap on the drug while the Inflation Reduction Act made the cap law unless it is repealed by future congressional action. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Harris-Walz campaign infers that Trump and Vance’s “message to America is: ‘you’re on your own.’”</span></p>

(Tony Leys/KFF Health News)</p><p><em><strong>By Tony Leys/KFF Health News</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ADAIR, Iowa — The blue-and-white highway sign for the eastbound rest stop near here displays more than the standard icon of a person in a wheelchair, indicating facilities are accessible to people who can’t walk. The sign also shows a person standing behind a horizontal rectangle, preparing to perform a task.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second icon signals that this rest area along Interstate 80 in western Iowa has a bathroom equipped with a full-size changing table, making it an oasis for adults and older children who use diapers because of disabilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a beacon of hope,” said Nancy Baker Curtis, whose 9-year-old son, Charlie, has a disability that can leave him incontinent. “I’m like, ‘Oh my gosh, we’re finally there.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The white changing table is 6 feet long and can be lowered and raised with a handheld controller wired to an electric motor. When not in use, the table folds up against the wall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The table was recently installed as part of a national effort to make public bathrooms more accessible in places like airports, parks, arenas, and gas stations. Without such options, people with disabilities often wind up being changed on bathroom floors, in cars, or even on the ground outside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many families hesitate to go out because of the lack of accessible restrooms. “We all know somebody who’s tethered to their home by bathroom needs,” Baker Curtis said. She doesn’t want her son’s life to be limited that way. “Charlie deserves to be out in the community.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said the need can be particularly acute when people are traveling in rural areas, where bathroom options are sparse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baker Curtis, who lives near Des Moines, leads the Iowa chapter of a national group called “Changing Spaces,” which advocates for adult-size changing tables. The group offers </span><a href="https://my.atlist.com/map/306b2633-4789-4c3c-af67-f948baa51f66?marker_id=f1d365d9-645d-4872-96f5-842f653b6ae1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an online map</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showing scores of locations where they’ve been installed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advocates say such tables </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10309150/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are not explicitly required</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the federal Americans with Disabilities Act. But a new federal law will mandate them in many airports in coming years, and states can adopt building codes that call for them. </span><a href="https://casetext.com/statute/california-codes/california-health-and-safety-code/division-13-housing/part-53-access-to-places-of-public-amusement-and-resort-by-physically-handicapped-persons/section-199525-adult-changing-stations" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">California</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for example, requires them in new or renovated auditoriums, arenas, amusement parks, and similar facilities with capacities of at least 2,500 people. </span><a href="https://codes.iccsafe.org/s/OHBC2024P1/chapter-11-accessibility/OHBC2024P1-Ch11-Sec1110.18" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ohio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requires them in some settings, including large public facilities and highway rest stops. </span><a href="https://www.kvoa.com/news/local/governor-doug-ducey-passes-adult-changing-table-law/article_93f2b84b-79a1-506d-a3ae-8cc4b4f367ee.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arizona</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://senatorrezin.com/2024/08/12/rezin-sponsored-samis-law-signed-by-governor/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Illinois</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.md-council.org/3462-2/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maryland</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/adult-changing-tables-are-now-minnesota-law-in-all-new-public-restrooms/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minnesota</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/new-hampshire/2022/title-xii/title-155/section-155-80/#:~:text=(b)%20The%20powered%2C%20height%20adjustable%20adult%20changing,Support%20up%20to%20at%20least%20350%20pounds." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Hampshire</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also have taken steps to require them in some public buildings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Justin Boatner of Arlington, Virginia, advocates for more full-size changing tables in the Washington, D.C., area. Boatner, 26, uses a wheelchair because of a disability similar to muscular dystrophy. He uses diapers, which he often changes himself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He can lower an adjustable changing table to the height of his wheelchair, then pull himself onto it. Doing that is much easier and more hygienic than getting down on the floor, changing himself, and then crawling back into the wheelchair, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boatner said it’s important to talk about incontinence, even though it can be embarrassing. “There’s so much stigma around it,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said adult changing tables are still scarce, including in health care facilities, but he’s optimistic that more will be installed. Without them, he sometimes delays changing his diaper for hours until he can get home. That has led to serious rashes, he said. “It’s extremely uncomfortable.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iowa legislators in recent years have considered requiring adult changing tables in some public restrooms. They declined to pass such a bill, but the discussion made Iowa Department of Transportation leaders aware of the problem. “I’m sorry to say, it was one of those things we’d just never thought of,” said Michael Kennerly, director of the department’s design bureau.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kennerly oversees planning for rest stops. He recalls an Iowan telling him about changing a family member outside in the rain, with only an umbrella for shelter. Others told him how they changed their loved ones on bathroom floors. “It was just appalling,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iowa began installing adult changing tables in rest stops in 2022, and it has committed to including them in new or remodeled facilities. So far, nine have been installed or are in the process of being added. Nine others are planned, with more to come, Kennerly said. Iowa has 38 rest areas equipped with bathrooms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kennerly estimated it costs up to $14,000 to remodel an existing rest-stop bathroom to include a height-adjustable adult changing table. Incorporating adult changing tables into a new rest stop building should cost less than that, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several organizations offer portable changing tables, which can be set up at public events. Some are included in mobile, accessible bathrooms </span><a href="https://momentumrefresh.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">carried on trailers or trucks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Most permanent adult changing tables are set up in “family restrooms,” which have one toilet and are open to people of any gender. That’s good, because the act of changing an adult is “very intimate and private,” Baker Curtis said. It’s also important for the tables to be height-adjustable because it’s difficult to lift an adult onto a fixed-height table, she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advocates hope adult changing tables will become nearly as common as infant changing tables, which once were rare in public bathrooms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jennifer Corcoran, who lives near Dayton, Ohio, has been advocating for adult changing tables for a decade and has seen interest rise in recent years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corcoran’s 24-year-old son, Matthew, was born with brain development issues. He uses a wheelchair and is unable to speak, but he accompanies her when she lobbies for improved services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corcoran said Ohio leaders this year designated $4.4 million in federal pandemic relief money to be distributed as grants for changing-table projects. The program has led to installations at Dayton’s airport and art museum, plus libraries and entertainment venues, she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ohio also is adding adult changing tables to rest stops. Corcoran said those tables are priceless because they make it easier for people with disabilities to travel. “Matthew hasn’t been on a vacation outside of Ohio for more than five years,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaylan Dunlap serves on a committee that has worked to add changing-table requirements to the </span><a href="https://www.iccsafe.org/products-and-services/i-codes/2018-i-codes/ibc/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">International Building Code</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which state and local officials often use as a model for their rules.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dunlap, who lives in Alabama, works for an architecture firm and reviews building projects to ensure they comply with access standards. She expects more public agencies and companies will voluntarily install changing tables. Maybe someday they will be a routine part of public bathrooms, she said. “But I think that’s a long way out in the future, unfortunately.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, the Founding Freedoms Law Center, the legal division of the Family Foundation, announced it filed a lawsuit in Henrico County Circuit Court, claiming the state violated their clients&#8217; right to free speech and religious freedom. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The suit names the Virginia Board of Counseling, Virginia Department of Health Professions, and its director, Arne Owens, as the defendants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The American Medical Association has denounced conversion therapy, </span><a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/population-care/advocating-lgbtq-community" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">saying</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the practice is based on the idea that “homosexuality and gender nonconformity are mental disorders and that sexual orientation and gender identity can be changed,” assumptions that are not based on medical or scientific evidence.</span></p>
<p>Narissa Rahaman, executive director for Equality Virginia, said the Family Foundation&#8217;s latest action is another attempt to discriminate against LGBTQ+ people.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once again, anti-LGBTQ+ forces are just trying to find new ways to advance their failing cause,&#8221; Rahaman said in a statement. &#8220;To the LGBTQ+ youth in Virginia and around the country who have been subjected to this dangerous practice: We will not stop fighting for you. You are worthy of love, support and access to affirming therapy.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, Virginia </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title54.1/chapter24/section54.1-2409.5/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">banned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conversion therapy, which prohibits state-licensed healthcare providers and counselors from practicing it on anyone under 18.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the suit, John and Janet Raymond, the plaintiffs and owners of the Associate Counseling Center in Front Royal, have lost “significant” business income due to the ban.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Raymonds wish to counsel children who are seeking help to align their sexual feelings, actions, and identity toward a biblical sexual ethic, in accordance with God‘s design for human beings, including those struggling with homosexuality and so-called &#8216;gender identity,’” the suit states.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia lawsuit was announced soon after Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear banned the practice through an executive order on Sept. 18. Republicans outraged by the decision said it violated parental rights and hindered their legal authority to make decisions about their child’s care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founding Freedoms Law Center attorney Josh Hetzler said their case is independent of Kentucky’s recent action, but makes the Virginia lawsuit “all the more timely” and could be a learning opportunity for the neighbor state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We think our case is going to help (and) hopefully when we win, Kentucky will see the writing on the wall and will do the right thing as well,” Hetzler said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a </span><a href="https://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/therapeutic-response.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the American Psychological Association, behavior therapists used treatment like inducing nausea, providing electric shocks, or having the individual snap an elastic band around their wrist when they became aroused by same-sex erotic images or thoughts. Virginia’s ban on the practice in 2020 came after</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2020/02/18/after-years-of-efforts-virginia-passes-law-to-ban-conversion-therapy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> several years of failed legislative efforts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to make it illegal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, minors’ sexuality and gender expression have been at the forefront of political discussions concerning education and athletics in Virginia schools. Both Democrats and Republicans have  fought over the protections and rights of minors as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most notable actions came when Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration overhauled the state&#8217;s </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/09/12/despite-law-few-virginia-school-districts-adopt-state-model-transgender-policies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> model school policies for transgender and nonbinary students designed under former Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam to protect the privacy and rights of such minors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, groups including the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia have filed lawsuits challenging the Virginia Department of Education on the policies that some schools have adopted. In February, the ACLU and Freshfields filed three related lawsuits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One case, involving at least one teacher refusing to address a transgender student by her preferred first name, was </span><a href="https://www.wtkr.com/news/in-the-community/historic-triangle/york-county-court-dismisses-lawsuit-challenging-virginias-transgender-student-policies" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dismissed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in July. The other two cases are still being litigated in the Eastern District of Virginia and the Hanover County Circuit Court.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the Mercury </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/07/12/changes-to-sex-listed-on-virginia-birth-certificates-more-than-doubled-after-2020-law/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the number of Virginians changing the sex listed on their birth certificate more than doubled between 2020 and 2022, after lawmakers passed </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+SB657" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> streamlining the process for individuals wanting to do so.</span></p>

(Scott Olson/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the aftermath of the recent </span><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/georgia-school-shooting-suspect-gun-backpack-hid-bathroom/story?id=113622880" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">school shooting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Winder, Georgia, that left four students and teachers dead, and the threats of violence made online in various Virginia school districts, the NAACP Virginia State Conference has pushed for increased action on social media education, mental health services and a renewed commitment to addressing racism and inequality in public schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No student should live in fear of attending school, nor should any student be the target of racially motivated hatred,” the Rev. Cozy Bailey, the group’s president, said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We call on school districts, state leaders, and policymakers to prioritize expanding both mental health services and DEI initiatives in schools. These efforts are not mutually exclusive but critical to building inclusive and supportive environments where all students feel safe and valued,” Bailey said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Virginia has been spared a fatal school shooting since November 2022, when three people were killed and two others were injured in </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/12/26/uva-shooting-timeline-what-happened/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a mass shooting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the University of Virginia, online threats continue to disrupt school operations and scare parents and students. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just last week, the Harrisonburg Police Department </span><a href="https://www.dnronline.com/places/local/rockingham_county/harrisonburg/harrisonburg-teen-arrested-after-posting-shooting-threat-on-social-media/article_1bf1d0aa-3d4c-58a6-9b99-29b6af85bba6.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">arrested</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a 16-year-old male suspected of making violent threats against other students. The arrest was the result of an investigation into the threats posted to social media on Sept. 15, which resulted in both Harrisonburg High School and Rocktown High School closing the next day as a matter of precaution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/us/school-shootings-fast-facts-dg/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent report by CNN</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there have been 50 school shootings this year in the United States. While this is lower than last year’s 82 school shootings, if patterns move as they have historically, a dramatic uptick is to be expected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While addressing school security is critical, the Virginia NAACP stresses that a comprehensive strategy is needed to tackle not only gun control but also the mental health crisis facing youth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This strategy must also confront the harmful effects of racism that persist in educational settings and has motivated racial issues that the Virginia NAACP regularly receives reports about, the organization said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The rise in violent threats demonstrates the pressing need for DEI programs and inclusive curriculums that can address these systemic issues and create inclusive school environments. Calls to dismantle DEI efforts ignore the reality of the continued presence of racism in schools, where marginalized students are often most vulnerable,” the statement said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bailey, the group’s president, added that the mental health and safety of Virginia’s school children must remain a top priority.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia NAACP further called for collaboration between local governments, law enforcement, community organizations, and educational institutions to ensure that schools are not only secure but equipped to confront both mental health challenges and the ongoing issue of racial discrimination.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OEMS is currently part of the Virginia Department of Health and oversees funding and programming for Virginia’s emergency medical services. This includes purchasing and maintaining equipment and ambulances as well as training first responders. As a result of financial issues in recent years, some trauma centers have received state funding late.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key findings in the audit revealed in a presentation on Wednesday included multi-million dollar contracts that bypassed state procurement rules by being routed through a Regional EMS Council and dedicated rescue squad funding used to cover costs for a symposium, inflated operating expenses and EMS-related technology. Seven laptops were purchased outside of procurement processes and have since been lost, the audit revealed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The audit also showed that the office purchased shuttle vehicles to transport fire and rescue squad members to a symposium they attended previously, along with $9,000 spent on alcohol.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this year&#8217;s symposium having since been canceled, Winchester Fire and Rescue Chief Jon Henschel was frustrated by the missed learning opportunity for paramedics and other first responders. It’s just one of the “negative impacts downstream,” he said in an interview.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Department of Health Commissioner Karen Shelton requested the audit when she noticed irregularities last year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One piece of the $33 million  puzzle has included Adam Harrell, a former director in the office, </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/business/health-care/adam-harrell-department-of-health-ems/article_5f4258b8-4abc-11ef-9745-a356984ae776.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pleading guilty to embezzlement of over $4 million.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The report confirmed that he used one of the Regional EMS Councils to pay a fraudulent company he owned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In reflecting on the past year during the audit presentation Sept18, Shelton said that Harrell was able to “use and abuse (his) OEMS position of power.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shelton and Chief Operating Officer Christopher Lindsay noted changes the department has made in the past year to improve accountability and avoid errors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This year has been a difficult year for all of us,” Shelton said.  “As we have processed these financial deficits as well as the fraudulent activity, we&#8217;ve put in place measures to prevent this from happening again.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OEMS has held regular briefings with VDH, they said, and a new director is being hired who will sign off on expenses. Contracts that were previously handled by Regional EMS councils have been centralized back to OEMS or canceled. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, revamped procedures now ensure that dedicated funding is dispensed properly and there are set benchmarks for recipients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have changed the way that we will pay out money to trauma centers in the state,” Lindsay said. “We&#8217;re moving from an annual payment to a biannual payment.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VDH had also tapped consulting firm Fitch &amp; Associates to compile recommendations for OEMS’ future operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There were no checks and balances within the system,” said Todd Sheridan, who presented on behalf of the firm. In the first week of his company’s review of the department, he said that they found roughly 500 unpaid invoices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also listed several of more than 60 reform recommendations that the department could take. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideas include reorganizing OEMS’ leadership structure and creating a dedicated business operations manager to consult on financial decisions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sheridan noted other potential configurations that would put OEMS under other departments instead of VDH, which would require state legislation.  Those options included merging the state emergency department with the Department of Fire Programs or OEMS establishing itself within the Department of Public Safety. Another option, he said, would be disbanding OEMS altogether and allowing other departments to absorb its duties. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another idea was to reduce Virginia’s 11 Regional EMS Councils to seven (it was a regional council that Harrell pleaded guilty to routing fraudulent payments through). The councils were created through state code to address region-specific needs for emergency responses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s Regional EMS Councils Director’s Group handed out white papers at the meeting that contextualized their stances. The group advocated for continuing with 11 councils and codifying dedicated funding for the regional councils to use. The papers also noted the group’s support for stricter oversight mechanisms for VDH and OEMS to prevent financial mismanagement. </span></p>

<p>Raj’s last text message was to his college lab partner about how to divide homework questions.</p>
<p>“You don’t say you’re going to take questions 1 through 15 if you’re planning to be dead one hour later,” said Mehta, 29, a mental health and suicide prevention advocate in Arlington, Virginia. She had been trained in <a href="https://www.mentalhealthfirstaid.org/" target="_blank">Mental Health First Aid</a> — a nationwide program that teaches how to identify, understand, and respond to signs of mental illness — yet she said her brother showed no signs of trouble.</p>
<p>Mehta said some people blamed her for Raj’s death because the two were living together during the covid-19 pandemic while Raj was attending classes online. Others said her training should have helped her recognize he was struggling.</p>
<p>But, Mehta said, “we act like we know everything there is to know about suicide prevention. We’ve done a really good job at developing solutions for a part of the problem, but we really don’t know enough.”</p>
<p>Raj’s death came in the midst of decades of unsuccessful attempts to tamp down suicide rates nationwide.</p>

<p>During the past two decades federal officials have launched three national suicide prevention strategies, including one announced in April.</p>
<p>The first strategy, announced in 2001, focused on addressing risk factors for suicide and leaned on a few common interventions.</p>
<p>The next strategy called for developing and implementing standardized protocols to identify and treat people at risk for suicide with follow-up care and the support needed to continue treatment.</p>
<p>The latest strategy builds on previous ones and includes a federal action plan calling for implementation of 200 measures over the next three years, including prioritizing populations disproportionately affected by suicide, such as Black youth and Native Americans and Alaska Natives.</p>
<p>Despite those evolving strategies, from 2001 through 2021 suicide rates <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db464.htm#:~:text=Matthew%20F.,Curtin%2C%20M.A.&amp;text=After%20increasing%20between%202001%20(10.7,increased%20to%2014.1%20in%202021." target="_blank">increased most years</a>, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/vsrr/vsrr034.pdf" target="_blank">Provisional data for 2022</a>, the most recent numbers available, shows deaths by suicide grew an additional 3% over the previous year. CDC officials project the final number of suicides in 2022 will be higher.</p>
<p>In the past two decades, suicide rates in <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/suicide-mortality/suicide.htm" target="_blank">rural states</a> such as Alaska, Montana, North Dakota, and Wyoming <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rural-health/php/public-health-strategy/suicide-in-rural-america-prevention-strategies.html#:~:text=Suicide%20was%20responsible%20for%20over,one%20suicide%20every%2011%20minutes.&amp;text=In%20the%20past%20two%20decades,to%2027.3%25%20in%20metro%20areas." target="_blank">have been about double</a> those in urban areas, according to the CDC.</p>
<p>Despite those persistently disappointing numbers, mental health experts contend the national strategies aren’t the problem. Instead, they argue, the policies — for many reasons —simply aren’t being funded, adopted, and used. That slow uptake was compounded by the covid-19 pandemic, which had a broad, negative impact on mental health.</p>
<p>A chorus of national experts and government officials agree the strategies simply haven’t been embraced widely, but said even basic tracking of deaths by suicide isn’t universal.</p>
<p>Surveillance data is commonly used to drive health care quality improvement and has been helpful in addressing cancer and heart disease. Yet, it hasn’t been used in the study of behavioral health issues such as suicide, said Michael Schoenbaum, a senior adviser for mental health services, epidemiology, and economics at the National Institute of Mental Health.</p>
<p>“We think about treating behavioral health problems just differently than we think about physical health problems,” Schoenbaum said.</p>
<p>Without accurate statistics, researchers can’t figure out who dies most often by suicide, what prevention strategies are working, and where prevention money is needed most.</p>
<p>Many states and territories don’t allow medical records to be linked to death certificates, Schoenbaum said, but <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/compendium-policies-use-linkable-mortality-data" target="_blank">NIMH is collaborating</a> with a handful of other organizations to document this data for the first time in a public report and database due out by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Further hobbling the strategies is the fact that federal and local funding ebbs and flows and some suicide prevention efforts don’t work in some states and localities because of the challenging geography, said Jane Pearson, special adviser on suicide research to the NIMH director.</p>
<p>Wyoming, where a few hundred thousand residents are spread across sprawling, rugged landscape, consistently ranks among the states with the highest suicide rates.</p>
<p>State officials have worked for many years to address the state’s suicide problem, said Kim Deti, a spokesperson for the Wyoming Department of Health.</p>
<p>But deploying services, like mobile crisis units, a core element of the latest national strategy, is difficult in a big, sparsely populated state.</p>
<p>“The work is not stopping but some strategies that make sense in some geographic areas of the country may not make sense for a state with our characteristics,” she said.</p>
<p>Lack of implementation isn’t only a state and local government problem. Despite evidence that screening patients for suicidal thoughts during medical visits <a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.focus.20220086" target="_blank">helps head off catastrophe</a>, health professionals are not mandated to do so.</p>
<p>Many doctors find suicide screening daunting because they have limited time and insufficient training and because they aren’t comfortable discussing suicide, said Janet Lee, an adolescent medicine specialist and associate professor of pediatrics at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University.</p>
<p>“I think it is really scary and kind of astounding to think if something is a matter of life and death how somebody can’t ask about it,” she said.</p>
<p>The use of other measures has also been inconsistent. Crisis intervention services are core to the national strategies, yet many states haven’t built standardized systems.</p>
<p>Besides being fragmented, crisis systems, such as mobile crisis units, can vary from state to state and county to county. Some mobile crisis units use telehealth, some operate 24 hours a day and others 9 to 5, and some use local law enforcement for responses instead of mental health workers.</p>
<p>Similarly, the fledgling 988 Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline faces similar, serious problems.</p>
<p>Only 23% of Americans are familiar with 988 and there’s a significant knowledge gap about the situations people should call 988 for, according to a <a href="https://www.nami.org/support-education/publications-reports/survey-reports/poll-of-public-perspectives-on-988-crisis-response-2024/#:~:text=A%20NAMI%2DIpsos%20poll%20conducted,increased%20public%20awareness%20and%20education." target="_blank">recent poll</a> conducted by the National Alliance on Mental Illness and Ipsos.</p>
<p>Most states, territories, and tribes have also not yet permanently funded 988, which was launched nationwide in July 2022 and <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/988-two-year-anniversary-issue-brief.pdf" target="_blank">has received</a> about $1.5 billion in federal funding, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.</p>
<p>Anita Everett, director of the Center for Mental Health Services within SAMHSA, said her agency is running an awareness campaign to promote the system.</p>
<p>Some states, including Colorado, are taking other steps. There, state officials installed financial incentives for implementing suicide prevention efforts, among other patient safety measures, through the state’s Hospital Quality Incentive Payment Program. The program hands out about $150 million a year to hospitals for good performance. In the last year, 66 hospitals improved their care for patients experiencing suicidality, according to Lena Heilmann, director of the Office of Suicide Prevention at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.</p>
<p>Experts hope other states will follow Colorado’s lead.</p>
<p>And despite the slow movement, Mehta sees bright spots in the latest strategy and action plan.</p>
<p>Although it is too late to save Raj, “addressing the social drivers of mental health and suicide and investing in spaces for people to go to get help well before a crisis gives me hope,” Mehta said.</p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A committee of state lawmakers met in Virginia’s Eastern Shore this week as part of ongoing gatherings to hear from health care providers and other experts about rural health care challenges and possible solutions. The cohort will deliver a report later this year with recommendations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Topics at the meetings have been broadly about rural health care access. But there has also been time dedicated to specific issues like maternal health care gaps, sparse dental health care in some areas, regulatory hurdles in treating obesity and challenges to telehealth amid insufficient broadband infrastructure.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="joIlnekS81"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/rural-health-committee-hears-from-maternal-health-dental-specialists-in-farmville/">Rural health committee hears from maternal health, dental specialists in Farmville</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Rural health committee hears from maternal health, dental specialists in Farmville&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/rural-health-committee-hears-from-maternal-health-dental-specialists-in-farmville/embed/#?secret=tEd9OH5dAW#?secret=joIlnekS81" data-secret="joIlnekS81" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transportation issues and health care workforce shortages were common refrains at their first meeting in Tazewell this May and their Farmville meeting in June and were repeated again at the Sept. 16 Eastern Shore meeting this week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether it’s due to a lack of access to a car, fewer public transportation options, or increased travel time compared to urban areas, rural health care providers relayed that patients often miss follow up appointments or have to travel further for emergency care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s Southside also has fewer hospitals than other parts of the state. And though Southwest Virginia has a cluster of providers, both regions are experiencing the closure of obstetric units — fueling maternal healthcare disparities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the rural health committee works on proposing enterprising solutions to these problems, they may also look at ways to build on existing state programs or funding. For example, to help alleviate maternal workforce issues, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/17/virginias-state-budget-will-fund-ob-gyn-medical-residencies-amid-obstetrics-closures/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">funding was earmarked in Virginia&#8217;s current budget for OB-GYN medical residencies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Virginia’s Department of Medical Assistance Services has a program to support non-emergency medical transportation for some Medicaid patients, boosting transportation options. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve got something that’s at least serving some people,” committee chair Del. Rodney Willett, D-Henrico said of the DMAS program. “Can we leverage that? Is there a way to expand that for non-Medicaid folks who have certain income levels or live in certain areas? Can we fund that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some issues may be addressed or supported s by state funding, there are also regulatory routes to solutions through legislation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Willett noted how <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/rural-health-committee-hears-from-maternal-health-dental-specialists-in-farmville/">midwives have played a role</a> in Southside’s maternal health care problems. Though not OB-GYNs, some midwives are nurses and they specialize in pregnancy, childbirth and postpartum care. In 2020 Virginia law allowed for the certification of nurse-midwives and a 2021 law allowed for those with over two years of experience to serve as consultants for newly-licensed midwives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The state can’t totally solve that crisis,” Willett said. “But we’ve got to start somewhere.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blacksburg-area pharmacist Jeremy Counts called in to the meeting to talk about challenges independent pharmacies face, highlighting that these pharmacists will serve the areas of the state that national chains sometimes won’t. He’s hopeful for reimbursement reforms so that smaller pharmacies don’t continue to lose ground. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Independent pharmacies are in an existential crisis,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rx Partnership, a nonprofit that has coordinated the donation of bulk medicines from pharmaceutical manufacturers to clinics with licensed pharmacies, represents a point of progress on that front. Virginia’s General Assembly has already given funding to the organization and commended it through a resolution this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the topic of obesity was also a talking point at the Eastern Shore meeting this week, the state legislature could also explore adjusting criteria for Medicaid coverage of certain weight-loss treatments. Obesity is often tethered to other health conditions; it can contribute to some conditions, occur simultaneously with them, or be their root cause. While diet and exercise can play a role, exercise may be out of reach for those with debilitating chronic illnesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Something about being in the rural areas puts you at an increased risk of having obesity and diabetes,” said Lisa Price Stevens, a chief medical officer at DMAS, of the two often coexisting conditions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She noted how fresh produce, for example, can cost more sometimes than foods with less nutritional value while committee member Del. Otto Waschmann, R-Brunswick, described seeing fewer grocery stores in his district over time. When people have to travel further or have transportation hurdles to food markets, they are more likely to rely on whatever is readily available close by. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Susan Wolver, a VCU Health specialist who called into Monday’s meeting, recalled how treating obesity in one of her patients helped improve other aspects of her physical and mental health.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She relayed how she treated a breast cancer survivor who was struggling with depression and obesity along with a gap in employment. Being able to utilize her Medicaid coverage for an injectable medication helped her lose 100 pounds. This led to a domino effect of tackling her depression, finding new employment and finally being able to undergo breast reconstruction surgery. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, Wolver said, new criteria that took effect this past summer makes it harder for some of her patients to qualify for that type of coverage or other types of treatments. Patients must have certain, elevated Body Mass Index levels and/or have diabetes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wolver would rather patients be able to tackle obesity with medications sooner, if that’s the best course of treatment for them. She pointed to another patient who needs a kidney transplant, she said, but his BMI isn’t high enough for medication to be covered to help him lose weight to qualify for the surgery. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s like waiting for cancer to metastasize before waiting for treatment,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group also discussed creating a Secretary of Rural Affairs role at the meeting. The possible position, which would extend beyond the healthcare sphere, would be able to focus on the unique issues experienced by rural communities around the state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s nobody whose job it is to think about the rural communities (all the time),” said Andrew Block, a University of Virginia professor. “Even the governors who are most committed to rural communities just don’t have that kind of bandwidth to focus on that.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He pointed to bipartisan efforts last year to study whether Virginia should create such a position that failed in the legislature. In an interview with the Mercury, Willett said he would be open to the study if the General Assembly were to take up such a bill again. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, the committee, composed of lawmakers from around the state, is expected to meet once more before their report is due. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are collecting our thoughts,” Willett said. “We’re trying to get what we’ve heard into a series of categories and within each of those, have a legislative or budget-related suggestion.”</span></p>

(Courtesy of Ben Crump Law)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A newly released report by the disAbility Law Center of Virginia (dLCV) reveals that the death of Irvo Otieno, who </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-03-29/irvo-otieno-henrico-county-funeral" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">was killed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Central State Hospital in Dinwiddie County during a mental health crisis while in police custody last year, could have been prevented had sheriff’s deputies and hospital staff not used prone restraint, a controversial method of subduing individuals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a presentation of the findings before the House Appropriations Committee at the state Capitol in Richmond Tuesday, Colleen Miller, the dLCV’s executive director, urged lawmakers to end the criminalization of mental illness, remove law enforcement from the state’s response to people with mental health episodes and address the conditions in Virginia’s jails, where thousands of inmates with mental illness are being kept.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is serious reform needed in Virginia, because the events that happened to Mr. Otieno resulted in his death, and it got a lot of media attention. But people with mental illness are encountering these issues every single day in Virginia, and we need to do something about it,” Miller told the panel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otieno, a 28-year-old man with a history of mental health challenges, died on March 6, 2023, after being transported from the Henrico County Jail to Central State Hospital. The dLCV confirmed that sheriff’s deputies and hospital staff’s use of prone restraint — a technique where an individual is held face down — was a key factor in Otieno’s death. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The thing that led to his death, the prone restraint, is prohibited in our state facilities, and yet at Central State Hospital he was placed face down, people piled on top of him, and it killed him. So we really need to think about how to eliminate the prone restraint,” Miller said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ten Henrico County deputies and hospital workers were </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/irvo-otieno-killed-deputies-charged-virginia-hospital-ed9d227abea1bfa6946aa7cade5ced8b" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">initially charged</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with second-degree murder in Otieno’s death, which was captured on video. But prosecutors later asked a Dinwiddie Circuit Court judge </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/irvo-otieno-hospital-death-criminal-charges-dropped-b1b6cf44a3c6a33a37a69e657cc821c8" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to dismiss</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the charges against seven of the accused. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investigation by the dLCV, a non-profit designated by the federal government as the protection and advocacy organization for people with disabilities in Virginia, also found that while jailed in Henrico’s Regional Jail West for three days after suffering a mental health episode, Otieno was subjected to hours — possibly days — in an emergency restraint chair, and the jail failed to provide him with any psychiatric treatment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A restraint chair all by itself can be very dangerous, you are kind of caved in on yourself while you are in that chair, making it difficult to breathe. The correctional restraints require that someone be restrained only as long as necessary, while they are acting out,” Miller said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From Otieno’s initial encounter with police and the hospital emergency room to his incarceration and transfer to Central State Hospital, the </span><a href="https://www.dlcv.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IO-Public-Report-8.19.24-Near-Final.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">27-page report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> details “a complete breakdown of Virginia’s mental health crisis system, compounded by a culture of criminalizing individuals with mental illness, particularly communities of color.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The system that was supposed to help Otieno “utterly and completely failed him,” the investigation concluded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Mark Sickles, D-Fairfax, the committee’s vice chair, called the report “disturbing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve been trying to work on this area, and law enforcement is getting training in many places,” Sickles said. “Maybe it’s not uniform, I don’t know what happened in Henrico, but they are training law enforcement every day in dealing with people who have serious mental illness, and they need the appropriate training.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sickles emphasized the ongoing struggle to fill positions for mental health workers in Virginia, despite the legislature’s approval of additional funding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don’t have professional staffers, we are trying to fund psychiatric residencies, there is a shortage of all these mental health workers. We would hire them, we have openings,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sickles also pointed to housing shortages as a significant barrier, noting that many patients remain in hospitals longer than necessary due to a lack of community housing options. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They shouldn’t be in these situations, and we are working on this,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Rodney Willett, D-Henrico, called Otieno’s death a “tragedy on every level.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Willett is the sponsor of </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB1242" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 1242</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, also dubbed Irvo’s Law, that the General Assembly passed earlier this year. The measure allows family members and caregivers to access loved ones who are in crisis during their emergency room evaluations, unless the presence of a family member would create a medical or safety risk or if the patient objects to their presence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Irvo’s mom never got the chance to provide that information,” Willett said. “It’s such an unfortunate situation, and it’s also unfortunate that we need to have these terrible situations to inspire action. But we already took action before Irvo’s terrible death, and we are certainly going to take more.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislature this year also backed Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2023/december/name-1018721-en.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right help, right now”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> initiative, which marked a major investment in building emergency room alternatives to care for patients experiencing a behavioral health crisis, among other measures to address mental health challenges in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Del. Delores McQuinn, D-Richmond, said that Virginia’s jails, police and sheriff’s departments still are not equipped to deal with situations involving mental health episodes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I talk often to my sheriffs in Richmond and Henrico County about these issues, and they are overloaded with individuals who have mental health challenges, and they really don’t have a clue of what to do with them,” McQuinn said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is something that all of us must get to the table and bring some greater resolution to this, and I don’t think it’s going to happen swiftly, it’s going to be some years to get where we are trying to go.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The timeline of the dLCV’s investigation shows the importance of removing law enforcement from mental health treatment, said Miller, the group’s executive director. “Everything that law enforcement is trained to do is contrary to what is necessary for a mental health response. They are trained to be intimidating, to be tough, to never retreat.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers and stakeholders “should do some hard thinking” about how to protect people and help them get the treatment that they need,” Miller concluded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have seen different places throughout the timeline where Mr. Otieno was determined to need medical and mental health care and was prevented from getting that, time and time again.” </span></p>

It’s a critical investment in Virginia’s health care workforce, and one that all of us should be celebrating — but there’s an opportunity for further action. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ve likely heard of CHWs over the last few years. They are making </span><a href="https://richmondmagazine.com/life-style/health/community-health-workers/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">headlines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for all the right reasons. For one, these frontline health professionals played an outsized role in reducing vaccine hesitancy and connecting people to resources during the pandemic. </span></p>

(Health Brigade)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CHWs are public health professionals who come from or have an unusually close understanding of the communities they serve. They help patients access important safety net services like food, housing and transportation assistance – all factors that contribute to a person’s wellbeing. In short, they support people so they can comfortably and confidently navigate health care settings by leveraging their personal experiences.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raeann Ramshaw, a CHW at Ballad Health System in Southwest Virginia, is just one example. Every day is different, but she frequently helps people navigate SNAP paperwork, find rental assistance or access specialty medical programs in her hometown.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community health centers, nonprofits and local health districts are seeing the value of CHWs and are increasingly integrating them into care teams. Today, there are nearly 1,300 CHWs across Virginia, including approximately 290 certified CHWs who have completed substantial training supervision and education requirements.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CHWs are invaluable assets to the communities they serve. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal government recognized their importance and provided funding to support them. Now, it is crucial we ensure sustained long-term funding.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a logical solution: to bill CHW services through Virginia’s Medicaid program. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, the federal government has created </span><a href="https://www.astho.org/topic/brief/leveraging-medicaid-to-support-community-health-workers/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">several pathways</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for billing CHW supports through Medicaid. Currently, </span><a href="https://nashp.org/state-tracker/state-community-health-worker-policies/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">15 state Medicaid plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> authorize coverage for CHW services, which are designed to improve health outcomes and save program costs. Five states cover CHW services through Medicaid waivers, which allow states to test innovative ideas to improve health. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collaborating with Gov. Glenn Youngkin and his administration as well as members of the legislature on a comprehensive strategy is essential to secure this funding, which is vital for the viability of the CHW workforce and the health of our communities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a focus on improving the health and well-being of Virginians through access to high-quality health care coverage and services, the state’s Medicaid program already covers care from doctors and nurses. Including reimbursements for CHWs, who are often on these care teams, is the missing link.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a wise investment because we know CHW interventions work, and we have local data to prove it.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ballad Health was one of five health care organizations across the country to participate in a </span><a href="https://www.pcori.org/research-results/2019/expanding-use-impact-community-health-worker-program" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that examined the impact of CHWs. Researchers found patients who were connected to CHWs experienced 29% fewer hospital stays than patients who were not connected to them.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study mirrors </span><a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2020/february/penns-community-health-worker-program-yields-247-for-every-1-invested-annually-by-medicaid" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">previous research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that shows for every dollar invested in CHW programs, Medicaid payers see a $2.47 return on investment within a year, generated through reduced hospitalizations.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While calculating the costs of avoidable hospital visits can be hard to measure, helping patients access care outside of emergency rooms for non-emergency care can save people and our state millions of dollars. One analysis by </span><a href="https://www.vhi.org/Media/flyers/Potentially%20Avoidable%20ED%20Visits.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Health Information</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2020 showed the total cost of avoidable emergency room visits for symptoms like urinary tract infections, back problems and upper respiratory infections was more than $75 million, compared to $8 million for similar care at a primary care provider.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to reducing health care costs and improving patient care, CHWs are an important part of the solution. CHWs are making so much progress  in the commonwealth because they go above and beyond every day to support people and disrupt health disparities.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Mount Rogers health district, Grace Lowe works throughout the community sharing information about free NARCAN trainings, while also helping families connect with Medicaid, WIC and other important programs. You can regularly find her at local events and fairs because she is focused on building a foundation of trust when it comes to accessing health care and safety net resources.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than four hours away, CHW Emely Baez Salazar visits with Latino community members and encourages them to access health services at Health Brigade. Her outreach is helping connect dozens of new people with comprehensive care at the free clinic.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s CHWs know the challenges of their communities and are equipped to work with their local health care system to create solutions. I’m immensely grateful that they’re such a prominent part of our healthcare safety net. CHWs are essential, and it’s just as essential we find sustainable funding solutions to help them continue making progress. The health of Virginians depends on it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final guidelines, which have grown from a seven-page document to 27 pages, include suggestions on improving communication gaps between parents, teachers and school officials in emergency and non-emergency situations. Additional information was added to support school leaders with the best practices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guidelines continue to define “cellphone-free” education as “bell-to-bell,” meaning phones should be turned off and stored away from the first school bell until dismissal. The period includes lunchtime and breaks between classes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VDOE said many students wrote in asking to use their cellphones during lunch, but doubled down on its position that the phones distract students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is essential that students have the opportunity to develop face-to-face conversations and critical in-person communication skills during unstructured school hours,” the agency stated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final guidelines only provide exemptions for students with disabilities and English Learner students with a documented language barrier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to studies, students have used cellphones to browse the internet and social media apps, and message people during instructional time. Students have also used the devices to record events at schools and post them on various platforms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As proposed last month, the draft guidance includes age-appropriate cellphone restrictions in Virginia’s elementary and secondary public schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a parent determines an elementary student needs to bring a cellphone or personal electronic communication device to school, it must be stored, off, and away from the student during the school day. Students should not use cellphones in the school building or on the school grounds before or after school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In middle and high school, students should not have a readily available cellphone or personal electronic communication device during the bell-to-bell school day, the guidance states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Middle schools should establish local policies that determine cellphone and personal electronic communication device use within the school building or on school grounds outside of bell-to-bell,  the guidance stipulates, including before and after school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cellphones and personal electronic communication devices may be used on a high school campus before or after school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officials said Tuesday that a task force will also be established to support schools and division leaders in enhancing communications and handling school-based emergencies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This guidance from the Virginia Department of Education is an important step towards creating a healthier learning environment where students can receive a quality education free from harmful distractions,” said Gov. Glenn Youngkin in a statement, who thanked parents, students and school staff for their “substantive engagement” in the process and committed to continued discussions to refine the policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Department officials held several meetings with the public before drafting the guidelines. The public comment period ended on Sunday. While some have already adopted cellphone regulations, school boards are expected to adopt them by Jan. 1.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, VDOE will release an “Administrator’s Toolkit” to support school leaders in implementing their policies. No timetable was provided for when the microgrants are expected to be available for schools to raise awareness about the mental health impacts of cellphones and social media. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor allocated $500,000 from existing funds for the Departments of Education and Behavioral Health and Development Services to support the initiative.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are so thankful for the collaborative input from families, educators, and students on such a critical challenge for our young people,” said Superintendent of Public Instruction Lisa Coons in a statement. “Virginians helped us shape the final guidance and our implementation supports. We look forward to continuing to work with families and educators as we help ensure that every student can have a cellphone-free education.&#8221;</span></p>

Tidewater Virginia has some of the highest death rates among Black women for breast cancer in the nation. (Leah Small/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They are slightly less likely than white women to develop breast cancer but are about 42% more likely to die from it.</span> <a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3322/caac.21754" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Breast cancer deaths for all women in the U.S. have decreased</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but the mortality gap between Black and white women persists. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a group, Black women diagnosed before age 50 are 50% more likely to die from the disease than white women diagnosed before age 50.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, the situation is worse. The state has the nation’s </span><a href="https://www.evms.edu/research/centers_institutes_departments/leroy_t_canoles_jr_cancer_research_center/#:~:text=Breast%20cancer,breast%20cancer%20in%20her%20lifetime." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ninth highest breast cancer death rate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and is one of </span><a href="https://www.cancer.org/research/acs-research-news/breast-cancer-death-rates-are-highest-for-black-women-again.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">only four states in which Black women develop cancer at a higher rate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than white women, according to recent data from</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ​​the Leroy T. Canoles Jr. Cancer Research Center at Old Dominion University and the American Cancer Society. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s eastern Tidewater region, where Cade lives, is one of the ten metro areas in the U.S. with the highest number of Black women dying from breast cancer, a 2021 </span><a href="https://www.komen.org/wp-content/uploads/Landscape-Analysis-Exec-Summary.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report by Susan G. Komen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, Black women in Tidewater were 60% more likely to die of breast cancer than white women, up from 41% in 2014, according to data from Komen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suffolk and Chesapeake stand out for having the biggest gap between Black and white women in late-stage diagnosis and survival rates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February of 2021, before her pregnancy, Cade expressed her worries about the lump in her breast to a local radiologist, medical records show. But findings from a mammogram followed by a breast ultrasound didn’t indicate cancer, the physician said. Cade sought a second opinion and records show both physicians agreed that the lump wasn’t cancer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They instead connected the problem to Cade’s dense breast tissue. Breast tissue varies among women; breasts that are dense have more glandular and connective tissue than fat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They said you’re fine, it’s nothing to be concerned about,” Cade said. “They considered it … fibroglandular tissue, (and said) it is not unusual for it to get larger or to be more painful; it’s not cancerous.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dense breast tissue can </span><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-the-fda-ruling-about-dense-breasts-means-for-cancer-risk-and-screening/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prevent a mammogram from detecting cancer and can increase a woman’s overall cancer risk.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Physicians said that readings from both mammograms and breast ultrasounds were normal for Cade, but she was doubtful. She knew she had multiple risk factors linked to developing or dying from breast cancer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I asked questions like, why is it getting larger? Can I have a biopsy?” Cade said. “They didn&#8217;t want to do a biopsy despite (me) having dense breast tissue, despite me being a Black woman.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October 2022, Cade found out she was pregnant with her son, whom she calls her unexpected “miracle baby.” She worried more about the lump, which her OBGYN insisted be biopsied by a local surgeon. The biopsy revealed that it was cancerous at stage zero and could spread during pregnancy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Anger was one of my biggest emotions,” Cade said. “I knew something was wrong. I know my body and I knew this lump was a problem.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What is fueling the disparity?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reasons for the breast cancer mortality disparity are multifaceted. Studies show that tumor biology and the interplay of genetics and environmental factors explain part of the problem. Both factors partially explain why Black women are </span><a href="https://www.webmd.com/breast-cancer/features/racial-disparity-mtnbc-breast-cancer" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more likely to develop highly aggressive tumors and to be diagnosed at an earlier age,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> negatively impacting survivorship. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black women are also more likely to be obese, have heart disease, and to not breastfeed after pregnancy — </span><a href="https://www.bcrf.org/blog/black-women-and-breast-cancer-why-disparities-persist-and-how-end-them/#:~:text=Black%20women%20are%20statistically%20more,risk%20factors%20for%20breast%20cancer." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">all risk factors for breast cancer. </span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But other factors — including racism in medicine and systemic racism that drives high poverty among Black women, and the lack of insurance and access to quality breast health facilities — are also greatly to blame.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The differences in death rates are not explained by Black women having more aggressive tumors,” </span><a href="https://www.cancer.org/research/acs-research-news/breast-cancer-death-rates-are-highest-for-black-women-again.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said Rebecca Siegel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an American Cancer Society epidemiologist.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is time for health systems to take a really hard look at how they are treating Black women differently.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breast cancer deaths in Tidewater Virginia are driven significantly by “where a person lives and their race,” Komen wrote in its report. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of the problem is poor access to transportation tied to poverty, in an area connected by bridges and tolls, which often prevents Black women from seeking follow-up mammograms to diagnose suspected cancers, said Natasha Mmeje, a Komen spokesperson. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some progress has been made. New national guidance lowers the recommended age most women should start mammography, which helps early cancer detection. States that adopted Medicaid expansion earlier than Virginia have improved access to care for Back women, positively impacting cancer outcomes. And more scientific research is focused on finding out why Black women are less likely to survive a cancer diagnosis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fight to prevent more Black women from dying of breast cancer at disproportionate rates is on multiple fronts and more must be done, Mmeje said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Black women should have the same chance of surviving breast cancer as anyone else,” she said. “We must work together — researchers, lawmakers and key stakeholders — to decrease breast cancer disparities in the Black community.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Failings in medicine and science</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cade was rushed into an emergency lumpectomy in Hampton Roads to remove her tumor the same week her cancer was diagnosed in December 2022. But scans showed that the cancer had spread to another part of her left breast. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She consulted physicians at Virginia Commonwealth University Massey Cancer Center who said that the breast should be removed. They performed a mastectomy while Cade was four months pregnant and frightened for her life and her unborn baby. Surgeons removed her right breast in a later procedure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I remember being wheeled into that operating room, and I’m crying so hard,” Cade said. “I was just thinking about my child — I’ve wanted this child all of my life.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early cancer detection</span><a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/254500/9789241511940-eng.pdf?sequence=1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> improves chances of survival and often results in less invasive treatment.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> But Black women in the U.S. are far more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer at later stages — despite being </span><a href="https://www.komen.org/breast-cancer/screening/screening-disparities/#:~:text=In%202021%20(most%20recent%20data%20available)%2C%20Black%20women%20had,among%20white%20women%20%5B174%5D." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">screened for it at higher rates than other races.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Tidewater Virginia, Komen found that Black women have roughly the same rate of regular mammography screening as white women. And in about half of the cities Komen studied in the region — Newport News, Hampton and Portsmouth — white women are diagnosed with more late-stage cancers than Black women. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Black women are still dying disproportionately of breast cancer throughout the metro area. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Systemic racism is a huge part of why Black women are still dying [disproportionately], and that is regardless of the economic status for Black women,” Mmeje said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Komen report, undiagnosed women and breast cancer survivors in the area said they experienced discrimination while seeking care. Bias held by healthcare providers is part of the problem, though its impact is difficult to prove, said Arnethea Sutton, a breast cancer health equity researcher at Virginia Commonwealth University. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s what’s happening once women get to care — they’re not being treated fairly, and their process is being delayed or they’re not being listened to,” Sutton said. “Those are the kind of things we can’t capture in hospital metrics.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The history of racism in healthcare institutions has also slowed the development of treatments that could be more effective for Black women. The collective cultural memory in the Black community of medical wrongdoings, such as the Tuskegee syphilis study, has contributed to low participation in clinical trials by Black women. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And less health research has focused on women, and Black women in particular, than white men. To fill the information gap, the American Cancer Society is conducting what would be at completion the largest ever study on Black women and cancer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Cancer Society researchers aim to enroll at least 100,000 women from Virginia, 19 other states, and Washington D.C. for the </span><a href="https://voices.cancer.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voices of Black Women</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> study, which would shed more light on why Black women have some of the highest mortality rates for most cancers. The states represent where 90% of Black women live in the U.S. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Realizing that eastern Virginia is a breast cancer hotspot, The American Cancer Society partnered with Macon &amp; Joan Brock Health Sciences at Old Dominion University to recruit women in Hampton Roads for a pilot study in 2023. Atlanta was another pilot site. A target of 3,000 participants has been set for Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers aim to gather a wide range of environmental, behavioral and health data from a cohort of women ages 25 to 55, over 30 years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This study really puts us in an extremely powerful position to be able to understand cancer and other health outcomes in black women, and then identify opportunities to intervene in a way that will be successful for black women,” said study co-investigator Alpa Patel.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Early detection is key</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cade’s grandmother, Judy Hall, died from breast cancer at the age of 64. Cade had worried for years that breast cancer could run in her family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My anxiety was through the roof, I would constantly think about the possibility of getting cancer, passing away from cancer,” Cade said. “Then for it to actually happen, it just takes a toll thinking about it constantly.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39954" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:169px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/10/science-policy-advancements-could-curb-disproportionate-breast-cancer-deaths-in-tidewater/grandmother/" rel="attachment wp-att-39954"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-39954 size-medium" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Grandmother-169x300.jpg" alt="" width="169" height="300" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Grandmother-169x300.jpg 169w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Grandmother-576x1024.jpg 576w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Grandmother-768x1365.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Grandmother-864x1536.jpg 864w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Grandmother.jpg 1152w" sizes="(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Tasha Cade, right, with her grandmother Judy Hall, left, who died of breast cancer. (Contributed photo)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cade began receiving mammograms in her late 30s, slightly earlier than the recommended age of 40, due to her family history. Her employer’s insurance plan partially covered the early screenings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But many Black women face significant insurance and financial hurdles to receiving preventive screening and testing, diagnostics and treatment — all factors that impact survivorship. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Screening for breast cancer at an earlier age is even more impactful for Black women, who tend to develop breast cancer younger. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April, The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a leading independent panel of experts, lowered its recommendation on when women should start biennial mammography screening from age 50 to 40, and said the change would improve early detection for Black women. The panel had previously recommended that women at high risk of breast cancer consider screening earlier than 50.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the Affordable Care Act, USPSTF recommendations guide</span><a href="https://www.acr.org/-/media/ACR/Files/Advocacy/AIA/Annual-Meeting--2019--PALS-TPsdoc.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> insurance coverage for mammograms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and other preventive screenings. But nearly all insurers are currently required to fully cover more frequent, annual mammograms, for women 40 and older, under a</span><a href="https://preventcancer.org/news/prevent-cancer-foundation-responds-to-new-breast-cancer-screening-guidelines-issued-by-the-u-s-preventive-services-task-force/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> federal law up for renewal in 2026</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Komen and other advocacy organizations favor annual screening.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guideline changes don’t fully address the needs of Black women, said Ifeoma Udoh, a policy advisor for the </span><a href="https://bwhi.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Women’s Health Imperative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re suffering from late-[stage] diagnoses — we’re getting screening too late,” Udoh said. “We have 35-year-olds being diagnosed with breast cancer, particularly if there’s some genetic predisposition.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women should speak to their primary care physicians about their family history of breast cancer and ask about genetic testing. High risk women may benefit from screening as early as age 30, even if genetic testing is negative, said Rachel Burke, a professor of surgery at ODU. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women experiencing barriers to screening, diagnosis or treatment can contact</span><a href="https://www.komen.org/support-resources/patient-care-center/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Komen patient navigators </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">for information about health services and financial resources. Women without insurance who are low income are eligible for free or low-cost breast cancer screening and diagnostics under the </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/breast-cervical-cancer-screening/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> And patients diagnosed through the NBCCED may be eligible for Medicaid coverage for treatment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patients who feel they are receiving poor treatment should seek a second opinion or find a new provider, Cade said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Women must feel empowered to advocate for their health,” she said. “Your voice matters in every healthcare conversation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In May of 2023, Cade gave birth to a healthy son. She is now cancer free. </span></p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Abortion</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the only state in the South that hasn’t restricted abortion access since the Supreme Court overturned Roe. v Wade in 2022, which made abortion a federal right, Virginia is a key player in the country’s reproductive health landscape. By dismantling Roe v Wade, the nation’s highest court laid the groundwork for each state to restrict or enhance access to abortion; a spate of state bans on abortion have since emerged, with 14 states making the procedure illegal. Abortion remains legal in Virginia and state Democrats will push to enshrine it as a right in the commonwealth’s constitution next year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Republican candidates in Virginia’s congressional races assert that abortion access should be determined at the state level. In District 2, Republican incumbent U.S. Rep. Jenn Kiggans, a Navy veteran, nurse and former member of the state senate, has “consistently advocated for women to choose life, but respects exceptions for rape, incest, and life of the mother,” according to her campaign </span><a href="https://jenforcongress.com/issues/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Democratic challenger Missy Cotter Smasal, who is also a Navy veteran as well as the director of a nonprofit focused on women veterans, </span><a href="https://fb.watch/uhpo6DTiSN/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declared herself</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “the only pro-choice Navy veteran in this race.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 7, anchored in Prince William County but also spanning rural parts of the state, Spotsylvania attorney and former Green Beret Derrick Anderson, a Republican, is challenging career military officer and Democrat Eugene Vindman for the seat currently occupied by Abigail Spanberger, who is running for governor next year. Anderson has expressed support for the overturn of Roe and </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/DerrickAndersonforVA/videos/my-life-story-is-pro-life-and-thats-how-i-will-serve-in-congress-my-mother-got-p/414067620643367/?locale=ms_MY" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">called himself “pro-life” while sharing on social media</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that his mother had him as a single parent at 17 years old. Vindman plans to support </span><a href="https://vindmanforcongress.com/issues/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">access to abortions and contraception along with in vitro fertilization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 10, anchored in Loudoun County, Democratic state Sen. Suhas Subramanyam is running against Republican Mike Clancy to fill Rep. Jennifer Wexton’s seat. Wexton will not seek reelection due to a health issue, and endorsed Subramanyam during his democratic primary. He has supported an effort to </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SJ255" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">enshrine abortion protections into Virginia’s constitution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and plans to support federal protections. Clancy said that he “does not support federal action on abortion.” His campaign website lists “respect life” as a campaign issue and notes his support for resources for pregnant people and families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 9, incumbent Rep. Morgan Griffith faces Democratic challenger Karen Baker, a lawyer-turned-nurse. Griffith has voted against congressional efforts to protect abortion access and </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=402684" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Roe v. Wade had “produced decades of tragedy.” Baker wrote on her campaign website that “women’s choices must be respected.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, who is seeking reelection, has co-sponsored the </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/kaine-others-reintroduce-reproductive-freedom-for-all-act/article_f6cbd514-a8a7-11ed-8ac8-e388ae499856.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reproductive Freedom For All Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would protect access federally, now that Roe has been overturned. His Republican challenger, retired Navy veteran Hung Cao, told Virginia Mercury this summer that he </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/17/they-dont-like-abortion-but-kaines-gop-challengers-say-they-wont-seek-a-federal-ban/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">won’t support a federal abortion ban</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He has also </span><a href="https://www.hungforva.com/right-to-life/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">called himself “pro-life.” </span></a></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Housing </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing is an issue people experience practically and constantly, amid paying rent or mortgages. Local governments handle approvals or rejections of developments and craft zoning laws that guide development potential. But state and federal lawmakers have roles to play as well — largely through funding mechanisms or taking action where housing intersects with other policy platforms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While many congressional candidates this year don’t have housing policy outlined on their websites, some have been talking about how they plan to help states and local governments from the federal level. The Mercury reached out to others for more details on what they would do to help with housing supply and affordability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 2, Incumbent Rep. Jen Kiggans did not respond to inquiry for more details on housing policy by the time of this publication, though during her time in the state legislature as a senator, she voted in favor of the </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+vot+SV0271HB1889+HB1889" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her challenger, Democrat Missy Cotter Smasal, acknowledged the Mercury’s request for comment but did not follow through with a response in time for this publication. Her website touches on housing policy while addressing the economy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We need to stop the price gouging on groceries, and stop massive corporations from buying up houses and raising rent,” she wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 7, Democratic candidate Eugene Vindman expressed support for building more homes that middle-class families can purchase and “support programs that help first-time homebuyers buy a house.” He added that he’s concerned about out-of-state corporations buying homes that they then sell or rent at higher prices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Congress, I will work to take on these speculators who are putting regular people&#8217;s American dream out of reach,” he said in an email. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican candidate Derrick Anderson said he’s going to focus initially on how Congress can help reduce inflation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The first thing I’d do is pass a federal balanced budget amendment – ridiculous inflationary spending drove up housing prices (and grocery costs, gas costs, etc),” he said in an email. “Let’s stop the spending and get inflation down for the sake of Virginians who are struggling to get by.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 10, Republican Mike Clancy could not be reached for comment by the time of this publication. His campaign website doesn’t include housing policy, but it does stress his goal of helping to reduce inflation and stimulate the economy by “unleashing American innovation” and energy as well as reducing regulations on small businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Suhas Subramanyam’s campaign replied to The Mercury’s inquiry but did not follow through with his housing policy plans should he become a congressman before publication. He has supported affordability measures as a state senator: This year he </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB597" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">co-sponsored a bill </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to allow more Virginian localities to utilize Low Income Housing Tax Credits when approving developments, but it was vetoed by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 9, Democratic challenger Karen Baker supports expansion of tax credits that can help spur construction of affordable housing available to various levels of area median income. She also wants to</span><a href="https://www.bakerforva9th.com/affordable-housing" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “work on tailored solutions that address the specific needs of rural communities,”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like the Southwest Virginia ones she seeks to represent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his tenure as representative, Morgan Griffith has </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=402287" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">supported funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> appropriations to his district meant to help with affordable housing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine has cited his early-career experience as a fair housing lawyer before he went into politics. As a member of congress, he pointed to a bill he co-sponsored, the </span><a href="https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/klobuchar-kaine-introduce-legislation-to-address-nationwide-housing-shortage" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing Supply and Affordability Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would create a grant program for state and local governments to tap into. He’s also been involved with the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/2797" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low-Income First-Time Homebuyers Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would establish fixed-rate 20 year mortgages for first-time buyers whose income doesn’t exceed a certain amount. Both bills have been introduced multiple times but have yet to become law. Kaine also supports expansions to Low Income Housing Tax Credits, which helps increase affordable housing supply. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine’s opponent, Hung Cao, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/how-kamala-harris-new-policy-plan-could-impact-housing-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">echoes a stance of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump that ties housing issues to the U.S.-Mexico border</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“First and foremost, we need to secure the border,” Cao said in an email to The Mercury. “Everything that’s going wrong in our country right now is a direct result of our wide-open southern border. Housing costs are at an all-time high because there&#8217;s millions who were not here a few years ago for which we need to provide housing.” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Guns</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congress remains at a standstill as lawmakers fiercely debate the future of gun rights in America, with proponents of stricter gun control measures clashing with staunch defenders of the Second Amendment. Amid a surge in mass shootings and growing public outcry, both sides are digging in, setting the stage for what will likely be another defining battle over gun laws as the nation is headed toward the 2024 presidential election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Senate, U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., who was governor of Virginia when the deadly mass shooting at Virginia Tech took place in 2007, co-sponsored the Virginia Plan to Reduce Gun Violence, which he said would enact the same gun safety provisions passed by the Democratic-controlled Virginia General Assembly in 2020 at the federal level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hung Cao, Kaine’s Republican opponent, strictly opposes further legislation that he believes would infringe Second Amendment rights. Instead, Cao proposes that gun-related violence to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Prosecutors who refuse to enforce the law must be held accountable, the retired U.S. Navy captain said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia’s 2nd Congressional District, U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, in 2023 received a 100% rating by Gun Owners of America (GOA), a national gun rights organization, and a 92% rating by the National Rifle Association (NRA) in the previous year. While in the Virginia legislature, Kiggans has voted against universal background checks, expanding red flag laws that take guns out of the hands of domestic abusers and those who pose a threat to Virginians, and against prohibiting guns in schools and childcare centers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Missy Cotter Smasal, Kiggans’ Democratic opponent, states on her campaign website that she is committed to legislation seeking to prevent gun violence, create safer communities, and prevent veteran suicide. Smasal said that there are “commonsense measures supported by large majorities of Virginians” that can make Virginia’s neighborhoods safer while also protecting individual rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 7, Derrick Anderson, the Republican nominee, has stated that Second Amendment rights are sacred and shall not be infringed upon. As a former special forces Green Beret, Anderson vows to be “a strong advocate for gun owners in the halls of Congress.” Earlier this year, the Republican turned to the social media platform X, where </span><a href="https://x.com/DerrickforVA/status/1774127722647687559" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">he said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Americans have to “stand up for and protect our 2nd Amendment rights.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eugene Vindman, a former career military officer and the Democratic nominee, supports gun safety measures such as background checks and red flag laws to keep guns out of the hands of criminals, the mentally ill, and others who might cause harm. While he believes in the right of law-abiding gun owners to own firearms, Vindman also pushes for more legislation ensuring public safety. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, the incumbent in District 9, is a strong advocate for Second Amendment rights. Griffith said in a statement to The Mercury that he does not support government-mandated registrations of guns but that he backs harsher penalties for offenders who “abuse the right to have guns” by committing felonious crimes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Karen Baker, Griffith’s opponent and a gun owner, said she backs rigorous gun safety training for children in school. She is also pushing for enhanced gun safety laws, including tax credits for trigger locks, and she has called for enhanced mental health services for troubled individuals, and a legal mechanism to manage early reports of suspicious behaviors involving non-imminent ideation of shootings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the state in District 10, constitutional lawyer Mike Clancy, the Republican nominee, has vowed to defend Americans’ constitutional rights without exception, including the Second Amendment right to bear arms. Instead of regulating gun ownership. Clancy is pushing for legislation to fully fund law enforcement to ensure law enforcement has the training and equipment to protect Virginia’s communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his time in Virginia’s state legislature, Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, Clancy’s opponent, has actively supported several gun safety laws, including </span><a href="https://www.suhasforvirginia.com/press-and-media/key-gun-violence-prevention-bills-from-senator-subramanyam-vetoed-by-gun-lobby-backed-governor" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">several measures which passed the General Assembly just this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, two of which were signed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican. Suhas told The Mercury he believes America can achieve serious progress on this issue while respecting the Second Amendment, and without undermining the rights of responsible gun owners.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Education/Project 2025</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With divergent calls from some to eliminate the U.S. Department of Education and from others to improve teacher pay, public education is a top matter for voters in Virginia and across the nation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a Pew Research Center </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2024/04/23/what-are-americans-top-foreign-policy-priorities/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published in April, half of the Americans surveyed said that public K-12 education is going in the wrong direction. Some believe that schools should spend more time on core academic subjects. At the same time, communities, including those in Virginia, are sparring over what is taught in schools, particularly history, and gauging if students are falling behind in their studies and how to address that challenge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schools are also facing confrontation from parents over social issues, such as the types of books that are allowed in schools and the treatment of transgender students. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of these education issues and recommendations to address them are outlined in </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/04/what-could-project-2025-mean-for-education-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Project 2025</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — a conservative plan for how the country should operate if a Republican wins the White House. Some support the plan and others fear it could derail previous efforts to improve public education in Virginia.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="AKFt5DoOMp"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/04/what-could-project-2025-mean-for-education-in-virginia/">What could Project 2025 mean for education in Virginia?</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the state’s District 2 congressional race, Republican nominee and incumbent Jen Kiggans has publicly supported</span><a href="https://jenforcongress.com/issues/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> prioritizing students&#8217; safety and security</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and equipping teachers with tools and resources to improve student outcomes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She voted for the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/5" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parents Bills of Rights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a measure to “ensure the rights of parents are honored in public schools” and stands against critical race theory, a graduate-level framework that focuses on racial inequity and has not been found in Virginia curricula.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like the authors of Project 2025 and Kiggans, the Republican nominee for the District 10 seat Mike Clancy said he supports school choice. </span></p>
<p>Democratic nominee Eugene Vindman, in District 7, said he opposes book bans and the project, which he <a class="c-link" href="https://dailyprogress.com/opinion/column/eugene-vindman-project-2025-is-a-threat-to-democracy/article_709f3f3a-6a2a-11ef-927e-b310eb440bd5.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://dailyprogress.com/opinion/column/eugene-vindman-project-2025-is-a-threat-to-democracy/article_709f3f3a-6a2a-11ef-927e-b310eb440bd5.html" data-sk="tooltip_parent">sa</a>id his opponent and Republican nominee Derrick Anderson has failed to denounce.</p>
<p>Anderson said Vindman is “lying” and denied supporting the project&#8217;s proposal to eliminate the U.S. Department of <span class="c-mrkdwn__highlight">Education</span>.</p>
<p>He said he supports helping students in his home district “succeed” and will advocate for ensuring that “test scores go up and conflicts go down.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 9, Karen Baker, the democratic nominee, said she supports strengthening public schools, much like Vindman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Baker’s </span><a href="https://www.bakerforva9th.com/issues" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">campaign website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, she supports making universal preschool “a reality for all families” in Southwest Virginia. She also supports investing in vocational education and making it accessible to the area. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, the Democratic nominee in District 10, said if elected, he will work to expand Pre-K, access to “critical“ job training into apprentice programs, and support providing resources to local schools to close the pandemic, learning loss gap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He told the Mercury that if the recommendations for Project 2025 were implemented, it would “devastate” Virginia’s public education system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We must do the opposite: invest in our schools, support our parents and teachers, and make college and postgraduate education affordable,” Subramanyam’s campaign said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Environment/Climate</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic candidates in Virginia’s congressional races largely have expressed the desire to address climate change by transitioning to zero-carbon generation sources. Some candidates differentiate themselves, like District 3 incumbent U.S. Rep. Bobby </span><a href="https://www.bobbyscottforcongress.com/the-scott-record" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who’s advocated for funding Norfolk’s flood wall to reduce sea level rise damage. District 6 contender Ken </span><a href="https://www.kenmitchellforvirginia.com/issues" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitchell</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> highlighted a need to “transition public investments away from propping up fossil fuel companies” on his campaign site, while District 11 incumbent U.S. Rep. Gerry </span><a href="https://gerryconnolly.com/issues/environment/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connolly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has said he’s an advocate for environmental justice, an environmental lens that amplifies the voices and needs of overlooked and overburdened communities during development that could impact their area. District 9 candidate Karen </span><a href="https://www.bakerforva9th.com/coal-miners" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baker </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">doesn’t address climate change on her website, but highlights a need to protect coal miners’ health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the aisle, Republican congressional candidates also mostly fall in line with each other’s environmental policy views by advocating for  </span><a href="https://www.mikeclancyforcongress.com/services-5" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reducing regulations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.hungforva.com/enviornment/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">energy independence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or promoting energy sources stemming from </span><a href="https://cline.house.gov/issues/energy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fossil fuels</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://sitkaforcongress.com/on-the-issues" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nuclear</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

Some environmental groups say the bill includes some concessions for continued natural gas use. Whichever party gains majority control of Congress could determine the fate of that bill.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Election integrity</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concerns over election integrity and the potential for voter fraud have sparked a renewed focus in Congress, as lawmakers from both parties debate how best to safeguard the democratic process. With allegations of fraudulent voting making headlines in recent election cycles, the issue has become a political flashpoint. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some legislators call for stricter voting regulations to prevent potential abuse, others argue that such measures could suppress voter participation. As the 2024 election approaches, members of Congress are crafting new policies aimed at ensuring fair elections while addressing public concerns over security and accessibility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the U.S. Senate, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., has carried legislation such as the Freedom to Vote Act, which would implement provisions like automatic voter registration, same-day and Election Day voter registration, online voter registration, and no-excuse mail voting. Kaine has also co-sponsored the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which seeks to restore and update crucial protections against voting discrimination that were weakened by recent Supreme Court decisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine’s Republican opponent Hung Cao, a retired U.S. Navy captain who is backed by former President Donald Trump, has proposed few legislative means to secure the electoral process beyond a universal requirement for providing a voter ID in order to cast a ballot. But he said in a statement to The Mercury that “the only way to have election integrity is to have people watch the polls.” Cao has also suggested that the U.S. hold elections like the ones he witnessed in Iraq and Afghanistan, where people vote with their finger and blue ink. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In July, U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, who represents House District 2, voted in support of the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr8281/BILLS-118hr8281rh.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which passed in the House of Representatives by a 221-198 vote. Advocates of the SAVE Act say it would ensure that only citizens can vote in federal elections, partly by making it mandatory for states to obtain proof of citizenship to register voters and also requiring states to purge noncitizens from voter rolls. But President Joe Biden has vowed to veto the measure, stating that it would make it more difficult for eligible voters to register and increase “the risk that eligible voters are purged from voter rolls.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiggans’ Democratic challenger Missy Cotter Smasal, who previously mounted an unsuccessful campaign in Virginia’s 8th Senate District, has talked little about election integrity legislation. But the U.S. Navy veteran has attacked her Republican opponent for being  a “big supporter of President Trump” for backing “Big Lie” conspiracy theorists in Virginia’s state legislature by being one of </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/02/24/virginia-youngkin-tax-cuts-house-senate/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">only four Senators to vote for an audit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the 2020 election that would have cost Virginia taxpayers $70 million.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Derrick Anderson, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">former special forces Green Beret and the Republican nominee in District 7, has talked little publically about election integrity and he offers no clues about his views on his campaign website, but in </span><a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/government-politics/elections/derrick-anderson-talks-biden-the-border-and-inflation-ahead-of-tuesdays-gop-primary/article_a009bd2a-2837-11ef-9cbd-0f478e969dbd.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with The Daily Progress he acknowledged that Joe Biden is the legitimate president.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If elected, Anderson’s Democratic opponent Eugene Vindman, the twin brother of anti-Trump whistleblower Alexander Vindman, has vowed to work to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and strengthen protections for election workers, “so that anyone who threatens a poll volunteer or election official in an attempt to undermine our vote is held accountable.” Vindman, whose family emigrated to the United States from the former Soviet Union, has also warned against downplaying the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, which he blamed on a pro-Trump movement that did not recognize the nation’s norms of peaceful transfer of power and that he said undermines elections across the country to this day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, the incumbent in District 9, in 2023 sponsored the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/4460" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No Vote for Non-Citizens Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, seeking to ensure only eligible American citizens may participate in federal elections. The bill, which is still moving through the House, withholds some federal dollars that go to localities that allow non-citizens to vote in their elections. Griffith also voted for the SAVE Act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Karen Baker, Griffith’s opponent, told The Mercury that Republicans have failed to provide any evidence of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election and therefore there is no reason to believe that this year’s election will be different. Baker also stated that fears of undocumented immigrants voting are generated to induce distrust of election integrity but are absolutely without basis, and she has criticized Griffith for refusing to state that he will accept the outcome of the 2024 presidential election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Mike Clancy, an attorney from Loudoun County and the Republican nominee in District 10, does not list election integrity as one of his legislative priorities on his campaign website, he has been outspoken on social media about strengthening election laws. “Congress must pass the SAVE Act,” Clancy </span><a href="https://x.com/MikeClancyVA/status/1811031488923586986" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said on X</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in July. “Only U.S. citizens should be voting in our elections.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, Clancy’s opponent and a strict opponent of the SAVE Act, believes that “democracy is under attack” in America. The son of Indian immigrants, Subramanyam has vowed to continue to fight against “restrictive voter ID laws that are designed to suppress the vote, protect early voting to ensure greater access to the polls, and combat political gerrymandering.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Immigration</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Americans find that more migrants are turning to the United States for employment opportunities or to escape violent conflict in their home countries, among other reasons, they are increasingly interested in candidates&#8217; views on immigration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">America has become one of the most prominent destinations for migrants. However, over several years, many migrants have entered the country illegally, prompting backlash. At the same time, migrants have also been a staple of America’s workforce, including in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the </span><a href="https://map.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/locations/virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Immigration Council</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, immigrants comprised about 12.6% of Virginia’s total population in 2022, and 16.2% of Virginia&#8217;s labor force.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Hr7omrdD9o"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/08/convention-delegates-virginia-voters-reflect-on-immigration-policy-ahead-of-presidential-election/">Convention delegates, Virginia voters reflect on immigration policy ahead of presidential election</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the District 9 race, Republican nominee and incumbent Morgan Griffith said immigrants are welcome to come to the United States “legally” and share in the “American dream,&#8221; but supports “cracking down” on illegal immigration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While criticizing the House for ducking its responsibility, Democratic nominee Karen Baker in District 9 said Congress needs to pass comprehensive immigration reform. She said she supports the Senate&#8217;s template for more border control agents and asylum officers and advocates for a DACA bill to protect children who have lived in the U.S. their entire lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the District 2 race, Jen Kiggans’ campaign said the Republican nominee and incumbent voted for legislation to increase security at the U.S. border by ensuring that federal immigration officials have the training and resources to stop the influx of illegal immigration, drugs and crime into the U.S. The measure has remained in the Senate since last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiggans supports strict enforcement of existing federal immigration laws and holding President Joe Biden’s administration accountable. She also backed legislation to prevent the administration from using National Parks to house illegal immigrants.</span></p>
<p>Derrick Anderson, the Republican nominee for the District 7 seat, said he <a class="c-link" href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/government-politics/elections/derrick-anderson-talks-biden-the-border-and-inflation-ahead-of-tuesdays-gop-primary/article_a009bd2a-2837-11ef-9cbd-0f478e969dbd.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/government-politics/elections/derrick-anderson-talks-biden-the-border-and-inflation-ahead-of-tuesdays-gop-primary/article_a009bd2a-2837-11ef-9cbd-0f478e969dbd.html" data-sk="tooltip_parent">supports</a> shutting down the border.</p>
<p>“It’s clear that the crisis at the border is hurting people right here in Virginia’s 7th District,” Anderson said in a statement. “Drugs, fentanyl, human trafficking – we need a serious change. We need to secure the border.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, the Democratic nominee in District 10, said with the U.S. immigration system being “broken,” he supports the country taking a comprehensive approach to the problem by starting with securing the border and ensuring that people who are doing “the right things the right way and contributing to our economy“ have a path to citizenship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said the country must also fix its “broken” asylum system.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Foreign policy (Israel-Hamas conflict, China, Ukraine)</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Virginia voters are following their congressional candidates&#8217; views on common issues in the U.S., they are also considering their responses to global conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a Pew Research Center </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2024/04/23/what-are-americans-top-foreign-policy-priorities/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that was completed in April, two of the most important issues to Americans are limiting the powers of China and finding a solution to the Israel-Hamas conflict.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Americans are also interested in limiting Russia’s powers following its invasion of Ukraine in Feb. 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said he takes pride in the fact that he is among a wide slate of lawmakers President Vladimir Putin of Russia permanently banned from visiting Russia in response to his record of standing against Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine two years ago. Kaine has voted for aid to Ukraine, and earlier this year he helped pass a supplemental package that included support for the country to defend its sovereignty. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine also said he views the U.S.-China relationship as the most consequential bilateral relationship of the century. Kaine voted to pass the </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/09/fact-sheet-chips-and-science-act-will-lower-costs-create-jobs-strengthen-supply-chains-and-counter-china/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CHIPS and Science Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> designed to outcompete China by shoring up domestic supply chains and bringing manufacturing back to America. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Hamas terrorists attacked Israeli territories on Oct. 7, 2023, Kaine has worked with Democrats, Republicans, and the Biden administration to ensure that Israel has defensive support. But Kaine has also called for a reduction of civilian casualties, supported the safe and swift delivery of humanitarian assistance to civilians in Gaza and the West Bank, and for long-term solutions to allow Palestinians and Israelis to live alongside each other in peace.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine’s Republican opponent and former U.S. Navy captain Hung Cao in a statement criticized the Biden administration and Congress for giving “blanket amounts of money” towards Ukraine’s defense effort, alleging the financial support instead helps fund Ukraine’s retired workers pension plans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cao considers China an “existential threat” to the United States, and he has further called for the continued support of Israel, which he considers one of the United States’ closest allies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Jen Kiggans’ campaign, the District 2 Republican nominee and incumbent supports legislation to impose sanctions against China for its responsibility in the fentanyl crisis and </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/22/cosponsors" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prevent selling any petroleum to Chinese Communist Party-controlled entities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her campaign also said she prioritizes protecting American jobs and intellectual property from being stolen by the CCP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Derrick Anderson, the Republican nominee in District 7 and a former special forces Green Beret with six tours of duty overseas, including Afghanistan, Iraq, and various countries throughout the Middle East, told the </span><a href="https://jewishinsider.com/2024/04/virginia-congressional-candidate-derrick-anderson-military/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Jewish Insider”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in an interview in April that Congress needs to move quickly to provide additional aid to the Jewish state in its war against Hamas. He added that he was skeptical of sending more U.S. funds to the Palestinians, noting that other countries are providing aid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Anderson, his Democratic opponent Eugene Vindman, also a veteran, called for continued support for Israel, while asking that the U.S. continue to ensure that all the hostages — including Americans — are returned safe and sound to their families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman has also pushed for the continued support of Ukraine in both military and economic terms, and for taking on China&#8217;s state-directed economic system, which he said unfairly competes in the market and compromises America’s national security. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, voted for the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2022, which allowed the lending and lease of American defense material to the country in its defense of the Russian invasion, he also also voted to block similar legislation last year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griffith </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=403045" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has called</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> China a “dangerous, power-hungry actor” over the country’s territorial claims in the South China Sea, as well as its escalating efforts to control Taiwan, while </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=403086" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criticizing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> President Joe Biden’s decision to hold an arms shipment to Israel last spring. Griffith also said that America’s dealings with other countries must be driven by a careful analysis of what best serves the United States and its citizens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In relation to the conflict between Israel and Hamas, Karen Baker, Griffith’s Democratic opponent, has pointed out that while she acknowledged Israel’s right to exist, there are “bad acts on both sides.” Baker has also endorsed the continued financial and military support of Ukraine by the United States, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, the Democratic nominee in District 10, said he supports the U.S. in opposing Russia leader Vladimir Putin&#8217;s territorial ambitions in Europe and standing up to China, which is “violating international law and illegally dumping goods to prop up their economy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also supports the CHIPS Act, which helped to boost domestic research and manufacturing of semiconductor chips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the Israel-Hamas war, Subramanyam said he supports the U.S. returning hostages, especially  American citizens, and helping to rebuild communities affected by the war.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also supports a two-state solution, adding that Hamas cannot be one of the states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The human lives lost in this conflict have been devastating for all sides,” Subramanyam said in a statement. “I have visited the region, including the areas of Israel that were attacked, and made good friends there. I want to see an end to the war and a long-term path to peace.”</span></p>

<p>Dodge, who now lives in Austin, Texas, has built up a loyal base of patients, including many who are part of military families. But when any of them move out of Texas, she has to stop treating them, even via telehealth, unless she gets a license to practice in that state.</p>
<p>“I do my best and collaborate with them, but they already feel alone,” Dodge told Stateline. “I wonder, ‘Why can’t I be the glue? Why can’t I step over state lines and provide the care that they deserve?’”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aapa.org/about/what-is-a-pa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Physician assistants</a>, commonly known as PAs, are licensed clinicians who have a master’s degree and can practice in a range of specialties. Their three years of training typically includes 3,000 hours of direct patient care, and they are an increasingly critical part of the health care workforce, which in many states isn’t keeping pace with a growing and aging population.</p>

<p>By 2028, the nation as a whole will be short some 100,000 critical health care workers — doctors, nurses and home health aides — according to a new <a href="https://www.mercer.com/assets/us/en_us/shared-assets/local/attachments/pdf-us-2024-future-of-us-healthcare-industry-labor-market-projections-by-2028.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> from Mercer, a management consulting firm.</p>
<p>The looming shortage is one reason why 13 states have joined the <a href="https://www.pacompact.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PA Licensure Compact,</a> a multistate agreement that allows PAs to practice in any participating state, without having to get an additional license.</p>
<p><a href="https://delcode.delaware.gov/title24/c017b/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delaware</a>, <a href="https://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title58/Chapter70C/58-70c-S111.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Utah</a>, and <a href="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2023/related/acts/81.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wisconsin</a> enacted the legislation in 2023. <a href="https://fastdemocracy.com/bill-search/co/2024A/bills/COB00006122/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colorado</a>, <a href="https://www.billtrack50.com/billdetail/1653930" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maine</a>, <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/text.php?number=HF5247&amp;type=bill&amp;version=4&amp;session=ls93&amp;session_year=2024&amp;session_number=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minnesota</a>, <a href="https://nebraskalegislature.gov/bills/view_bill.php?DocumentID=55524" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nebraska</a>, <a href="http://www.oklegislature.gov/BillInfo.aspx?Bill=hb3781&amp;Session=2400" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oklahoma</a>, <a href="https://www.billtrack50.com/billdetail/1682753" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tennessee</a>, <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB324" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virginia</a>, <a href="https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bill%20Reports/Senate/5815%20SBR%20HLTC%20OC%2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington</a> and <a href="http://www.wvlegislature.gov/Bill_Status/bills_text.cfm?billdoc=sb667%20sub1.htm&amp;yr=2024&amp;sesstype=RS&amp;i=667" target="_blank" rel="noopener">West Virginia</a> followed suit this year. <a href="https://search-prod.lis.state.oh.us/api/v2/general_assembly_135/legislation/sb28/05_EN/pdf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ohio</a> became the <a href="https://www.aapa.org/news-central/2024/07/pa-licensure-compact-update-ohio-becomes-thirteenth-state-to-enter-pa-compact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest state</a> to enact it in July.</p>
<p>The PA compact is one of several that have emerged over the past several years, especially since the expansion of telehealth services during the COVID-19 pandemic. There are <a href="https://telehealth.hhs.gov/licensure/licensure-compacts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">similar compacts</a> for doctors, nurses, occupational therapists and <a href="https://stateline.org/2024/05/28/amid-mental-health-crisis-new-compact-allows-social-workers-to-practice-across-state-lines/" target="_blank">social workers</a>.</p>
<p>One challenge has been completing the background checks required for providers who want to practice under the compacts. For example, Pennsylvania’s participation in the nursing and medical licensure compacts was <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/government-politics/dojs-silence-on-background-checks-source-of-ongoing-frustration-for-pennsylvania-nurses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed</a> as the FBI denied the state access to its fingerprint database. They later <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/briefs/house-panel-passes-background-check-bill-for-pennsylvania-nurses-and-doctors-to-practice-in-other-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached an agreement</a> on how to move forward.</p>
<p>The PA compact grants a “privilege to practice,” allowing PAs to practice in participating states without getting an additional license. The nursing compact gives nurses a <a href="https://www.nursecompact.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multistate</a> license, while the physician licensure compact just <a href="https://www.imlcc.org/a-faster-pathway-to-physician-licensure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expedites</a> the licensing process.</p>
<div class=" newsroomBlockQuoteContainer ">
<div class="newsroomBlockQuoteSVGContainer">Some large states, such as California and New York, don’t participate in compacts for doctors, nurses, social workers or PAs. Some state lawmakers in those states say joining interstate compacts would reduce the quality of their states’ health care workforces, because other states require lower standards of education and training.</div>
</div>
<p>“We are proud that New York’s high standards have resulted in our state being an international destination in health care,” New York Democratic Assemblymember Deborah Glick <a href="https://www.timesunion.com/opinion/article/Commentary-An-interstate-compact-is-not-the-way-17711461.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote in an op-ed</a> last year for the Times Union newspaper in Albany. “While it’s possible that it may make sense at some point for New York to join a licensure compact, we should pause before we allow a quick fix to lower New York’s standards.”</p>
<p>In other states, <a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/scope-practice/scope-practice-texas-how-texas-medical-association-and-ama-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">such as Texas</a>, doctors who have succeeded in limiting the “scope of practice” of Texas PAs oppose the compact because they believe it might allow out-of-state PAs to go beyond those limits for their patients who reside in Texas. The American Medical Association and its state affiliates argue that allowing PAs to provide care traditionally provided by physicians puts patients at risk.</p>
<p>Dr. G. Ray Callas, president of the Texas Medical Association, said he values the role that physician assistants play in the health care system, but that his organization objects to any measure that might “give PAs authority to do more in health care than they are trained to do.”</p>
<p>“TMA is not opposed to appropriate, expedited licensure, but we do oppose these compacts when they expand scope of practice and create a patient safety issue, lowering the standard of care in Texas,” Callas said in a statement.</p>
<p>Supporters of the compact say that fear is unfounded, and that the agreement has no effect on state scope of practice rules. The model legislation for the compact specifies that PAs who treat patients in another state can only do so “under the Remote State’s laws and regulations.”</p>
<p>Last year, the Texas legislature <a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/text/HB2544/id/2792633" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considered legislation</a> to join the PA compact, but it died in the state Senate.</p>
<p>Monica Ward, president of the Texas Academy of Physician Assistants, said her group will keep pushing for the bill.</p>
<p>“In the rural areas of Texas, there is absolutely a need and a shortage of health care providers,” Ward said. “We’re surrounded by multiple states, so it’s nice to be able to reduce those administrative burdens, paperwork and possibly fees for those that are looking to work in Texas.”</p>
<p>It will <a href="https://www.pacompact.org/siteassets/pa-licensure-compact/pdf/pa-compact-timeline.pdf?DocumentID=55524" target="_blank" rel="noopener">take 18 to 24 months</a> for the compact to become fully operational and for PAs to apply for the privilege to practice in other areas. The compact commission also needs to create a data system to keep track of licenses.</p>
<p>This model of licensure may not have worked even five years ago, said Tennessee Republican state Rep. Jeremy Faison, who sponsored his state’s compact <a href="https://www.capitol.tn.gov/Bills/113/Bill/SB1727.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legislation</a>.</p>
<p>“It would have had major pushback and people would have asked, ‘What are you trying to do? We like to control what we’re doing in our state,’” said Faison. “But because we live in a global society and people move around so much more than ever before, I think the average person has embraced this.”</p>
<p>Faison told Stateline that for states such as Tennessee, which borders eight states, joining the compact makes economic sense because it will encourage people to move to the state.</p>
<p>Financial stability was 32-year-old Aneil Prasad’s motivation for getting a compact nursing license. He moved from New Orleans to Asheville, North Carolina, last year.</p>
<p>“It allows people to seek out better-paying jobs and move themselves ahead, buy houses and have better health and education and all that,” Prasad said. “And then the less competitive places are forced to raise their wages in order to attract people.”</p>
<p>After moving from Louisiana to North Carolina with his multistate license, Prasad said his wage increased from $21 an hour to $36 an hour. He notes that while the multistate license for nurses costs a bit more than a regular license, it would be much more expensive for him to apply for a new license in every state.</p>
<p>Since Texas hasn’t joined the PA compact, Dodge maintains active licenses in her home state as well as Alaska, California, Florida, New Mexico and Washington. She said the process to get them was expensive and time-consuming. Licenses can cost upward of $500 and can take three to nine months to obtain. Dodge said it’s been worth the trouble to help her patients, but she would appreciate an easier pathway.</p>
<p>“I got all these state licenses to follow my patients,” she said. “So when the PA compact license gets enacted in Texas, I hope it’s going to help me continue following my patients and I’ll be the glue that they need.”</p>

(Terence Lewis/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)</p><p>Fall brings football season in the U.S. and, with it, <a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/ranking-the-13-alternate-nfl-helmets-debuting-in-2024" target="_blank">the parade of distinctively decorated helmets that the players wear</a>.</p>
<p>Over time, the shape and size of these helmets have gradually changed, from the <a href="https://historicsportscollectibles.com/" target="_blank">leather head coverings</a> of the early 20th century to the <a href="https://content.riddell.com/Axiom/" target="_blank">space-age plastic domes</a> we’re accustomed to seeing today.</p>
<p>But the visual profiles of some NFL football helmets may change drastically in 2024. The league has approved the in-game use of padded helmet accessories known as Guardian Caps, which, according to the NFL, “can reduce the force from head contact” <a href="https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-to-give-players-option-to-wear-guardian-caps-during-regular-season-games" target="_blank">by up to 20%</a>.</p>
<p>A backlash has already begun. Some players have <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/34313193/feel-bobblehead" target="_blank">complained that the devices are unwieldy</a>. And both fans and players have blanched at how the blocky accessory <a href="https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Articles/2024/08/19/nfl-guardian-caps?publicationSource=sbd&amp;issue=208d5f5ece8341dc81fccda364fc0570" target="_blank">makes players’ heads seem disproportionately large</a>.</p>
<p>Because I’m working on <a href="https://noahcohan.com/" target="_blank">a cultural history of the football helmet</a>, I’m eager to see what transpires.</p>
<p>In a multibillion-dollar sport in which <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2023/11/football-helmet-safety-innovation-design.html" target="_blank">the helmet is the preeminent branding space and symbol of the game</a>, what happens when the imperative of player safety conflicts with its visual appeal?</p>
<p>We’re about to find out.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">From the practice field to the playing field</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Affixed to the outside of players’ existing helmets via snaps and Velcro straps, <a href="https://guardiansports.com/guardian-caps/" target="_blank">Guardian Caps</a> consist of a series of soft, rectilinear pads connected by fabric.</p>
<p>After the caps were introduced in 2010, some college and pro teams gradually adopted them during practices. In 2022, the <a href="https://guardiansports.com/2022/04/06/nfl-mandates-guardian-caps/" target="_blank">NFL began requiring their use in preseason practices</a>. At first, only linemen and linebackers were required to wear them. By 2024, the league mandated <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/33620788/seeking-reduce-head-contact-nfl-nflpa-mandate-use-guardian-cap-helmet-early-portion-training-camp" target="_blank">all players except quarterbacks and kickers wear them</a> while practicing. In April 2024, the league announced that players <a href="https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-to-give-players-option-to-wear-guardian-caps-during-regular-season-games" target="_blank">could wear them in regular season games</a> at their discretion.</p>
<p>There seems to be good reason to encourage their use. Using data collected from all 32 teams, the league found that the devices <a href="https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-to-give-players-option-to-wear-guardian-caps-during-regular-season-games" target="_blank">reduce the impact force of head-on-head collisions</a> by 20% when both players involved wear the device, and 10% when one of the players is wearing one.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/11/is-the-nfl-making-progress-tackling-its-concussion-crisis/" target="_blank">Some scholars have expressed skepticism</a> toward the NFL’s closely held research data. Nonetheless, the league claims that there’s been an <a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/nfl-says-positions-wearing-guardian-caps-saw-52-decrease-in-concussions" target="_blank">eye-popping decline of 52% in concussion incidence reporting</a> during preseason practices since the devices were mandated.</p>
<p>Touting the safety benefits of the Guardian Caps is an obvious public relations win for the NFL. <a href="https://www.bu.edu/cte/" target="_blank">Ongoing research into chronic traumatic encephalopathy</a>, or CTE, and other traumatic brain injuries continues to show just how much damage repeated blows to the head can do to the brain, with football players particularly vulnerable.</p>
<p>Many players <a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/sports/nfl/colts/2024/08/11/5-colts-wear-guardian-caps-including-jonathan-taylor-vs-broncos/74762096007/" target="_blank">have supported the league’s efforts</a> to put safety first, including Indianapolis Colts running back <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/T/TaylJo02.htm" target="_blank">Jonathan Taylor</a>, who became the first high-profile, skill-position player <a href="https://www.nfl.com/news/jonathan-taylor-among-colts-players-to-wear-guardian-caps-in-sunday-s-preseason-game" target="_blank">to wear a Guardian Cap</a> during a preseason game on Aug. 11, 2024.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Players object</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>But the story of Guardian Caps’ introduction is not an unfettered success – at least, not yet.</p>
<p>Though the standard-issue Guardian Caps <a href="https://guardiansports.com/guardian-caps/" target="_blank">weigh less than</a> 7 ounces (0.2 kilograms), many players find them <a href="https://www.profootballnetwork.com/miami-dolphins-guardian-caps-nfl-2024/" target="_blank">heavy and hot</a>.</p>
<p>“I hate them,” Seattle Seahawks defensive tackle <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/sports/seahawks/why-seahawks-are-wearing-padded-helmets-in-practice-and-possibly-games/?utm_source=pocket_shared" target="_blank">Jarran Reed told The Seattle Times</a>. “I understand the safety for them, but I’ve been playing a long time. It just looks crazy to me. I don’t like them. I’m ready to take them off.”</p>
<p>“I can’t stand them. It impacts my swag,” Philadelphia Eagles cornerback <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/aug/12/aesthetics-over-safety-nfl-players-weigh-benefits-/?utm_source=pocket_saves" target="_blank">Darius Slay told CBS Sports</a>. “My game is part of my swag. If I ain’t looking the part, I can’t feel the part.”</p>
<figure class="align-center "><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>Obviously, in such a fast-paced and violent game, the tiniest margins – both physical and psychological – can make a difference in performance. And players like Reed, Slay and <a href="https://www.profootballnetwork.com/miami-dolphins-guardian-caps-nfl-2024/" target="_blank">at least</a> <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/sports/seahawks/why-seahawks-are-wearing-padded-helmets-in-practice-and-possibly-games/?utm_source=pocket_shared" target="_blank">a dozen</a> <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/aug/12/aesthetics-over-safety-nfl-players-weigh-benefits-/?utm_source=pocket_saves" target="_blank">others</a> don’t seem to be willing to sacrifice their ability to maximize on-field performance for incremental safety gains.</p>
<p>As important as such players’ objections to the feel and look of Guardian Caps may be, it may not be the most significant problem the NFL faces in their adoption.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Blemishing the brand</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Simply put, many fans think the <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/nfl/news-nfl-fans-react-new-guardian-cap-rules?utm_source=pocket_saves" target="_blank">Guardian Caps</a> <a href="https://athlonsports.com/nfl/nfl-fans-furious-over-recent-league-uniform-change?utm_source=pocket_saves" target="_blank">are</a> <a href="https://talksport.com/sport/1845153/nfl-rule-change-guardian-caps-helmet-concussion-controversy/" target="_blank">ugly</a>, even when they’ve been <a href="https://uni-watch.com/2024/07/28/chargers-commanders-have-custom-cap-covers/?utm_source=pocket_shared" target="_blank">covered with fabric</a> that mimics the look of the logos on the underlying plastic shell.</p>
<p>But why should the reaction of the fans matter? After all, they’re not the ones putting their health on the line.</p>
<p>What’s more, for the first 75 years of football history, most helmets were nondescript. Per football historian Timothy P. Brown, early helmets were constructed from plain leather in “various shades of brown or black, <a href="https://www.footballarchaeology.com/p/how-the-forward-pass-changed-the-color-of-football-helmets" target="_blank">so they all looked more or less alike</a>, as did many team uniforms.” It wasn’t until the 1940s and ’50s, <a href="https://content.riddell.com/history/" target="_blank">when sports equipment manufacturer Riddell’s early plastic models</a> began to gain popularity, that the helmet’s potential <a href="https://doi.org/10.1123/kr.2024-0037" target="_blank">as a canvas for decoration began to be realized</a>.</p>
<p>Yet so much of the NFL’s incredible success is premised on its visual appeal.</p>
<p>In the early 1960s, then-NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle observed that television, not ticket sales, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/08/sports/rozelle-s-nfl-legacy-television-marketing-and-money.html" target="_blank">would power football’s future financial success</a>. Helmet branding was a vital way <a href="https://www.toddradom.com/blog/fl-helmet-logos-licensing-giants-rams-eagles-cowboys" target="_blank">to promote and celebrate an NFL team’s identity</a>. For TV viewers, helmet logos would become only more crisp and colorful as broadcasting technology improved.</p>
<p>Today, the logos that first appeared on helmets in the mid-20th century have become the icons of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/lists/nfl-valuations/" target="_blank">multibillion-dollar brands</a> with <a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/2022/07/18/nfl-executive-outlines-mission-for-the-league" target="_blank">hundreds of millions of fans</a> around the world.</p>
<p>The negative impact the Guardian Caps have on the look of the game, and the importance of that look to the continued popularity of the game, have not gone unnoticed.</p>
<p>“Football is an extremely visual sport,” <a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/nfl-confirms-players-can-choose-to-wear-guardian-caps-during-games" target="_blank">Mike Florio of “Pro Football Talk” wrote</a>. “It thrives in large part because of how it looks on TV.”</p>
<p>“With sleek helmets coated in clumpy coverings that look like soundproofing panels, the vibe will be compromised,” he added.</p>
<p>Fortunately for Florio and others who dislike the look of the Guardian Cap, the NFL has already <a href="https://www.nfl.com/news/twelve-new-helmets-to-be-offered-to-players-for-2024-season" target="_blank">approved and encouraged the use of six new helmet models</a> that purportedly provide equivalent protection to those with the Guardian Cap affixed to them.</p>
<p><a href="https://vicis.com/products/zero2-trench-helmet?srsltid=AfmBOor3aFZArlxN2DAr-7QjFg6kHBis8XSJXFvs6fydi9iDsM624hqJ" target="_blank">These models</a> don’t exactly look like normal helmets, either. But they don’t look like Guardian Caps, and that could make all the difference.</p>

As gambling options become more accessible, experts warn that the number of young people falling into addiction is on the rise, leading to severe financial, emotional, and social consequences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Problem gambling is not just a personal problem, it’s a family, community and state problem. One individual that struggles with gambling-related harm negatively impacts eight to 10 other individuals,” Brianne Doura-Schawohl, the former vice president of U.S. Policy and Strategic Development for global harm prevention consultancy EPIC Risk Management and now head of Doura-Schawohl Consulting LLC, said at </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/22/virginia-one-step-closer-to-creating-single-gaming-agency/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a recent meeting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the newly created Joint Subcommittee to Study the Feasibility of Establishing the Virginia Gaming Commission in Richmond. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doura-Schawohl warned the panel that about 5% of people who actively gamble will suffer from problematic gambling at some point. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are biological, psychological and sociological factors that feed into this. Given that the commonwealth has traditionally done nothing to address this public health issue, I’m very concerned about the current state of problem gambling within our jurisdiction,” she said.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The full scope of the problem</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a 2022 review published by the scientific </span><a href="https://www.addictionjournal.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Journal of Addiction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, globally one in every 400 adults has sought help for gambling problems, either in the past 12 months or at some point in their lifetime, Doura-Schawohl said. In the United States, an estimated 1-2% of the adult population struggles with problematic gambling, and about 5% percent of all those who actively gamble will suffer from this addiction, according to the National Council on Problem Gambling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the opening of several new casinos in the state and the proliferation of online gambling technologies — such as sports betting apps and virtual casinos — the popular pastime has become easier and more enticing for young adults, and lawmakers are aware of the challenges that require the government to act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As the Virginia Gaming Commission starts to form, between myself and our colleagues in the General Assembly, the problem gambling is probably one of the foremost issues that we are trying to get a handle on and make sure that the resources are there,” said Sen. Bryce Reeves, R-Spotsylvania, the committee chairman. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because there are currently no federal funds designated for problem gambling treatment or research — unlike the billions of dollars in funding for alcohol, tobacco and drug addiction — the General Assembly last year passed legislation creating a new </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1465" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Problem Gambling Treatment and Support Advisory Committee </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">within the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services to address and mitigate gambling addiction in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislature previously created a </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title37.2/chapter3/section37.2-314.2/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Problem Gambling Treatment and Support Fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help pay for “counseling and other support services for compulsive and problem gamblers, developing and implementing compulsive and problem gambling treatment and prevention programs, and providing grants to support organizations that provide assistance to compulsive and problem gamblers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advocates for combating problem gambling, including Doura-Schawohl, have been pushing to create a state fund even before a 2021 survey found that Virginia ranked 27th in the nation with a per capita spending of just 27 cents on measures countering the effects of the addiction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think more shocking was when I did an estimate for the annual cost we as the taxpayers are incurring because we are not funding this efficiently, including divorce, bankruptcy, crime, healthcare for suicidal ideations, depression and anxiety,” Doura-Schawohl told the committee. “We are talking about individuals who are in the throes of an addiction which often compromises their finances.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Substance abuse is 338 times more funded in Virginia than problem gambling services, but it is only seven times more prevalent within the state’s communities, Doura-Schawohl said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So we are talking about something that is pretty rampant yet it doesn’t have nearly the funds that it needs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reeves, the committee chair, said that in Virginia these efforts are already underway but still in the early stages. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The team that we have on the ground working on this is doing a phenomenal job. One of the primary goals of this committee is to strictly highlight problem gambling, which is why we have to make sure to put in the effort to counter the human cost and try to fix that,” Reeves said. </span></p>

Bryce Reeves, R-Spotsylvania (left), chairs the Joint Subcommittee to Study the Feasibility of Establishing the Virginia Gaming Commission. (Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax, a committee member and the sponsor of the support fund legislation, said because there is no federal money for problem gambling prevention or treatment, it is on the state to step up and create more awareness. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think we need to do a better job at public health messaging, and I look forward to the creation of this new agency that will put all gambling regulation in one agency,” Krizek said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At its next meeting in November, the committee is set to vote on a recommendation to create the new independent state agency — dubbed the Virginia Gaming Commission — to consolidate the regulatory powers over online gambling, charity gaming, bingo, live horse racing, fantasy contests, the state’s five licensed casinos, and 10 licenses for Rosie’s Gaming Emporium. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Krizek said that bringing the problem gambling issue into that agency will be an important step, “because the primary reason for why we need this agency is for public safety purposes, that’s the primary responsibility that we have as legislators.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Problem gambling is a big enough issue that the state should take seriously, Krizek added. “I thought that was a wake up call for all of us, I don’t think anybody realized that. We have to use our money wisely, and having it in one agency will help. The idea is we can’t ignore the dark side of gambling, and one of the things we learned is that more suicides occur with problem gamblers than with any other addiction.” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The risk to young bettors</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A survey by the National Council on Problem Gambling found that sports betting was the most problematic among all forms of gambling, with twice the rate in problematic play than that of other types. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re not talking about tendencies compared to non-gamblers, but these are new individuals,” Doura-Schawohl said. “Most of these are male bettors. There are of course females that are engaged in sports betting, but really I am worried most about the male 18- to 24-year-old demographic in particular.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Carolyn Hawley, the president of the Virginia Problem Gambling Council and an associate professor in mental health counseling at Virginia Commonwealth University’s School of Allied Health Professions, said the fact that the increasing number of younger people taking advantage of the VPGC’s gambling helplines in recent years is of particular concern. From January through June alone, the helpline had 526 intakes, a 16% increase from the same period of 2023, and a 64% increase from 2022 over the same time period. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We see a huge demographic shift where people right at the beginning of their careers are now being devastated by developing a gambling disorder. The impact that problem gambling has on people, on their families, on their work, and on their schools is significant,” Hawley said. “When you get people this early in their lives that are experiencing this condition, it’s such a setback.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39884" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:253px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/03/how-virginia-is-addressing-the-dark-side-of-gambling/screenshot-2024-08-30-at-3-58-00-pm/" rel="attachment wp-att-39884"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-39884 size-medium" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-30-at-3.58.00 PM-253x300.png" alt="" width="253" height="300" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-30-at-3.58.00 PM-253x300.png 253w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-30-at-3.58.00 PM.png 356w" sizes="(max-width: 253px) 100vw, 253px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Dr. Carolyn Hawley, president of the Virginia Problem Gambling Council (courtesy of Virginia Commonwealth University)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New forms of online gambling are a special concern because of their convenience, Hawley added.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m a college professor, and I see it with kids and young adults in the classroom, I see how they are on their phones and everybody is wagering, and it’s become such an acceptable recreational activity. People start out with their friends and their families, and we also see it with families and their young kids and parents thinking this is a safer behavior than say alcohol or drugs. They don’t recognize that this is a similar conditioning, and there can be consequences for people who have developed problems with this behavior.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Next steps</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Krizek, the delegate from Fairfax, said that lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have already agreed to introduce legislation ahead of the 2025 General Assembly session to ensure that going forward, “everybody who will have skin in the game” will pay into the problem gambling fund. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And they want to,” Krizek said, adding that “the casinos are already doing a lot of work, and the online sports betting businesses put in 2.5%, which is the highest of any group. But we can certainly raise that amount, and we have to figure out the best way to raise that money.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current problem, Krizek continued, is that these efforts remain inconsistent because they lack the coordination by a single state-run agency — a void that the new Virginia Gaming Commission is designed to fill, especially in light of the many new gambling technologies emerging nationwide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is new gambling coming online, there is artificial intelligence, virtual reality, there are tons of ways for the dopamine in your system to be activated. I mean, the idea of gaming is to take your money, and many of us cannot afford to lose too much money,” Krizek said.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, for casual gamblers who wager simply for entertainment purposes especially at casinos, that approach is fine, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But we don’t want to have casinos on every street corner, and we have to be mindful of those people that aren’t good at saying no, that cannot afford to lose the money, and who aren’t really gambling for entertainment purposes anymore.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, Virginia needs to stand up an agency with the sole purpose of focusing on gaming and gambling, while being a one-stop shop for the commonwealth, “and that doesn’t do its own gambling, like the Lottery selling tickets,” Krizek said. “It would be an agency that’s not conflicted at all.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39885" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:279px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/03/how-virginia-is-addressing-the-dark-side-of-gambling/screenshot-2024-08-30-at-4-01-16-pm/" rel="attachment wp-att-39885"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-39885 size-medium" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-30-at-4.01.16 PM-279x300.png" alt="" width="279" height="300" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-30-at-4.01.16 PM-279x300.png 279w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-30-at-4.01.16 PM-768x825.png 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-30-at-4.01.16 PM.png 838w" sizes="(max-width: 279px) 100vw, 279px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Del. Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax (courtesy of Krizek campaign)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But until the Virginia Gaming Commission is set up — which is currently planned by 2027 if approved by the legislature during next year’s session — the commonwealth will have to step up and provide some up-front funding to counter problem gambling, said Reeves, the committee chair. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Paul and I will have to make a presentation to the money committees in both the House and the Senate to bring this to fruition, because the entity has not been up yet and we can’t start pulling the money out of the gambling institutions as of yet,” he said. “But eventually, gambling will pay for all of this and more.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DBHDS Commissioner Nelson Smith said in an email that cross-agency collaboration “has been and will continue to be key in our prevention and treatment efforts.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The department, Virginia’s Community Services Boards, and the Virginia Department of Education are partnering to develop a curriculum for schools to help increase problem gambling awareness and help students build financial skills, Smith said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are also working to increase merchant education about problem gambling and provide tools and resources. When it comes to treatment for problem gambling, we’ve seen tremendous progress with the addition of peer support from individuals with lived experience. Working with peers helps individuals dealing with problem gambling issues understand that they aren’t alone and recovery is possible.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hawley, the VCU professor, said that she was grateful for the ongoing efforts by the General Assembly and the DBHDS to raise awareness about the dangers of problem gambling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They have put forward so much legislation that impacts us and the work that we are doing in trying to minimize harm,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think we have to have a balance between understanding what are the economic benefits of an activity and balance that with, ‘What is a potential harm for that?’ We do have a responsibility to protect the citizens and families of the commonwealth, because ultimately we all pay.”</span></p>

Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-currentlevels.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">high or very high levels of COVID nationwide this summer. </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">But with new vaccines expected to be available next month and the winter months on the horizon, medical professionals in Virginia suggest people get their shots sooner rather than later. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“COVID mutates quicker than the flu,” said Heather Harmon-Sloan with Virginia’s Department of Health. “This makes it incredibly important to get the updated COVID-19 vaccine that will be coming out here shortly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is because the newer vaccines — approved last week and expected in September —  will be more effective at guarding against the latest variants of the virus. The new Pfizer and Moderna vaccines will target the specific strain of the virus that has been attributed to spikes in infections this past spring and summer. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/see-the-numbers/covid-19-in-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 3%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of emergency room visitors each week for the past three weeks in Virginia have been diagnosed with COVID-19, a number that has been rising over the summer. And while not every case may lead to an emergency room visit, wastewater surveillance to detect the presence of COVID indicates </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-currentlevels.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">high levels around the country</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Virginia’s latest surveillance shows mostly a </span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/sars-cov-2-in-wastewater/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plateau around the state with an increase in the Eastern Shore</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we’re seeing right now is higher than what we saw this time last year,” Harmon-Sloan said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also attributes some of the spikes in cases and emergency visits to the inclination to spend more time indoors amid the summer heat — not unlike how indoor gatherings in the winter contribute to infection spikes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Respiratory viruses tend to be able to spread more efficiently when we&#8217;re all indoors, especially if we have poor ventilation,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where opening windows, practicing social distancing and mask use can help reduce infection potential, Harmon-Sloan said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while the new vaccines should target the same variant that has been driving the summer wave, Harmon-Sloan said that anyone who was infected this summer could consider delaying the new vaccine for about three months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is because those people may have a temporary resistance to the strain having just recovered from it, but she still suggests that people speak with their doctors if they’re weighing when they should get their newest shots. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People overall should get the new vaccine — even if they were vaccinated or were sick with COVID 19 earlier this year,” she said. The vaccine that’s emerging “is going to better target those particular variants that are new, that are in circulation right now in our communities, and the cause for these high trends.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CDC will be launching a </span><a href="http://vaccines.gov/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vaccine locator through the vaccines.gov </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">website. Additionally, President Joe Biden’s administration announced last week that it will once again offer free at-home COVID test kits that people can receive by mail. They can be ordered through </span><a href="http://covidtest.gov/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">covidtest.gov.</span></a></p>

(Drug Enforcement Administration) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After an unstable childhood, Sheyka Lyon said that she had lost herself as an adult with drug addictions. She made her way to Virginia as a sex trafficking victim, she said, but found recovery when tapping into support programs at Caritas — a Richmond-based nonprofit that supports people in recovery from substance abuse. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It really does take a village,” she said as she recounted her journey, from receiving help to now working as a peer navigator at Caritas and earning her degree in social work. After speaking to a crowd at the organization’s headquarters on Tuesday, she then introduced Gov. Glenn Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor focused on the village mindset as he noted various efforts inside and outside his administration to combat fentanyl addictions and support Virginians in recovery. 1,772 people experienced fentanyl-related deaths in 2023, according to the </span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/drug-overdose-data/overdose-deaths/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Department of Health</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the somber moments reflecting on lives lost to fentanyl overdoses were statements of hope as he announced the expansion of the “It Only Takes One” fentanyl overdose awareness campaign that had piloted in Roanoke earlier this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No community is immune,” Youngkin said of addiction. “We have work to do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier in the year, Virginia First Lady Suzanne Youngkin visited Roanoke multiple times for awareness events promoting the campaign that urges community members to take a pledge to talk to teens about the dangers of fentanyl.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin also highlighted other efforts to combat fentanyl use and abuse, including Attorney General Jason Miyares’ “one pill can kill” campaign and the Narcan trainings he and First Lady Youngkin have led around the state. Narcan is a commonly used drug to counteract a fentanyl overdose. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent legislative efforts to combat fentanyl abuse by Virignia’s General Assembly include  a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB1269" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to allow people in recovery from substance abuse who’ve been convicted of certain crimes to be able to work in treatment centers and a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb469" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">targeting fentanyl manufacturers. Both measures succeeded in the House and Senate and were signed by Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there has been bipartisan work to combat fentanyl issues in Virginia, Youngkin has his eye on a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/02/23/as-fentanyl-surges-virginia-lawmakers-debate-how-far-criminal-penalties-should-go/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to create a felony homicide criminal penalty for dealers whose drugs lead to a fatal overdose, regardless of whether or not it was accidental. Some Democrats had pushed back on the idea over the concern that it could go “too far” to charge people distributing drugs that they don’t know contain fentanyl.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I will put it forward again, and we will do everything we can to get this bill passed,” Youngkin told members of the media Tuesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jill Chicowicz is pleased to see various efforts that help bolster her nonprofit organization’s mission. After losing her twin brother to an accidental overdose in 2017, she founded 2 End The Stigma and worked to raise awareness about fentanyl. Her brother Scott Zebrowski had been prescribed opioids after an injury that led to the addiction that ended his life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, she said that she talks with her teenage sons about the dangers of black market drugs and the risks of addiction. She said she’s pleased to see the Youngkin administration and lawmakers do their part to help families be less likely to experience a tragedy like hers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I always tell parents, ‘Open the dialog. Talk to your children. Don&#8217;t be scared,’” she said.  “It is an awkward conversation. It&#8217;s more awkward to bury them.”</span></p>

(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)</p><p>The broader scope of fertility treatments entered the spotlight last week after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and his wife Gwen shared that they had children through a less commonly known procedure.</p>
<p>Since Vice President Kamala Harris selected Gov. Walz as her running mate, he has discussed his family’s fertility journey during speeches in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/wP5qOjgY88M?feature=shared&amp;t=4386" target="_blank">Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?537741-1/democratic-vice-presidential-nominee-tim-walz-campaigns-omaha-nebraska" target="_blank">Nebraska</a> and mostly recently at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/former-high-school-football-coach-rises-running-mate-walz-accepts-vp-nomination" target="_blank">Illinois</a>.</p>
<p>“It took Gwen and I years,” Walz <a href="https://youtu.be/Mf0u5MJEjhw?feature=shared&amp;t=468" target="_blank">said</a> on last Wednesday night. “But we had access to fertility treatments. And when our daughter was born, we named her Hope.”</p>
<p>This week, the Walzes clarified that they conceived via intrauterine insemination, not in vitro fertilization.</p>
<p>IUI involves injecting sperm into the uterus <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/gynecology-obstetrics/specialty-areas/fertility-center/infertility-services/intrauterine-insemination" target="_blank">during</a> or <a href="https://www.bcm.edu/healthcare/specialties/obstetrics-and-gynecology/reproductive-endocrinology-and-infertility/intrauterine-insemination-iui" target="_blank">just before</a> ovulation to increase the chances of fertilization and pregnancy.</p>
<p>“Our fertility journey was an incredibly personal and difficult experience. Like so many who have experienced these challenges, we kept it largely to ourselves at the time — not even sharing the details with our wonderful and close family,” Gwen Walz said in a statement provided to States Newsroom. “The only person who knew in detail what we were going through was our next door neighbor. She was a nurse and helped me with the shots I needed as part of the IUI process.”</p>
<p>During IVF, eggs and sperm are combined in a lab and an embryo is inserted into the uterus. IVF has been drawn into national reproductive rights debates for much of this year, and Walz has been talking about it on the campaign trail while discussing his family’s fertility journey.</p>
<p>U.S. Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, the Republican vice presidential candidate, accused his opponent of lying about how he and his wife had children. In an Aug. 20 social media post, Vance <a href="https://x.com/JDVance/status/1825905977008533700" target="_blank">said</a>, “Today it came out that Tim Walz had lied about having a family via IVF. Who lies about something like that?” He also shared a clip of Walz talking about fertility care and families on <a href="https://x.com/KamalaHQ/status/1821904074649883007" target="_blank">Aug. 9</a>.</p>
<p>In a statement, Harris-Walz campaign spokesperson Mia Ehrenberg said, “Governor Walz talks how normal people talk. He was using commonly understood shorthand for fertility treatments.”</p>
<p>Experts said that patients commonly get IUI and IVF confused or refer to them interchangeably, given that in vitro fertilization is more popular.</p>
<p>“There’s such a huge sort of alphabet soup that comes along with assisted reproduction,” said Kimberly Mutcherson, a professor at Rutgers University-Camden who specializes in reproductive justice, bioethics, and family and health law.</p>
<p>Dr. Kelly Acharya, a fertility physician and assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Duke University, said patients’ partners are more likely to mix up the two treatments or rope related procedures into IVF.</p>
<p>“A lot of times in my line of work, I see people that are referring to other things, like egg freezing, they call that IVF, even though technically it’s not,” she said.</p>
<p>Both Acharya and Mutcherson said the main differences between IUI and IVF are where fertilization occurs, the price and effectiveness.</p>
<p>“Intrauterine insemination or IUI is basically less invasive. It’s typically less expensive, and it is often what is recommended as the first thing that somebody tries,” Acharya said. “When somebody has mild forms of infertility, like if there are mild differences in the semen analysis, or if somebody is young and they’re not quite sure why they’re not getting pregnant, then often a provider will recommend that they do IUI as a first step to help things along.”</p>
<p>IUI is performed during or near ovulation, and it typically takes 10 minutes and is a minor procedure, according to Acharya. The price of IUI varies, depending on insurance coverage, from a <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/pregnancy/fertility-treatments/what-iui" target="_blank">few hundred dollars</a> to <a href="https://www.fertilityiq.com/fertilityiq/iui-or-artificial-insemination/the-cost-of-iui" target="_blank">several thousand dollars</a>.</p>
<p>Mutcherson noted that some people also confuse IUI with intracervical insemination, or ICI. During this method, the sperm is inserted into the cervix — the passageway to the uterus, according to the <a href="https://carolinasfertilityinstitute.com/the-difference-between-ici-and-iui/#:~:text=Intracervical%20insemination%20is%20when%20sperm,increase%20the%20chances%20of%20conception." target="_blank">Carolina Fertility Institute</a>.</p>
<p>Doctors often recommend ICI or IUI as a precursor to IVF, which Mutcherson said can cost $12,000 to $15,000 per cycle — or more with grading and genetic testing. During IVF, “fertilization happens outside of the body,” Acharya said.</p>
<p>IUI, the treatment the Walz family used to have children, is not under the same scrutiny as IVF, which has faced opposition from anti-abortion hardliners. “It sometimes is listed as being less controversial than IVF, because it’s just helping along the natural process of getting the sperm inside the uterus and then expecting fertilization to happen inside the body,” Acharya said.</p>
<p>But Mutcherson said that could also be attributed to the fact that it’s a less well-known procedure.</p>
<p>“I think the really big issue when it comes to something like artificial insemination is that it allows people to create families that a lot of these folks — unfortunately, in the Republican Party and folks who are evangelicals — don’t approve of: families with two moms, families with two dads, single women who are having children,” she said.</p>
<p>Price is a significant barrier to fertility care. Only 21 states require insurers to cover fertility procedures, <a href="https://stateline.org/2023/07/28/fertility-health-coverage-is-still-hard-to-come-by-in-many-states/" target="_blank">Stateline</a> reported. A successful birth via IVF can cost more than $60,000, according to a 2022 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9351254/" target="_blank">study</a> published in Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology.</p>
<p>“It requires a lot more physically, emotionally and economically to be able to do IVF,” Mutcherson, who conceived via IUI, said.</p>
<p>IVF became a national reproductive rights issue in February after the Alabama Supreme Court likened frozen embryos to “unborn children” in a ruling. The plaintiffs were couples who sued for damages under an 1872 wrongful death of children law after their embryos were accidentally destroyed in a clinic four years ago, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/alabama-supreme-court-ruling-could-end-ivf-treatments-state" target="_blank">Alabama Reflector</a> reported. Alabama’s fertility clinics temporarily closed after the ruling until Republican Gov. Kay Ivey signed legislation in March shielding providers from criminal and civil liabilities, the <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/alabama-passed-new-ivf-law-questions-remain" target="_blank">Reflector</a> reported.</p>
<p>But there’s still <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/women-undergoing-ivf-alabama-face-uncertainty-amid-legal-battle" target="_blank">uncertainty</a> over whether embryos and fetuses in the state have legal “personhood” rights. Despite the new law, two fertility clinics in Alabama announced <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/alabama-clinic-end-ivf-services-light-litigation-concerns" target="_blank">plans to close</a> by the end of the year, though <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/huntsville-ivf-clinic-close-january-denies-link-alabama-supreme-court-ruling" target="_blank">one denied the decision was related</a> to the  ruling.</p>
<p>Since the Alabama ruling, polls have shown most Americans back IVF. A survey conducted by <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/05/13/americans-overwhelmingly-say-access-to-ivf-is-a-good-thing/#:~:text=An%20April%20Pew%20Research%20Center,%2C%20while%2022%25%20are%20unsure." target="_blank">Pew</a> in April found that 70% said IVF is a good thing, while 22% said they’re not sure, and 8% said it’s a bad thing. Awareness is growing, too: <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/09/14/a-growing-share-of-americans-say-theyve-had-fertility-treatments-or-know-someone-who-has/" target="_blank">42% of Americans said they or someone they know have had fertility treatments</a>, according to a 2023 Pew poll.</p>
<p>Nationally, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-comes-out-against-alabama-ivf-ruling-national-republicans-scramble-distance" target="_blank">Republicans</a> and <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-republicans-reject-democrats-bill-ivf-protections" target="_blank">Democrats</a> condemned the Alabama Supreme Court’s ruling and filed bills seeking to protect IVF this spring, though all of them stalled in Congress. The Republican Party’s <a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/2024-republican-party-platform?emci=e10b129f-7f4f-ef11-86c3-6045bdd9e096&amp;emdi=1abd2530-f54f-ef11-86c3-6045bdee6681&amp;ceid=526826#:~:text=We%20proudly%20stand%20for%20families,pass%20Laws%20protecting%20those%20Rights." target="_blank">platform</a> featured support for both IVF and the equal protections clause of the 14th Amendment, which <a href="https://www.heritage.org/life/report/can-the-fourteenth-amendment-be-used-protect-human-life-birth?emci=e10b129f-7f4f-ef11-86c3-6045bdd9e096&amp;emdi=1abd2530-f54f-ef11-86c3-6045bdee6681&amp;ceid=526826" target="_blank">conservative legal scholars</a> argue can be used to solidify “<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/potential-threats-ivf-push-political-novices-election-year-advocacy" target="_blank">fetal personhood</a>” along with effectively banning abortion. And in June, the <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/republican-ivf-bill-fails-us-senate" target="_blank">Southern Baptist Convention</a> — the largest Protestant denomination in the U.S. — voted to condemn IVF, particularly the destruction or donation of embryos that are not implanted in the uterus.</p>
<p>“People who believe that life begins at conception, people who believe that an embryo is no different than a 5-year-old sitting in a kindergarten classroom, those are people who have really deep and abiding principles related to procedures like in vitro fertilization,” Mutcherson said.</p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce/ For the Virginia Mercury)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Thursday approved an updated COVID-19 vaccine intended to address severe symptoms of the virus ahead of the cold and flu season.</p>
<p>The new booster shots from Moderna and Pfizer follow a summer of increasing COVID-19 cases and are designed to better address the variants that are circulating now.</p>
<p>Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in a written statement that vaccination “continues to be the cornerstone of COVID-19 prevention.”</p>
<p>“These updated vaccines meet the agency’s rigorous, scientific standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality,” Marks said. “Given waning immunity of the population from previous exposure to the virus and from prior vaccination, we strongly encourage those who are eligible to consider receiving an updated COVID-19 vaccine to provide better protection against currently circulating variants.”</p>
<p>Wastewater surveillance has been <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#wastewater-surveillance" target="_blank">steadily increasing</a> since early May and could rise further now that children throughout the country are returning to school.</p>
<p>The number of emergency department <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#ed-visits_separated_by_age_group" target="_blank">visits</a> began increasing in May as well. And while the death rate from COVID-19 steadily decreased during the first half of the year, it began ticking up slightly in June, according to <a href="http://demographicsovertime/" target="_blank">data</a> from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>The FDA announcement said that three doses of the updated Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine or two doses of the updated Moderna vaccine are approved for unvaccinated children between six months and 4 years old.</p>
<p>Children between six months and 4 years old who have already received their COVID-19 vaccine are eligible to receive one or two doses or either updated vaccine. The dosing will depend on the timing and number of doses of their previous vaccination.</p>
<p>Children between 5 and 11 years old can receive a single dose of the updated vaccine, regardless of whether they’ve been previously vaccinated or not. If a child in that age range has been vaccinated against COVID-19, they need to wait at least two months before getting the updated dose.</p>
<p>Anyone over the age of 12 is eligible for a single dose of the updated vaccine if they’ve been vaccinated previously. They also must wait at least two months after their last vaccination.</p>
<p>Pfizer wrote in a statement that its “vaccine will begin shipping immediately and be available in pharmacies, hospitals, and clinics across the U.S. beginning in the coming days.”</p>
<p>Moderna said it expects its updated vaccine “to be in pharmacies and care settings in the coming days.”</p>

Legislation to allow medical aid in dying in Pennsylvania hasn’t been approved. (Eric Harkleroad/KFF Health News)</p><p>In the 18 months after Francine Milano was diagnosed with a recurrence of the ovarian cancer she thought she’d beaten 20 years ago, she traveled twice from her home in Pennsylvania to Vermont. She went not to ski, hike, or leaf-peep, but to arrange to die.</p>
<p>“I really wanted to take control over how I left this world,” said the 61-year-old who lives in Lancaster. “I decided that this was an option for me.”</p>
<p>Dying with medical assistance wasn’t an option when Milano learned in early 2023 that her disease was incurable. At that point, she would have had to travel to Switzerland — or live in the District of Columbia or one of the <a href="https://compassionandchoices.org/resource/states-or-territories-where-medical-aid-in-dying-is-authorized/" target="_blank">10 states where medical aid in dying was legal</a>.</p>
<p>But Vermont lifted its residency requirement in May 2023, followed by Oregon two months later. (Montana effectively allows aid in dying <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/montana-medical-aid-in-dying-legal-gray-zone-reviving-legislation/" target="_blank">through a 2009 court decision</a>, but that ruling doesn’t spell out rules around residency. And though New York and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/01/california-assisted-suicide-00149833" target="_blank">California recently considered</a> legislation that would allow out-of-staters to secure aid in dying, neither provision passed.)</p>
<p>Despite the limited options and the challenges — such as finding doctors in a new state, figuring out where to die, and traveling when too sick to walk to the next room, let alone climb into a car — dozens have made the trek to the two states that have opened their doors to terminally ill nonresidents seeking aid in dying.</p>
<p>At least 26 people have traveled to Vermont to die, representing nearly 25% of the reported assisted deaths in the state from May 2023 through this June, according to the Vermont Department of Health. In Oregon, 23 out-of-state residents died using medical assistance in 2023, just over 6% of the state total, according to the <a href="https://www.oregon.gov/oha/PH/PROVIDERPARTNERRESOURCES/EVALUATIONRESEARCH/DEATHWITHDIGNITYACT/Documents/year26.pdf" target="_blank">Oregon Health Authority</a>.</p>
<iframe loading="lazy" 0 id="datawrapper-chart-gNve9" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" title="Where Aid in Dying Is Allowed" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/gNve9/4/" height="879" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" aria-label="Map" 1="data-external=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;" width="100%" class="iframe-class"></iframe>

<p>Oncologist Charles Blanke, whose clinic in Portland is devoted to end-of-life care, said he thinks that Oregon’s total is likely an undercount and he expects the numbers to grow. Over the past year, he said, he’s seen two to four out-of-state patients a week — about one-quarter of his practice — and fielded calls from across the U.S., including New York, the Carolinas, Florida, and “tons from Texas.” But just because patients are willing to travel doesn’t mean it’s easy or that they get their desired outcome.</p>
<p>“The law is pretty strict about what has to be done,” Blanke said.</p>
<p>As in other states that allow what some call physician-assisted death or assisted suicide, Oregon and Vermont require patients to be assessed by two doctors. Patients must have less than six months to live, be mentally and cognitively sound, and be physically able to ingest the drugs to end their lives. Charts and records must be reviewed in the state; neglecting to do so constitutes practicing medicine out of state, which violates medical licensing requirements. For the same reason, the patients must be in the state for the initial exam, when they request the drugs, and when they ingest them.</p>

<p><strong>The status of aid-in-dying in Virginia</strong></p>
<p>The Virginia Senate in February passed the End of Life Options Act and the House of Delegates&#8217; Health and Human Services Committee voted to advance the bill, but that was as far as it got. In March, a House committee voted to carry the bill over to the 2025 session.</p>
<p>The bill, sponsored by Democratic Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, would allow a person 18 or older who had received a diagnosis of six months or less to live to self-administer a controlled substance prescribed by a health care provider.</p>
<p>The Virginia legislature <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2018/09/24/should-terminally-ill-patients-be-allowed-to-choose-when-they-die-the-medical-aid-in-dying-debate-comes-to-virginia/">first considered</a> an aid-in-dying bill in 2018.</p>
</div>
	</div>
	
<p>State legislatures impose those restrictions as safeguards — to balance the rights of patients seeking aid in dying with a legislative imperative not to pass laws that are harmful to anyone, said Peg Sandeen, CEO of the group <a href="https://deathwithdignity.org/" target="_blank">Death With Dignity</a>. Like many aid-in-dying advocates, however, she said such rules create undue burdens for people who are already suffering.</p>
<p>Diana Barnard, a Vermont palliative care physician, said some patients cannot even come for their appointments. “They end up being sick or not feeling like traveling, so there’s rescheduling involved,” she said. “It’s asking people to use a significant part of their energy to come here when they really deserve to have the option closer to home.”</p>
<p>Those opposed to aid in dying include <a href="https://www.usccb.org/prolife/killing-pain-not-patient-palliative-care-vs-assisted-suicide" target="_blank">religious groups</a> that say taking a life is immoral, and <a href="https://www.acponline.org/acp-newsroom/american-college-of-physicians-reaffirms-opposition-to-legalization-of-physician-assisted-suicide" target="_blank">medical practitioners</a> who argue their job is to make people more comfortable at the end of life, not to end the life itself.</p>
<p>Anthropologist <a href="https://anitahannig.com/about-me/" target="_blank">Anita Hannig</a>, who interviewed dozens of terminally ill patients while researching her 2022 book, “<a href="https://anitahannig.com/" target="_blank">The Day I Die: The Untold Story of Assisted Dying in America</a>,” said she doesn’t expect federal legislation to settle the issue anytime soon. As the Supreme Court did with abortion in 2022, it ruled assisted dying to be a states’ rights issue in 1997.</p>
<p>During the 2023-24 legislative sessions, <a href="https://compassionandchoices.org/state-advocacy/" target="_blank">19 states</a> (including Milano’s home state of Pennsylvania) considered aid-in-dying legislation, according to the advocacy group <a href="https://compassionandchoices.org/" target="_blank">Compassion &amp; Choices</a>. Delaware was the sole state to <a href="https://legis.delaware.gov/BillDetail/130281" target="_blank">pass it</a>, but the governor has yet to act on it.</p>
<p>Sandeen said that many states initially pass restrictive laws — requiring 21-day wait times and psychiatric evaluations, for instance — only to eventually repeal provisions that prove unduly onerous. That makes her optimistic that more states will eventually follow Vermont and Oregon, she said.</p>
<p>Milano would have preferred to travel to neighboring New Jersey, where aid in dying has been legal since 2019, but its residency requirement made that a nonstarter. And though Oregon has more providers than the largely rural state of Vermont, Milano opted for the nine-hour car ride to Burlington because it was less physically and financially draining than a cross-country trip.</p>
<p>The logistics were key because Milano knew she’d have to return. When she traveled to Vermont in May 2023 with her husband and her brother, she wasn’t near death. She figured that the next time she was in Vermont, it would be to request the medication. Then she’d have to wait 15 days to receive it.</p>
<p>The waiting period is standard to ensure that a person has what Barnard calls “thoughtful time to contemplate the decision,” although she said most have done that long before. Some states have shortened the period or, like Oregon, have a waiver option.</p>
<p>That waiting period can be hard on patients, on top of being away from their health care team, home, and family. Blanke said he has seen as many as 25 relatives attend the death of an Oregon resident, but out-of-staters usually bring only one person. And while finding a place to die can be a problem for Oregonians who are in care homes or hospitals that prohibit aid in dying, it’s especially challenging for nonresidents.</p>
<p>When Oregon lifted its residency requirement, Blanke advertised on Craigslist and used the results to compile a list of short-term accommodations, including Airbnbs, willing to allow patients to die there. Nonprofits in states with aid-in-dying laws also maintain such lists, Sandeen said.</p>
<p>Milano hasn’t gotten to the point where she needs to find a place to take the meds and end her life. In fact, because she had a relatively healthy year after her first trip to Vermont, she let her six-month approval period lapse.</p>
<p>In June, though, she headed back to open another six-month window. This time, she went with a girlfriend who has a camper van. They drove six hours to cross the state border, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naP9PZTIy4I" target="_blank">stopping at a playground and gift shop</a> before sitting in a parking lot where Milano had a Zoom appointment with her doctors rather than driving three more hours to Burlington to meet in person.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if they do GPS tracking or IP address kind of stuff, but I would have been afraid not to be honest,” she said.</p>
<p>That’s not all that scares her. She worries she’ll be too sick to return to Vermont when she is ready to die. And, even if she can get there, she wonders whether she’ll have the courage to take the medication. About one-third of people approved for assisted death don’t follow through, Blanke said. For them, it’s often enough to know they have the meds — the control — to end their lives when they want.</p>
<p>Milano said she is grateful she has that power now while she’s still healthy enough to travel and enjoy life. “I just wish more people had the option,” she said.</p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the roughly 2 million Virginians who’d been enrolled in Medicaid before the COVID-19 pandemic, over 480,000 of them </span><a href="https://www.dmas.virginia.gov/data/eligibility-redetermination-tracker/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have been disenrolled as of this August.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically eligibility determinations are made annually, but they’d been on pause nationwide amid the pandemic due to federal policy. That’s changed over the past year in what’s colloquially referred to as “Medicaid Unwinding” as provisions of federal law have expired. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A top reason for disenrolling people from Medicaid is that they no longer meet the financial requirements to be eligible — such as income at or below 80% of federal poverty levels. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the ineligibility data could point to higher incomes which can be a good thing for people, policy analysts at The Commonwealth Institute caution that is not always the case when it comes to health insurance coverage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial disqualifications from Medicaid don’t always mean someone has health insurance otherwise, TCI policy director Freddy Mejia explained. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Examples could be someone having a combination of part time jobs tallying up to their overall income — which wouldn’t entail employer-sponsored insurance — or people might have a temporary spike in income through seasonal work that kicks them off eligibility for Medicaid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are also non-financial reasons to be removed, which can include </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/08/16/as-medicaid-review-continues-many-virginians-have-lost-coverage-for-procedural-reasons/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">procedural hiccups like not submitting proper paperwork for reenrollment on time</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re seeing a lot of people come off Medicaid enrollment, but we don’t have a clue what is happening with them,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mejia</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said. “Future data will take time to see who is uninsured or not after this.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medicaid is a state and federal program that provides insurance coverage to low-income people or people with disabilities. For some people, having Medicaid or even employer-offered insurance may not be enough. For instance, Virginia’s free clinics report an uptick in patients in recent years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of these patients are dubbed “ALICE patients,” — or asset-limited, income-constrained, employed people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rufus Phillips, CEO of the Virginia Association of Free and Charitable Clinics, said the demographic was contributing to patient uptick even before the pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The pinch is much greater on what we used to know as the middle class,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The clinics around the state have been a key point of healthcare access for some of Virginia&#8217;s poorest residents along with immigrant and refugee families. They are also a resource for people who are between jobs and insurance coverage — the “safety net to the safety net,” Phillips said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mejia noted how more uninsured people can continue to strain Virignia’s free clinics and Federally Qualified Health Centers who may need to serve larger populations than their resources will be able to handle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, there are still about 69,000 people who are still awaiting redetermination for Medicaid.

Tim Kaine, D-VA takes a photo with healthcare advocates in Henrico County on Aug. 15, 2024. Charlotte Rene Woods / Virginia Mercury</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two years ago Congress’ Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law by President Joe Biden after Vice President Kamala Harris cast a tie-breaking vote. Sen. Time Kaine, D-Va visited Henrico County Thursday to celebrate the anniversary and stress its role in reducing healthcare costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healthcare-specific components of the IRA have included a $35 cap on insulin and overall annual caps on prescription drug prices for seniors. Medicare is also negotiating prescription drug prices as a result of the legislation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While in Henrico, Kaine also heard insights from policy groups and Virginia residents who shared how the IRA helped them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott Kizner has been living with a form of blood cancer for a few years and has relied on a series of medications and procedures, including a bone marrow transplant. But his pills are pricey and he joked about “almost losing a finger” to fish a dropped pill out of his garbage disposal in his sink. Though he stepped down from his job amid his diagnosis, his wife has delayed retirement so that he can have health insurance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historian Chris Graham,52, had been worried about managing his Type II diabetes since he was laid off from his job. Thankfully, he said, he was able to obtain insurance through Virginia’s marketplace using tax credits. He’s searching for his next job and noted the role different employment types play in insurance access. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have to be realistic that maybe my future is stringing together uncertain freelance work for the rest of my life,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freddy Mejia, a policy director at The Commonwealth Institute noted the IRA extends tax credits people can use when obtaining health insurance. With </span><a href="https://scc.virginia.gov/newsreleases/release/VIM-Debut-Sees-Increase-in-Enrollment#:~:text=The%20number%20of%20health%20insurance,the%20needs%20of%20its%20residents." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increased enrollment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Virginia’s healthcare marketplace over the past year, he attributes some of that to the IRA. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Those numbers mean that the IRA is working for Virginia families,” Mejia said. “It’s making healthcare more of a right for all rather than a privilege for some.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the IRA has drawn criticism from Republicans with some calling for its repeal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We need to protect it,” Kaine said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His own opponent, retired Navy captain Hung Cao, has criticized the bill and been critical of inflation in general. But Kaine said that there’s “no magic wand” federal lawmakers can wave to fix it. What they can do, he said, is reduce costs where they can. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inflation has been easing, </span><a href="https://youtu.be/1u9TLPWB-to?si=HvlcG2QiUvocSX87" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rising just 2.9% in July</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the lowest it has been in three years. </span></p>

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)</p><p>Advocates for abortion access say compounding crises of abortion bans, rising economic costs and systemic health care issues are beginning to cause significant funding challenges and potential disruptions to reproductive care of all kinds.</p>
<p>Several people described it as a “perfect storm” of problems with the U.S. health care system, particularly post-pandemic, and the rise of abortion bans and other reproductive care restrictions in the wake of the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision in June 2022. Many individuals must now travel hundreds or thousands of miles to seek abortion care, and the consolidation of demand at a smaller number of clinics is increasing wait times, which means pregnancies progress to a more advanced stage and the costs balloon further. According to leaders of Planned Parenthood affiliates and abortion funds, there simply aren’t enough dollars right now to support the need at any level. A <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/telehealth-abortion-still-rise-especially-states-shield-laws-report-shows" target="_blank">recent report from #WeCount</a> showed the number of abortions nationwide started to increase in 2017 and has continued to increase post-Dobbs, with more than 102,000 abortions in January alone.</p>
<p>Abortion fund directors nationwide have been raising the alarm for months about declining donation revenue and their struggles to meet the needs of those seeking help with the financial burdens of finding abortion care, especially those who live in one of <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/see-data-reproductive-rights" target="_blank">22 states</a> with near-total bans or severely restrictive abortion laws. That includes every state in the Southeast.</p>
<p>Planned Parenthood of Northern New England announced at the beginning of the month a projected <a href="https://mainemorningstar.com/briefs/planned-parenthood-of-northern-new-england-projects-multi-million-dollar-deficit-calls-for-state-funding/" target="_blank">funding shortfall</a> of about $8.6 million over the next three years, and Planned Parenthood of Greater New York announced just a few days later that it would pause abortion care at or beyond 20 weeks because of financial struggles that began earlier this year. The National Abortion Federation runs America’s largest financial assistance program for abortion patients and said that just in the first half of this year it has partially funded more than 60,000 people’s abortions — a total of around $6 million per month — but has now had to reduce patient grants from 50% of the cost of care to 30%.</p>
<p>Even in areas with new abortion restrictions, such as Florida, donations have declined significantly. Stephanie Loraine Piñeiro, executive director of Florida Access Network, said during a June press conference that the month after the Dobbs decision ended federal abortion rights, the fund received $200,000 in individual donations — but after the state supreme court decision in April 2024 reduced the state’s abortion ban from 15 gestational weeks to six weeks, the fund received just $40,000 in donations.</p>
<p>“That is a stark difference, and it has everything to do with donors feeling burnt out,” Loraine Piñeiro said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">States with abortion access face hostile political winds </h4>

	
<p>Planned Parenthood Federation of America told States Newsroom it is meeting its fundraising goals, but the organization’s local health centers and regional affiliates are struggling to provide care in the current climate.</p>
<p>Nicole Clegg, interim CEO of Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, told States Newsroom the affiliate has always been under-resourced and under-reimbursed for the care it provides, which includes birth control, testing for sexually transmitted diseases and routine gynecological care in addition to abortion services. But now that the region, which includes Maine, Vermont and New Hampshire, is taking on more patients from states with abortion bans, it is reaching a tipping point.</p>
<p>“The services we provide are just not valued by the insurance industry, or Medicaid and Medicare — they have always been poorly reimbursed,” Clegg said. “Once costs really started to skyrocket, the margin we were operating with disappeared.”</p>
<p>According to an analysis of health care spending and costs<a href="https://www.kff.org/health-policy-101-health-care-costs-and-affordability/?entry=table-of-contents-how-do-high-health-costs-affect-affordability-of-care" target="_blank"> by KFF</a>, health spending tripled between the year 2000 and 2022, from $1.4 trillion to $4.5 trillion. The pandemic accelerated that spending, but the analysis also said the aging population of the U.S., rising rates of chronic conditions, inflation, and expansions of insurance coverage have also driven up costs.</p>
<p>A bill that would have provided nearly $3.4 million to Maine’s family planning centers got caught in<a href="https://mainemorningstar.com/2024/05/21/less-than-10-of-bills-on-the-legislatures-2024-appropriations-table-became-law/" target="_blank"> legislative wrangling</a> that affected many appropriations bills at the end of the session.</p>
<p>In New Hampshire, which allows abortions until 24 weeks of pregnancy, the affiliate had nearly secured a multi-year grant of more than $2 million total, with the <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/council-could-get-rejected-family-planning-contracts-fifth-time" target="_blank">support of Republican Gov. Chris Sununu</a>. However, Clegg said that when the grant went before an executive council for final approval in 2023, the members <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/executive-council-republicans-again-reject-family-planning-contracts" target="_blank">struck it down</a>, saying they didn’t want taxpayer dollars to fund abortions. Both led to the projected $8.6 million shortfall over the next three years.</p>
<p>“The executive council has become increasingly hostile to Planned Parenthood,” Clegg said.</p>
<p>Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, which includes northwestern states as well as Hawaii, Alaska, Indiana and Kentucky, also said it is facing financial challenges that put access to care at risk. Lisa Humes-Schulz, vice president of policy and communications for Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates, said in a statement that the affiliate is facing the same health care cost challenges, an underfunded federal family planning program, workforce shortages and rising labor costs. Great Northwest includes Idaho, where there is a near-total abortion ban and which was at the center of a recent U.S. Supreme Court case over whether emergency room physicians could be prosecuted under the state law for providing an abortion in the case of a medical emergency. The affiliate’s clinics in Washington have seen an influx of patients from Idaho as a result of the abortion ban over the past two years, including some emergency patients that were<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/loss-federal-protection-idaho-spurs-pregnant-patients-plan-emergency-air-transport" target="_blank"> airlifted out of Idaho</a>.</p>
<p>“Unlike other safety net providers, we are trying to navigate these business challenges on top of the unprecedented political attacks focused on providers of abortion care and gender-affirming care,” Humes-Schulz said.</p>
<p>For Planned Parenthood of Greater New York, financial struggles have already prompted a change in care. After the state legislature <a href="https://www.nynmedia.com/opinion/2024/07/opinion-states-abortion-access-ecosystem-pushed-limit-two-years-after-demise-roe-v-wade/397800/" target="_blank">failed to increase Medicaid reimbursement rates</a> for medication abortion, the affiliate said it implemented executive pay cuts, consolidated job functions and closed small health centers to make up deficits. More than half of the patients that visit Planned Parenthood centers rely on Medicaid.</p>
<p>But it took another step in temporarily stopping abortions at 20 or more weeks starting Sept. 3 because it can’t afford to cover the vendor costs for anesthesia. Only one Planned Parenthood location in New York City will offer deep sedation and abortions at 20 or more weeks for now.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Unprecedented is not even the word anymore’</h4>

	
<p>The struggles also extend to organizations that provide more basic infrastructure for abortion clinics, such as the Abortion Care Network, which started a campaign called Keep Our Clinics to raise funds for independent abortion clinics. Independent clinics make up 55% of abortion providers, according to the network, while Planned Parenthood comprises 41%, and the remaining 4% occur at physicians’ offices and hospitals. The vast majority of clinics offering abortion care after 22 weeks — about 86% — are also independent.</p>
<p>Erin Grant, co-executive director of the Abortion Care Network, told States Newsroom the organization’s mission is to provide grant funding for independent clinics to support infrastructure needs — such as supplies, equipment, building repair, security, and litigation support — rather than patient care. The network has supported 32 clinics, and gave out $700,000 to providers in recent months.</p>
<p>But for the network too, donations are down by one-third. The full amount of donations to the Keep Our Clinics campaign goes to clinic members, and the organization granted nearly $5 million to clinics in 2022, but only $3.4 million in 2023. The requests for support did not go down during that time, but donations did.</p>
<p>Grant said it’s important to support the infrastructure of independent abortion clinics because once they close, it is extremely difficult to work through the bureaucratic process again to reopen them. In areas with newly instituted six-week abortion bans, such as Florida, Iowa and South Carolina, more clinics have closed their doors.</p>
<p>“We are in times where ‘unprecedented’ is not even the word anymore, and there is so much happening that calls for our attention. … There’s a need in this moment for us to hold multiple crises across communities,” Grant said. “… This isn’t something we get to say we did as an immediate need, because there’s decades of work ahead to build the actual infrastructure to have health care access, let alone abortion access in this country.”</p>
<p>During a June press call, several leaders of state abortion funds discussed funding struggles. Oriaku Njoku, executive director of the National Network of Abortion Funds, said the funds provided more than $36 million in abortion funding and $10 million in logistical support in 2023.</p>
<p>“This is not the same movement that it was five years ago, let alone 50 years ago, and yet we’re still operating and funding as if it were the same issue as it was before,” Njoku said.</p>
<p>There are nine clinics in Ohio, where voters affirmed their desire to keep access to abortion in 2023, but it is surrounded by three states with near-total bans — Indiana, Kentucky and West Virginia. Lexis Dotson-Dufault, executive director of the Abortion Fund of Ohio, said during the press conference that her organization averaged about 100 patients per month in 2022, but now it averages more than 500.</p>
<p>“While abortion funds have a huge increase in need, we are not seeing a huge increase in money coming in to support this need,” Dotson-Dufault said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">National Abortion Federation: Without cutbacks, funding would run out by fall </h4>

	
<p>Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the national organization, did not directly address whether it would provide more support to the affiliates facing significant financial troubles.</p>
<p>“While issues around funding are a concern, it is important to note that the reproductive health care ecosystem is straining under the weight of the post-Dobbs crisis,” a Planned Parenthood spokesperson said in a statement. “PPFA is working to support affiliates as they take action to adapt and continue to provide care.”</p>
<p>The organization’s comments came a few days after 41 abortion funds from around the country signed on to an op-ed <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/activism/abortion-funds-movement-crisis/" target="_blank">in The Nation</a> saying there is a disconnect between the most visible national reproductive rights organizations, like Planned Parenthood and the National Abortion Federation, and grassroots groups working to directly support those who need care. The op-ed called out the National Abortion Federation for cutting back its financial assistance program in July. Signers included the Abortion Fund of Ohio and the Florida Access Network.</p>
<p>Brittany Fonteno, CEO and president of the National Abortion Federation, called the change an “incredibly heartbreaking and difficult” decision that had to be made despite an “incredible and generous budget” that is the largest it has ever been. She said that in the first half of this year, NAF was funding at $6 million per month for abortion care, and then upwards of $200,000 per month in patient assistance funds to help with associated travel costs. These patient assistance funds are completely funded by foundation and individual donors, Fonteno said, noting that individual donations dropped nearly 40% in 2023 from the previous year after the Dobbs decision leaked.</p>
<p>In 2023, NAF said it funded 106,865 people with an average amount of $519 per patient. So far in 2024, the hotline has funded 66,330 people at an average of $541 per patient.</p>
<p>“We’re truly in a public health emergency right now, and unfortunately, we just can’t keep pace with the patient need,” Fonteno told States Newsroom. “We had to make this decision in order to make sure that we could stretch our funds and make sure that we could help as many people as possible for the rest of this year. If we hadn’t made this decision, then we would have run out of funding in the fall.”</p>
<p>The changes include no longer making exceptions for those in later stages of pregnancy who face higher costs — sometimes as much as $10,000, Fonteno said — because the procedure costs more or they have to travel further to find a clinic that can provide it. That “exception budget,” which was also used for patients facing extreme circumstances like intimate partner violence, will not exist for the remainder of the year, according to Fonteno.</p>
<p>“Of course, we’re working incredibly hard to try to fundraise, to try to get the word out and bring awareness to this issue. And if we’re able to fundraise, we may be able to consider increasing the funding that we’re able to do,” she said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Presidential election matters, director says </h4>

	
<p>Clegg, interim CEO of Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, said the problems will only get exponentially worse if the presidential election in November breaks for Republicans over Democrats. Project 2025, the <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/states-are-already-collecting-more-abortion-data-and-hipaa-wont-always-keep-it-private" target="_blank">blueprint document produced by the Heritage Foundation</a> for the next Republican presidential administration to follow, calls for the federal government to <a href="https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf#page=504" target="_blank">prohibit Planned Parenthood from receiving any Medicaid funds</a> (for non-abortion reproductive health services; federal funding of abortion is <a href="https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/issue-brief/the-hyde-amendment-and-coverage-for-abortion-services-under-medicaid-in-the-post-roe-era/#:~:text=Since%201977%2C%20the%20Hyde%20Amendment,result%20from%20rape%20or%20incest." target="_blank">currently prohibited</a>) and issue guidance to states that says they are free to defund Planned Parenthood in their state Medicaid plans as well.</p>
<p>Instead, it calls for the funding to be redirected to “health centers that provide real health care for women.” The anti-abortion organizations involved in crafting the document, such as Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, often promote funding for crisis pregnancy centers, which counsel pregnant patients against abortion and are known to spread misinformation about the procedure. A recent analysis from reproductive rights advocacy group Equity Forward showed<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/abortion-states-have-spent-nearly-500-million-on-anti-abortion-counseling-centers/" target="_blank"> nearly $490 million</a> was allocated in 23 state budgets over the past two years for crisis pregnancy centers, most of which were in the same states that restrict abortion access.</p>
<p>“It’s not just making sure the public understands that we need them to engage and partner with us to make sure we can keep providing the care; it’s also having them connect the dots to the November election and understand that who they vote for, who they put in office is going to determine our future,” Clegg said.</p>

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON —  The U.S. Department of Agriculture plans to embark on a year-long study beginning next month that will test samples for evidence of highly pathogenic avian influenza from former dairy cattle moved into meat production.</p>
<p>Emilio Esteban, the under secretary for food safety at the USDA, told reporters on a call Tuesday the new testing program follows three studies undertaken during the spring and summer that all found beef in the nation’s food supply is safe to eat.</p>
<p>“However, we want to move forward with an additional step,” Esteban said. “And what this means is that when those carcasses are tested, they are held and are not going to go into commerce until we get the results back.”</p>
<p>The virus, also referred to as bird flu or H5N1, has been found in wild bird and domestic poultry flocks within the United States for years. But the ongoing outbreak in dairy cattle has forced animal and human health experts to establish testing for a new community of agriculture workers and livestock.</p>
<p>The news of additional testing for the country’s meat supply came alongside the results of a study from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that reinforced the safety of pasteurized dairy products.</p>
<p>Steve Grube, chief medical officer for the FDA’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, said that the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/alerts-advisories-safety-information/updates-highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza-hpai#secondtesting" target="_blank">most recent round of dairy product testing</a> included 167 foods that were processed in 27 states in June and July.</p>
<p>“None of the product samples contained viable H5N1, reaffirming that pasteurization is effective,” he said. “The second survey was intended to address geographic and product gaps from the initial sampling of the commercial milk and dairy product supply that the FDA conducted during April and May.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Testing milk in bulk tanks</h4>

	
<p>Federal officials have also launched a voluntary program for farmers to test the milk in bulk tanks for H5N1, a step that’s intended to make it easier for them to move their cows between states without having to individually test each one.</p>
<p>Eric Deeble, deputy under secretary for marketing and regulatory programs at USDA, said the department’s Farm Service Agency has approved 23 of the 35 applications it has received so far to help ease the financial burden on dairy farmers who take their herds out of production after testing positive.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/disaster-assistance-program/emergency-assist-for-livestock-honey-bees-fish/index" target="_blank">program</a> — known as Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-raised Fish — has approved more than $1 million in payments.</p>
<p>The price paid to farmers is based on a formula that includes the price of milk from the preceding month as well as the number of dairy cattle that contract H5N1.</p>
<p>Deeble said on the call with reporters that of the approved applications, a dozen are from Colorado, which has seen a sharp increase in the number of positive H5N1 tests within its dairy industry.</p>
<p>Deeble argued the uptick is due to certain factors within the state and cautioned people against assuming that if testing was increased in other areas of the country, the number of positive H5N1 tests for dairy cattle would spike.</p>
<p>“I don’t think that it is accurate necessarily to extrapolate from the situation in Weld County, Colorado,” Deeble said. “Weld County and Colorado dairy in particular is rather unique in the degree to which the dairies are all closely associated with one another; both spatially and the way in which there is a lot of movement between the facilities.”</p>
<p>“It is a tightly integrated dairy community that’s isolated from much of the rest of the state, and there is a lot of connectivity between the premises in the way in which they use vehicles, support services, milk trucks,” Deeble added.</p>
<p>During the last 30 days, five states have had dairy cattle test positive for H5N1, including Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, South Dakota and Texas.</p>
<p>Colorado holds a disproportionate number of cases with 26 of the <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/hpai-confirmed-cases-livestock" target="_blank">dairy herds to test positive</a>, while the other four states combined hold a total of six herds.</p>
<p>Other mammals <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/mammals" target="_blank">diagnosed</a> with H5N1 during the last six weeks are overwhelmingly in Colorado, which has found the virus in house mice, deer mice, domestic cats, a desert cottontail and a prairie vole.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Effect on cats</h4>

	
<p>Public health officials said during the call Tuesday they are beginning to look more closely at when and why cats are being affected by the spread of H5N1.</p>
<p>Barn cats as well as those that hunt outside, coming into regular contact with wild birds that hold a reservoir of H5N1, have tested positive for the virus before.</p>
<p>But a <a href="https://www.colovma.org/cvma-news/influenza-a-highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza-h5n1-in-domestic-cats/" target="_blank">report</a> from the Colorado Veterinary Medical Association earlier this month noted that two of the six cats diagnosed with H5N1 in that state this year “were indoor only cats with no direct exposures to the virus.”</p>
<p>Public health officials on the call were unable to answer a question about how indoor-only cats would have come into contact with H5N1.</p>
<p>Experts on the call cautioned that as fall approaches, wild birds will begin migrating and dairy farmers will likely ship their cattle at higher rates, both of which could lead to an uptick in the number of positive cases of H5N1 being reported in dairy cattle as well as other animals.</p>

That hasn’t stopped Congress, state legislatures, and the U.S. surgeon general from moving ahead with age bans and warning labels for YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram.</p>
<p>But the emphasis on fears about social media may cause policymakers to miss the mental health benefits it provides teenagers, say researchers, pediatricians, and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.</p>
<p>In June, Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, the nation’s top doctor, called for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/opinion/social-media-health-warning.html" target="_blank">warning labels</a> on social media platforms. The Senate approved the bipartisan <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/1409/text" target="_blank">Kids Online Safety Act</a> and a companion bill, the Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act, on July 30. And at least 30 states have <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/technology-and-communication/social-media-and-children-2024-legislation" target="_blank">pending legislation</a> relating to children and social media — from age bans and parental consent requirements to new digital and media literacy courses for K-12 students.</p>
<p>Most research suggests that some features of social media can be harmful: Algorithmically driven content can distort reality and spread misinformation; incessant notifications distract attention and disrupt sleep; and the anonymity that sites offer can embolden cyberbullies.</p>
<p>But social media can also be helpful for some young people, said <a href="https://www.wcwonline.org/Active-Researchers/linda-charmaraman-phd" target="_blank">Linda Charmaraman</a>, a research scientist and director of the Youth, Media &amp; Wellbeing Research Lab at Wellesley Centers for Women.</p>
<p>For children of color and LGBTQ+ young people — and others who may not see themselves represented broadly in society — social media can reduce isolation, according to Charmaraman’s research, which was published in the <a href="https://www.teensandtech.org/handbook/" target="_blank">Handbook of Adolescent Digital Media Use and Mental Health</a>. Age bans, she said, could disproportionately affect these marginalized groups, who also spend more time on the platforms.</p>
<p>“You think at first, ‘That’s terrible. We need to get them off it,’” she said. “But when you find out why they’re doing it, it’s because it helps bring them a sense of identity affirmation when there’s something lacking in real life.”</p>
<p>Arianne McCullough, 17, said she uses Instagram to connect with Black students like herself at Willamette University, where about 2% of students are Black.</p>
<p>“I know how isolating it can be feeling like you’re the only Black person, or any minority, in one space,” said McCullough, a freshman from Sacramento, California. “So, having someone I can text real quick and just say, ‘Let’s go hang out,’ is important.”</p>
<figure id="attachment_39593" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:225px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=39593" rel="attachment wp-att-39593"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-39593" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Social_Media_Bans.jpg-225x300.webp" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Social_Media_Bans.jpg-225x300.webp 225w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Social_Media_Bans.jpg-768x1024.webp 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Social_Media_Bans.jpg-1152x1536.webp 1152w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Social_Media_Bans.jpg-1536x2048.webp 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Social_Media_Bans.jpg-scaled.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Arianne McCullough (left) and her mother, Rayvn, of Sacramento, California, support social media legislation that would require platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok to be more transparent about the effects of their products on adolescent mental health.(Courtesy of Rayvn McCullough )</p></figure>
<p>After about a month at Willamette, which is in Salem, Oregon, McCullough assembled a social network with other Black students. “We’re all in a little group chat,” she said. “We talk and make plans.”</p>
<p>Social media hasn’t always been this useful for McCullough. After California schools closed during the pandemic, McCullough said, she stopped competing in soccer and track. She gained weight, she said, and her social media feed was constantly promoting at-home workouts and fasting diets.</p>
<p>“That’s where the body comparisons came in,” McCullough said, noting that she felt more irritable, distracted, and sad. “I was comparing myself to other people and things that I wasn’t self-conscious of before.”</p>
<p>When her mother tried to take away the smartphone, McCullough responded with an emotional outburst. “It was definitely addictive,” said her mother, Rayvn McCullough, 38, of Sacramento.</p>
<p>Arianne said she eventually felt happier and more like herself once she cut back on her use of social media.</p>
<p>But the fear of missing out eventually crept back in, Arianne said. “I missed seeing what my friends were doing and having easy, fast communication with them.”</p>
<p>For a decade before the covid-19 pandemic triggered what the American Academy of Pediatrics and other medical groups declared “<a href="https://www.aap.org/en/advocacy/child-and-adolescent-healthy-mental-development/aap-aacap-cha-declaration-of-a-national-emergency-in-child-and-adolescent-mental-health/" target="_blank">a national emergency in child and adolescent mental health</a>,” greater numbers of young people had been struggling with their mental health.</p>
<p>More young people were reporting feelings of hopelessness and sadness, as well as suicidal thoughts and behavior, according to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/index.htm" target="_blank">behavioral surveys</a> of students in grades nine through 12 conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>The greater use of immersive social media — like the never-ending scroll of videos on YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram — has been blamed for contributing to the crisis. But a committee of the national academies found that the relationship between social media and youth mental health is complex, with potential benefits as well as harms. Evidence of social media’s effect on child well-being remains limited, the <a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/27396/social-media-and-adolescent-health" target="_blank">committee reported this year</a>, while calling on the National Institutes of Health and other research groups to prioritize funding such studies.</p>
<p>In its report, the committee <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/morning-breakout/utah-law-requires-parental-permission-for-kids-to-use-social-media/" target="_blank">cited legislation</a> in Utah last year that places age and time limits on young people’s use of social media and warned that the policy could backfire.</p>
<p>“The legislators’ intent to protect time for sleep and schoolwork and to prevent at least some compulsive use could just as easily have unintended consequences, perhaps isolating young people from their support systems when they need them,” the report said.</p>
<p>Some states have considered policies that echo the national academies’ recommendations. For instance, <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/youngkin-recommends-tighter-parental-approvals-for-children-accessing-websites/">Virginia</a> and Maryland have adopted legislation that prohibits social media companies from selling or disclosing children’s personal data and requires platforms to default to privacy settings. Other states, including Colorado, Georgia, and West Virginia, have created curricula about the mental health effects of using social media for students in public schools, which the national academies also recommended.</p>

<p>The Kids Online Safety Act, which is now before the House of Representatives, would require parental consent for social media users younger than 13 and impose on companies a “duty of care” to protect users younger than 17 from harm, including anxiety, depression, and suicidal behavior. The second bill, the Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act, would ban platforms from targeting ads toward minors and collecting personal data on young people.</p>
<p>Attorneys general in California, Louisiana, Minnesota, and dozens of other <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/meta-sued-facebook-instagram-children-teens-harm-mental-health/" target="_blank">states have filed lawsuits</a> in federal and state courts alleging that Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, misled the public about the dangers of social media for young people and ignored the potential damage to their mental health.</p>
<p>Most social media companies require users to be at least 13, and the sites often include safety features, like blocking adults from messaging minors and defaulting minors’ accounts to privacy settings.</p>
<p>Despite existing policies, the Department of Justice says some social media companies don’t follow their own rules. On Aug. 2, it sued the parent company of TikTok for allegedly violating child privacy laws, saying the company knowingly let children younger than 13 on the platform, and collected data on their use.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/10/31/81-of-us-adults-versus-46-of-teens-favor-parental-consent-for-minors-to-use-social-media/" target="_blank">Surveys show</a> that age restrictions and parental consent requirements have popular support among adults.</p>
<p><a href="https://netchoice.org/" target="_blank">NetChoice</a>, an industry group whose members include Meta and Alphabet, which owns Google and YouTube, has filed <a href="https://netchoice.org/category/netchoice-cases/" target="_blank">lawsuits against at least eight states</a>, seeking to stop or overturn laws that impose age limits, verification requirements, and other policies aimed at protecting children.</p>
<p>Much of social media’s effect can depend on the content children consume and the features that keep them engaged with a platform, said <a href="https://midas.umich.edu/faculty-member/jenny-radesky/" target="_blank">Jenny Radesky</a>, a physician and a co-director of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ <a href="https://www.aap.org/en/patient-care/media-and-children/center-of-excellence-on-social-media-and-youth-mental-health/" target="_blank">Center of Excellence on Social Media and Youth Mental Health</a>.</p>
<p>Age bans, parental consent requirements, and other proposals may be well-meaning, she said, but they do not address what she considers to be “the real mechanism of harm”: business models that aim to keep young people posting, scrolling, and purchasing.</p>
<p>“We’ve kind of created this system that’s not well designed to promote youth mental health,” Radesky said. “It’s designed to make lots of money for these platforms.”</p>

</p><p>Several U.S. senators have <a href="https://www.kaine.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/long_covid_letter1.pdf" target="_blank">called on</a> the Social Security Administration to take steps to make it easier for people with long COVID to access disability benefits, actions that disability rights advocates and patients say are desperately needed.</p>
<p>Senators Tim Kaine (D-VA), Ed Markey (D-MA), and Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Tina Smith (D-MN), Angus King (I-ME), and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) signed the letter released last week. They said the agency should make the process more transparent, track and publish data on long COVID applications, and consider expanding the listing of impairments the SSA considers in applications for benefits.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="8gov9Q5PNj"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/southwest-virginia-health-districts-launching-long-covid-study/">Southwest Virginia health districts launching long COVID study</a></p></blockquote>

<p>“In some situations, these symptoms can be debilitating and prevent an individual from being able to work, take care of their family, manage their household, or participate in social activities,” the senators wrote to SSA Commissioner Martin O’Malley.</p>
<p>Long COVID is a chronic health condition, which often includes fatigue, brain fog, and shortness of breath, following a COVID-19 infection. About three in 10 American adults have had long COVID at some point <a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/as-recommendations-for-isolation-end-how-common-is-long-covid/" target="_blank">according to</a> KFF’s April analysis of long COVID data. About 17 million people had it in March 2024. In 2021, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released guidance on long COVID <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/civil-rights-covid19/guidance-long-covid-disability/index.html" target="_blank">as a disability</a> under the Americans with Disabilities Act.</p>
<p>Kaine has been <a href="https://solvecfs.org/sen-tim-kaine-shares-his-long-covid-experience-at-solve-event-calls-for-more-research-and-equitable-care/" target="_blank">outspoken</a> about his own experience with long COVID and Sanders introduced legislation this month to provide $1 billion in funding each year for 10 years to support long COVID research by the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p>Lisa McCorkell, co-founder of the Patient Led Research Collaborative, a group of long COVID patients and patients with associated illnesses, told States Newsroom, “Creating a ruling or listing would be a huge improvement — having that specific guidance for how to document long COVID, its related diagnoses, and its associated impairment would assist physicians who may not be as knowledgeable about long COVID.”</p>
<p>The SSA administers disability benefits through Social Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income programs. The former program requires past employment payment into Social Security. The latter one does not have those restrictions and is based on financial need but to receive benefits, applicants have to prove they qualify as having a disability. The average monthly disability benefit for Social Security Disability Insurance is <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/social-security/social-security-disability-insurance-0#:~:text=The%20average%20disabled%2Dworker%20benefit,earnings%20for%20a%20median%20beneficiary." target="_blank">$1,538</a>.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Long COVID’s economic cost</h4>

	
<p>Researchers and economists are still trying to understand the full impact of COVID-19 infections and long COVID on the workforce. A 2023 <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723000713" target="_blank">study</a> estimated that COVID-19 brought down the labor force by 500,000 people and that the average loss of labor is equivalent to $9,000 in earnings. More than 25% of people with long COVID said their condition had an impact on their employment or work hours, <a href="https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/institute-working-papers/long-haulers-and-labor-market-outcomes" target="_blank">according to</a> a 2022 Minneapolis Fed paper.</p>
<p>Long COVID is not going to go away, particularly as government protections on the federal, state, and local level to reduce the spread of COVID are “severely lacking,” said Marissa Ditkowsky, who serves as the disability economic justice counsel at the National Partnership for Women &amp; Families, an organization focused on health, economic justice, and reproductive rights for women and families.</p>
<p>“While COVID continues to be a reality, we know that COVID disproportionately impacts women, disabled folks, and people of color, and the folks who are most impacted already have issues with access to appropriate health care, access to employment, and access to equitable wages,” said Ditkowsky, who has long COVID herself. “A lot of folks might be working in low-wage jobs where they’re in the service industry and constantly out there and more likely to contract COVID. It starts not just with the programs for how to deal with folks with long COVID, but how to prevent people from getting long COVID.”</p>
<p>In the meantime, she said people with long COVID, as well as other people with disabilities, would benefit from the changes senators are advocating, such as restoring the treating physician rule, which was repealed in 2017. The rule allowed the agency to give greater weight to medical evidence from a physician who treated a patient for years compared to, say, a doctor who examines a patient once.</p>
<p>“Giving your own doctor the weight [they] deserve is huge,” Ditkowsky said.</p>
<p>Mia Ives-Rublee, senior director of the disability justice initiative at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, said there is an opportunity for the Biden administration or the next administration to revamp how the agency administers disability benefits. She said that given the aging population, there is more reason than ever for the agency to make <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/how-dehumanizing-administrative-burdens-harm-disabled-people/" target="_blank">significant improvements</a> to the application process. Advocates for people with disabilities say it’s also imperative to boost funding for the agency.</p>
<p>“Not only are we seeing an increase in disability in younger folks, but we’re also looking at the big boomer generation getting older … We’re going to see a huge pressure on the [SSA] and we need to see real changes and funding and think of ways to manage the wide variety of experiences that people have in order to deal with differences in applying for these benefits,” she said.</p>

The Virginia Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services announced the start of the process Friday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 50 year old building has had no major renovations since opening in 1974, and its design isn&#8217;t compatible with phased renovations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The building design does not allow for phased renovations, meaning that staff and residents would need to vacate the building for up to 24 months to accomplish any significant and costly repairs,” a release announcing the planned closure stated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of this month, there are 46 patients at the center who are being treated for multiple medical and behavioral health issues. With the closure timeline, this gives a multi-year transition opportunity for patients and staff.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We will work with families on the available discharge options that meet their loved one’s needs and preferences and maintain open communication with the skilled staff of [the center] about employment at other DBHDS facilities,” commissioner Nelson Smith said in the release.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, there were 23,630 emergency room visits by patients who vaped, according to the organization. By 2023, that number had risen to 49,356 visits, a 108.9% increase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ER visits by people who reported using traditional tobacco products like cigarettes and chewing tobacco dropped by about 25% during the same period, but traditional tobacco products “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">still account for the majority of [emergency department] visits with a tobacco or vaping-related diagnosis,” according to a VHHA news release.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data doesn’t necessarily reflect the health risks or safety of various products. Julian Walker, a spokesman for the VHHA, said the data encompasses both people visiting the ER with a persistent cough that’s tobacco-related or patients who have other illnesses like the flu who disclose that they use tobacco.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Taken together, the trend data may suggest a shift away from traditional tobacco products in favor of e-cigarettes and vaping devices among some users of these products,” the VHHA said in a news release.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The drones are coming.</p>
<p>Starting in September, if someone in Clemmons, North Carolina, calls 911 to report a cardiac arrest, the first responder on the scene may be a drone carrying an <a href="https://www.osha.gov/aed#:~:text=An%20automated%20external%20defibrillator%20(AED,the%20heart%20rhythm%20to%20normal" target="_blank">automated external defibrillator</a>, or AED.</p>
<p>“The idea is for the drone to get there several minutes before first responders,” such as an emergency medical technician or an ambulance, said Daniel Crews, a spokesperson for the sheriff’s office in Forsyth County, where Clemmons is located. The sheriff’s office is partnering on the project with local emergency services, the Clinical Research Institute at Duke University, and the drone consulting firm Hovecon. “The ultimate goal is to save lives and improve life expectancy for someone experiencing a cardiac episode,” Crews said.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=655957189970284&amp;set=pcb.655958293303507&amp;ref=embed_post" target="_blank">Forsyth County program</a> is one of a growing number of efforts by public safety and health care organizations across the country to use drones to speed up lifesaving treatment in situations in which every second counts.</p>
<p>More than <a href="https://www.sca-aware.org/about-sudden-cardiac-arrest/latest-statistics" target="_blank">356,000 people</a> have a cardiac arrest outside of a hospital setting every year in the United States, according to the American Heart Association. Most people are at home when it happens, and about 90% die because they don’t get immediate help from first responders or bystanders. Every minute that passes without medical intervention decreases the odds of survival by 10%.</p>
<p>“We’ve never been able to move the needle for cardiac arrest in private settings, and this technology could meet that need,” said Monique Anderson Starks, a cardiologist and associate professor of medicine at Duke University. Starks is leading pilot studies in Forsyth County and James City County, Virginia, to test whether drone AED delivery can improve treatment response times. The work is funded by a four-year grant from the American Heart Association.</p>
<p>A 2017 study found it takes an emergency medical services unit seven minutes, on average, to arrive on the scene following a 911 call, though response times vary considerably by region, and rural wait times can be much longer. Starks said she believes the drone-delivered AEDs in the pilot study could reduce the time to treatment by four minutes compared with first responders.</p>
<p>Unlike a heart attack, which occurs when blood flow to the heart is blocked, a cardiac arrest happens when a heart malfunction causes it to stop beating, typically because of an arrhythmia or an electrical problem. Eighty percent of cardiac arrests start as heart attacks. The only way <a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/house-calls/differences-between-heart-attack-and-cardiac-arrest#:~:text=A%20heart%20attack%20happens%20when,the%20heart%20suddenly%20stops%20beating" target="_blank">to get the heart restarted</a> is with CPR and a defibrillator.</p>
<p>In Forsyth County, a drone pilot from the sheriff’s department will listen in on 911 calls. If there’s a suspected cardiac arrest, the pilot can dispatch the drone even before emergency medical services are contacted. The drone, which weighs 22 pounds and can travel 60 mph, will fly to the location and hover 125 feet in the air before lowering an AED to the ground on a winch. The AED provides simple verbal instructions; the 911 dispatcher on the phone can also help a bystander use the AED.</p>
<p>Eventually there will be six drone bases in Forsyth and James City counties, Starks said.</p>
<p>While the technology is promising and research has often found that drones arrive faster than first responders, there’s little conclusive evidence that drones improve health outcomes.</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38000871/" target="_blank">A Swedish study</a> published in The Lancet in 2023 compared the response times between drones and ambulances for suspected cardiac arrest in 58 deployments in an area of about 200,000 people. It found that drones beat the ambulance to the scene two-thirds of the time, by a median of three minutes and 14 seconds.</p>
<p>In the United States, most programs are just getting started, and they are exploring the use of drones to also provide remedies for drug overdoses and major trauma or potential drowning rescues.</p>
<p>In Florida, Tampa General Hospital, Manatee County, and Archer First Response Systems, or AFRS, <a href="https://archerfrs.com/" target="_blank">began a program</a> in May to deliver AEDs, a tourniquet, and <a href="https://narcan.com/frequently-asked-questions#:~:text=What%20is%20NARCAN%C2%AE%20Nasal,over%2Dthe%2Dcounter%20treatment" target="_blank">Narcan, a nasal spray</a> that can reverse an opioid overdose. The program initially covers a 7-square-mile area, and EMS dispatchers deploy the drones, which are monitored by drone pilots.</p>
<p>There were nearly 108,000 drug overdose deaths in the United States in 2022, according to the <a href="https://nida.nih.gov/research-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates#:~:text=National%20Drug%20Overdose%20Deaths%E2%80%94Number%20Among%20All%20Ages%2C%201999%2D,overdose%20deaths%20reported%20in%202022" target="_blank">National Institute on Drug Abuse</a>.</p>
<p>As of early July, the Tampa program hadn’t yet deployed any drones, said Gordon Folkes, the founder and chief executive of AFRS, which develops and deploys emergency drone logistics systems. One request in June to send a drone to an overdose couldn’t be fulfilled because of a violent thunderstorm, Folkes said. In the testing area, which covers about 7,000 residents, Folkes estimates that 10 to 15 drones might be deployed each year.</p>
<p>“The bread and butter for these systems is suburban areas” like Manatee County that are well-populated and where the drones have the advantage of being able to avoid traffic congestion, Folkes said.</p>
<p>There are other uses for drones in medical emergencies. The New York Police Department <a href="https://abc7ny.com/post/nyc-beach-safety-drones-now-drop-emergency-floatation/14944387/" target="_blank">plans to drop</a> emergency flotation devices to struggling swimmers at local beaches. In Chula Vista, California, a police drone was able to <a href="https://www.chulavistaca.gov/departments/police-department/programs/uas-drone-program" target="_blank">pinpoint the location</a> of a burning car, and then officers pulled the driver out, said Sgt. Tony Molina.</p>
<p>Rescue personnel have used drones to locate people who wander away from nursing homes, said James Augustine, a spokesperson for the American College of Emergency Physicians who is the medical director for the International Association of Fire Chiefs.</p>
<p>In the United States, one hurdle for drone programs is that the Federal Aviation Administration typically requires that drones be operated within the operators’ visual line of sight. In May, when Congress passed the FAA reauthorization bill, it gave the FAA four months to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking on <a href="https://democrats-transportation.house.gov/imo/media/doc/faa_reauthorization_act_of_2024.pdf" target="_blank">drone operations</a> beyond the visual line of sight.</p>
<p>“The FAA is focused on developing standard rules to make [Beyond Visual Line of Sight] operations routine, scalable, and economically viable,” said Rick Breitenfeldt, an FAA spokesperson.</p>
<p>Some civil liberties groups are concerned that the FAA’s new rules may not provide enough protection from drone cameras for people on the ground.</p>
<p>Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union, acknowledged the benefits of using drones in emergency situations but said there are issues that need to be addressed.</p>
<p>“The concern is that the FAA is going to significantly loosen the reins of drones without any significant privacy protections,” he said.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lifelong Richmond resident has tapped into the Health Brigade — formerly known as the Fan Free Clinic — when she needed it. It was there that she was diagnosed with  fibromyalgia (after previous doctors ignored her pain, she said). It’s also where health care workers helped her tackle her pre-diabetes, high blood pressure and mental health strain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bipartisan cohort of lawmakers has been touring the state in recent months to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/rural-health-committee-hears-from-maternal-health-dental-specialists-in-farmville/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hear from community members like Roane-Bell and healthcare providers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They’ll compile legislative proposals by the end of the year that the General Assembly could take up in the 2025 session. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virginia clinics act as ‘safety net to the safety net’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roane-Bell’s mental health challenges in recent years took her by surprise, she said as her voice cracked in a recent phone call. Therapy has helped her cope with grief and the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I didn&#8217;t realize how damaged I was,” she said as she paused to steady her emotions. “Through the pandemic, I lost a lot of people. I also lost myself, and I didn&#8217;t even realize it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roane-Bell said she might have taken care of her mental health a little sooner if she’d felt open minded to it. Now 60 years old, it’s just not how her generation was raised, she said, or a common topic in Black communities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Black and brown folks, we don’t want to accept or don&#8217;t think we need mental health care,” she explained. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Growing up in public housing in Gilpin Court, Roane-Bell also didn’t feel exposed to resources or more education of the role nutrition plays in health disorders. As an adult, she’s been able to remedy pre-diabetes through nutrition education. This is another area she said the Health Brigade has been helpful for her.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don&#8217;t know a lot of things, because nobody even exposed us to them, you know. As far as health care, we don&#8217;t know where to go to get free health care — so we wind up having diabetes that was never treated or high blood pressure that was never treated,” Roane-Bell explained. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She’s among many under or uninsured people around Virginia to rely on a free clinic. There are over 70 such clinics around the state, and about 30 of them serve patients in rural areas, Virginia Association of Free and Charitable Clinics CEO Rufus Phillips said at a June rural healthcare committee meeting in Farmville. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group’s tour has highlighted the need for increased state funding to bolster free clinics statewide. As more and more people have been visiting free clinics in recent years, clinics haven’t received an increase in state funding since 2016. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phillips hopes the state can allocate an additional $5 million. This, he said, would pretty much put the clinics back at the 2016 funding levels, considering the state of inflation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Free clinics typically service uninsured people and people whose income is 200% below federal poverty levels. But others have tapped into the clinics as they’ve found themselves between jobs, facing long appointment wait times through Medicaid, or as people have become ineligible for Medicaid this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usually, Medicaid recipients have their eligibility checked annually — a process that had been </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/medicaid-unwinding-texas-rcna131366" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on pause amid the pandemic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But this year began an “unwinding” process as the eligibility checks were restored. About </span><a href="https://www.kff.org/report-section/medicaid-enrollment-and-unwinding-tracker-overview/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">500,000 people were disenrolled in Virginia this year while 1.5 million had their coverage renewed.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s also the added factor of inflation and the rising cost of living placing some healthcare options out of reach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are the safety net to the safety net,” Phillips said of the clinics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Rebecca Butler, VP of communications at the association, operating costs are up 170% from 2016 to 2023. Clinic usage was also up 28% in fiscal year 2023 from 2022. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Pandemic pinch</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Phillips said, another contributing factor to the rise in use of free clinics is what are dubbed “ALICE patients” — or asset-limited, income-constrained, employed people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[This demographic] contributed to patient uptick before [the] pandemic,” he said. “The pinch is much greater on what we used to know as the middle class.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the pinch has been felt by Virginia’s free clinics too, as they’ve served more patients over time, exacerbated by the pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the pandemic subsided and restrictions eased, Phillips said the ALICE demographic and others began to rely on the clinics more as “people had put off care” during lockdowns. He also noted the rise in mental health concerns that had, in some cases, been exacerbated by the pandemic too. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even in periods when Roane-Bell had insurance, she’s felt the weight of co-pays and understands how it leads to putting off care. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s like ‘hold up — Do you put gas in the car? Do you buy something to eat? Or do you pay your co-payment?’” she asked. “And guess what happens?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, healthcare can’t be put off forever, and people eventually find their way to free clinics if they have nowhere else to turn. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And though the Virginia Association of Free and Charitable Clinics is asking the state for more money, Phillips said his organization is also in support of other policies at the state, local and federal level, such as improving Medicaid reimbursement. This could help other providers accept Medicaid patients in the first place and take some strain off of free clinics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s been a relatively new phenomenon,” Phillips said of patients who seek out care at free clinics because they have had trouble finding providers who accept their Medicaid. “Clinics don’t want to hold onto those patients if they can find a Medicaid provider.” </span></p>

<p>Pharmacist Mark Mikhael has lost 50 pounds over the past 12 months. He no longer has diabetes and finds himself “at my ideal body weight,” with his cholesterol below 200 for the first time in 20 years. “I feel fantastic,” he said.</p>
<p>Like millions of others, Mikhael credits the new class of weight loss drugs. But he isn’t using brand-name Wegovy or Zepbound. Mikhael, CEO of Orlando, Florida-based Olympia Pharmaceuticals, has been getting by with his own supply: injecting himself with copies of the drugs formulated by his company.</p>
<aside class="block--sidebar alignright ">
<div class="wp-block-kaiser-health-news-partner block--partner"></div>
</aside>
<p>He’s far from alone. Mikhael and other industry officials estimate that several large compounding pharmacies like his are provisioning up to 2 million American patients with regular doses of semaglutide, the scientific name for Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy, Ozempic, and Rybelsus formulations, or tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Eli Lilly’s Zepbound and Mounjaro.</p>
<p>The drug-making behemoths fiercely oppose that compounding business. Novo Nordisk and Lilly lump the compounders together with internet cowboys and unregulated medical spas peddling bogus semaglutide, and have high-powered legal teams trying to stop them. Novo Nordisk has filed at least 21 lawsuits nationwide against companies making purported copies of its drugs, said Brianna Kelley, a spokesperson for the company, and urges doctors to avoid them. The FDA, too, has cautioned about the potential danger of the compounds, and leading obesity medicine groups starkly warn patients against their use.</p>
<p>But this isn’t an illegal black market, though it has shades of gray.</p>
<p>The FDA allows and even encourages compounding pharmacies to produce and sell copycats when a drug is in short supply, and the wildly popular GLP-1 drugs have enduring shortages — first reported in March 2022 for semaglutide and in December 2022 for tirzepatide. The drugs have registered unprecedented success in weight loss. They are also showing promise against heart, kidney, and liver diseases and are being tested against conditions as diverse as Alzheimer’s disease and drug addiction.</p>
<p>In recent years, the U.S. health care system has come to depend on compounding pharmacies, many of which are run as nonprofits, to plug supply holes of crucial drugs like cancer medicines cisplatin, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil.</p>
<p>Most compounded drugs are old, cheap generics. Semaglutide and tirzepatide, on the other hand, are under patent and earn Novo Nordisk and Lilly billions of dollars a year. Sales of the diabetes and weight loss drugs this year made Novo Nordisk Europe’s most valuable company and Lilly the world’s biggest pharmaceutical company.</p>
<p>While the companies can’t keep up with demand, they heatedly dispute the right of compounders to make and sell copies. Lilly spokesperson Kristiane Silva Bello said her company was “deeply concerned” about “serious health risks” from compounded drugs that “should not be on the market.”</p>
<p>Yet marketed they are. Even Hims &amp; Hers Health — the telemedicine prescriber that got its start with erectile dysfunction drugs — is now <a href="https://news.hims.com/newsroom/affordability-and-safety-how-hims-hers-is-delivering-a-new-glp-1-experience-through-the-scale-of-our-platform" target="_blank">peddling compounded semaglutide</a>. It ran ads for the drugs during NBA playoff games. (According to a Hunterbrook Media report, Hims &amp; Hers’ semaglutide supplier has faced legal scrutiny.)</p>
<p>The compounded forms are significantly cheaper than the branded drugs. Patients pay about $100 to $450 a month, compared with list prices of roughly $1,000 to $1,400 for Lilly and Novo Nordisk products.</p>
<p>Five compounders and distributors interviewed for this article said they conduct due diligence on every lot of semaglutide or tirzepatide they buy or produce, upholding standards of purity, sterility, and consistency similar to those practiced in the commercial drug industry. Compounders operate under strict federal and state standards, they noted.</p>
<p>However, the raw materials used in the compounded forms may differ from those produced for Novo Nordisk and Lilly, said GLP-1 co-inventor Jens Juul Holst, of the University of Copenhagen, adding that care must be taken in drug production lest it cause potentially harmful immune reactions.</p>
<p>To date, according to FDA spokespeople, reports of side effects from taking compounded versions haven’t raised major alarms. But everyone with knowledge of the industry, including the compounders themselves, worry that a single batch of a poorly made drug could kill or maim people and destroy confidence in their business.</p>
<p>“I liken the compounding industry to the airline industry,” Mikhael said. “When you have an airline crash, it hurts everybody.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Warnings from the past</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The industry endured just such a catastrophe in 2012, when the New England Compounding Center released a contaminated injectable steroid that killed at least 64 people and harmed hundreds more.</p>
<p>In response, Congress and the FDA had strengthened oversight. Mikhael’s company is an outsourcing facility, or 503B compounding pharmacy — so-named for a section of the 2013 law that set new requirements for drug compounders. The companies are licensed to make slightly different versions of FDA-approved drugs in response to shortages or a patient’s special needs.</p>
<p>The law created two classes of compounding pharmacies: The FDA regulates the larger 503B compounders with standards like commercial drug companies, while 503A pharmacies make smaller lots of drugs and are largely overseen by state boards of pharmacy.</p>
<p>The 503A facilities also are producing compounded semaglutide and tirzepatide for hundreds of thousands of patients. Like the 503Bs, these operations take the active ingredient, produced as a powder in FDA-registered factories, mostly in China, then reconstitute it with sterile water and an antimicrobial in small glass vials.</p>
<p>Together, the compounding pharmacies may account for up to 30% of the semaglutide sold in the U.S., Mikhael said, although he cautions that is a “wild ballpark figure” since no one, including the FDA, is tracking sales in the industry.</p>
<p>The compounders say the companies should increase production if they’re worried about competition. Like the dozens of other drugs they produce for hospitals and medical practices, the compounders say, the two diet drugs are essential products.</p>
<p>“If you don’t want a 503B facility to make a copy, it’s pretty simple: Don’t go short,” said Lee Rosebush, chair of a trade association for 503B pharmacies. “FDA created this system because these are necessary drugs.”</p>
<p>Novo Nordisk hasn’t specified why it can’t keep up with demand, but the bottleneck apparently lies in the company’s inability to fill and sterilize enough of its special drug auto-injectors, said Evan Seigerman, a managing director at BMO Capital Markets.</p>
<p>The company announced June 24 that it was investing $4.1 billion in new production lines at its Clayton, North Carolina, site. The FDA last year issued a warning over procedural violations at the site and separate cautions at an Indiana facility that Novo Nordisk took over recently.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Compounding for dummies</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://dps.fda.gov/ndc/searchresult?selection=unfinished_product&amp;content=NONPROPRIETARYNAME&amp;type=Semaglutide" target="_blank">At least 28 companies</a> mostly in China, are registered with the FDA to produce or distribute semaglutide. At least half the companies have entered the market in the past 12 months, driving the raw material’s price down by 35%, according to Scott Welch, who runs a 503A pharmacy in Arlington, Virginia.</p>
<p>Compounders can buy powdered semaglutide from some U.S. distributors for less than $4,000 a gram, said Matthew Johnson, president and CEO of distributor Pharma Source Direct. That comes out to as little as $10 per weekly 2.5-microgram dose – not including overhead and other costs.</p>
<p>While Ozempic or Wegovy patients use a Novo Nordisk device to inject the drug, patients using compounded products draw them from a vial with a small needle, like the device diabetics use for insulin.</p>
<p>Some medical practices provide the compounded drug to patients as part of a weight loss package, with markups. Last July, Tabitha Ries, a single mother of six who works as a home health care aide in Garfield, Washington, found an online clinic that charged her $1,000 for three months of semaglutide along with counseling. She has lost 35 pounds.</p>
<p>She gets the drug from Mindful Weight Loss, a mostly telehealth-based operation led by physician Vivek Gupta of Manhattan Beach, California. Gupta said he’s prescribed the weight loss drugs to 1,500 patients, with about 60% using compounded versions from a 503A pharmacy.</p>
<p>He hasn’t seen any essential difference in patients using the branded and compounded forms, although “some people say the compounding is a little less effective,” Gupta said.</p>
<p>There’s some risk in using the non-FDA-approved product, he acknowledged, and he requires patients to sign an informed consent waiver.</p>
<p>“Nothing in life is without risk, but I would also argue that the status quo is not safe for people who need the medicine and can’t get it,” he said. “They’re constantly triggered by all this food that’s causing their weight to go up and their sugar to go high, increasing their insulin resistance and affecting their limbs and eyes.”</p>
<p>Compounding semaglutide is a helpful sideline for pharmacists like him, Welch said, especially given the pinch on drug sale revenue that has led many independents to close in recent years. He figures he earns 95% of his revenue from compounding drugs, rather than traditional prescriptions.</p>
<p>It’s important to distinguish compounded semaglutide from unregulated powders sold as “generic Ozempic” and the like, which may be contaminated or counterfeit, said FDA spokesperson Amanda Hils. But since compounded forms of the drug are not FDA-approved, those who make, prescribe, or use them also should have “an increased level of responsibility or awareness,” she said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Corporate battles</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.novonordisk-us.com/media/news-archive/news-details.html?id=168519" target="_blank">Novo Nordisk</a> and <a href="https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-warns-patients-about-counterfeit-and-compounded-medicines#:~:text=Lilly%20has%20discovered%20compounded%20drugs,than%20Lilly's%20FDA%2Dapproved%20medicines" target="_blank">Lilly</a>, in lawsuits each company has filed against competitors, say their own testing has found bacteria and other impurities in products made by compounding pharmacies. The companies also report patent infringement, but compounders, pointing to the FDA loophole for drugs in shortage, appear to have defeated that argument for now.</p>
<p>When the FDA removes the drugs from the shortage list, 503B compounders must immediately stop selling them. Smaller compounders may be able to produce their products for a reduced number of patients, said Scott Brunner, CEO of the Alliance for Pharmacy Compounding, which represents 503A compounders.</p>
<p>The evaporation of the compounded drug supply could come as a shock to patients.</p>
<p>“I dread it,” said David Wertheimer, an internist in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, who prescribes compounded semaglutide to some patients. “People are not going to be able to plunk down a grand every month. A lot of people will go off the drug, and that’s a shame.”</p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce/For The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summertime in Virginia: Temps are sweltering and show no sign of abating. Children are out of school and bored. Various fruits and vegetables are ripe for the picking, even in this hellish heat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And cases of COVID-19,</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths/?state=US" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the scourge of our nation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the planet, tick up around the commonwealth. It’s become a rite of the season, as common as antsy kids, forever-running air conditioning and respites at the beach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We should get used to the seasonal increase in infections and protect ourselves as best as possible. That means: boosting our vaccines – or getting an initial one</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2021/06/16/overcoming-vaccine-hesistancy-with-fomo/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">if we’ve stubbornly refused</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; practicing good hygiene, including washing our hands frequently; staying home if sick; and testing to detect infections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The situation now, thankfully, is far from the overwhelming terror at the height of the pandemic that began in early 2020. COVID-19</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths/?state=US" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">killed more than 1.13 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> people in the United States and infected more than 104 million, or less than one-third of the U.S. population.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, “There are people severely sick from COVID-19,” Heather Harmon-Sloan, the COVID-19 unit lead for the Virginia Department of Health, told me this week.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“We still see people pass away.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/see-the-numbers/covid-19-in-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state listed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> no coronavirus deaths in the weeks ending June 29 and July 6. That contrasted, though, with 40 deaths reported across Virginia in the week ending Feb. 10, according to the health department.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/covid-19-virginia-pandemic-flirt-variant-vaccination/article_fcb33672-3eef-11ef-902a-b7bb2497ced7.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Richmond Times-Dispatch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently reported COVID-19 numbers rose in June and that the new FLiRT variant is circulating. The COVID-19 “parent” variant is SARS-CoV-2.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On June 8, the state’s confirmed cases numbered 638, and they had nearly doubled by July 6. Those numbers, though, were dwarfed by the total in December, when 5,600 cases were reported in Virginia. The newest variant has the same symptoms of upper respiratory problems, Harmon-Sloan said. Antiviral treatments should be effective.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A troubling sign is the total number of people who got the 2023-24 vaccine in Virginia, she said. A new vaccine for 2024-25 will target the FLiRT variant and probably will come out in September. The current one, though, is still available for those who didn’t get vaccinated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some 91% of Virginians has gotten</span><a href="https://usafacts.org/visualizations/covid-vaccine-tracker-states/state/virginia/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">at least one dose of the vaccine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Seventy-seven percent were considered fully vaccinated as of May 2023. About</span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/epidemiology/respiratory-diseases-in-virginia/data/vaccines/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">1.34 million Virginians</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> got the latest COVID-19 vaccine, according to state records. (The state population is 8.7 million.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In order to update and restore people’s protection and immunity,” Harmon-Sloan told me, “it’s important to get the latest vaccine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The news on infections and vaccinations was released about the same time the agency announced that a</span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/news/2024-regional-news-releases/southwest-virginia-health-districts-conducting-long-covid-study/" target="_blank"> l<span style="font-weight: 400;">ong COVID surveillance project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which began in October in the Central Virginia Health District, would now be open to all residents in Southwest Virginia. Long COVID means someone is still sick at least two months after getting COVID-19.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re just hoping to better understand how long COVID has affected people in their daily lives,” said Cali Anderson, senior epidemiologist for the Central Health District. “And identify opportunities to improve long COVID resources.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Symptoms can include trouble breathing, coughing and feeling weak and tired. The project has so far detected 141 cases of long COVID and fewer than five deaths in the Central Health District, which comprises the Lynchburg city and the counties of Amherst, Appomattox, Bedford and Campbell.</span></p>

Tim Kaine has</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbYVCXAUC1c" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">publicly announced he has the condition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Democrat has co-sponsored legislation to support long COVID sufferers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February, the National Institutes of Health announced</span><a href="https://nih.gov/about-nih/who-we-are/nih-director/statements/nih-bolster-recover-long-covid-research-efforts-through-infusion-515-million" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">it was redirecting $515 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in federal money for the RECOVER initiative. The nationwide research program targets long COVID. The CDC says one in nine adults in the country who have had COVID-19 continue to suffer from long COVID.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nowadays, it’s comforting to go out to stores, restaurants and places of worship and feel we’re not taking our lives in our hands. Mask-wearing is mostly optional – and doesn’t cause controversy, thankfully. COVID is now considered “endemic,” what the CDC calls “the amount of a particular disease that is usually present in a community.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But COVID </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">hasn’t</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> disappeared.</span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">People ages 65 and over and with certain medical conditions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> must continue to monitor the latest news and updates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be smart. Get the vaccine. Realize others might refuse – and could be infected. Be cognizant when in poorly ventilated buildings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re in a much better place today than in 2020 and 2021. Let’s work to keep it that way.</span></p>

(Credit: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Rocky Mountain Lab)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As COVID-19 rates rise in Virginia and around the nation this summer, the prevalence of long COVID is underreported. Virginia’s health department wants to better understand it, so it’s about to conduct a new study. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest study will focus on Southwest Virginia residents after an initial analysis on Central Virginia last fall.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/long-term-effects/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long COVID </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">is diagnosed when symptoms persist for months or longer after a person’s initial viral infection. It’s something that John Bolecek of Richmond unfortunately knows very well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After his family’s January 2022 bout with the virus, Bolecek said the disease “derailed” so many aspects of his life. He experienced insomnia, weight loss, and constant malaise. The fitness enthusiast had to trade his arduous runs and bike rides for gentle walks, though he often must rest most of the time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My life looks nothing like it used to. I was an employed, active father of two who loved taking his kids on bike rides, hiking, and adventuring,” he wrote in a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/06/a-life-derailed-by-long-covid/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">guest column</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for Virginia Mercury last year. “If you see me out in the world, I may look normal, but just know I’m still suffering, as are many others experiencing long COVID, and I’m expending my very limited energy budget in strategic ways so my family can function as normally as possible.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_36135" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/06/a-life-derailed-by-long-covid/newriverbikepack/" rel="attachment wp-att-36135"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-36135" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/newriverbikepack-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/newriverbikepack-300x225.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/newriverbikepack-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/newriverbikepack-768x576.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/newriverbikepack-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/newriverbikepack-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  John Bolecek on a bikepacking trip along the New River Trail, May 2021. (John Bolecek)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With long COVID a relatively new medical phenomenon, his symptoms also overlap with another lesser-studied condition — </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/about/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With little known about either condition, Bolecek is hopeful that lawmakers can bolster research through funding.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/content/uploads/sites/81/2024/07/CV-LC-Report.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">preliminary report </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">based on interviews with 68 participants from last fall’s central Virginia-anchored inquiry found that 88% of the participants with long COVID symptoms were not up to date on their vaccinations. At the onset of Bolecek’s contraction of COVID and subsequent symptoms, he was vaccinated and boosted, but he did have asthma. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">High blood pressure was common among participants and the majority of people with long COVID symptoms reported severe or moderate symptoms during the initial infection that may have triggered the lingering symptoms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such triggers included physical activity, stress and mental activity. About 57% of participants were able to work, but with difficulty, while others needed to reduce hours, work remotely, or found themselves terminated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine has also struggled with long COVID symptoms and has used his personal experience to spearheaded efforts at the national level, including research, to address the disease. . </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year the National Institutes of Health </span><a href="https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/who-we-are/nih-director/statements/nih-bolster-recover-long-covid-research-efforts-through-infusion-515-million" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">redirected $515 million </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in federal funding for the RECOVER Initiative, first launched in 2021. By the time funding was running low last summer, </span><a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/08/09/long-covid-nih-trials/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advocates had been skeptical of the trials conducted so far</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bolecek believes a permanent office should be created to focus on long COVID research and treatment because “without a permanent program, there is little incentive for new doctors and academic researchers to specialize in this field.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For his part in Congress, Kaine continues to press for passage of the bipartisan </span><a href="https://www.kaine.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/long_covid_support_act_bill_text.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long COVID Support Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which he and U.S. Sen. Todd Young, R-Indiana, introduced last summer.  If passed, the bill would authorize centralization of data sets regarding patients with long COVID and related conditions for future research. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m glad that the Virginia Department of Health is conducting this study and that the Biden Administration has taken steps to better support Americans with Long COVID,” he said in an email. “ I will keep pushing to pass my bipartisan bill to accelerate research on Long COVID, educate providers, and expand resources to patients.”</span></p>

<p>The idea is similar to a local utility board: a public group that sets rules or makes recommendations to ensure that what they’re regulating — in this case, prescription medications — is affordable.</p>
<p>Some state laws have authorized these watchdogs to regulate drug prices for certain groups of people, such as state employees or those with Medicaid plans. Legislatures in a few states — Colorado, Minnesota and Washington — granted boards broader power to oversee drug prices for everyone in the state.</p>
<p>Over the past five years, <a href="https://www.lexisnexis.com/community/insights/legal/capitol-journal/b/state-net/posts/potentially-big-year-for-prescription-drug-affordability-boards" target="_blank" rel="noopener">11 mostly Democratic-led states</a> have created prescription drug affordability boards, and the model is picking up steam nationwide. Just this year, <a href="https://nashp.org/state-tracker/2024-state-legislation-to-lower-pharmaceutical-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lawmakers in 14 more states</a> proposed legislation to assemble their own boards.</p>
<p>The boards’ duties vary from state to state, but they’re usually <a href="https://www.lexisnexis.com/community/insights/legal/capitol-journal/b/state-net/posts/potentially-big-year-for-prescription-drug-affordability-boards" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tasked</a> with identifying medicines that could be considered unaffordable for most patients, finding ways that state health plans or Medicaid programs can reduce drug spending, and, in some cases, capping the amount of money that insurers have to pay for prescription drugs.</p>
<p>“Drug pricing is an extremely complex system, and you need experts in the space that understand how everything works,” said Andrew York, executive director of Maryland’s Prescription Drug Affordability Board. “Every state is proposing different laws and regulations to make prescription drugs more affordable and sometimes they pull in different directions.”</p>
<p>But consumers have yet to see significant savings. Most boards have had a slow rollout as they hammer out administrative and funding issues that come with creating a new state entity.</p>
<p>The boards that have made the most progress, such as the one in Colorado, are facing pushback from <a href="https://coloradonewsline.com/briefs/new-colorado-board-opts-against-price-controls-for-high-cost-cystic-fibrosis-drug/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patient advocacy groups</a> concerned regulations could hurt access to some medications, and from <a href="https://coloradosun.com/2024/03/25/amgen-lawsuit-enbrel-pdab/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drug manufacturers</a>, <a href="https://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2024/02/07/hobbs-legislature-should-remember-pharmacy-benefits-helps-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pharmacy benefit managers</a> and others in the prescription drug supply chain whose profits stand to take a hit.</p>
<p>“We’re not anti-business,” said Anthony Lourey, a former commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Human Services who now chairs Minnesota’s Prescription Drug Affordability Board. “We want [these businesses] to be successful, but this marketplace is not transparent enough for people to feel like they’re getting a fair shake. Free market forces really only work when there is equal information on both sides of the equation. When there’s so much that is not transparent, it takes a public actor to bring about transparency.”</p>
<p>About <a href="https://www.kff.org/health-costs/poll-finding/public-opinion-on-prescription-drugs-and-their-prices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">6 in 10 American adults</a> take at least one prescription medication, according to polling last year from nonprofit research organization KFF. And most adults, regardless of political affiliation, told KFF the government hasn’t done enough to limit the price of prescription drugs.</p>
<p>Maryland’s board has held public meetings across the state as it reviews medications it’s identified as being potentially unaffordable. York said members have heard from struggling patients at every stop.</p>
<p>“They’re choosing whether they can pay their rent or afford their prescriptions.”</p>
<h4 class="editorialSubhed">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Sky-high costs</h4>

	</h4>
<p>Prescription drugs in the United States, on average, cost <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/international-prescription-drug-price-comparisons" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than twice as much</a> as they do in similar high-income countries. Of the thousands of drugs that increased in price in the U.S. from 2022-2023, the average increase was <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/changes-list-prices-prescription-drugs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15.2%, far higher than the rate of inflation</a>, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" title="“‘Compounded’ weight-loss drugs are a growing problem for state regulators” — Stateline" src="https://stateline.org/2024/07/08/compounded-weight-loss-drugs-are-a-growing-problem-for-state-regulators/embed/#?secret=6VYFG06FjG#?secret=NbuoDKcm3I" width="500" height="440" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-scripts" data-secret="NbuoDKcm3I" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>Out-of-pocket costs vary, depending on the particular drug and a person’s insurance. While nearly two-thirds of people surveyed by KFF in 2023 said affording prescription drugs is at least somewhat easy, 3 in 10 reported <a href="https://www.kff.org/health-costs/poll-finding/public-opinion-on-prescription-drugs-and-their-prices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not taking their medicine as prescribed</a> due to costs. That share rose to 4 in 10 for certain groups, including young adults, Hispanic adults and people with low incomes.</p>
<p>Nine of the states that currently have boards are Democratic-controlled: Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon and Washington. The other two — New Hampshire and Ohio — are Republican-controlled.</p>
<p>This year, Democratic-sponsored state legislation on prescription drug affordability boards popped up in red states such as Iowa and South Carolina, blue states including Connecticut and Rhode Island, and swing states Arizona and Michigan.</p>

<p>In Virginia, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed legislation that passed both the state Senate and House — sponsored by Democrats, although the Senate version <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/04/09/skill-games-virginia-youngkin-bill-signing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had a Republican co-sponsor</a> — that would have established a prescription drug affordability board. In his veto message, Younkin said the idea wasn’t proven to lower prices and could limit patients’ access to treatment.</p>
<h4 class="editorialSubhed">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How it’s done</h4>

	</h4>
<p>State prescription drug affordability boards all share a similar mission — reduce the cost of prescription drugs for consumers — but their degree of power and the methods they use vary from state to state.</p>
<p>Some are independent, while others operate as departments within larger state agencies.</p>
<p>Minnesota’s board, created under a law enacted last year, has what are likely the broadest powers of any state board created so far. It’s one of just four boards that can cap prescription drug prices, and one of only three that can influence drug pricing for all consumers, not just those on state health plans. The nine-member commission is in the process of hiring an executive director before it begins reviewing prescription drug costs.</p>
<p>Maryland was <a href="https://health.maryland.gov/mmcp/Documents/MMAC/2019/04_April/Summary%20of%20Prescription%20Drug%20Affordability%20Board.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the first state</a> to create a prescription drug affordability board, in 2019. Democratic state legislators pushed for the law, which created <a href="https://msa.maryland.gov/msa/mdmanual/25ind/html/55prescript.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a five-member commission</a> appointed by the governor and other state leaders. The board has had a slow start due to funding setbacks and the administrative work it took to get a new agency up and running.</p>
<p>But now, after several months spent researching more than 1,200 drugs, the board has narrowed its focus to <a href="https://pdab.maryland.gov/Pages/board-selected-da-info.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">six drugs</a> that it’s currently putting through a cost review.</p>
<p>“It’s a chance for the board to do a deep dive on specific drugs and get the data they need to understand if [the drugs] are causing affordability problems,” York said.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" title="“An obscure drug discount program stifles use of federal lifeline by rural hospitals” — Stateline" src="https://stateline.org/2024/05/28/an-obscure-drug-discount-program-stifles-use-of-federal-lifeline-by-rural-hospitals/embed/#?secret=ctsTigjcEE#?secret=nKNNAwwKrd" width="500" height="461" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-scripts" data-secret="nKNNAwwKrd" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>Four are diabetes drugs: Ozempic, Trulicity, Farxiga and Jardiance. The other two are Dupixent, used to treat asthma, and Skyrizi, which treats psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and Crohn’s disease.</p>
<p>These are <a href="https://pdab.maryland.gov/Documents/comments/AARP%20PDAB%20cost%20reviews%20comment%20letter.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drugs</a> that AARP Maryland has said are “widely used, very expensive, and pose extreme hardship for state residents who cannot afford them.”</p>
<p>The average cost to commercial insurers per patient for the asthma medication Dupixent, for example, is nearly $32,000 per year. The board found that Dupixent’s <a href="https://pdab.maryland.gov/Pages/cost_review_process.aspx#Drug:~:text=Drugs%20Referred%20to%20the%20Stakeholder%20Council%2D%20Dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">average out-of-pocket cost</a> for a person with commercial insurance in 2022 was nearly $2,500.</p>
<p>If the board decides a drug is unaffordable, one of its options is to cap how much Maryland’s Medicaid and state employee health plans would pay for the drug. That recommendation would have to be approved by legislators.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, a group of Maryland lawmakers introduced a bill to expand the board’s authority to cap or reduce prices for all Marylanders, not just those on the state health plan. It <a href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Legislation/Details/SB0388" target="_blank" rel="noopener">died</a> in a Senate committee, amid <a href="https://marylandmatters.org/2024/02/13/phrma-representatives-say-its-not-the-time-to-expand-prescription-drug-affordability-board-authority/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pushback from the pharmaceutical industry</a>.</p>
<p>In the meantime, there’s work the board can do to help more patients afford their medications that doesn’t involve cost caps, York said.</p>
<p>“What we find in a lot of situations is that there are resources already available to a patient to help them afford their drug, but it’s all super-complicated,” said York. “It’s a lot to ask of patients who don’t live and breathe drug pricing programs.”</p>
<p>The board has established an initiative to help people find potential discounts and rebates that might be available, and is working on an insulin affordability program that partners with manufacturers to help patients access lower-priced insulin.</p>
<h4 class="editorialSubhed">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Pushback and a lawsuit</h4>

<p>In February, Colorado’s board <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2024/02/16/enbrel-unaffordable-colorado-prescription-drug-affordability-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">became the first in the nation</a> to officially declare a drug unaffordable. The board voted unanimously to kick-start a process to set an upper payment limit for Enbrel, a popular drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and other conditions.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" title="“This State Has a Bundle of Ideas to Lower Drug Prices” — Stateline" src="https://stateline.org/2019/05/07/this-state-has-a-bundle-of-ideas-to-lower-drug-prices/embed/#?secret=VG52rV54Pu#?secret=3OJV9mm5Es" width="500" height="348" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-scripts" data-secret="3OJV9mm5Es" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>Enbrel costs insurers <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xdHNz_KHSB5uL6o2DDSqcKOZbCsmRXq2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly $47,000 per patient</a> per year, according to the Colorado All Payer Claims Database. Most patients and caregivers surveyed by the Colorado affordability board said Enbrel’s cost made it difficult to access the drug, and some reported they still had trouble affording it even with financial assistance. Pharmaceutical manufacturer Amgen reported <a href="https://www.amgen.com/newsroom/press-releases/2024/02/amgen-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2023-financial-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3.65 billion</a> in U.S. sales of Enbrel last year.</p>
<p>A month after the decision, Amgen <a href="https://coloradosun.com/2024/03/25/amgen-lawsuit-enbrel-pdab/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sued Colorado</a>, arguing the board’s actions were unconstitutional and asking the court to strike down major parts of the law that created the board.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Colorado’s board has continued reviewing drugs. Last month, it declared arthritis medications <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/health-law-and-business/colorado-drug-pricing-board-says-j-js-stelara-is-unaffordable" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stelara</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kFpEkkkgSNPXKmBCbhn2QGikuNc65FXo/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cosentyx</a> unaffordable.</p>
<p>Back in Minnesota, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the nation’s largest trade group lobbying on behalf of pharmaceutical companies, <a href="https://cfb.mn.gov/reports-and-data/viewers/lobbying/lobbying-organizations/3381/2024.1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spent nearly $1.3 million</a> lobbying state lawmakers last year as they were debating that state’s bill to create a prescription drug affordability board. The trade group <a href="https://phrma.org/Blog/Government-price-setting-boards-Why-Minnesota-needs-to-take-a-better-approach?utm_campaign=2024-q2-pri-2024PriceSettingMinnesotaSearchWCMN1&amp;utm_medium=pai_srh_cpc&amp;utm_source=ggl&amp;utm_content=mn-pat-soc_txt-2024PriceSettingMinnesotaSearchWCMN1&amp;utm_term=mn%20health%20care&amp;utm_campaign=&amp;utm_source=adwords&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;hsa_acc=8523309176&amp;hsa_cam=21294770580&amp;hsa_grp=168252105971&amp;hsa_ad=699856441598&amp;hsa_src=g&amp;hsa_tgt=kwd-380915410695&amp;hsa_kw=mn%20health%20care&amp;hsa_mt=b&amp;hsa_net=adwords&amp;hsa_ver=3&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwqMO0BhA8EiwAFTLgIJFnRfayrESGRhaaufbbV28hYMtvm5JPzy5nKieYcKogNRqx-OVL-BoCldoQAvD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">says</a> government price setting threatens the development of new medicines and that existing boards have yet to deliver savings to consumers.</p>
<p>“There will be pushback and there probably will be a court challenge, and that’s OK,” said Lourey, of Minnesota’s affordability board. “States are the laboratories of invention. When you’re inventing, it’s not going to be uniformly agreed what the boundaries are. So we’ll learn from the other states. We’re watching, reading, paying attention, taking note.”</p>
<p>He and York both said their boards are hoping to keep lines of communication open with varying stakeholders, including pharmacy benefit managers and drug manufacturers.</p>
<p>“In our minds, there is no bad guy in this space,” York said. “Everyone in the supply chain is reacting to exactly the incentives that our payment system provides.”</p>

(Thanasis Zovoilis/Getty Images)</p><p>As part of President Joe Biden’s initiative to reduce maternal mortality rates and improve health outcomes in underserved communities, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced new policy<a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-proposes-policies-reduce-maternal-mortality-advance-health-equity-and" target="_blank"> proposals</a> that would require hospitals to adhere to more rigorous maternal care standards or risk losing their ability to participate in Medicare.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2024-15087.pdf" target="_blank">proposed rule</a>, the changes would cost close to $4.5 billion over 10 years, with an average annual cost of $70,671 to individual hospitals. The policies would represent the first attempts at federally prescribed maternal health standards for hospitals, and include baseline requirements for organization, staffing, and delivery of care within obstetrical units, as well as transfer protocols, emergency services readiness and annual staff training on evidence-based maternal health practices and cultural considerations. The requirements would apply to critical access hospitals, which is a federal designation for a clinic in a rural area, and hospitals that don’t have an obstetrics unit would still be required to have basic emergency equipment and protocols for emergency deliveries.</p>
<p>Particularly in the <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/dobbs-effect-today-abortion-ballot-initiatives-expected-higher-mortality-more-litigation" target="_blank">two years since</a> the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision allowing states to regulate abortion, there has been more attention paid to rising maternal mortality rates around the country, which have long been higher in states that now have near-total abortion bans, including Mississippi, Louisiana and Arkansas. Those states also have high numbers of Black women, who die at much higher rates during and in the year after pregnancy than white women. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated the U.S. maternal mortality rate for 2022 to be <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/maternal-mortality/2022/maternal-mortality-rates-2022.pdf" target="_blank">22.3 deaths per 100,000 live births</a>, one of the highest ratios among developed countries.</p>
<p>“For too long, too many women in the United States have been dying during pregnancy or in the postpartum period, and this crisis has disproportionately affected women of color,” Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said in the release. “(We are) taking additional steps to improve maternal health by strengthening the care new moms and their babies receive at our nation’s hospitals.”</p>
<p>The department requested feedback from hospitals who would be affected by the changes, and so far the response has been mixed. March of Dimes, an organization that has been raising alarm for years about <a href="https://www.marchofdimes.org/maternity-care-deserts-report" target="_blank">maternity care deserts</a> and rising maternal mortality rates, praised the proposal on <a href="https://x.com/MarchofDimes/status/1811789285772685775" target="_blank">social media</a>, saying it was pleased to see the development.</p>
<p>But provider-centric organizations were less enthused in their responses. The American Hospital Association sent a <a href="https://www.aha.org/system/files/media/file/2024/06/aha-comments-on-cms-inpatient-payment-proposal-for-fy-2025-letter-6-5-24.pdf" target="_blank">letter</a> to the federal agency outlining its concerns, which were largely about the costs of implementing the changes, given Medicaid reimbursement rates. The problems contributing to poor maternal outcomes largely occur outside of hospitals, the organization argued, and the agency’s requirements as proposed are “ill-suited” to address them.</p>
<p>“Over 40% of births are paid for by Medicaid, and Medicaid has historically reimbursed less than the cost of providing care,” wrote Ashley Thompson, the AHA’s senior vice president of public policy analysis and development, in a letter. “Payment rates from public payers have not kept pace with inflation, and the cost of providing care has increased dramatically over the last four years. On average, hospitals experienced negative margins (-18% across all payers) for labor and delivery services in 2023.”</p>
<p>Those financial burdens have been cited in the announcement of clinic closures in several states since the Dobbs decision, including three clinics in Idaho, which has a near-total abortion ban. One clinic in a <a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2023/03/17/citing-staffing-issues-and-political-climate-north-idaho-hospital-will-no-longer-deliver-babies/" target="_blank">North Idaho town</a> said the financial concerns on top of the political environment made their situation untenable, while another in a rural area of the state capital said a <a href="https://www.valorhealth.org/discontinuation-of-labor-delivery-services" target="_blank">staffing crisis on top of financial difficulties</a> were what led to its decision to close.</p>
<p>In the letter, Thompson said part of the challenge in improving maternal health is that many factors contributing to adverse outcomes are attributable to high rates of chronic illness, economic issues, including the lack of affordable housing, domestic violence, substance abuse and food insecurity, with often higher rates among those living in rural and underserved communities.</p>
<p>“Although well intentioned, (requirements) for hospital-based obstetrical services will not address the main drivers of maternal morbidity and mortality. Instead, this approach may further compound the problem for many women by negatively affecting the quality of care and accelerating hospital closures in the areas that need hospitals the most,” Thompson wrote.</p>
<p>In a statement to <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/07/11/biden-maternal-health-standards-hospitals-medicare?emci=0c95f697-c53f-ef11-86d2-6045bddbfc4b&amp;emdi=67a1f3f3-3d40-ef11-86c3-6045bdd9e096&amp;ceid=526826" target="_blank">Axios</a>, a representative from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists was also concerned about the effects of the proposed standards on providers.</p>
<p>“[W]e need smart and innovative policy solutions that do not further stress an overstretched health care system,” Lisa Satterfield, ACOG’s senior director of health and payment policy, told the outlet.</p>
<p>The changes, if approved, would take effect on Jan. 1, 2025.</p>

(Getty Images)</p><p>The U.S. House Appropriations Committee voted last week to advance an appropriations <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/AP/AP07/20240627/117475/BILLS-118-SC-AP-FY2025-LaborHHS-FY25LHHSSubcommitteeMark.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bill</a> for the federal Department of Labor that contains a provision to block the implementation of a newly finalized <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/04/18/2024-06920/lowering-miners-exposure-to-respirable-crystalline-silica-and-improving-respiratory-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rule</a> meant to limit coal miners’ exposure to dangerous silica dust.</p>
<p>The bill <a href="https://westvirginiawatch.com/2024/07/01/its-criminal-advocates-decry-congressional-attempt-to-halt-new-silica-rule-meant-to-protect-miners/" target="_blank">previously passed</a> a subcommittee and, on Wednesday, passed the full Appropriations Committee 31-25 with no amendments that would affect the attempt to stop the silica rule. It now advances to the full House, where lawmakers will have the chance to amend it before passage.</p>
<p>The appropriations bill — which outlines how the Department of Labor will allocate its funding for fiscal year 2025 — contains one line of text that prohibits the use of any funding for the implementation of the new silica dust rule.</p>

<p>The federal rule to limit miners’ exposure to silica dust was <a href="https://westvirginiawatch.com/2024/04/16/msha-rule-to-limit-silica-dust-exposure-in-mines-will-be-finalized-this-week/" target="_blank">finalized in April</a> and most of it began to go into effect <a href="https://westvirginiawatch.com/2024/06/03/as-silica-dust-rule-goes-into-effect-experts-advocate-education-for-the-industrys-youngest/" target="_blank">in June</a>. The new rule — initially proposed in July 2023 — implements for the first time ever a separate exposure limit for <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/silica/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">silica dust</a> in mines, cuts the maximum exposure limit to 50 micrograms per cubic meter for a full-shift and creates an “action level” for when exposure comes at 25 micrograms per cubic meter for a full shift. It also establishes uniform exposure monitoring and control requirements for mine operators to follow.</p>
<p>“The new silica dust rule is not perfect, but it is an important step forward to protect the health and safety of hard-working miners,” said Brendan Muckian-Bates, a policy and advocacy associate with the nonprofit Appalachian Citizens’ Law Center, in a <a href="https://appvoices.org/2024/07/10/silica-rule-committee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">news release</a>. “This dangerous provision, however, is a dramatic leap backwards that would put lives at risk and allow the black lung epidemic to continue to spread in spite of decades of advocacy to tackle this crisis. We need every tool possible to protect the health of miners, and we urge every member of Congress — especially House Republicans — with coal miners and those with black lung as constituents to work with their colleagues in deleting this section from the final bill.”</p>
<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 20% of coal miners in Central Appalachia are suffering from black lung — the highest rate <a href="https://archive.cdc.gov/#/details?url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/updates/upd-07-20-18.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detected</a> for the disease in more than 25 years. One in 20 of those coal miners are living with the most severe form of the condition, and fatalities tied to black lung are <a href="https://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2023/02/27/mining-lung-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">steadily increasing</a> in central Appalachia faster than the rest of the country.</p>
<p>Younger coal miners in the region are also being diagnosed with the disease at rates unseen by their predecessors due to a lack of easily accessible coal and an increase in the amount of silica-rich sandstone they have to dig through to reach what remains.</p>
<p>“Miners with black lung and their families have been fighting for protections from deadly silica dust for years. We know that those in the mines are getting sicker faster than ever because of silica dust, and we’re grateful [the Mine Safety and Health Administration] finally took action to help,” said Vonda Robinson, who serves as vice president of the National Black Lung Association, in a news release Wednesday. “It’s very disheartening to see a handful of Washington politicians try and undo all this hard work on a whim. If this policy becomes law, it will put the lives of countless miners at risk. Mining families deserve better, and we urge Congress to throw out this dangerous policy and get to work helping miners, not making their lives much harder.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a school that’s distinct from the general population of students – and possibly in a separate building altogether. Keep the enrollment to no more than about 30 students at a time. Invite hospitals, colleges and other institutions to share their expertise and resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another thing: “People often forget they are schools,” said Finch, a professor at Vanderbilt University and a co-founder of the</span><a href="https://recoveryschools.org/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Association of Recovery Schools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a nonprofit group based in Pennsylvania. Students are “working on high school diplomas, credits, preparing for college, the workforce. … A best practice is they have to provide a solid academic curriculum.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opening such specialized schools is a serious, possibly expensive project. However, it’s one that educational officials should undertake if they plan smartly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">School divisions and their larger communities are helping to rehabilitate young people at a critical time in their lives – and these academies might make the difference in keeping students clean. Costs shouldn’t be ignored; neither should the fact these schools fight alcohol and drug abuse among teenagers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Beach School Board members are weighing such an initiative, and they’ve already identified some public funding. They are leading an effort that could comprise public school students in Virginia Beach, Chesapeake, Norfolk, Portsmouth and Suffolk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carolyn Weems, a longtime Virginia Beach School Board member, is a key proponent. It’s also very personal to her, since Weems lost her</span><a href="https://www.wtkr.com/investigations/lawmakers-discussing-recovery-high-school-in-hampton-roads" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">21-year-old daughter Caitlyn to a drug overdose in 2013</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While in high school, Caitlyn Weems had a soccer injury; she broke her nose and lost three teeth. She became addicted to pain medicine and had taken Oxycontin and Percocet at various times, the elder Weems told me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s unbelievable how much medicine she was on,” Weems said, noting much of it was prescribed by doctors. “It was so hard to get her help.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The General Assembly approved $750,000 over two years for a recovery academy in the region. Virginia Beach also has committed $500,000</span><a href="https://www.wavy.com/news/virginia/virginia-to-receive-over-16m-in-juul-agreement/?fbclid=IwY2xjawD7e19leHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHaSycTRJO3nwIkUi2uMO0dfR5AzRoJJ1s6FeRN31-zaKN9_MS1zTXcWdvg_aem_qt2gQQDtO9qafWGe2jSQDQ" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">from the state settlement with JUUL, the e-cigarette brand</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, involving the firm’s marketing and sales practices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other details about the proposed academy, though, haven’t been decided. They include how much money each city would contribute; where the academy would be located; and how transportation would be worked out.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2024/1/HB30/Introduced/CR/124/13c/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loudoun County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is also considering a recovery high school.</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/07/05/virginia-prepares-to-launch-its-first-recovery-high-school/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Such schools have been around for decades</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, though they’ve generally been clustered in about half of the states. The academies often do random drug testing to ensure the students adhere to the rules.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://drugabusestatistics.org/teen-drug-use/#virginia" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Center for Drug Abuse Statistics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reports that 9% of all 12- to 17-year-olds in Virginia used alcohol in the past month, and 7% of the age group reported using drugs. One bright spot: Teenagers in the commonwealth were 16.5% less likely to have used drugs in the past month than the average American teen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hampton Roads’ developing plan will study the</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C56ivS1e9uE&amp;t=11s" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Chesterfield Recovery Academy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a possible model. The academy opened in August 2022,  and is a regional effort headed by Chesterfield Public Schools. It’s the first recovery school in the state, and Chesterfield’s is one of about 45 such schools nationwide. The General Assembly contributed</span><a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2023/RD671/PDF" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly $1.4 million to help start the Chesterfield academy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A recovery school is a good asset for any school division,” Justin Savoy, Chesterfield academy program coordinator, told me. “Unfortunately, the ease of access to drugs and alcohol has increased a lot for students.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The school takes up to 50 students but often has just 20, said Savoy, whose professional background is in mental health and substance abuse. The staff includes two academic facilitators, three clinicians and a peer recovery specialist, who is someone often maintaining sobriety. A white retriever named Lettie, a therapy dog, is part of the staff and encourages calm. Enrollment requires students to have abstained from drugs and alcohol for at least 20 days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This past spring, 10 students graduated, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Savoy and two of his students participated in a White House panel on recovery strategies in 2023. “There’s a lot of times when my recovery was impossible,”</span><a href="http://www.youtube.com/live/KZfZiB-WDQ8?si=yojbLf3uIIgXVSJe" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Spain told the audience</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “I spent the time. I put in the work.” He said he was scheduled to join the military this year, to the cheers of attendees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Durchslag is director of the</span><a href="https://mtcs.org/pease/about/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">P.E.A.S.E. Academy in Minneapolis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and he’s been at the recovery school since 1995. “Many of the schools operate on a shoestring budget,” he told me, but added, “they are needed resources.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nor are they panaceas. Some students, Durchslag said, would be better treated in other settings that offer different services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What they represent is hope, for students and parents alike. That a teen might kick the habit and stay that way. That he’ll have support when he thinks about backsliding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That kind of school “would have been perfect for Caitlyn,” said Weems, the school board member.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s worth the effort to begin the academy, she added. “The things we’re doing now aren’t working.” </span></p>

Charlotte Rene Woods / Virginia Mercury</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results of a </span><a href="https://www.dmas.virginia.gov/media/3lvdytyw/2023-medallion-acute-annual-technical-report.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">survey </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">commissioned by a state department shows that a majority of low-income pregnant people newly enrolled in Medicaid aren’t able to access prenatal care in a timely manner due to processing issues stemming from managed care organizations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managed care organizations are insurers paid by the state to provide Medicaid coverage, which is a federal and state health insurance program that typically serves low-income or disabled people. In Virginia, Medicaid is administered by the Department of Medical Assistance Services, or DMAS. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Medicaid enrollees are handled by managed care organizations, or MCOs. DMAS commissioned the “secret shoppers” survey to test the efficacy of Virginia’s contracted MCOs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“DMAS</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> monitors the MCOs in many ways,” Mary Olivia Renter, a spokesperson for the department, relayed in a statement. “The Secret Shopper Survey served as an innovative addition to our many processes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It found that 95% of the nearly 2,000 survey participants were unable to set up prenatal care. Causes included reaching disconnected numbers, excessive hold times, or the numbers connecting to out-of-state providers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey also concluded that the MCOs were not compliant with DMAS’ wait time standards. This means that pregnant people would also be unable to set up doctor appointments while waiting for the MCOs to process their applications. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a new method of data collection and auditing, DMAS noted the limitations of the survey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The surveys assessed a small sample of providers for the timeliness of new patient appointments only, not overall access to an appointment,” Renter wrote. “Due to the nature of the Secret Shopper Survey, callers were unable to provide any personal information or details required for preregistration. This was stated as the most frequent reason cases were unable to be offered an appointment or schedule an appointment within the appointment standards.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the survey helped to highlight some concerns which, anecdotally, advocates and prenatal professionals said they have been hearing from people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PUSH Maternal Health Coalition, a cohort of various advocacy groups, gathered at Virginia’s capitol on Tuesday to highlight the survey results. They also implored lawmakers and the governor to support legislation to enhance maternal healthcare access more broadly and to “hold MCOs accountable.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our hope is that MCOs see this as an opportunity to advocate for legislation they may need to improve access,” said Kathryn Haines, the health equity manager with the Virginia Interfaith Center for Public Policy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Association of Health Plans, a lobbying organization that represents Virginia’s MCOs, said their clients asked them to respond to media inquiries on the matter. Representative Heidi Dix said that the organization and its members are “keenly aware of the need for overall improvements in prenatal care” and that they are “fully engaged” to address issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This report and other analyses have identified a variety of factors placing a historic strain on prenatal care, the Medicaid program and the overall healthcare sector,” Dix wrote in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the disparities hit close to home for several members of the PUSH Coalition Tuesday — particularly when it comes to Black maternal health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kenda Sutton-El, director of doula and maternal health advocacy organization Birth In Color, said the survey didn’t surprise her. Instead, it helped confirm what she’s personally seen both as a Black mother and a doula with Black clients. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This just validated the experiences of many Black pregnant women who have tried to navigate the complex world of managed care organizations against a backdrop of significant disparities,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While studies and data show that </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7384760" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">negative health outcomes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or</span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/maternal-mortality/2021/maternal-mortality-rates-2021.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mortality rates are higher</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when Black people give birth than white people, Sutton-El wants lawmakers and officials to think more critically about the systemic contributions to such data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Instead of saying Black women are three times more likely to die, we have to start using language like, the system is actually murdering Black women at three times the rate,” Sutton-El said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nichole Wardlaw, a midwife with the American College of Nurse-Midwives and the National Black Midwife Alliance, said requirements for implicit bias training when renewing medical licenses must be a legislative priority.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, a bipartisan effort to do just that cleared the legislature before being </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/20/youngkin-vetoes-bills-on-contraception-access-skill-games-confederate-heritage-rollbacks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">by Gov. Glenn Youngkin in May. With racial bias one component of negative health outcomes, Youngkin did more recently issue an executive order to reestablish a maternal data task force (</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/27/youngkin-to-reestablish-maternal-health-data-task-force-after-vetoing-bill-that-would-have-done-so/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">after vetoing a passed bill that would have done so as well</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stephanie Spencer, a nurse and founder of Urban Baby Beginnings, commended the governor’s executive action. The coalition said they hope to see the governor signing laws, issuing orders, allocating funding and voicing support for these issues more often. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s still a lot of work that needs to be done, and obviously this survey shows that we need to do better,” Spencer said.</span>        <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/subscribe" style="text-decoration:none;">

(Courtesy of SDI Productions via Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia will soon establish guidance to restrict or eliminate student cell phone use during instructional time at school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, Gov. Glenn Youngkin issued Executive Order 33, which directs his administration to “heed the call” of parents, public health professionals, educators and others by establishing cell phone-free policies and procedures for school divisions, in light of growing concerns over children’s health and declines in academic performance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Education, in collaboration with the Departments of Health and Health and Human Services, must clearly define what “cell phone-free education” means, and publish model plans and draft guidance on implementing </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/programs-services/school-operations-support-services/cell-phone-free-education-in-virginia-k-12-public-schools" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cell phone-free education</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Virginia’s K-12 schools on its website by Aug. 15, according to the governor’s directive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The directive will establish “the clear goal to protect the health and safety of our students by limiting the amount of time they are exposed to “addictive” cell phones and social media and eliminating “clear distractions” in the classroom, Youngkin said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor added that $500,000 in existing funds allocated to the Departments of Education and Behavioral Health and Development Services will be made available to implement the initiative. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the governor’s office, the funds will support state and local efforts to facilitate family nights and community engagement events to combat youth mental health challenges, and provide microgrants for school divisions to help implement cell phone best practices in their communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the policies’ development, the departments will be required to hold listening sessions seeking public input on “age-appropriate cell phone-free education policies and procedures, gather feedback on best practices currently underway in Virginia public schools, and receive input for the draft guidance,” the governor’s executive order reads. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The departments are slated to release the final guidance by Sept. 16 of this year. The order directs school boards to adopt the policies by Jan. 1, 2025, or before. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s order cites American Psychological Association </span><a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2024/04/teen-social-use-mental-health" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that suggests adolescents who spend over three hours on social media daily have double the risk of poor mental health. The order also references studies showing that children spend about 4.8 hours a day on social media, and that students who use their phones during class learn less and earn lower grades. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Therefore, creating a cell phone-free education environment in public schools is not only a prudent measure but an essential one to promote a healthier and more focused educational environment where every child is free to learn,” Youngkin directive states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of Virginia’s school boards have already begun banning or restricting cell phone use in schools. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB28" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> empowering local boards to institute such prohibitions on cellphones and other “handheld communication devices” during regular school hours died last session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">James Fedderman, president of the Virginia Education Association, said in a statement that the organization recognizes the mounting worries over how cell phones impact students in classrooms and thinks it&#8217;s “essential” to approach the issue with “a nuanced perspective that considers the real-world needs of our students and teachers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fedderman, whose organization is the largest educator advocacy group in the state, went on to urge the Virginia Department of Education to engage with educators to develop balanced guidelines “that support effective teaching and learning while also addressing legitimate concerns about distractions.”</span></p>

(Photo illustration by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)</p><p>Clinic closures in the wake of the Dobbs decision and questions about the legality of emergency contraceptives, including disinformation that some are abortion drugs, may have contributed to a sharp drop in the rate of prescriptions for contraceptives in states with the most restrictive abortion bans, according to a <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2820370?utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_term=062624" target="_blank">University of California Los Angeles study</a>.</p>
<p>The decline was significant in most states with restrictive bans following Dobbs in June 2022 that returned regulation of abortion procedures to the states, the study found. The group of researchers, led by pharmacy professor Dima Qato, used data from national prescription audit databases to estimate the monthly volume of prescriptions dispensed at pharmacies nationwide and state-by-state. It represents estimates from more than 93% of retail pharmacies.</p>
<p>“Given that abortion would be restricted in many states even more after Dobbs, I wondered whether now more people would get covered through contraception to prevent pregnancy and the need for an abortion,” Qato said.</p>
<p>Over the past six months, especially in states with near-total abortion bans, lawmakers have <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/right-birth-control-bill-stalls-louisiana-legislature-over-anti-abortion-concerns" target="_blank">discussed proposals</a> that would protect access to contraception, but those efforts have largely failed because of concern over whether that would include emergency contraception. Some anti-abortion organizations call Plan B, which is an emergency contraceptive designed to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex, an abortion drug because it can prevent the implantation of a fertilized egg.</p>
<p>The researchers think those conversations have led to confusion among residents who aren’t sure if emergency contraceptives are still legal in their state. That confusion could also extend to pharmacists. While Plan B is available over the counter at many retail stores and pharmacies, including Amazon, it can also be obtained by prescription, which is the only data point the study captured. According to the research, the rate of obtaining it through prescription between 2021 and 2023 dropped more than 70% in four states with near-total bans — Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana and Tennessee. It declined by about 60% in Missouri.</p>
<p>The increases peaked in July 2022 and then dropped to levels lower than the pre-Dobbs period, Qato said.</p>
<p>“For patients that are seeking emergency contraception but can’t get it prescribed or filled, that’s where it matters,” Qato said. “They want to take it, they know it’s an option, and now they’re faced with hesitant prescribers and pharmacies.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Half of women surveyed in ban states are unsure if Plan B is legal </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/poll-finding/kff-health-tracking-poll-early-2023/" target="_blank">Kaiser Family Foundation poll</a> released in early 2023 found that more than 30% of adults surveyed were unsure if Plan B was legal in all 50 states and over the counter — and half of women living in states with abortion bans were under the impression that emergency contraceptives were illegal or were unsure if they were legal.</p>
<p>Conversely, in two states with near-total bans, Idaho and South Dakota, the rate of prescriptions for emergency contraceptives increased by 148% and 182%, respectively. Those numbers were attributed to increases in ulipristal, which is also known as Ella, rather than levonorgestrel, known as Plan B. Ella can be effective at preventing pregnancy up to five days after unprotected sex, while Plan B is most effective within three days and is also less effective in people who weigh more than 165 pounds, while Ella does not have that limitation.</p>
<p>Between the 12 states with the most restrictive bans, the combined decline of emergency contraceptive prescriptions was 60%, and the decline for oral contraceptives was 24%.</p>
<p>Qato said she expected to see lower rates of emergency contraceptive use in the most restrictive states, particularly with the conversations likening them to abortion drugs, but she wasn’t expecting to also see a drop in monthly oral contraceptive prescriptions. Among states with the most restrictive bans, the largest decrease of 28% was in Texas, while most other states had decreases of about 20%, including Kentucky, Louisiana, Alabama and Tennessee.</p>
<p>Qato also theorized that the closure of abortion clinics in those states with bans contributed to the decreases, since most clinics that provided abortions prior to Dobbs also offered prescriptions for oral and emergency contraceptives, IUDs and other family planning services such as screenings for sexually transmitted diseases. The study found no change in the use of IUDs and other forms of contraception such as the patch or vaginal ring.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Over-the-counter options only help certain people </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In her research, Qato noted that two years after Iowa imposed Medicaid coverage restrictions on family planning clinics that provided abortions, the use of contraceptives declined by two-thirds.</p>
<p>A<a href="https://click.everyaction.com/k/88143516/483292034/-344187778?nvep=ew0KICAiVGVuYW50VXJpIjogIm5ncHZhbjovL3Zhbi9TTldTUi9TTldTUi8xLzEwNTEzMSIsDQogICJEaXN0cmlidXRpb25VbmlxdWVJZCI6ICJjMGNmODE2Ny0yYjM5LWVmMTEtODZkMi02MDQ1YmRkOWUwOTYiLA0KICAiRW1haWxBZGRyZXNzIjogImttb3NlbGV5QGlkYWhvY2FwaXRhbHN1bi5jb20iDQp9&amp;hmac=ywMCUDPlSR2nSJqm_Lo8KzweXsH2dT0CwjGw83EUKxM=&amp;emci=efcfb094-b138-ef11-86d2-6045bdd9e096&amp;emdi=c0cf8167-2b39-ef11-86d2-6045bdd9e096&amp;ceid=453730" target="_blank"> report from the Guttmacher Institute</a> released this week showed 42 clinics that provided abortions nationwide closed their doors between 2020 and 2024. The number of abortions have also increased during that time, and more than 80% still take place at brick-and-mortar clinics rather than via telehealth or by mail.</p>
<p>While Plan B and Opill — an oral contraceptive — are available over the counter, Qato said those options are still untenable for some people who need contraceptives the most, including low-income women and women of color.</p>
<p>“Opill is convenient for those who don’t want to go to the doctor and have that discretionary income to purchase it, but low-income women relied on clinics that are now closed, they relied on prescriptions that they now don’t have,” Qato said. “Those options are accessible, but not affordable to women who could really benefit from it.”</p>
<p>While Qato said there should be a focus on restoring and protecting access to abortion, there should also be efforts to protect contraception in the most restrictive states. She is alarmed to see initial increases after Dobbs and then such steep declines.</p>
<p>“It suggests that we may observe increases in live births from unintended pregnancies in women who were forced to have a child that wasn’t planned because the state didn’t protect or introduced fear of criminalization or liability for patients, doctors, or pharmacists,” she said. “A woman may not feel safe choosing emergency contraception in those states anymore.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not long ago, in vitro fertilization — the medical process by which human sperm and ovum are united in clinical conditions outside a woman’s body and later implanted, giving the otherwise childless a chance at having a child — would have met scant resistance in the chambers of political power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome to 2024 and the looming American dystopia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, Virginia’s Democratic U.S. senators, Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, were copatrons (along with most of the Senate’s Democratic conference) of a bill sponsored by Sens. Tammy Duckworth and Patty Murray that would establish legal protections for IVF.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill was in response to an</span><a href="https://publicportal-api.alappeals.gov/courts/68f021c4-6a44-4735-9a76-5360b2e8af13/cms/case/343d203a-b13d-463a-8176-c46e3ae4f695/docketentrydocuments/e3d95592-3cbe-4384-afa6-063d4595aa1d" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">extraordinary ruling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in February by Alabama’s Supreme Court that outlawed IVF. It held that embryos frozen in liquid nitrogen at a temperature of 320 degrees below zero Fahrenheit are legally no different from a newborn in its mother’s arms or a kindergartner on a school bus. Since there are more embryos on ice than a woman could reasonably carry to term, the choice becomes whether to leave them frozen permanently or, eventually, to destroy them. To IVF foes, that’s homicide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ruling instantly suspended IVF procedures across Alabama and produced panic and heartbreak among aspiring parents for whom it was their best, or last, shot at having offspring and had spent many thousands of dollars out of pocket toward that end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to our sister publication, The</span><a href="https://alabamareflector.com/2024/02/19/alabama-supreme-court-ruling-could-end-ivf-treatments-in-state/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Alabama Reflector</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Justice Jay Mitchell tied his majority opinion to a state law enacted seven years after the Civil War authorizing lawsuits over the wrongful deaths of children and a</span><a href="https://www.al.com/news/2018/11/alabama-passes-anti-abortion-amendment.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">2018 Alabama constitutional amendment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that requires the state to “ensure the protection of the rights of the unborn child.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitchell wrote that neither specified an exception for frozen embryos. That goes without saying for the statute, passed 106 years before the first birth from an extracorporeal conception, when electricity was in its infancy and refrigeration was decades in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greater illumination into motivations behind the decision, however, derive from a concurring opinion by Alabama’s chief justice, Tom Parker, that reads more like a sermon than a legal treatise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…[E]ven before birth, all human beings bear the image of God, and their lives cannot be destroyed without effacing his glory,” Parker wrote. “We believe that each human being, from the moment of conception, is made in the image of God, created by Him to reflect His likeness.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state constitutional amendment, which conveys personhood at a somewhat uncertain instant of conception, was approved by Alabama’s conservative, largely evangelical and fundamentalist religious electorate six years ago to deter abortion. When the court applied it to IVF, however, the volume and intensity of the resulting outrage sent the Republican-ruled legislature scurrying back to Montgomery to promptly enact legislation that put IVF clinics back in operation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a place for proselytizing — by </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">all</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> faiths — and it should be afforded all the robust protections of our First Amendment. But the First Amendment also prohibits the government from establishing a religion, a safeguard against an American theocracy enacted by founders who bore the Church of England’s yoke before winning independence from Britain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When religion — in this case, segments of Christianity — muscles its doctrines into public policy to be imposed upon those who don’t share them, the resulting conflict is uncivil and ubiquitous. It produces the sort of uncompromising, paralyzed politics that grips our nation’s tribalized culture today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Polling consistently shows majorities of Americans support abortion rights in some form. A</span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/03/25/what-the-data-says-about-abortion-in-the-us/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">recent poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Pew Research Center says 62% of Americans surveyed believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases. A</span><a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/506759/broader-support-abortion-rights-continues-post-dobbs.aspx" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Gallup survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that 69% said abortions should generally be legal in the first trimester. Support for abortions declines the longer a fetus progresses toward birth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As this near-existential election year moves toward its decisive conclusion on Nov. 5, one of the few issues that augurs in favor of Democrats is that of women&#8217;s reproductive freedom. Until recently, that was abortion, particularly after the U.S. Supreme Court’s</span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> decision struck down 49 years of federal protections for abortion access and made abortion a state-by-state issue. Virginia is the lone southern state that has not banned or severely curbed abortion access.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It galvanized abortion rights voters, especially women, and staunched what was expected to be a crimson wave midterm congressional election for Republicans in 2022. Rather than win back a Senate majority as predicted, Democrats narrowly retained power after a late November runoff election in Georgia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which brings us back to June’s effort in the Senate to codify IVF protections. It failed on a near party-line vote with 47 Republicans in opposition. Forty-four Democrats, two Republicans and two independents voted for it, but that’s shy of the 60 votes needed to advance bills in the Senate. But even in its demise, it served a purpose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no small amount of partisan theater in votes like these, particularly in high-stakes election years. The goal is to force one party to take damaging, adversarial votes that the other party can use to rally sympathetic voters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is the normal course of events in Congress in election years,” said Stephen Farnsworth, professor of political science and director of the Center for Leadership and Media Studies at</span><a href="https://cas.umw.edu/polisci/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Mary Washington University</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Fredericksburg. “Legislating may be the driving factor in year one, but demonizing your opponent is the prominent factor in year two of the election cycle.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Both parties do this. The Republicans, when they were in the majority, forced the Democrats to take tough votes on immigration and, when Obamacare was unpopular, Republicans pushed for Obamacare votes,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine stands to be a direct beneficiary of the IVF bill’s death. He’s on this fall’s ballot seeking his third Senate term and hitting his Republican challenger, retired Navy officer Hung Cao, relentlessly on the reproductive rights issue. Cao</span><a href="https://www.fauquier.com/news/wexton-cao-clash-on-abortion-va-policies-for-transgender-students-in-first-debate/article_c835174e-4379-11ed-a0a6-bf53776c5ea8.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">said in a debate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a U.S. House seat two years ago that life “begins at conception” and he felt compelled to protect it.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="1TycpL7oXZ"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/17/they-dont-like-abortion-but-kaines-gop-challengers-say-they-wont-seek-a-federal-ban/">They don’t like abortion, but Kaine’s GOP challengers say they won’t seek a federal ban</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other Democrats can reap a residual benefit by using the outcome in a broader message about a GOP threat to women’s rights, particularly in two of the nation’s most fiercely contested U.S. House races. Incumbent Democratic Reps. Abigail Spanberger and Jennifer Wexton — both forceful advocates for reproductive rights — are leaving seats they won in 2018 in Virginia’s 7th and 10th congressional districts, respectively. Spanberger is a 2025 candidate for governor and Wexton is departing for health reasons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The painful reality about politics these days is that we’re talking about trench warfare,” Farnsworth said. “An unpopular vote here, an unpopular vote there may weaken a party in a swing district.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger’s seat is a prime example, he said. “In that Washington-area district, the greater the focus is on the Dobbs decision and IVF, the better for a Democratic candidate.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women are a potent voting bloc. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pissed off</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> women are a force of nature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a year when Kaine and down-ballot Democrats swim upstream against unfavorable issues such as the economy, immigration and an octogenarian president whose recent debate debacle leaves overwhelming majorities —</span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/poll-debate-should-biden-be-running-mental-abilities/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">72%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — believing he’s too old to perform, a force of nature is a comforting thing to have.</span></p>

<p>A landmark Supreme Court decision that reins in federal agencies’ authority is expected to hold dramatic consequences for the nation’s health care system, calling into question government rules on anything from consumer protections for patients to drug safety to nursing home care.</p>

<p>The June 28 decision overturns a 1984 precedent that said courts should give deference to federal agencies in legal challenges over their regulatory or scientific decisions. Instead of giving priority to agencies, courts will now exercise their own independent judgment about what Congress intended when drafting a particular law.</p>
<p>The ruling will likely have seismic ramifications for health policy. A flood of litigation — with plaintiffs like small businesses, drugmakers, and hospitals challenging regulations they say aren’t specified in the law — could leave the country with a patchwork of disparate health regulations varying by location.</p>
<p>Agencies such as the FDA are likely to be far more cautious in drafting regulations, Congress is expected to take more time fleshing out legislation to avoid legal challenges, and judges will be more apt to overrule current and future regulations.</p>
<p>Health policy leaders say patients, providers, and health systems should brace for more uncertainty and less stability in the health care system. Even routine government functions such as deciding the rate to pay doctors for treating Medicare beneficiaries could become embroiled in long legal battles that disrupt patient care or strain providers to adapt.</p>
<p>Groups that oppose a regulation could search for and secure partisan judges to roll back agency decision-making, said Andrew Twinamatsiko, director of the Health Policy and the Law Initiative at Georgetown University’s O’Neill Institute. One example could be challenges to the FDA’s approval of a medication used in abortions, which survived a Supreme Court challenge this term on a technicality.</p>
<p>“Judges will be more emboldened to second-guess agencies,” he said. “It’s going to open agencies up to attacks.”</p>
<p>Regulations are effectively the technical instructions for laws written by Congress. Federal agency staffers with knowledge related to a law — say, in drugs that treat rare diseases or health care for seniors — decide how to translate Congress’ words into action with input from industry, advocates, and the public.</p>
<p>Up until now, when agencies issued a regulation, a single rule typically applied nationwide. Following the high court ruling, however, lawsuits filed in more than one jurisdiction could result in contradictory rulings and regulatory requirements — meaning health care policies for patients, providers, or insurers could differ greatly from one area to another.</p>
<p>One circuit may uphold a regulation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for example, while other circuits may take different views.</p>
<p>“You could have eight or nine of 11 different views of the courts,” said William Buzbee, a professor at Georgetown Law.</p>
<p>A court in one circuit could issue a nationwide injunction to enforce its interpretation while another circuit disagrees, said Maura Monaghan, a partner at Debevoise &amp; Plimpton. Few cases are taken up by the U.S. Supreme Court, which could leave clashing directives in place for many years.</p>
<p>In the immediate future, health policy leaders say agencies should brace for more litigation over controversial initiatives. A requirement that most Affordable Care Act health plans cover preventive services, for example, is already being litigated. Multiple challenges to the mandate could mean different coverage requirements for preventive care depending on where a consumer lives.</p>
<p>Drugmakers have sued to try to stop the Biden administration from implementing a federal law that forces makers of the most expensive drugs to negotiate prices with Medicare — a key cog in President Joe Biden’s effort to lower drug prices and control health care costs.</p>
<p>Parts of the health care industry may take on reimbursement rates for doctors that are set by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services because those specific rates aren’t written into law. The agency issues rules updating payment rates in Medicare, a health insurance program for people 65 or older and younger people with disabilities. Groups representing doctors and hospitals regularly flock to Washington, D.C., to lobby against trims to their payment rates.</p>
<p>And providers, including those backed by deep-pocketed investors, have sued to block federal surprise-billing legislation. The No Surprises Act, which passed in 2020 and took effect for most people in 2022, aims to protect patients from unexpected, out-of-network medical bills, especially in emergencies. The high court’s ruling is expected to spur more litigation over its implementation.</p>
<p>“This really is going to create a tectonic change in the administrative regulatory landscape,” Twinamatsiko said. “The approach since 1984 has created stability. When the FDA or CDC adopt regulations, they know those regulations will be respected. That has been taken back.”</p>
<p>Industry groups, including the American Hospital Association and AHIP, an insurers’ trade group, declined to comment.</p>
<p>Agencies such as the FDA that take advantage of their regulatory authority to make specific decisions, such as the granting of exclusive marketing rights upon approval of a drug, will be vulnerable. The reason: Many of their decisions require discretion as opposed to being explicitly defined by federal law, said Joseph Ross, a professor of medicine and public health at Yale School of Medicine.</p>
<p>“The legislation that guides much of the work in the health space, such as FDA and CMS, is not prescriptive,” he said.</p>
<p>In fact, FDA Commissioner Robert Califf said in an episode of the “Healthcare Unfiltered” podcast last year that he was “very worried” about the disruption from judges overruling his agency’s scientific decisions.</p>
<p>The high court’s ruling will be especially significant for the nation’s federal health agencies because their regulations are often complex, creating the opportunity for more pitched legal battles.</p>
<p>Challenges that may not have succeeded in courts because of the deference to agencies could now find more favorable outcomes.</p>
<p>“A whole host of existing regulations could be vulnerable,” said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF.</p>
<p>Other consequences are possible. Congress may attempt to flesh out more details when drafting legislation to avoid challenges — an approach that may increase partisan standoffs and slow down an already glacial pace in passing legislation, Levitt said.</p>
<p>Agencies are expected to be far more cautious in writing regulations to be sure they don’t go beyond the contours of the law.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court’s 6-3 decision overturned <em>Chevron U.S.A. v. Natural Resources Defense Council</em>, which held that courts should generally back a federal agency’s statutory interpretation as long as it was reasonable. Republicans have largely praised the new ruling as necessary for ensuring agencies don’t overstep their authority, while Democrats said in the aftermath of the decision that it amounts to a judicial power grab.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a joke in development economics: it helps to pick your parents. It’s a tongue-in-cheek reference to outcome disparities based on both where a person is born and what their parents do for a living. My mom&#8217;s family is from Western Pennsylvania between Pittsburgh and the Ohio border – an area that reminds me a lot of Southwest and Southside Virginia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I saw how macroeconomic decline during the 1980s and 1990s limited my family’s options. After my uncle lost his job in a steel mill, he had to drive six hours each day for work because the only decent job he could find was in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Ultimately, he ended up sleeping at a friend’s place in Harrisburg four days a week for over 20 years, only seeing the family on weekends until he retired. My cousin, who is almost the same age as me (I&#8217;m 43), works irregularly in food service and the gig economy to make ends meet. College wasn’t for him but the new economy that took root in Pittsburgh required advanced degrees even for entry-level roles. Now his future is even more uncertain as the</span><a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/covid-19/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">economy of rural America struggles to regain its footing after COVID-19.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following my parent’s divorce, I grew up in two neighborhoods: Arlington,/East Falls Church (EFC) in Northern Virginia and Hill East in Washington, D.C. Both were very much working-class neighborhoods back then; neither are now. Hill East was around 90% blue-collar African American. Today, the neighborhood is upwards of 80% non-Hispanic White with at least 50% of the population having graduate degrees. This change is reflected in rents, housing prices and property tax burdens that most of the people I grew up with can no longer afford. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, EFC was once full of teachers, police officers, administrators — even my elementary school&#8217;s custodian lived there. Now, only people like lawyers, finance professionals, and c-suite executives make enough to buy there. A vast majority of the residents of Hill East and EFC were able to wait out the most serious impacts of COVID-19 in relative comfort; the rest of Virginia wasn’t as lucky. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a public policy researcher, I constantly think about structure — the things that affect a person’s outcomes but are largely pre-existing and/or beyond their ability to control. Structure-based outcomes are something I’ve seen consistently throughout both my personal and professional lives. Studying the COVID-19 pandemic was no different. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://data.census.gov/table/ACSDP1Y2021.DP03?q=DP03&amp;g=050XX00US51013,51015" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, at least 49% of Arlington residents worked from home. Meanwhile in Augusta County near the West Virginia border, only 8% of workers were able to do the same. The most common industries in Arlington are classified as professional, scientific, and management while the most common industries in Augusta are educational services, health care and manufacturing. Through 2021, Augusta’s age-adjusted COVID-19 death rate was 2.25 times higher than Arlington’s, despite Arlington’s population density being 115 times greater. As a community-based researcher at VCU, I’ve seen a similar dynamic play out inside the City of Richmond between different groups that share the same spaces. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The common themes here are:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 1.) Marginalized groups have often been left behind because they are forced to accept more vulnerable, less-decent employment and housing options.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2.) They generally don’t have the resources to break this cyclical poverty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3.) Government programs designed to address these issues suffer from major gaps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4.) These inequities inevitably lead to other serious outcome disparities, like what we saw during the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212420924003583?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">My recent research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, co-authored with Dr. Brittany “Brie” Haupt, illuminates how these differences in structure guided COVID-19’s disproportionate impacts in rural and minority communities in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the county and independent city level, we started with a simple correlational analysis that showed Virginia municipalities with greater percentages of African Americans and those outside of metropolitan statistical areas suffered greater levels of COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations and death rates (both crude and age-adjusted). We then took socio-economic data collected before the COVID-19 pandemic to analyze how structure interacted with race and rurality to produce these disparate COVID-19 outcomes. Using a procedure called structural equation modeling , we partialed out direct and indirect effects, as well as analyzed likely causality direction by modifying the covariance functions and comparing their likelihoods.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our model, we were able to isolate a set of workforce roles as the primary cause of disproportionate infections in more rural and minority communities. Once we included a variable for this, the direct covariance between race, rurality and COVID-19 infection rates lost statistical significance in the case of rurality, and, in the case of race, became a statistically significant negative. Additional analyses showed there was still a statistically significant positive indirect path. Similarly, once we added data to our model on underlying community health (diabetes, premature death rates, etc.), the direct paths between race, rurality and COVID-19 hospitalizations and age-adjusted death rates lost statistical significance. Also similarly, statistically significant positive indirect paths remained. Thus, we believe we likely isolated the biggest drivers of COVID-19’s disproportionate impacts in marginalized communities.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our conclusions are fairly straightforward — before vaccine uptake was widely utilized, patients with COVID-19 either made it through or perished based on their underlying health status and other characteristics. These traits are not randomly distributed throughout Virginia’s population, rather they are concentrated based on the structures many people are either born into, migrate to, or are displaced to. We believe future pandemics will play out in similar fashion given the nature of epidemiology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension — which were the biggest driver of COVID-19 deaths in our model — are managed and reduced instead of cured. This requires sustained resources for years if not decades. Unfortunately for many people and localities that need them, these resources are either not currently available, affordable or feasible, given the dynamics of structure. The at-risk jobs we identified in our model are less likely to offer health insurance or pay high wages but they are unstable and often lack promotion potential. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local governments in these areas are often not able to offset this because of the same economic structures that affect employment opportunities. Local governments rely overwhelmingly on business and property taxes. But if an area is economically distressed and/or has a greater marginalized population, this means that the government  has less money but also a greater need. Thus, even with the CARES Act, we saw how metropolitan areas like the city of Richmond were able to provide more resources to local businesses during COVID-19 than rural areas like Lee County. Similarly, we cannot expect marginalized or declining areas to stockpile resources on their own before the next pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an era when Virginia</span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/virginia-news/latest-estimate-shows-virginia-with-5-1-billion-surplus-youngkin-calls-for-more-tax-cuts/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">consistently sees record revenue surpluses in the billions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there is no good reason why health disparities, especially like what we observed during the COVID-19 pandemic, should be so stark or consistent. In 2022, the U.S. Census Bureau listed Virginia as the 13</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><a href="https://data.census.gov/table/ACSDT1Y2022.B19013?g=010XX00US,$0400000&amp;moe=false" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">wealthiest state by median income</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the same year, Virginia’s health system was ranked 20</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> out of 50 states</span><a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/scorecard/2022/jun/2022-scorecard-state-health-system-performance" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">by the Commonwealth Fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There are 86 Virginia jurisdictions  currently</span><a href="https://www.vhcf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/MUAs_Localities_in_Virginia_3_3_23.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">designated as medically under-served</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> areas (MUAs).

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Virginia increased healthcare funding since the COVID-19 pandemic,</span><a href="https://cdn.wildapricot.com/33442/resources/Documents/Key%20Public%20Health%20Takeaways%20from%20Virginia%E2%80%99s%20New%20Budget.pdf?version=1658928791000&amp;Policy=eyJTdGF0ZW1lbnQiOiBbeyJSZXNvdXJjZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vY2RuLndpbGRhcHJpY290LmNvbS8zMzQ0Mi9yZXNvdXJjZXMvRG9jdW1lbnRzL0tleSUyMFB1YmxpYyUyMEhlYWx0aCUyMFRha2Vhd2F5cyUyMGZyb20lMjBWaXJnaW5pYSVFMiU4MCU5OXMlMjBOZXclMjBCdWRnZXQucGRmP3ZlcnNpb249MTY1ODkyODc5MTAwMCIsIkNvbmRpdGlvbiI6eyJEYXRlTGVzc1RoYW4iOnsiQVdTOkVwb2NoVGltZSI6MTcxOTUxMTM1NX0sIklwQWRkcmVzcyI6eyJBV1M6U291cmNlSXAiOiIwLjAuMC4wLzAifX19XX0_&amp;Signature=mMRS9nSM~41u7~LOZePnCfBxBxr5b~Xpi2T~VDjvyI60qkhVogRSO8zM4y59LXS1UJZLw598~gf~v9tUTDmPPGV-ozEVzmuu6AMl5IuO3H9vxzNZwrWM5dQbvo22lhK1-HFOAxefERIFxsoHVh7o21w6fAyB6G9veFrwkvZRqNRJK47tmcpCyrt4V-gHUiJSllxiQbpYAgXmvWIoAbbaMiya69CA~qSzSEhG8cbCHiQh0usut65yEjtOYfcoGqa6UUZAtyDeybm9mbieX8uvM3aOIJSUFFvUJ8rSKQ9H7Tyu1O--BJpA-BqkZPLRr4Q56Vx6S6UmvE3rfCy0Ab7QRw__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=K27MGQSHTHAGGF" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">per the Virginia Public Health Association (VPHA)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, most of it (approximately 85%) was a result of Federal CARES Act funding rather than sustained appropriations from the general fund. Understandably, the major focus of the increased spending is on communicable disease spread, but there is little mention of managing chronic conditions that our research suggests are the biggest factors in patient survival. Also, while</span><a href="https://www.employmentlawwatch.com/2021/09/articles/employment/it-continues-virginia-updates-its-permanent-covid-19-workplace-safety-standard/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia requires COVID-19 workplace-based protections that follow CDC standards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the current disparities in infection rates suggests much more can be done. And, employers shouldn’t be asked to bear these costs and responsibilities alone. So, where do we go next?</span></p>

Abigail Spanberger, D-7th, speaks to a crowd in Richmond, Virginia on the second anniversary of the overturn of federal abortion protections. (Charlotte Rene Woods / Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats are finally talking about the Comstock Act — and they are finally trying to repeal it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The act is a dormant 19th century federal law that’s still technically on the books and could be used to implement a national abortion ban. Named for activist Anthony Comstock who pushed for it, the 1873 </span><a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title18-section1461&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> prohibits the mailing of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“every article or thing designed, adapted, or intended for producing abortion, or for any indecent or immoral use.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dubbed the “Stop Comstock Act,” U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., announced legislation last week that would repeal portions of it. A House version of the bill is co-sponsored by Virginia Reps. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond and Abigail Spanberger, D-Henrico.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More broadly, the Gilded Age-era law focuses on obscene materials such as pornography, but other provisions of it have included abortifacients and contraception. The contraception components were stripped away over the years. While its abortion components have not been enforced, the law has been used in child pornography prosecutions. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.congress.gov/search?q=%7B%22source%22%3A%22legislation%22%2C%22search%22%3A%22%5C%22comstock%5C%22+AND+%5C%22abortion%5C%22%22%7D&amp;pageSort=dateOfIntroduction%3Aasc" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four previous attempts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from decades ago to repeal the abortion components of the act have failed and McClellan was candid about how her bill may not see success in the U.S. House right away due to its current GOP control.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That doesn’t mean we don’t start fighting,” McClellan said, noting how it took her about a decade to pass legislation to remove abortion barriers when she was a state senator in Virginia. “Hopefully it will be the next Congress, under Speaker Hakeem Jeffries, that we pass that bill.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeffries, the House Minority leader from New York, stands to become the next Speaker of the House if Democrats are able to take control of the chamber in this year’s elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Showing their work on Comstock can help Democrats communicate about threats to abortion access amid this year’s presidential and congressional elections, said Erin Covey, an analyst for the Cook Political Report. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think the reason that this is coming up now is because we&#8217;re getting closer to the presidential election,” she said. “The potential reality of a second Trump term is something that Democrats in Congress are reckoning with right now.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Why does this particular law matter?</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has </span><a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/110384051064378318" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">taken credit for</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">how his Supreme Court picks during his presidency ushered in the fall of Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court ruling that federally protected abortion for nearly 50 years. With speculation at how far he would seek to regulate abortion, he’s said different things in interviews with national press over the past year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While President Joe Biden has made abortion protection a pillar of his re-election campaign, Trump has made </span><a href="https://www.kff.org/compare-2024-candidates-health-care-policy/?utm_campaign=KFF-Health-Policy-101&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_HRRnbnWlwDVW2NM5l9DQk1jYM_RqWvqC6w7ohqGbfp_j_cbuKLZ05Xq7-b22j0fd-elvauV1HskryaKFS-80nxUFu2dQz3wq4ZTMK3CjN0iGvNgo&amp;_hsmi=312903414&amp;utm_content=312903414&amp;utm_source=hs_email#abortion" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">various statements</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">ranging from supporting a national 15 or 16 week ban, to leaving regulation to the states, and “feeling “strongly” about Comstock. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an </span><a href="https://time.com/6972022/donald-trump-transcript-2024-election/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">April interview with TIME Magazine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, he said he’d have a “big statement” within two weeks, but he never did.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also said earlier this month that he would “</span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-says-hell-work-side-side-group-wants-abortion-eradicated" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">work side by side”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a group that wants to see abortion “eradicated.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And though Comstock’s abortion provisions were not enforced during the nearly 50 years of Roe, it has been a looming specter for the abortion rights movement all along. Activists and legal scholars have cautioned about its potential as it is still technically on the books. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a Trump-appointed Texas’ judge’s interpretation of Comstock that helped propel the Federal Drug Administration v Alliance For Hippocratic Medicine to the U.S. Supreme Court. Though the Supreme Court, which has several Trump appointees, did not rule in the Alliance’s favor, they kicked the case back down to lower courts where it will continue to be litigated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most directly, the Comstock Act applies to mailing abortion medication, but some think it can be interpreted further to prohibit transport of supplies to establish abortion clinics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While “not literally a ban,” legal historian Mary Ziegler explained how abortion opponents can interpret it to be used as one. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The question is, if you can&#8217;t put anything in the mail or through a common carrier or potentially into interstate commerce, then how do you get surgical tools or whatever? How do you get any of the items you would need?” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comstock’s </span><a href="https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_CHAPTER-14.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legal code</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> appears in a conservative manifesto called “Project 2025” that Trump could tap into should he win a second term. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chapter 14 of the policy guidebook by conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation recommends that promotion and approval of mail-order abortion medications cease and alleges they are “in violation of long-standing federal laws that prohibit the mailing and interstate carriage of abortion drugs.” Comstock’s legal code is then cited in footnote number 16. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local government officials have tried for years to use Comstock to limit abortions in their communities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law has surfaced in local ordinances around the country, such as in Virginia where it was </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/a-virginia-county-considered-19th-century-approach-to-abortion-restrictions/article_2b72de8a-9b04-11ee-9864-1fbc992a7e0e.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voted down</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year and in New Mexico where </span><a href="https://sourcenm.com/2023/12/14/n-m-supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-local-anti-abortion-ordinances/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legal challenges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have ascended to the state’s supreme court. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assisted by former Texas Solicitor General Jonathan Mitchell, Texas activist Mark Lee Dickson has </span><a href="https://sourcenm.com/2024/03/04/texas-activists-pushed-abortion-restrictions-in-nm-cities-and-counties-records-show/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">encouraged localities to pass such ordinances</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Dickson also has said that they offer legal representation to localities that </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/abortion-roe-versus-wade-youngkin-bristol-tennessee-virginia/article_31281cfc-15f1-11ee-8559-9b85d4db3696.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“goes up” to the U.S. Supreme Court.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be it Trump utilizing Comstock if elected, or legal challenges progressing successfully in Dickson’s favor through courts, Dickson’s confident it can be a path for a national ban. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If enforced, it would have the same impact as a national ban on abortion,” he said. “That is because it is a de-facto national abortion ban.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legal historian Lauren MacIver Thompson, who specializes in Comstock, echoed Ziegler’s theory of how that could work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If Trump is reelected, (abortion opponents) basically have a clear path to enforce it with a newly re-formed Department of Justice,” said legal historian Lauren MacIver Thompson. “They can kind of read the act however they want it to be read.” </span></p>

Glenn Youngkin speaking to a crowd in Richmond on April 8, 2024. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced a new executive order to reestablish a maternal health data task force a little over a month after vetoing legislation designed to accomplish the same goal.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/EO-32---Maternal-Health-Task-Force---FINAL.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Executive Order 32 </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reestablishes the Maternal Health Data and Quality Measures Task Force, which was first established in 2021 and ran through the end of last year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal was, and is, to collect maternal health data that can inform future policy but the report with recommendations from the previous task force was not published in time for the 2024 legislative session. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, Del. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charniele Herring, D-Alexandria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, filed </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB781" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 781</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this year to reestablish the board and it cleared both chambers with bipartisan support. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin then pursued a shorter substitute, which Herring said “gutted” her bill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s proposal also removed the term “birthing people.” Pregnancy is most common in cisgender women. Meanwhile, for transgender and nonbinary people who are pregnant, finding competent medical care can be a challenge, </span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/for-many-pregnant-trans-people-competent-medical-care-is-hard-to-find" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PBS News reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the legislature reconvened in May, they rejected Youngkin’s proposal and he vetoed the bill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unfortunately, the proposed legislation politicized an otherwise noncontroversial issue,” Youngkin’s veto statement had said. “I offered an amendment to address this, but unfortunately the General Assembly did not adopt it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Herring feels it was Youngkin doing the politicizing of an otherwise bipartisan bill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It seems like this is truly being politicized by the executive order,” Herring said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokeswoman for Youngkin did not respond when asked if Youngkin’s veto statement was in reference to Herring’s inclusion of “birthing people.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new task force will include various health care and maternal health care officials such as OB GYN doctors, nurses and midwives, as well as representatives from various state agencies and nonprofits related to health care information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don&#8217;t know who he&#8217;s going to appoint but he did keep some of my structure for the task force in the executive order,” Herring said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike his shorter substitute, Youngkin’s executive order is longer and includes details from Herring’s bill such as examining the quality of care and barriers that prevent collection and reporting of timely maternal health data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cohort will develop recommendations for standard quality metrics on maternal care and report findings to both the governor and state legislature by Dec. 1, 2025. There is also a Dec. 1 deadline this year for the Secretary of Health and Human Resources to provide a report with recommendations for ways to address maternal mental health and substance use issues to help eliminate disparities in care. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the previous task force’s  </span><a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2024/RD136" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">existing proposals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are to mandate a year of postpartum coverage for commercial insurance plans, identify reimbursements to incentivize social determinants of health screenings, and to develop a fetal and infant mortality review team — a bill from this year that was</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB140" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tabled until next year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The infant mortality review team was among a </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/virginia-black-maternal-health-carroll-foy-youngkin/article_4608fd84-d1ae-11ee-8379-138efdfc34c7.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">slate of maternal health bills this session</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, carried primarily by Black women lawmakers; while some advanced, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/20/youngkin-vetoes-bills-on-contraception-access-skill-games-confederate-heritage-rollbacks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">others were vetoed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Herring said in a Thursday interview  that she’s been in touch with the administration about composition of the new task force. This week, she spoke with John Littel, who is Youngkin’s new chief of staff and former head of the department of health and human resources. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not yet clear when the new task force will be up and running or if previous members will rejoin it and a representative from the state health department could not be reached by the time of this publication. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite divergence on details of the task force, lawmakers in both parties have worked on various measures to enhance maternal health outcomes in recent years. Youngkin has </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/04/17/petersburg-maternal-hub-opening-reignites-discussion-over-commercial-doula-benefits/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">supported maternal health hubs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as part of the Partnership for Petersburg initiative. He also signed a bill this year to </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/youngkin-doulas-black-maternal-health-general-assembly/article_34a9f222-f379-11ee-8dc9-e36a8194fce6.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">require health insurance coverage for doulas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mothers play an incomparable role in the lives of their children and families, and it is imperative that we do the necessary, collective work to ensure they are receiving the care they deserve,” Youngkin said in a release announcing his order. “This begins with knowing where we need to improve, so that we can better maternal health policies throughout the Commonwealth and promote the well-being of women, children and families.” </span></p>

<p>U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy declared firearm violence a public health crisis, as gun deaths and injuries punctuate daily life in America.</p>

<p>On nearly every day of 2024 so far, a burst of gunfire has hit at least four people somewhere in the country. Some days, communities have endured four or five such shootings.</p>
<p>The nation’s top doctor called on policymakers to consider gun safety measures such as bans on assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines and universal background checks for all firearm purchases. <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/priorities/firearm-violence/index.html" target="_blank">His advisory</a> also urges a “significant increase” in funding for research on gun injuries and deaths, as well as greater access to mental health care and trauma-informed resources for people who have experienced firearm violence.</p>
<p>In 2022, more than 48,000 people <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/firearm-violence/data-research/facts-stats/index.html#:~:text=While%20firearm%20violence%20and%20injury,are%20from%20firearm%2Drelated%20assaults." target="_blank">were killed by guns</a> in the U.S., or about 132 people a day, and suicides accounted for more than half of those deaths, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. An additional 200-plus Americans seek emergency care for firearm injuries each day, <a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/center-for-gun-violence-solutions/research-reports/firearm-violence-in-the-united-states" target="_blank">according to estimates</a> from Johns Hopkins University research. No federal database records nonfatal gun injuries.</p>
<p>The Office of the Surgeon General does not set or carry out gun policy, but historically its reports and warnings have nudged policymakers and lawmakers to act.</p>
<p>Murthy, a physician, told KFF Health News he hoped to convey the broader toll of gun violence on the nation and the need for an urgent public health response. He cited soaring gun deaths among children and teens and noted that “the mental health toll of firearm violence is far more profound and pervasive than many of us recognize.”</p>
<p>“Every day that passes we lose more kids to gun violence,” Murthy said, “the more children who are witnessing episodes of gun violence, the more children who are shot and survive that are dealing with a lifetime of physical and mental health impacts.”</p>
<p>Firearm-related homicides over the past decade and suicides over the past two decades have driven the sharp rise in gun deaths, the advisory says.</p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Swing-state legislatures diverge on election-year gun measures&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/21/swing-state-legislatures-diverge-on-election-year-gun-measures/embed/#?secret=tK7uHSPSwB#?secret=mEMfYiDhRq" data-secret="mEMfYiDhRq" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>Guns are the leading cause of death for children and teens, with higher death rates <a href="https://www.kff.org/mental-health/issue-brief/the-impact-of-gun-violence-on-children-and-adolescents/" target="_blank">among Black and Hispanic youths</a>. Researchers from Boston University found that during the height of the covid pandemic, Black children were <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2802128?utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;utm_medium=refe" target="_blank">100 times as likely</a> as white children to experience gun injuries. Hispanic and Asian children also saw major increases in firearm assault injuries during that time, that study showed.</p>
<p>Joseph Sakran, executive vice chair of surgery at John Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore and chief medical officer for Brady United Against Gun Violence, said the surgeon general’s declaration is a “historic moment that sounds the alarm for all Americans.”</p>
<p>But Sakran added: “It cannot stop here. We have to use this as another step in the right direction. No one wants to see more children gunned down.”</p>
<p>Murthy has long said gun violence should be framed as a health issue. He argued that the approach has been successful in combating significant societal problems, citing tobacco control efforts that took hold following the then-surgeon general’s <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco-surgeon-general-reports/about/history.html" target="_blank">landmark 1964 report</a> concluding that smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer and other diseases.</p>
<p>“We saved so many lives, and that’s what we can do here, too,” Murthy said.</p>
<p>Murthy’s move is one of several recent Biden administration actions designed to combat gun violence, as most gun-related measures remain political nonstarters in Congress. Federal officials have allowed states <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/medicaid-violence-prevention-new-state-funding-guns-firearms/" target="_blank">to use Medicaid dollars</a> to pay for gun violence prevention, and the White House has called on hospital executives and doctors to <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/white-house-initiative-doctors-hospitals-gun-violence-prevention/" target="_blank">gather more data about gunshot injuries</a> and to routinely counsel patients about the safe use of firearms.</p>
<p>While available data points to tragic outcomes across American communities, government officials and public health researchers have long been stymied by <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/gun-violence-data-public-health-experts-research-funds/" target="_blank">sparse federal funding</a> devoted to gun violence research and the scope of its health effects.</p>
<p>“I’ve been studying gun violence for about 33 years now and there’s still some really basic and fundamental questions I can’t answer,” said Daniel Webster, a gun violence researcher at Johns Hopkins University.</p>
<p>“To really understand gun violence, you need to do more than just look at publicly available surveillance data,” he said. “You need to actually do in-depth studies involving the populations at highest risk for shooting or being shot.”</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.bradyunited.org/resources/research/reducing-firearm-violence" target="_blank">Brady analysis found</a> that of the 15 leading causes of death in the U.S., firearm injuries received the third-lowest amount of federal research funding through the National Institutes of Health for each person who died. The only causes of death that garnered less research funding through NIH were poisonings and falls, according to the analysis.</p>
<p>Sonali Rajan, an adjunct associate professor of epidemiology at Columbia University who researches the effects of gun violence on children, said political leaders and others need to reframe the debate on gun violence from crime to public health.</p>
<p>“We are raising a whole generation of children for whom exposure to gun violence is normal,” Rajan said.</p>
<p>In Michigan, “we had a kid survive the Oxford High School shooting only to go to Michigan State University and see another mass shooting,” she said. “It is unbelievably shameful.”</p>
<p>Serving as President Joe Biden’s surgeon general since 2021, Murthy has, at times, caused political controversy with his views on gun violence.</p>
<p>Over a decade ago, former President Barack Obama nominated Murthy to be the nation’s top doctor. But <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.drsforamerica.org/images/DFA_Gun_Petition_and_Congressional_Letter.pdf" target="_blank">Murthy’s support for a federal ban</a> on the sale of assault weapons and ammunition and additional restrictions on gun purchases drew the ire of the National Rifle Association, as well as Republicans and some Democrats in Congress. The U.S. Senate narrowly confirmed Murthy to the job <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2014/12/15/nations-doctor-dr-vivek-murthy-confirmed-surgeon-general" target="_blank">in December 2014</a>, more than a year after his nomination.</p>
<p>Murthy has previously issued advisories on social isolation and loneliness, youth mental health, and the well-being of health workers. He said gun violence comes up in many of his conversations with young people about the mental health challenges they’re facing.</p>
<p>“Fears around gun violence have really pervaded so much of the psyche of America in ways that are very harmful to our mental health and well-being,” Murthy said.</p>
<p>Many other causes of death are treated differently as to understanding the problems and developing solutions, Webster said. But “that’s generally not what we’ve done with gun violence. We’ve oversimplified it and overpoliticized it.”</p>
<p>As Sakran put it: “As we look at firearm injuries, there’s arguably no public issue that’s as urgent.”</p>

Charlotte Rene Woods / Virginia Mercury</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My story includes abortion — a guy I&#8217;ve known since I was a kid raped me,” actress and activist Ashley Judd shared with a crowd of about 100 in Richmond on Monday to mark the two-year anniversary of the overturn of federal abortion protections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And when I became pregnant, I was so grateful that I was able to access safe and legal abortion,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judd, who was a prominent figure amid the #MeToo movement to advocate against sexual assault and harassment, joined state and federal lawmakers Monday to stress the significance of abortion access amid this year’s presidential and congressional elections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the personal story Judd shared was grim, the attitude of the event was light at times; Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, celebrated the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/08/virginia-democrats-triumph-in-statehouse-elections-reducing-youngkins-power/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic gains made in the state legislature last year </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">while U.S. Reps. Jennifer McClellan, 4th District, and Abigail Spanberger, 7th District, celebrated camaraderie among women in politics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the seriousness of abortion laws was central to the gathering. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Signs held by participants read “This is Trump’s fault” — a reference to how President Donald Trump’s U.S. Supreme Court picks gave conservatives the majority to overturn Roe v. Wade, the nearly 50 year-old case that had guaranteed abortion rights. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you think Dobbs was the beginning, it wasn&#8217;t,” McClellan said, in reference to the 2022 case that overturned Roe. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39056" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2149-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-39056 size-medium" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2149-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2149-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2149-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2149-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2149-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2149-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Attendees hold signs in Richmond, Virginia on June 24,2024 for a political rally on the second anniversary of the overturn of federal abortion protections. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She noted how in the years following, legislators and legal cases have challenged contraception and in vitro fertilization, as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump will face off against current president Joe Biden this November, as will congressional and U.S. Senate candidates around the nation. While Biden has made abortion protection a key pillar of his campaign, another Trump presidency and GOP gains in congress could usher in further abortion restrictions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We cannot afford Republican-controlled governance. We cannot afford a Republican-controlled Congress,” Lucas told the crowd. “Our freedoms are at stake: Freedom to vote, freedom to contraception, freedom over our bodies.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucas and Spanberger stressed how before Democrats held their line in the state senate and flipped the House of Delegates last year, they’d blocked Republican-led attempts to restrict abortion in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Spanberger, who is not seeking another term in congress and is instead running for governor, could be the person to sign other reproductive health-related legislation into law in 2026. That year, voters statewide could also see a potential ballot referendum to </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/virginia-abortion-rights-restoration-same-sex-marriage/article_731f82a4-b4b0-11ee-9c14-7719906ce1fc.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">decide if abortion protections should be enshrined in Virginia’s constitution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are in a place where we have seen desperate people come from other states, because Virginia is the only state in the South that has not put additional restrictions in place,” Spanberger said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That fact was reiterated several times later in the morning in a roundtable discussion at the VCU Health Hub in Richmond’s east end. McClellan was joined by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services acting director Melanie Fontes Rainer, Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax and Del. Rae Cousins, D-Richmond to hear from reproductive health professionals. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘A turning point’</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From various providers of reproductive healthcare, to those who assist with births and political advocates, each person had insight to share. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Longtime OB-GYN William Fitzhugh, Whole Woman’s Health CEO Amy Hagstrom Miller, Kenda Sutton-El of Birth in Color and Stephanie Spencer of Urban Baby Beginnings shared concerns about the influx of out-of-state abortion patients.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39055" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2297-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-39055 size-medium" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2297-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2297-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2297-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2297-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2297-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2297-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Lawmakers and reproductive healthcare professionals participate in a roundtable discussion in Richmond, Virginia on June 24, 2024. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hagstrom Miller said that there’s been an uptick in patients visiting Whole Women’s Health from Georgia and Florida – where most abortions are banned after six weeks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She noted how last year, a patient&#8217;s menstrual cycle had continued after she conceived, so she was unaware she was pregnant until she had lost the ability to receive an abortion in Georgia. The patient, Chasity Dunnans, then traveled to Whole Woman&#8217;s Health’s Charlottesville clinic for the procedure. As many other southern states impose near-total bans or six-week limits, North Carolina and Virginia stand as a point of access for some. But </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/n-c-s-12-week-abortion-ban-to-make-va-least-restrictive-state-in-south/article_5ac91606-f503-11ed-b9b5-2315241bf865.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">North Carolina’s 12-week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cap meant </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/oct/31/virginia-abortion-rights-ban-south-state" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dunnans had to travel further</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are at a turning point here in Virginia,’ Boysko said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She has carried a proposed constitutional amendment that would enshrine abortion access in Virginia’s constitution. This would make access less subject to partisan turnover in the state legislature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To alter the constitution, Boysko’s resolution will need to clear the legislature two years in a row, with a House of Delegates election in between, before appearing on statewide ballots for voters to accept or reject. Pending its first passage next year, this could happen in 2026.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Abortion isn’t always a partisan issue,” Hagstrom Miller said. “Everytime we put abortion on the ballot, it wins.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the two years since Roe was overturned, voters have backed abortion rights in red states like </span><a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2024/03/05/august-was-not-a-fluke-kansas-advocates-warn-against-raft-of-bills-limiting-reproductive-rights/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kansas </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span><a href="https://michiganadvance.com/2023/11/08/ohio-voters-pass-issue-1-constitutional-amendment-to-protect-abortion-and-reproductive-rights/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ohio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and blue states like </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/abortion-us-supreme-court-health-california-89310197d2b3bd3e3ba806620dd2bdbb" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">California</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and in competitive states like </span><a href="https://michiganadvance.com/2022/11/10/braving-long-lines-michigan-college-students-help-propel-dem-proposal-3-victories/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a patchwork quilt of different abortion laws exist around the country. So, as people travel to other states to receive abortions, privacy and criminalization concerns have emerged. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rainer noted a </span><a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/04/22/biden-harris-administration-issues-new-rule-support-reproductive-health-care-privacy-under-hipaa.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new Biden administration rule </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that strengthens privacy protections. It will prevent reproductive healthcare information from being shared for criminal investigations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Bolstered patient privacy and trust isn&#8217;t just about your records,” she said. “It&#8217;s about ‘am I too scared to go back to an emergency room or to go back to a facility to get the care that I need? Am I too scared to keep information from my doctor because I&#8217;m trying to protect myself or I&#8217;m trying to protect my doctor? Or is my provider too scared to give me information because they risk criminal liability?’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, Virginia has taken on the issue at the state level. After vetoing it previously, this year Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed a bill this year to </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/youngkin-menstrual-data-virginia-search-warrants-general-assembly/article_b2ea107c-f5b8-11ee-ac2c-ab1a87d2cca1.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prohibit menstrual health data from being subject to search warrants.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> But  he vetoed a companion bill that would have </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/youngkin-menstrual-data-virginia-search-warrants-general-assembly/article_b2ea107c-f5b8-11ee-ac2c-ab1a87d2cca1.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prevented Virginia from complying with extradition requests</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for patients who travel from states with bans to receive abortions in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concurrent with abortion legislation, lawmakers from Virginia and nationwide have sought to protect access to contraception and in vitro fertilization. Youngkin vetoed a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/20/youngkin-vetoes-bills-on-contraception-access-skill-games-confederate-heritage-rollbacks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">right-to-contraception</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bill this year while congress’ right-to-contraception and IVF efforts have </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/05/u-s-senate-gop-prevents-contraception-access-bill-from-moving-ahead/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">been stalled </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">as well. Lawmakers say they will keep trying. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is imperative that we take action at the state and federal level,” Cousins said. “It’s concerning to me that with one election, we could go all the way backward.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Judd noted how some who seek abortions are already mothers and may not be able to afford to care for more children, an example of the various reasons a woman may need to end a pregnancy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Becoming a mother or a parent is a profoundly human endeavor. It rests on our hearts and on our souls,” Judd said. “It involves circumstances that are deeply practical — our light bill, our pocketbooks, housing, social support — and it often involves faith and prayer. And what it should not include is the United States government.”</span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A rural health committee met in Farmville this week as part of ongoing efforts to hear from community members and experts on rural healthcare disparities and brainstorm ways to fix them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assembled </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/12/scott-announces-special-committee-on-rural-health-care-access/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">earlier this year,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the bipartisan cohort has been hosting meetings around the state to focus on different challenges to healthcare access in rural communities. The group is also tasked with delivering policy recommendations by the end of the year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of those recommendations may include trying again on bills that didn’t cross the finish line this year or were vetoed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such was the case for a bill to </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB286" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reestablish a maternal health task force</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which had been tabled for this year, and a bill to </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb35" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">require unconscious bias training</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when renewing medical licenses, which </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/20/youngkin-vetoes-bills-on-contraception-access-skill-games-confederate-heritage-rollbacks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin vetoed last month</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. An effort to collect data on </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB140" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fetal and infant mortality</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had also been tabled. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Katie Page, a certified nurse-midwife with Centra Health who serves as the legislative liaison for the American College of Nurse-Midwives said she considered those policies to be important. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Page was among presenters at the meeting where maternal health was a focus of discussion. As a midwife, she explained the role the medical professionals play in labor and delivery as well as prenatal and postnatal care. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maternal health was a focal point of Tuesday’s meeting in Farmville in Virginia’s South Side. Other topics included overlapping issues with regards to access such as dental care and how free clinics have been “safety nets” for communities since Virginia </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/08/02/virginias-uninsured-rate-dropped-after-medicaid-expansion-new-report-finds/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expanded Medicaid</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> several years ago. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Workforce development was a shared concern for the various industries and a suggestion that emerged during the discussion was a sales pitch to medical professionals about working in rural areas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Polly Raible, director of Delta Dental of Virginia Foundation, said “we’re not doing enough” to ask medical professionals what would bring them to rural areas. And, she added that Virginia isn’t doing enough to “sell” what’s attractive about rural areas and working in them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another challenge that the different groups shared was transportation for patients — be it travel time and cost or less access to public transportation options. The matter also popped up when the committee met in Tazewell this past spring, the first of its several meetings scheduled throughout this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we&#8217;re finding out is that even if you can find a provider, so many people can&#8217;t get to them or their follow up visits,” said Del. Rodney Willett, D-Henrico, who chairs the committee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Originally from Farmville, Willett recalled how his own family had to drive up to an hour away for dental care growing up. That’s not feasible for everyone, he said, and added that allocating state and federal funding towards transportation can help families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Money of course could always be part of the equation, but we&#8217;ve got to look at that,” he said.  “But once you’ve got the funding, can you find a transportation company willing to provide services in a really rural area? We’ve got some figuring out to do there; this (issue) just keeps hitting us in the face.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He suspects transportation struggles will surface in future presentations at future committee meetings. The next meeting is slated for mid-September on Virginia’s Eastern Shore. Willett said the details are still being finalized. </span>        <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/subscribe" style="text-decoration:none;">

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican lawmakers from southwest Virginia </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/17/virginias-state-budget-will-fund-ob-gyn-medical-residencies-amid-obstetrics-closures/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">earmarked funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the new state budget to attract OB-GYN medical residents, while Democratic U.S. Sen. Mark Warner has </span><a href="https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/d/b/db64187c-8170-4b41-93c7-2e292710d7e4/671BBC17FF60624673294CC49BA54FA4.061724-keep-obstetrics-local-act-discussion-draft-leg-text.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drafted a bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help limit obstetrics closures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dubbed the “Keep Obstetrics Local Act,” the federal legislation would increase Medicaid payment rates for labor and delivery services to hospitals in rural and high-need urban areas. It would also provide payments to help hospitals cover the cost of staffing and maintaining obstetrics at low-volume hospitals and require all states to provide postpartum Medicaid coverage for up to 12 months after birth (which </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/virginia-will-expand-medicaid-coverage-up-to-a-year-after-pregnancy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia already does</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recruiting and retaining these professionals is one reason rural hospitals are shutting down their obstetrics units.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In some parts of Virginia, we’ve got a declining population, but also if you’re an OB-GYN, you can make more money in a suburb or urban area,” Warner said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Money is both a problem and solution, Southwest Virginia resident Wendy Welch said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the director of the Southwest Virginia Graduate Medical Education Consortium, Welch’s organization helps cover costs of bringing medical residents into Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While family practice doctors and midwives play an important role in care for pregnant people, OB-GYN doctors can be useful for high-risk pregnancies and complicated births. They’re also a key component of hospitals having obstetrics units. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To catch a unicorn — to catch someone who’s that valuable and knows they’re that valuable, you need a whole lot of stuff to attract them now,” Southwest Virginia resident Wendy Welch previously told the Mercury. “If they’re a kayaker or their mom is in Southwest Virginia, you’ve got them, but if not, how are you going to get them here?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warner said his bill can help hospital systems spend money to recruit and pay OB-GYN specialists. He noted how addressing maternal healthcare intersects with other work that public and private sectors are doing to bolster rural communities such as job creation and broadband buildout. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re not going to bring good quality jobs if a future young mom can&#8217;t get the health care she needs,” Warner said. </span></p>

(Kena Betancur/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Scientists debated the origins of COVID-19 on Tuesday, trading barbs over whether the bulk of evidence available points to a natural spillover event from a wild animal or a virus designed in a lab and then let loose through an inadvertent leak.</p>
<p>The hearing in front of the U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee was part of ongoing efforts in Congress to apply the lessons learned during the pandemic to prevent or blunt the next outbreak.</p>
<p>Gregory Koblentz, associate professor and director of the Biodefense Graduate Program at George Mason University in Virginia, said during the <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/hearings/origins-of-covid-19-an-examination-of-available-evidence/" target="_blank">two-hour hearing</a> that debate continues in the scientific community about the origins.</p>
<p>“The possibility that SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately developed as a biological weapon has been unanimously rejected by all U.S. intelligence agencies,” Koblentz testified. “While the intelligence community is divided on the origin of the pandemic, most of the agencies have determined that the virus was not genetically engineered.”</p>
<p>Residents in Wuhan, China, were first diagnosed with “an atypical pneumonia-like illness” in December 2019, according to a COVID-19 <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/museum/timeline/covid19.html" target="_blank">timeline</a> from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>Initial cases all appeared linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market at the time, though there has since been much speculation about the types of research taking place at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.</p>
<p>Koblentz said he believes the available evidence points to a spillover event from an animal, though he added a “research-related accident can’t be ruled out at this time.”</p>
<p>The lack of transparency and data from the Chinese government has significantly hindered scientists’ efforts to unify around the origin of COVID-19, he said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Scientists battle over lab vs. spillover</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Richard Ebright, board of governors professor of chemistry and chemical biology and laboratory director at the Waksman Institute of Microbiology at Rutgers University in New Jersey, testified he believes a “large preponderance of evidence indicates SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, entered humans through a research incident.”</p>
<p>Ebright also leveled criticism at fellow panelist Robert Garry, who, along with a handful of co-authors, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9" target="_blank">published an opinion article</a> in the journal nature medicine in March 2020, titled “The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2.”</p>
<p>In the commentary, Garry and the other scientists wrote, “we do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible.”</p>
<p>Ebright said during Tuesday’s hearing that the opinion article represented “scientific misconduct up to and including fraud,” a characterization that Garry rejected during the hearing.</p>
<p>“The authors were stating their opinion, but that opinion was not well-founded,” Ebright said. “In March of 2020, there was no basis to state that as a conclusion, as opposed to simply being a hypothesis.”</p>
<p>Garry, professor and associate dean of the School of Medicine at Tulane University in Louisiana, argued on behalf of the spillover event during the hearing, testifying that the virus likely didn’t move directly from a bat to humans, but went to an unidentified intermediary animal.</p>
<p>“The bat coronaviruses are viruses that are spread by the gastrointestinal route,” Garry said. “For a virus like this to become a respiratory virus — it’s just going to require too many mutations, too many changes for a bat virus to spill directly over to a human being. That could only really happen in nature with replication through an intermediate animal.”</p>
<p>Garry also defended gain-of-function research during the hearing, arguing that it has had some beneficial impact, though he noted that it does need “appropriate safeguards and restrictions.”</p>
<p>Lawmakers and pundits have used several, often evolving, definitions for gain-of-function research in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The American Society for Microbiology <a href="https://asm.org/getmedia/24ebbde0-d618-4a8a-901c-6e297e6f92aa/HD-918-ASM-GoF-FactSheet-final.pdf" target="_blank">defines</a> it as techniques “used in research to alter the function of an organism in such a way that it is able to do more than it used to do.”</p>
<p>When research is “responsibly performed” on highly transmissible and pathogenic viruses, it can lead to advances in public health and national security, Garry testified.</p>
<p>“Without gain-of-function research, we’d have no Tamiflu. Without gain-of-function research, we wouldn’t have a vaccine to prevent cancer caused by infection by the human papilloma virus,” Garry said. “And without gain-of-function research, we won’t be able to identify how novel viruses infect us. And if we don’t know how they infect us, we cannot develop appropriate treatments and cures for the next potential pandemic creating virus.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Oversight of funding, research </h4>

<p>New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan raised several questions about whether there’s enough oversight of how the United States spends research dollars as well as what mechanisms are in place to monitor how private entities conduct certain types of research.</p>
<p>“While their research has the potential to cure diseases and boost our economy, unless they accept federal funding, there is very little federal oversight to ensure that private labs are engaged in safe and ethical research,” she said.</p>
<p>Koblentz from George Mason University said there is much less oversight of biosafety and biosecurity for private research facilities that don’t receive federal funding.</p>
<p>“In order to expand the scope of oversight to all privately funded research, (it) would require legislative action,” Koblentz said.</p>
<p>Congress, he said, should establish a national bio-risk management agency that would have authority over biosafety and biosecurity “regardless of the source of funding.”</p>
<p>“At the end of the day, it shouldn’t matter where the funding comes from in terms of making sure this research is being done safely, securely and responsibly,” Koblentz said.</p>
<p>Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul, ranking member on the committee, said the panel will hold an upcoming hearing specifically on gain-of-function research, including what steps Congress should take to ensure it doesn’t put the public at risk.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The next pandemic</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Committee Chairman Gary Peters, a Michigan Democrat, said during the hearing that lawmakers “must learn from the challenges faced during this pandemic to ensure we can better protect Americans from future potential biological incidents.”</p>
<p>“Our government needs the flexibility to determine the origins of naturally occurring outbreaks, as well as potential outbreaks that could arise from mistakes or malicious intent,” Peters said.</p>
<p>Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney, after listening to some of the debate, expressed exasperation that so much attention is going toward what caused the last pandemic and not on how to prepare for the next one.</p>
<p>“Given the fact that it could have been either, we know what action we ought to take to protect from either,” Romney said. “And so why there’s so much passion around that makes me think it’s more political than scientific, but maybe I’m wrong.”</p>
<p>The United States, he said, shouldn’t be funding gain-of-function research and should “insist” that anyone who receives federal funding follow the standards of the International Organization for Standardization.</p>

																						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1024" height="683" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/pregnant-woman_Getty-1024x683.jpeg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="" style="margin-bottom: 10px;" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/pregnant-woman_Getty-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/pregnant-woman_Getty-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/pregnant-woman_Getty-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/pregnant-woman_Getty-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/pregnant-woman_Getty-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p style="font-size:12px;">(Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julia Resil is leaving Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this stage in her career, the chapter of being a medical resident is naturally coming to a close and she will move on to become an attending physician in Rhode Island. Resil has spent the past three years at Johnston Memorial Hospital in Abingdon, in Southwest Virginia. She’s excited that she’ll be closer to her family in Boston and nearer to metropolitan areas, though practicing family medicine in a rural area was attractive to her as a medical resident. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Family medicine practice can include obstetrics — the delivery of babies — and the exodus of doctors like Resil comes at a time where several rural hospitals in Virginia have suspended their obstetrics programs. Within the past year, Sentara Halifax Regional Hospital, Sovah Health in Martinsville and LewisGale Hospital-Montgomery in Blacksburg have stopped offering obstetrics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sentara</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Halifax Regional Hospital Dr. Brian Zwoyer said that there was a 33% decrease in births there over the past five years. In a recent email, he attributed this to “changing demographics, aging populations and a national declining birth rate.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With hospitals already less accessible in rural areas of the state than urban areas, Resil noted that patients end up traveling further for check-up appointments or to give birth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And as you get closer to your due date, you have more appointments,” Resil said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 15% of people in Virginia </span><a href="https://www.marchofdimes.org/peristats/reports/virginia/maternity-care-deserts" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">don’t have a birthing hospital within a 30-minute drive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to a report from the March of Dimes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Danville-based doula Roshay Richardson works with clients around Virginia’s South Side and occasionally some from North Carolina. She said that she’s seen patients travel to Danville from elsewhere to give birth and wonders how much of a strain that could put on labor and delivery doctors with an uptick in clients. Richardson works with the Virginia Rural Health Association, which advocates to lawmakers about rural healthcare needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While doulas aren’t obstetricians, they provide companionship and patient advocacy to their clients. A U.S. Department of Health </span><a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/dfcd768f1caf6fabf3d281f762e8d068/ASPE-Doula-Issue-Brief-12-13-22.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> noted doulas’ role in positive health outcomes and they’ve been particularly helpful for Black parents. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Likewise, Resil described a patient traveling about three hours because they wanted to see a doctor of color. Resil is among a diverse cohort of medical residents in a</span><a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/state-by-state/virginia-population-change-between-census-decade.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> predominantly white part of the state</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They were a little bit scared because they had providers that were white in the past and they felt uncomfortable because they felt like they weren’t being heard,” Resil said of the patient.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a woman of color with family from Haiti, Resil knows this feeling. She shared that anecdotally, she and members of her family have felt this way when they’ve gone to the doctor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then seeing that in some of my patients. They’ve been hopping around from doctor to doctor saying ‘something is wrong but I can’t figure it out; but no one is listening to me,” Resil said. “And then we find out, ‘oh yeah, there is. Let’s make sure we get you to the high-risk OB-GYN.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OB-GYN care can be deadly at times, with pregnancy-related medical emergencies that can arise suddenly. Such was the case for Wendy Welch’s friend. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welch, director of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Southwest Virginia Graduate Medical Education Consortium, described how a friend developed eclampsia. The pregnancy-related blood pressure disorder is life threatening and her friend had to be flown to a different hospital across the state line and into an urban area. This saved her life, but also resulted in much higher medical bills. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She explained that her friend was unconscious when loaded onto a flight and then “woke up about $30,000 in debt.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A funding boost</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Money is both an issue and a solution, Welch explained. Her nonprofit organization works to help cover costs of bringing medical residents into Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welch said that lower population density and declining birth rates has meant there’s not “enough people for the hospital system to consider (obstetrics) profitable.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But funding positions could help. Most OB-GYN residencies </span><a href="https://www.acog.org/career-support/medical-students/medical-student-toolkit/ob-gyn-residencies-by-state" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are in other areas of the state</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Though family medicine residents can work with pregnant clients, OB-GYN residents are more specialized in obstetrics and gynecology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“(Rural areas) get screwed,” Welch said. “To catch a unicorn — to catch someone who’s that valuable and knows they’re that valuable, you need a whole lot of stuff to attract them now. If they’re a kayaker or their mom is in Southwest Virginia, you’ve got them, but if not, how are you going to get them here?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers have secured </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/item/2024/1/HB30/Enrolled/1/288/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">funding in the state budget </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that they hope can bolster medical residencies. Del. Chris Obenshain, R-Montgomery and Del. Jason Ballard, R-Giles pressed for one million over the next two years to fund 10 obstetric-gynecological residents. Two positions are specifically earmarked for Johnston Memorial, where Resil has worked in family medicine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The matter is also personal to Obenshain, whose wife had to travel to give birth to their child recently when the LewisGale hospital near them stopped labor and delivery services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He felt lucky that there is a cluster of hospitals in his portion of Southwest Virginia, but he noted how other parts of Southwest Virginia and South Side have less options.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s a much bigger issue when a hospital doesn&#8217;t provide these services anymore,” Obenshain said. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Maternal health legislation</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia legislators in both parties worked on a variety of bills this year to improve maternal health outcomes. Some proposals, like a requirement for health insurance </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/youngkin-doulas-black-maternal-health-general-assembly/article_34a9f222-f379-11ee-8dc9-e36a8194fce6.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">coverage of doulas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, were signed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, he vetoed a proposal to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/20/youngkin-vetoes-bills-on-contraception-access-skill-games-confederate-heritage-rollbacks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">include unconscious bias and cultural competency training when renewing medical licenses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black people are more likely to experience</span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7384760" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> negative maternal health outcomes, in part, due to providers’ racial bias,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> according to a study. </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/maternal-mortality/2021/maternal-mortality-rates-2021.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black women are also more likely to die from pregnancy complications than white women</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Women whose skin is darker than my wife’s skin have significantly worse outcomes,” Sen. Chris Head, R-Botetourt, said during a floor speech while defending the bill in the Senate. “Something needs to be examined and done about that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Head had carried the bill with three Democratic  lawmakers who are also Black women: Sens. Lashrecse Aird, D-Petersburg; Mamie Locke, D-Hampton; and Jennifer Carroll Foy, D-Prince William. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though he ultimately vetoed the bill, Youngkin had first sought amendments that advocates for the bill worried made the training just a “checked box.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin signaled interest in working on more maternal health legislation so the bill could come up again next year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, new cohorts of medical residents will cycle through Virginia and state agencies are set to use the new budget funding to recruit some with OB-GYN specialties. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Resil has been able to bring her perspective as a practitioner of color to rural Virginia, she has lessons learned from the more hands-on experience that she will take with her when she leaves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have made countless house calls to people, and I know that’s something I would probably not do in Boston, back home,” she said. “Being able to see how people are living, you can get a better idea of a family.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said she plans to be “more inquisitive” with her patients going forward as a result.</span></p>

(Photo illustration by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a much-anticipated decision Thursday that mifepristone, one of two pharmaceuticals used in medication abortion, can remain available under current prescribing guidelines.</p>
<p>The high court unanimously rejected attempts by anti-abortion groups to roll back access to what was in place more than eight years ago, writing that they lacked standing to bring the case.</p>
<p>Those limits would have made it more difficult for patients to get a prescription for mifepristone, which the Food and Drug Administration has approved for up to 10 weeks gestation and is used in about 63% of U.S. abortions.</p>
<p>Erin Morrow Hawley, senior counsel at Alliance Defending Freedom, who argued the case in front of the court on behalf of the legal organization, doesn’t believe this is the end of efforts to challenge access to mifepristone.</p>
<p>She said on a call shortly after the ruling was released the three states that intervened in a lower court — Idaho, Kansas and Missouri — could still advance their arguments against mifepristone and potentially hold standing, the legal right to bring a case.</p>
<p>“I would expect the litigation to continue with those three states,” Hawley said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Kavanaugh writes opinion</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Justice Brett Kavanaugh <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-235_n7ip.pdf" target="_blank">wrote the opinion</a> in the united ruling from the Supreme Court, with Justice Clarence Thomas writing a concurring opinion.</p>
<p>“Plaintiffs are pro-life, oppose elective abortion, and have sincere legal, moral, ideological, and policy objections to mifepristone being prescribed and used by others,” Kavanaugh wrote.</p>
<p>The four anti-abortion medical organizations and four anti-abortion doctors who originally brought the lawsuit against mifepristone have protections in place to guard against being forced to participate in abortions against their moral objections, he noted.</p>
<p>“Not only as a matter of law but also as a matter of fact, the federal conscience laws have protected pro-life doctors ever since FDA approved mifepristone in 2000,” Kavanaugh wrote. “The plaintiffs have not identified any instances where a doctor was required, notwithstanding conscience objections, to perform an abortion or to provide other abortion-related treatment that violated the doctor’s conscience.”</p>
<p>“Nor is there any evidence in the record here of hospitals overriding or failing to accommodate doctors’ conscience objections,” he added.</p>
<p>Alliance Defending Freedom has not “identified any instances where a doctor was required, notwithstanding conscience objections, to perform an abortion or to provide other abortion-related treatment that violated the doctor’s conscience since mifepristone’s 2000 approval,” the opinion said.</p>
<p>Kavanaugh might have also included hints on how the court will rule later this session on <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/supreme-court-justices-appear-split-over-whether-protect-abortion-care-during-emergencies" target="_blank">a separate abortion access case</a> that addresses the Emergency Medical Treatment &amp; Labor Act, known as EMTALA.</p>
<p>“EMTALA does not require doctors to perform abortions or provide abortion-related medical treatment over their conscience objections because EMTALA does not impose obligations on individual doctors,” Kavanaugh wrote.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Thomas agrees but questions who can sue</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Thomas wrote a concurring opinion in the case, saying that he agreed with the court’s unanimous decision, which he did join, but brought up concerns with how a certain type of standing is used by the Court.</p>
<p>“Applying these precedents, the Court explains that the doctors cannot establish third-party standing to sue for violations of their patients’ rights without showing an injury of their own,” Thomas wrote.</p>
<p>“But, there is a far simpler reason to reject this theory: Our third-party standing doctrine is mistaken,” Thomas added. “As I have previously explained, a plaintiff cannot establish an Article III case or controversy by asserting another person’s rights.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Reaction pours in</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Politicians, anti-abortion groups and reproductive rights organizations all reacted to the ruling within hours of its release, often pointing to November’s elections as a potential next step.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden released a written statement saying the “decision does not change the fact that the fight for reproductive freedom continues.”</p>
<p>“It does not change the fact that the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade two years ago, and women lost a fundamental freedom,” Biden added. “It does not change the fact that the right for a woman to get the treatment she needs is imperiled if not impossible in many states.”</p>
<p>Former President Donald Trump, the Republican Party’s presumptive nominee, was in meetings most of Thursday with U.S. House Republicans and then separately with Republican U.S. Senators.</p>
<p>Neither Trump nor his campaign released a statement by early Thursday afternoon addressing the Supreme Court’s ruling.</p>
<p>Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, ranking member on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, wrote in a statement that the justice didn’t actually address the merits of the case.</p>
<p>“The Court did not weigh in on the merits of the case, but the fact remains this is a high risk drug that ends the life of an unborn child,” Cassidy wrote. “I urge FDA to follow the law and reinstate important safeguards.”</p>
<p>President of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Stella Dantas related a statement saying the ruling “provides us with long-awaited relief.”</p>
<p>“We now know that patients and clinicians across the country will continue to have access to mifepristone for medication abortion and miscarriage management,” Dantas wrote. “Decades of clinical research have proven mifepristone to be safe and effective, and its strong track record of millions of patient uses confirms that data.”</p>
<p>Hawley from Alliance Defending Freedom wrote in a written statement the organization was “disappointed that the Supreme Court did not reach the merits of the FDA’s lawless removal of commonsense safety standards for abortion drugs.”</p>
<p>“While we’re disappointed with the court’s decision, we will continue to advocate for women and work to restore commonsense safeguards for abortion drugs—like an initial office visit to screen for ectopic pregnancies,” Hawley wrote. “And we are grateful that three states stand ready to hold the FDA accountable for jeopardizing the health and safety of women and girls across this country.”</p>
<p>Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, wrote in a statement she had “both relief and anger about this decision.”</p>
<p>“Thank goodness the Supreme Court unanimously rejected this unwarranted attempt to curtail access to medication abortion, but the fact remains that this meritless case should never have gotten this far,” Northup wrote.</p>
<p>“The FDA’s rulings on medication abortion have been based on irrefutable science,” Northup wrote. “Unfortunately, the attacks on abortion pills will not stop here — the anti-abortion movement sees how critical abortion pills are in this post-Roe world, and they are hell bent on cutting off access.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Scientific evidence argued</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Court heard <a href="https://tinyurl.com/4h8yfaks" target="_blank">oral arguments </a>in the case in March, during which Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar argued the FDA’s guidelines for prescribing mifepristone were based on reputable scientific evidence and years of real-world use.</p>
<p>“Only an exceptionally small number of women suffer the kinds of serious complications that could trigger any need for emergency treatment,” Prelogar said. “It’s speculative that any of those women would seek care from the two specific doctors who asserted conscience injuries. And even if that happened, federal conscience protections would guard against the injury the doctors face.”</p>
<p>Hawley of ADF told the court that conscience protections in federal law didn’t do enough to protect anti-abortion doctors from having to possibly treat patients experiencing complications from medication abortion.</p>
<p>“These are emergency situations,” Hawley said. “Respondent doctors don’t necessarily know until they scrub into that operating room whether this may or may not be abortion drug harm — it could be a miscarriage, it could be an ectopic pregnancy, or it could be an elective abortion.”</p>
<p>The case reached the Supreme Court within two years of ADF originally filing the lawsuit in the District Court for the Northern District of Texas, where ADF wrote the FDA “exceeded its regulatory authority” when it originally approved mifepristone in 2000.</p>
<p>ADF filed the case on behalf of Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American College of Pediatricians and Christian Medical &amp; Dental Associations, as well as four doctors from California, Indiana, Michigan and Texas.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Kacsmaryk ruling started journey to high court</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Judge Matthew Joseph Kacsmaryk essentially agreed with the anti-abortion groups, in a <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-administration-appeals-judges-ruling-ordering-abortion-pill-us-market" target="_blank">ruling</a> in April 2023, where he wrote he did “not second-guess FDA’s decision-making lightly.”</p>
<p>“But here, FDA acquiesced on its legitimate safety concerns — in violation of its statutory duty — based on plainly unsound reasoning and studies that did not support its conclusions,” Kacsmaryk wrote.</p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-preserves-access-abortion-pill-lawsuit-continues" target="_blank">issued a stay</a> at the request of the Justice Department, which put the district court’s ruling on hold until the appeal process could work itself out.</p>
<p>The Justice Department also appealed the district court’s ruling to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in Louisiana, where a three-judge panel <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/three-judge-panel-us-appeals-court-hears-arguments-abortion-pill-case" target="_blank">heard the case</a> in May 2023.</p>
<p>The panel — composed of Jennifer Walker Elrod, who was appointed by former President George W. Bush, as well as James C. Ho and Cory T. Wilson, who were both appointed by former President Donald Trump — <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/abortion-pill-stay-market-until-us-supreme-court-ruling-after-appeals-court-order-0" target="_blank">issued its ruling</a> in August 2023.</p>
<p>The appeals court disagreed with the district court’s ruling that mifepristone’s original approval should be overturned, though it said that the FDA erred in making changes to prescribing guidelines in 2016 and 2021.</p>
<p>“It failed to consider the cumulative effect of removing several important safeguards at the same time. It failed to consider whether those ‘major’ and ‘interrelated’ changes might alter the risk profile, such that the agency should continue to mandate reporting of non-fatal adverse events,” the appeals judges wrote. “And it failed to gather evidence that affirmatively showed that mifepristone could be used safely without being prescribed and dispensed in person.”</p>
<p>That ruling didn’t take effect under the Supreme Court’s earlier stay.</p>
<p>The Department of Justice wrote to the high court weeks later in September, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-justice-department-asks-supreme-court-take-abortion-pill-case" target="_blank">urging the justices</a> to take up an appeal of the 5th Circuit’s decision.</p>
<p>“The loss of access to mifepristone would be damaging for women and healthcare providers around the Nation,” the DOJ wrote in the 42-page document. “For many patients, mifepristone is the best method to lawfully terminate their early pregnancies. They may choose mifepristone over surgical abortion because of medical necessity, a desire for privacy, or past trauma.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Briefs filed with court</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Dozens of abortion rights organizations and lawmakers filed so-called amicus curiae or friend of the court briefs to the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/dozens-friend-court-briefs-backing-abortion-pill-access-arrive-supreme-court" target="_blank">calling on the justices</a> to keep access to mifepristone in line with the FDA guidelines.</p>
<p>A group of more than 16 medical organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, wrote that “restricting access to mifepristone will not only jeopardize health, but worsen racial and economic inequities and deprive women of the choices that are at the very core of individual autonomy and wellbeing.”</p>
<p>Anti-abortion groups and lawmakers opposed to mifepristone <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/who-wants-us-supreme-court-limit-abortion-pill-access-heres-list" target="_blank">wrote numerous briefs</a> as well.</p>
<p>Attorneys general from Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia and Wyoming sent in a 28-page brief.</p>
<p>They wrote that the availability of mifepristone undermined states’ rights, since some of their states had sought to restrict abortion below the 10 weeks approved for mifepristone use or had sought to bar access to medication abortion.</p>
<p>“The FDA’s actions undermine these laws, undercut States’ efforts to enforce them, and thus erode the federalism the Constitution deems vital,” the attorneys general wrote. “Given these harms to federalism, this Court should view the FDA’s actions with skepticism.”</p>
<p>During oral arguments in March, several Supreme Court justices brought up conscience protections that insulate health care workers from having to assist with or perform procedures they have a religious objection to, like abortion.</p>
<p>Associate Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said she was “worried that there is a significant mismatch in this case between the claimed injury and the remedy that’s being sought.”</p>
<p>“The obvious, common-sense remedy would be to provide them with an exemption that they don’t have to participate in this procedure,” Jackson said.</p>
<p>Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch said the case seemed “like a prime example of turning what could be a small lawsuit into a nationwide legislative assembly on an FDA rule, or any other federal government action.”</p>

(Meghan McIntyre/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares wants states to have more authority to regulate pharmacy benefit managers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pharmacy benefits managers, or PBMs, are the middlemen that negotiate contracts between health plans, drug manufacturers and pharmacies. Though they do retain rebates and discounts set in their contracts, the exact amount of savings passed onto consumers has been relatively unknown. In recent years, several states have pushed legislation to enhance transparency, but it’s unclear how much power states have to enact their own regulations due to different court rulings on similar cases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, Miyares recently signed onto a 32-state </span><a href="https://files.constantcontact.com/d3e83e11901/9f8033d8-ce4d-4073-9282-74a00254f77e.pdf?rdr=true" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">amicus brief</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to request that the United States Supreme Court review a case from Oklahoma. In that case, the U.S Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit upheld that federal laws preempt Oklahoma’s laws to regulate PBMs. In the brief Miyares joined, the coalition argued that the Tenth Circuit decision conflicts with previous, related decisions by the Supreme Court and from the Eighth Circuit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Their self-serving protections stifle competition, obscure transparency, and restrict access to potentially life-saving medications,” Miyares said of PBMs in a statement. “PBMs have not served the best interests of consumers, and it is essential the Court affirms that all States can regulate [them].”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a representative of a PBM trade association asserts the Tenth Circuit got it “right.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We will continue to defend that position,” Greg Lopes, vice president of government affairs for the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, said in an email. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, Virginia lawmakers</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/14/amendments-establishing-single-va-medicaid-pharmacy-benefits-manager-die-in-conference/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> attempted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to establish a single PBM for Medicaid but the measure failed. </span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="YPRinzPcMJ"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/14/amendments-establishing-single-va-medicaid-pharmacy-benefits-manager-die-in-conference/">Amendments establishing single Va. Medicaid pharmacy benefits manager die in conference</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Amendments establishing single Va. Medicaid pharmacy benefits manager die in conference&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/14/amendments-establishing-single-va-medicaid-pharmacy-benefits-manager-die-in-conference/embed/#?secret=z1mEmCGMyT#?secret=YPRinzPcMJ" data-secret="YPRinzPcMJ" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes, pharmacies are reimbursed for less than what they pay for medications due to the lack of transparency from PBMs and manufacturers. When advocating for Virginia to have a single PBM for Medicaid, Sen. Travis Hackworth, R-Tazewell, explained that independent pharmacies like the one he used to own are often impacted the most. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are more Medicaid payers than there are private payers, and so when the PBMs get in there … it’s the only business I’ve ever had that literally we would have customers walk in and I’d lose $5 on you, maybe $5 on this one and make $20 here and I lose $20 here; it’s crazy,” he said. “It was all the same dosages and medications.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the U.S. Supreme Court were to review Oklahoma’s case, it could set a precedent for other states to have more regulatory powers over PBMs. Miyares joining the amicus brief is the latest in Virginia’s attempts to rein in drug costs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the past several years in a row a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers has tried to create a Prescription Drug Affordability Board. After clearing the legislature this year, it was vetoed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin. Skeptics of the proposal have argued there’s not enough evidence it would function as intended — boards in states that have created them </span><a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2022/can-state-prescription-drug-affordability-boards-address-high-cost-drug-prices" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have been set up in recent years</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+amd+SB274AG" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">veto statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Youngkin called the idea “noble in its intent,” but expressed concern that the board could have potential to limit availability of some drugs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If created, it would have the authority to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">review sudden price increases on prescription medicine and set a limit on what pharmaceutical manufacturers can charge people for them. Lawmakers supportive of the proposal relayed how constituents have struggled to pay for medications or have had to weigh the costs against other necessities like paying rent or keeping groceries in their households. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville, who’d carried the bill this year in the Senate, said he’s going to explore when to bring the bill back up again and if any changes might make it more palatable to Youngkin should the bill come up next year while he is still governor.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve got to sit down with the advocates and see what they want to do and talk with [Youngkin] about what changes would make him favor this bill if there are changes that could be made,” Deeds said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One such advocate has been the AARP of Virginia. They supported Deeds’ bill. Though Youngkin vetoed that proposal, AARP associate director Jared Calfee said his organization was pleased that the governor </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb1402" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">signed bills </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to impose fees on unlicensed PBMs and enhance reporting requirements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While PBMs have a role to play with costs of prescription drugs, we view manufacturers and some of their practices as a main driver of costs,” Calfee said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s why creating the affordability board is still a top priority for his organization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While best practices to enhance prescription drug affordability are debated in courts and legislatures, Congress has already worked on a bit of relief with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. That means that 10 drugs are being negotiated with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services; and the </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/kaine-hears-from-patients-medical-professionals-on-health-care/article_4d98a32e-66dd-11ee-ac9d-ab8939c2ccc3.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">results of those negotiations are slated to take effect in 2026</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

<p>It’s the latest in a long-running saga involving Massachusetts-based Magellan Diagnostics, which will <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/pr/magellan-diagnostics-agrees-plead-guilty-and-pay-42-million-resolve-criminal-charges" target="_blank">pay $42 million in penalties</a>, according to the Department of Justice.</p>
<p>While many of the fault-prone devices were used from 2013 to 2017, some were being recalled <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CCDPHP/DEODC/CLPPB/CDPH%20Document%20Library/magellan_fact_sheet_20211203_ADA_v2.pdf" target="_blank">as late as 2021</a>. The Justice Department said the malfunction produced inaccurate results for “potentially tens of thousands” of children and other patients.</p>
<p>Doctors don’t consider any level of lead in the blood to be safe, especially for children. Several U.S. cities, including Washington, D.C., and Flint, Michigan, have struggled with widespread lead contamination of their water supplies in the last two decades, making accurate tests critical for public health.</p>
<p>It’s possible faulty Magellan kits were used to test children for lead exposure into the early 2020s, based on the recall in 2021. Here’s what parents should know.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What tests were affected?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The inaccurate results came from three Magellan devices: LeadCare Ultra, LeadCare II, and LeadCare Plus. One, the LeadCare II, uses finger-stick samples primarily and accounted for more than half of all blood lead tests conducted in the U.S. from 2013 to 2017, according to the Justice Department. It was often used in physician offices to check children’s lead levels.</p>
<p>The other two could also be used with blood drawn from a vein and may have been more common in labs than doctor’s offices. The company “first learned that a malfunction in its LeadCare Ultra device could cause inaccurate lead test results – specifically, lead test results that were falsely low” in June 2013 while seeking regulatory clearance to sell the product, the DOJ said. But it did not disclose that information and went on to market the tests, according to the settlement.</p>
<p>The agency said 2013 testing indicated the same flaw affected the LeadCare II device. A 2021 recall included most of all three types of test kits distributed since October 27, 2020.</p>
<p>The company said in a <a href="https://www.magellandx.com/resources/magellan-diagnostics-announces-voluntary-resolution-of-federal-investigation/" target="_blank">press release</a> announcing the resolution that “the underlying issues that affected the results of some of Magellan’s products from 2013 to 2018 have been fully and effectively remediated,” and that the tests it currently sells are safe.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What does a falsely low result mean?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Children are often tested during pediatrician visits at age 1 and again at age 2. Elevated lead levels can put kids at risk of developmental delay, lower IQ, and other problems. And symptoms, such as stomachache, poor appetite, or irritability, may not appear until high levels are reached.</p>
<p>Falsely low test results could mean parents and physicians were unaware of the problem.</p>
<p>That’s a concern because treatment for lead poisoning is, initially, mainly preventive. Results showing elevated levels should prompt parents and health officials to determine the sources of lead and take steps to prevent continued lead intake, said Janine Kerr, health educator with the Virginia Department of Health’s <a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/leadsafe/" target="_blank">Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program</a>.</p>
<p>Children can be exposed to lead in a variety of ways, including by drinking water contaminated with lead from old pipes, such as in Flint and Washington; ingesting lead-based paint flakes often found in older homes; or, as reported recently, eating some <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/outbreaks-foodborne-illness/investigation-elevated-lead-chromium-levels-cinnamon-applesauce-pouches-november-2023" target="_blank">brands of cinnamon-flavored applesauce.</a></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What should parents do now?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>“Parents can contact their child’s pediatrician to determine if their child had a blood lead test with a LeadCare device” and discuss whether a repeat blood lead test is needed, said <a href="https://profiles.mountsinai.org/maida-p-galvez" target="_blank">Maida Galvez</a>, a pediatrician and professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York.</p>
<p>During an earlier recall of some Magellan devices, in 2017, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-warns-americans-about-risk-inaccurate-results-certain-lead-tests" target="_blank">recommended that patients be retested</a> if they were pregnant, nursing, or children younger than 6 and had a blood lead level of less than 10 micrograms per deciliter as determined by a Magellan device from a venous blood draw.</p>
<p>The 2021 recall of Magellan devices recommended retesting children whose results were less than the current CDC reference level of 3.5 micrograms per deciliter. Many of those tests were of the finger-stick variety.</p>
<p>Kerr, at the Virginia health department, said her agency has not had many calls about that recall.</p>
<p>The finger-stick tests “are not that widely used in Virginia,” said Kerr, adding that “we did get a lot of questions about the applesauce recall.”</p>
<p>In any case, she said, the “best course of action for parents is to talk with a health care provider.”</p>

<p>As of May 25, the nation had seen a roughly 150% increase in cases of the disease formerly known as monkeypox — from 434 at that time last year to 1,089 this year, according to the <a href="https://wonder.cdc.gov/nndss/static/2024/21/2024-21-table968.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CDC</a>. About a third of the cases are in New York state, New York City (which the CDC reports separately), New Jersey and Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Anyone can contract <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/monkeypox#tab=tab_1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mpox</a>, a viral disease that can cause a rash, pain severe enough to require hospitalization and — in <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/clinicians/reporting-deaths.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rare cases</a>, primarily in patients with other complications — death. But during 2022’s U.S. outbreak, the contagious infection mainly affected men in gay and bisexual communities. While it’s not a sexually transmitted infection, mpox can be passed through skin-to-skin contact, respiratory droplets or contact with bodily fluids.</p>
<p>June is Pride Month, and public health experts are concerned about a potentially higher caseload this summer as people gather for large celebrations. Experts are encouraging vaccination outreach, especially to Black and Hispanic LGBTQ+ people, who are less likely to be vaccinated and more likely to face barriers to getting care.</p>
<p>Those who are at highest risk for mpox, including men who have sex with men and people with advanced HIV, should receive two doses, four weeks apart, of the trademarked Jynneos vaccine to prevent infection.</p>
<p>The CDC has <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/cases-data/mpx-jynneos-vaccine-coverage.html#:~:text=CDC%20estimates%20show%20that%20without,become%20more%20likely%20over%20time." target="_blank" rel="noopener">warned</a> that low vaccination rates among those groups with the highest risk of mpox exposure could lead to a resurgence of the disease.</p>

<p>Dr. Richard Silvera, an assistant professor of infectious diseases at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, said the current mpox rates are far lower than they were in 2022, when there were <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/monkeypox/mpox-response-data-summary.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 3,800 cases</a> citywide, but that the numbers are growing rapidly.</p>
<p>“I am very concerned that there will be increased rates over the summer, particularly as we hit Pride Month,” Silvera said.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" title="“Missed care, fewer patients: Rural families and clinics feel Medicaid cuts” — Stateline" src="https://stateline.org/2024/05/17/missed-care-fewer-patients-rural-families-and-clinics-feel-medicaid-cuts/embed/#?secret=eGIzYFNmTD#?secret=BF1gkduXNT" width="500" height="461" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-scripts" data-secret="BF1gkduXNT" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>New York City has seen more than 200 cases this year — up from 46 at this time last year. It’s unclear what is causing the surge, but Silvera and other experts say one factor could be that some patients may not have received their second doses.</p>
<p>“Either their immunity is waning, or folks didn’t get complete vaccination,” he said. “And so now there’s been time for that virus to exploit those gaps in protection.”</p>
<p>The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene released an <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/han/advisory/2024/han-advisory-12-mpox.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advisory</a> in early May, noting that of the 256 diagnoses between October 2023 and April 15, 73% were among unvaccinated people or people who had received only one dose.</p>
<p>“There’s a large overlap between people who belong to BIPOC communities, living with HIV, identifying as LGBTQ+,” said Preeti Pathela, executive director of the STI program at the agency.</p>
<p>“Our hope is that, through this kind of regular outreach which we have intensified in the last couple of months, knowing that coming into the summer is going to be a critical time to really double down, we’re just hoping that the messaging and the services get out to the communities that need it.”</p>
<p>Racist language associated with the former name of mpox helped spur the World Health Organization to rename it in 2022. Public health experts also were concerned that the former name might be discouraging people from being tested and vaccinated by contributing to the stigma surrounding the disease.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" title="“Tuberculosis cases rise, but public health agencies say they lack the resources to keep up” — Stateline" src="https://stateline.org/2024/02/07/tuberculosis-cases-rise-but-public-health-agencies-say-they-lack-the-resources-to-keep-up/embed/#?secret=apJp3RB4oX#?secret=f9jO2MSYs9" width="500" height="461" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-scripts" data-secret="f9jO2MSYs9" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7320a4.htm?s_cid=mm7320a4_w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> last month, the CDC <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7319a3.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">warned</a> of a heightened global threat of a deadlier strain of mpox that is devastating the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the virus is endemic. That strain hasn’t been detected in the United States, but the agency and clinicians are on alert for possible cases in travelers from the country.</p>
<p>Infectious disease physician Dr. Anu Hazra said he and others in the field are closely watching that strain.</p>
<p>“The only way that we can truly think about eradicating mpox is bringing vaccines to everywhere in the world that’s impacted by the illness,” said Hazra, who sees patients at Howard Brown Health, which runs several clinics in the Chicago area focused on LGBTQ+ care.</p>
<p>HIV patients are at <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10378858/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">higher risk</a> of contracting mpox, and are <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/data-research/facts-stats/race-ethnicity.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disproportionately</a> Black and Hispanic. Racism, homophobia and barriers to care such as poverty and a lack of transportation complicate prevention and treatment efforts.</p>
<p>“When we think about, sort of, any communicable disease, we know that it tracks along racial and economic fault lines. We’ve seen that with HIV, we’ve seen that with COVID, we see that with certain STIs — we have certainly seen it with mpox,” Hazra said.</p>
<p>Silvera, of the Icahn School of Medicine, said clinicians and state health agencies also should consider the historic distrust of medicine among Black and Hispanic communities.</p>
<p>“It takes a lot of time. We’re undoing decades and centuries of work,” he said. “It’s a tough job. And so, we can do that person to person, but it’s also going to require larger efforts as well to undo these disparities.”</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" title="“Monkeypox Straining Already Overstretched Public Health System” — Stateline" src="https://stateline.org/2022/07/28/monkeypox-straining-already-overstretched-public-health-system/embed/#?secret=E2usfNqt67#?secret=qcmMwltLlz" width="500" height="610" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-scripts" data-secret="qcmMwltLlz" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>Along with distrust and vaccine skepticism, fear of being “outed” as gay is a major barrier in some Black communities, said Ryan Payne, a prevention specialist at the Alliance of AIDS Services-Carolina. The organization serves six counties in North Carolina.</p>
<p>“That is a full-blown truth. It’s very hard. Me and my co-workers are talking about that all the time,” Payne said.</p>
<p>At the end of April, the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services found that <a href="https://www.ncdhhs.gov/2022-23-mpox-surveillance-data/open" target="_blank" rel="noopener">30 of the 51 cases</a> over the previous six months were among Black people. But <a href="https://www.ncdhhs.gov/mpox-vaccine-administration-and-demographic-data/download?attachment?attachment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only 27%</a> of patients vaccinated in the state this year were Black.</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania, there have been 64 reported mpox cases compared with two at this time last year, according to the CDC. The state’s health department said it will emphasize the importance of vaccinations throughout 2024, using an awareness campaign that will focus on reaching the at-risk populations through social media and dating apps.</p>
<p>Cory Haag, a registered nurse at the Central Outreach Wellness Center in Pittsburgh, said the best way to stem the spread is by addressing barriers, educating patients and quelling fears within the LGBTQ+ community the center serves.</p>
<p>Many patients travel for up to two hours to receive care at the center. It provides bus passes to patients so they can more easily return for a second vaccine dose.</p>
<p>“We’re just happy to be that safe space to catch them,” Haag said.</p>

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WASHINGTON — An attempt to reinforce Americans’ access to contraception failed Wednesday when U.S. Senate Republicans blocked a bill from advancing toward final passage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1182/vote_118_2_00190.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">51-39 procedural vote </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">required at least 60 senators to move forward, but fell short after GOP lawmakers said the measure was too broad as well as unnecessary. Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Maine Sen. Susan Collins, both Republicans, broke with their party and voted to advance the legislation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats argued during debate on the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/4381/text" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">12-page bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that it would provide a safety net should a future Supreme Court overturn two cases that ensure married and unmarried Americans have the right to make decisions about when and how to use contraception. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GOP senators contended the vote was mere politics and that if Democrats were serious about safeguarding access to contraception for future generations, they’d work with Republicans on a bipartisan bill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevada Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen said the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the constitutional right to an abortion in the Dobbs decision two years ago showed women how quickly things can change. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It demonstrated that a fundamental right, the right of women to make decisions over their own bodies, could be taken away in the blink of an eye,” Rosen said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women, she said, can’t rely solely on the Supreme Court to uphold the cases that have guaranteed Americans access to contraception for more than 50 years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Contraception has been safely used by millions of women for decades,” Rosen said. “It’s allowed women to take control over their own bodies — to decide when they want to start a family, how many kids they have, who they want to start a family with.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For these very same reasons, the right to contraception has been a target of anti-choice extremists for years,” Rosen added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Minority Whip John Thune, the South Dakota Republican seeking to become the chamber’s next GOP leader, said the bill was meant to “provide a talking point for Democratic candidates.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These votes have nothing to do with legislating and everything to do with boosting Democrats’ electoral chances, he hopes, in this fall’s election,” Thune said, referring to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation was a non-starter with many Republicans, Thune said, because it didn’t carve out the conscience protections that exist under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/103rd-congress/house-bill/1308#:~:text=Religious%20Freedom%20Restoration%20Act%20of%201993%20%2D%20Prohibits%20any%20agency%2C%20department,government%20may%20burden%20a%20person's" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">federal law,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> enacted in 1993 after being sponsored by Schumer, established “a heightened standard of review for government actions that substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Sales of contraceptives</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats’ bill would have protected “an individual’s ability to access contraceptives” and “a health care provider’s ability to provide contraceptives, contraception, and information related to contraception.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation would have barred state and federal governments from prohibiting the sale of any contraceptives or blocking “any individual from aiding another individual in voluntarily obtaining or using any contraceptives or contraceptive methods.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill defined contraception as “an action taken to prevent pregnancy, including the use of contraceptives or fertility-awareness-based methods and sterilization procedures.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Democrats </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-dems-decry-limits-abortion-access-house-dems-unveil-contraception-bill" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">introduced an identical bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in that chamber on Tuesday, though it’s unlikely to get a vote while Republicans remain in control. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Larry Sabato, who heads the Center For Politics at the University of Virginia, called the effort “a good move for Democrats” to still try. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The problem they&#8217;re going to have is most people don&#8217;t believe that Republicans would actually [prohibit birth control],” Sabato said. “Now the obvious comeback for that is ‘Well, did you think they would abolish Roe v Wade?’ Because people didn&#8217;t believe that either — and then it happened.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But since the overturn of federal abortion protections, access to contraception has come into question as </span><a href="https://stateline.org/2022/05/19/some-states-already-are-targeting-birth-control/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">some states have targeted it </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and a recent Alabama Supreme Court</span><a href="https://alabamareflector.com/2024/02/19/alabama-supreme-court-ruling-could-end-ivf-treatments-in-state/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ruling </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">declared embryos used for in vitro fertilization as people.</span><b> </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the vote on the contraception bill, Schumer moved to schedule a procedural vote next week on legislation that would guarantee access to in vitro fertilization. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schumer said during a press conference afterward that vote would give Americans an opportunity to “see where Republicans stand on the so very important issue” of reproductive rights.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Supreme Court opinion</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supreme Court Associate Justice Clarence Thomas stirred up concerns about access to contraception two years ago when he wrote a </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">concurring opinion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Dobbs case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thomas wrote that the justices should “reconsider all of this Court’s substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">None of the other nine justices joined Thomas in writing that opinion, likely signaling they didn’t agree with some or all of it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 1965 Griswold v. Connecticut case was the first time the court recognized that married couples’ constitutional privacy rights extend to decisions about contraception. That ruling struck down a Connecticut state law that barred access to contraceptives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Supreme Court, in 1972, extended the right to make private decisions about contraception to unmarried people in the Eisenstadt v. Baird ruling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the release of Thomas’ concurring opinion, Democrats and reproductive rights organizations immediately began pressing for federal laws that would reinforce current contraception access. Congress has not passed any so far. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mini Timmaraju, president and chief executive officer of Reproductive Freedom for All, said during a press conference with Senate Democrats on Wednesday before the vote that women should talk with their mothers and grandmothers about when they were first able to obtain birth control. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we talk about the generations of women in this country who didn’t have access to birth control, we’re just talking about my mother’s generation — 1965,” Timmaraju said. “It was not that long ago and that should really be a wake-up call.” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">White House, Biden campaign weigh in</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration signaled its support for Senate Democrats’ bill hours before the vote, writing in a </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/SAP-S4381.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statement of Administration Policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the measure “would protect the fundamental right to access contraception and help ensure that women can make decisions about their health, lives, and families.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Women must have the freedom to make deeply personal health care decisions, including the right to decide if and when to start or grow their family,” the policy states. “Now is the time to safeguard the right to contraception once and for all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden-Harris campaign held a press call on reproductive rights Wednesday morning to highlight the differences between the presidential candidates on reproductive rights, including access to abortion, contraception and in vitro fertilization. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden-Harris Campaign Manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said during the call that Donald Trump, Republicans’ presumptive nominee for president, couldn’t be further away from Biden on access. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rodriguez said Trump’s </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-leaves-door-open-banning-medication-abortion-nationwide" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">comments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during an interview with TIME magazine in April and his </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-signals-hes-open-state-limits-contraceptive-access-then-insists-hes-not" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to a local Pennsylvania TV news station in May show he’s not supportive of women’s reproductive rights. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decisions about contraception, abortion and in vitro fertilization belong to women and their doctors, “not politicians and the government,” Rodriguez said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">North Carolina Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, a member of the Biden-Harris campaign’s advisory board, said on the call this year’s election will be a “defining moment” for the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican efforts to restrict access to reproductive health care, he said, mean they are trying to “control women.” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Ernst alternative proposal </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst said during debate on the bill that Democrats’ legislation went too far and pressed for the Senate to take up </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/4447/text?s=5&amp;r=1&amp;q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22ernst%22%7D" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a bill she introduced </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">earlier this week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The measure has since gained nine co-sponsors including Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Steve Daines of Montana, Todd Young of Indiana, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Ted Cruz of Texas, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, James E. Risch of Idaho and John Cornyn of Texas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iowa Republican Rep. Ashley Hinson plans to introduce the companion bill in the House, according to an announcement from Ernst’s office. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With my bill, we’re ensuring women 18 and over can walk into any pharmacy, whether in Red Oak, Iowa, or Washington, D.C., and purchase a safe and effective birth control option,” Ernst said. “This Republican bill creates a priority review designation for over-the-counter birth control options to encourage the FDA to act quickly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ernst said she was “encouraged” that one over-the-counter oral contraceptive has been approved and is available, but that should be “just a starting point.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The four-page bill would encourage the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to approve additional over-the-counter oral contraceptives and “direct the Comptroller General of the United States to conduct a study on federal funding of contraceptive methods.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation would require the secretary of the Health and Human Services Department to give priority review to a supplemental application for oral contraceptives “intended for routine use.” But it does not extend that to “any emergency contraceptive drug” or “any drug that is also approved for induced abortion.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Access to over-the-counter oral birth control that receives FDA approval so that it no longer requires a prescription would be available for people over 18.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">States, including Virginia, can still control contraceptives access — for now</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While federal politicians continue their back and forth over legislating contraception access, states can still take their own stances on the matter. Virginia already tried to do so earlier this year in a measure that cleared both the House of Delegates and state Senate before being vetoed by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, joined Schumer and the other U.S. senators Wednesday for a press conference outside of the Capitol. She had carried Virginia’s own right-to-contraception act months prior. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin had stated support for contraception and initially attempted to amend Price’s bill. While hers would have codified protections whether or not the Griswold and Eisenstadt rulings are upheld or repealed, his amendment — which the legislature rejected — would have aligned Virginia with the rulings. He then vetoed the bill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gov. Younkin unfortunately taught us again that actions mean more than words,” she said Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Likewise, U.S. Sen Tim Kaine, D-Va., said in a call with States Newsroom affiliate the Virginia Mercury that he was not surprised the state measure passed with bipartisan support, but that he was surprised to see Youngkin veto it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you really want to reduce abortions, contraception access is a way to do it,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price and Virginia state Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield, plan to reintroduce their proposal during Virginia&#8217;s next legislative session and again until it is passed. As Virginia governors cannot serve consecutive terms, a new person will be elected to helm the state come 2026. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginians may still have hope since we will soon have a new governor due to our own state term limits,” Price said. “But other states may be stuck with governors like him for years.”</span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eric Oakes’ voice cracked for a moment when he reflected on the Virginia Hazing Prevention Summit he’d helped host at Virginia Commonwealth University Tuesday. Three years after the death of his son, Adam Oakes, the pain lingers but so does inspiration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was great seeing everybody collaborate and come together,” Oakes told reporters following a day-long gathering on VCU’s campus June 4. “I know Adam’s was the extreme of hazing, but there’s so much physical and mental damage done by hazing. It needs to be eradicated.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oakes was a college freshman when he died of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">alcohol poisoning after a fraternity party hazing event in 2021. While hazing can be broad, it usually entails people seeking to join institutions performing expected actions that can sometimes be dangerous to them — such as drinking excessive amounts of alcohol.  </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_30341" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/adam_oakes.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-30341" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/adam_oakes.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="168" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Adam Oakes, 19, died of alcohol poisoining after a VCU fraternity event. (NBC12)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members of his family went on to create the Love Like Adam Foundation and visit colleges in multiple states to give seminars. The Virginia Hazing Prevention Summit in partnership with VCU was their largest endeavor to date and the first of its kind in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The summit included representatives from various universities, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">brainstorming sessions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and presentations, with groups including the Hazing Prevention Network participating. The family of Stone Foltz also attended. Foltz, a Bowling Green State University sophomore, died from hazing-related alcohol poisoning days after Oakes had. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oakes’ cousin Courtney White had been working on her doctorate degree when the tragedy struck and focused her dissertation on hazing prevention. She points to decades of other </span><a href="https://hazingpreventionnetwork.org/hazing-facts/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about hazing in </span><a href="https://www.alfred.edu/about/news/studies/_docs/hazing-study.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">high school</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and collegiate levels when advocating for law changes at the state capitol and when organizing events like the Hazing Prevention Summit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is real. It’s prevalent,” White said. “I’m hoping with the summit we can really get that message out — but then also tap into all the expertise that’s already in and around our state.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The messages resonated with Dirron Allen, associate president of student life at James Madison University. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are now talking about this in light of a tragedy, but we are in spaces to think deeply,” he told reporters after the event Tuesday evening. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rachel Tully, the assistant dean of students at VCU, noted how strategies to mitigate hazing will look different for each institution but that there are tools to learn from each other. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A portion of the gathering included brainstorming meetups for various student and athletics groups to strategize and interact with each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For universities, part of hazing prevention is already mandated by state law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Passed in 2022, “</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+SB439" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adam’s Law,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” requires people joining student organizations at Virginia colleges and universities to undergo hazing prevention training and for the universities to post reports of hazing misconduct online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb379" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> new law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, set to take effect next month, will also build on those efforts by bringing anti-hazing education into high schools. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_38856" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240604_165708-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-38856" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240604_165708-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240604_165708-300x225.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240604_165708-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240604_165708-768x576.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240604_165708-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240604_165708-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  (From left to right) Eric Oakes, Linda Oakes, and Courtney White stand outside of the University Commons at Virginia Commonwealth University after co-hosting the Virginia Hazing Prevention Summit on June 4, 2024.</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will require Virginia’s Board of Education to develop standards and curriculum guidelines for anti-hazing prevention in public schools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The instruction will include examples of hazing and its dangers along with the consequences of alcohol intoxication and laws surrounding hazing — such as bystander intervention. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, the inaugural Hazing Prevention Summit will continue to incubate strategies. White said that other universities have expressed interest in hosting the event in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At one point during the day, White recalled stepping aside to view the crowd at the summit. Seeing people gathered with a common goal was “overwhelming,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s always my goal that more people know about him so that this doesn’t happen to anyone else,” White said. “I hope people can stop seeing us as a grieving family and start seeing us as a catalyst for change.”</span></p>

<div class="entry-content single-content">
<p>The Criminalizing Abused Substance Templates, or <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1549/all-info" target="_blank">CAST</a>, Act would redefine the criminal penalty for producing counterfeit drugs using a pill press. Counterfeiting drugs is already illegal as outlined in the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/jm/jm-9-100000-controlled-substances-act" target="_blank">Controlled Substances Act</a>  but no penalty is included in the law.</p>
<p>Under CAST, it would be illegal to possess a pill press mold with the intent to produce schedule I or II drugs, a crime <a href="https://kustoff.house.gov/media/press-releases/kustoff-re-introduces-criminalizing-abused-substance-templates-cast-act" target="_blank">punishable</a> for up to 20 years.</p>
<p>CAST was <a href="https://spanberger.house.gov/posts/spanberger-applauds-u-s-senate-introduction-of-her-bipartisan-bill-to-crack-down-on-illegal-pill-presses-combat-illicit-fentanyl" target="_blank">introduced</a> in the House by Reps. Abigail Spanberger, a Virginia Democrat, and David Kustoff, a Tennessee Republican, in October 2019 and it was reintroduced in March 2023.</p>
<p>The bill got a boost earlier this month when Sens. Bill Cassidy, R-La., and Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., <a href="https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-hassan-introduce-bill-to-crack-down-on-illegal-pill-presses/" target="_blank">introduced</a> it in the upper chamber.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Overdoses and deaths</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The bill particularly targets the production and distribution of opioids, especially fentanyl. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid with an incredibly high potency, about 100 times more than morphine. As a result, it’s often mixed into other drugs to increase strength, sometimes in lethal doses.</p>
<p>Synthetic opioids are the main drivers of opioid overdoses. Between 2020 and 2021, deaths involving synthetic opioids like illegally made fentanyl <a href="https://www.dea.gov/resources/facts-about-fentanyl" target="_blank">rose</a> by 55%, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration.</p>
<p>Opioid-related and other drug poisoning deaths per 100,000 people are <a href="https://statehealthcompare.shadac.org/rank/197/opioidrelated-and-other-drug-poisoning-deaths-per-100000-people-by-drug-type#1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52/127/37/233/false/highest" target="_blank">highest</a> in West Virginia, the District of Columbia, Delaware, Tennessee and Kentucky.</p>
<p>Lawmakers attribute this rise in fentanyl-related deaths to the counterfeit market and drug trafficking.</p>
<p>“The overdose crisis and the rising scourge of fentanyl are undoubtedly made worse by the rise in use of illicit pill presses to manufacture counterfeit drugs,” Spanberger said in a statement about her legislation.</p>
<p>“By stepping up penalties for narcotics traffickers who use illicit pill presses to manufacture drugs, our bipartisan legislation would empower our law enforcement officers to crack down on these criminals and prevent dangerous substances — such as fentanyl — from being pressed into illicit pills and sold on our streets.”</p>
<p>Much of the illicit fentanyl sold in the U.S. contains at least a potentially lethal dose of fentanyl, 2 mg. A DEA study found that 42% of tested pills contained this amount or more, some as much as 5.1 mg.</p>
<p>Lawmakers said they want to ensure law enforcement officials have the necessary tools to stop the production and sale of these drugs.</p>
<p>“Strengthening penalties for the criminals creating these counterfeit drugs can help get them off the market,” said Hassan in a statement. “This bipartisan legislation will help ensure that law enforcement officials have the tools that they need to crack down on criminals making counterfeit drugs.”</p>
<p>According to the DEA, because lethal doses of fentanyl are often mixed in with other drugs, it can be “possible for someone to take a pill without knowing it contains fentanyl.” Cassidy said the CAST Act could prevent these deaths.</p>
<p>“No one should have to worry if their medicines are counterfeit or laced with fentanyl,” he said.</p>

Ballad Health gets A grades from the Tennessee government. But the scoring rubric largely ignores the actual performance of Ballad’s hospitals, which often falls below expectations. (Brett Kelman/KFF Health News)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Tennessee agency that is supposed to hold accountable and grade the nation’s largest state-sanctioned hospital monopoly awards full credit on dozens of quality-of-care measurements as long as it reports any value — regardless of how its hospitals actually perform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ballad Health, a 20-hospital system in northeast Tennessee and southwest Virginia, has received A grades and an annual stamp of approval from the Tennessee Department of Health. This has occurred as Ballad hospitals consistently </span><a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/appalachia-ballad-health-copa-monopoly-charity-care-quality/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fall short of performance targets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> established by the state, according to health department documents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the state’s scoring rubric largely ignores the hospitals’ performance, only 5% of Ballad’s final score is based on actual quality of care, and Ballad has suffered no penalty for failing to meet the state’s goals in about 50 areas — including surgery complications, emergency room speed, and patient satisfaction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It doesn’t make any sense,” said Ron Allgood, 75, of Kingsport, Tennessee, who said he had a heart attack in a Ballad ER in 2022 after waiting for three hours with chest pains. “It seems that nobody listens to the patients.”</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;After Appalachian hospitals merged into a monopoly, their ERs slowed to a crawl&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/25/after-appalachian-hospitals-merged-into-a-monopoly-their-ers-slowed-to-a-crawl/embed/#?secret=BQjNNPtYFG#?secret=WgIUk4SnUD" data-secret="WgIUk4SnUD" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ballad Health was created six years ago after Tennessee and Virginia lawmakers waived federal anti-monopoly laws so two competing hospital companies could merge. The monopoly agreement established two quality measures to compare Ballad’s care against the state’s baseline expectations: about 17 “target” measures, on which hospitals are expected to improve and their performance factors into their grade; and more than 50 “monitoring” measures, which Ballad must report, but how the hospitals perform on them is not factored into Ballad’s grade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ballad has failed to meet the baseline values on 75% or more of all quality measures in recent years — and some are not even close — according to reports the company has submitted to the health department.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the merger, Ballad has become the only option for hospital care for most of about 1.1 million residents in a 29-county region at the nexus of Tennessee, Virginia, Kentucky, and North Carolina. Critics are vocal. Protesters rallied outside a Ballad hospital for months. For years, longtime residents like Allgood have alleged Ballad’s leadership has diminished the hospitals they’ve relied on their entire lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a shadow of the hospital we used to have,” Allgood said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And yet, every year since the merger, the Tennessee health department has reported that the benefits of the hospital merger outweigh the risks of a monopoly, and that Ballad “continues to provide a Public Advantage.” Tennessee has also given Ballad an A grade in every year but two, when the scoring system was suspended due to the covid-19 pandemic and no grade issued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The department’s </span><a href="https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/health/documents/copa/COPA-Department-Annual-Report-on-FY23.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">latest report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, released this month, awarded Ballad 93.6 of 100 possible points, including 15 points just for reporting the monitoring measures. If Tennessee rescored Ballad based on its performance, its score would drop from 93.6 to about 79.7, based on the scoring rubric described in health department documents. Tennessee considers scores of 85 or higher to be “satisfactory,” the documents state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Larry Fitzgerald, who monitored Ballad for the Tennessee government before retiring this year, said it was obvious the state’s scoring rubric should be changed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fitzgerald likened Ballad to a student getting 15 free points on a test for writing any answer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do I think Ballad should be required to show improvement on those measures? Yes, absolutely,” Fitzgerald said. “I think any human being you spoke with would give the same answer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ballad Health declined to comment. Tennessee Department of Health spokesperson Dean Flener declined an interview request and directed all questions about Ballad to the Tennessee Attorney General’s Office, which also has a role in regulating the monopoly. Amy Wilhite, a spokesperson for the AG’s office, directed those questions back to the health department and provided documents showing </span><a href="https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/health/documents/copa/2019-COPA-RULES.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">it is the agency responsible</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for how Ballad is scored.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Health, which is also supposed to perform “</span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/licensure-and-certification/active-supervision/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">active supervision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” of Ballad as part of the monopoly agreement, has fallen several years behind schedule. Its most recent assessment of the company was for fiscal year 2020, when it found that the benefits of the monopoly “</span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/content/uploads/sites/96/2023/10/Cooperative-Agreement.Virginia-State-Health-Commissioner-FY2020-Annual-Report-and-Determination-1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">outweigh the disadvantages</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” Erik Bodin, a Virginia official who oversees the agreement, said more recent reports are not yet ready to be released.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ballad Health was formed in 2018 after state officials approved the nation’s biggest so-called Certificate of Public Advantage, or COPA, agreement, allowing a merger of the Tri-Cities region’s only two hospital systems — Mountain States Health Alliance and Wellmont Health System. Nationwide, COPAs have been used in about 10 hospital mergers over the past three decades, but none has involved as many hospitals as Ballad’s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/COPA_Policy_Paper.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal Trade Commission has warned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that hospital monopolies lead to increased prices and decreased quality of care. To offset the perils of Ballad’s monopoly, officials required the new company to agree to more robust regulation by state health officials and a long list of special conditions, including the state’s quality-of-care measurements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ballad failed to meet the baseline on about 80% of those quality measures from July 2021 to June 2022, according to a report the company submitted to the health department. The following year, Ballad fell short on about 75% of the quality measures, and some got dramatically worse, another company report shows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, the median time Ballad patients spend in the ER before being admitted to the hospital has risen each year and is now </span><a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/ballad-health-er-wait-times-copa-monopoly-appalachia-hospitals/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly 11 hours</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to the latest Ballad report. That&#8217;s more than three times what it was when the monopoly began, and more than 2.5 times the state baseline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And yet Ballad’s grade is not lowered by the lack of speed in its ERs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fitzgerald, Tennessee’s former Ballad monitor, who previously served as an executive in the University of Virginia Health System, said a hospital company with competitors would have more reason than Ballad to improve its ER speeds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When I was at UVA, we monitored this stuff passionately because — and I think this is the key point here — we had competition,” Fitzgerald said. “And if we didn’t score well, the competition took advantage.”</span></p>

Ayanna Pressley speaks during a press conference on reproductive rights for people with disabilities outside the U.S. Capitol on Thursday, May 23, 2024. (Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Three members of Congress introduced a resolution Thursday that’s intended to bring attention to the experiences and challenges people with disabilities face when it comes to reproductive rights.</p>
<p>Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley announced the resolution during a press conference with advocates just steps from the U.S. Capitol, saying that under a Supreme Court ruling still in effect, people with disabilities can be sterilized without their consent.</p>
<p>“<a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/buck-v-bell-1927/" target="_blank">Buck v. Bell</a> is a decision of the United States Supreme Court in which the court ruled on May 2, 1927, affirming the constitutionality of Virginia’s law allowing state-enforced sterilization,” Pressley said.</p>
<p>Pressley said people outside of the disability rights community often aren’t aware of the ruling or the fact it has never been challenged.</p>
<p>“They’re in disbelief that this even happened and that this ruling authorizes involuntary sterilization of people with disabilities and has never been overturned,” Pressley said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Unique barriers</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://pressley.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Disability-Reproductive-Equity-Day-2024.pdf" target="_blank">four-page resolution</a> would designate one day in May as Disability Reproductive Equity Day.</p>
<p>The resolution says that “people with disabilities face unique barriers when accessing reproductive health care,” including harmful stereotypes, communication barriers and a lack of accessible health care facilities, among other obstacles.</p>
<p>It adds that Congress “pledges to advance the right of people with disabilities to reproductive and sexual health, autonomy, and freedom.”</p>
<p>Illinois Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth and Washington Democratic Sen. Patty Murray introduced the companion resolution in that chamber.</p>
<p>Murray wrote in a statement announcing the introduction that “Americans with disabilities have long had to jump through extra hoops and faced real discrimination when it comes to accessing the health care they need, including abortion care.”</p>
<p>“Access to reproductive health care has been in crisis since the Dobbs decision, making it even harder for people with disabilities to access high-quality care from providers who understand their health care needs,” Murray wrote. “It’s important that we recognize the barriers millions of women face in accessing reproductive health care, and this resolution is an important marker for us all to recommit to the fight for reproductive justice for all.”</p>
<p>Co-sponsors in the House include New Jersey Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, Pennsylvania Rep. Madeleine Dean and Washington Rep. Adam Smith. All are Democrats.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Access to full slate of care</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Rebecca Cokley, a disability advocate and former executive director of the National Council on Disability, told a story during the press conference about how after having her middle child, the anesthesiologist told the OB-GYN to “tie her tubes,” adding that “people like her don’t need to have any more babies.”</p>
<p>Cokley said her OB-GYN could have “advocated for that and it would have been perfectly legal.”</p>
<p>“When we talk about reproductive justice, it’s about the idea that all women, all people have the right to have children, the right to not have children.” Cokley said. “The right to nurture the children we have in a safe and healthy environment.”</p>
<p>Jess Davidson, communications director at the American Association of People with Disabilities, discussed how access to the full slate of reproductive health care, including abortion, is crucial for people with disabilities.</p>
<p>Members of the community, she said, “have an 11 times greater risk of mortality from pregnancy.”</p>
<p>“I know all too well the fear that comes with living with that kind of risk,” Davidson said. “I felt deep in my bones as a young woman that I was made for motherhood.”</p>
<p>After being diagnosed with an illness in her mid-20s that significantly increased her chances of miscarriage or maternal mortality, Davidson said she spoke with her doctor about whether or not she should ever get pregnant.</p>
<p>“I was devastated when I first learned this, but my doctor assured me that if I was willing to get an abortion if it were necessary to save my life and work closely with a high-risk obstetrician, that I could try and see how it went,” Davidson said. “After all, every person and every pregnancy is different.”</p>
<p>That was all before the Supreme Court in 2022 overturned the constitutional right to an abortion that had stood for nearly 50 years under two prior rulings.</p>
<p>“Now when I think about attempting a high-risk pregnancy, I feel so fearful that it feels like I can’t breathe,” she said. “And I am someone who lives in Colorado and Washington, D.C., two places where my right to that life-saving care is still intact.”</p>
<p>Many people with disabilities who want to have children, Davidson said, now live in states that ban or significantly restrict abortion access, even if continuing a pregnancy threatens their life or health.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Forced sterilization in state laws</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Ma’ayan Anafi, senior counsel for health equity and justice at the National Women’s Law Center, said that <a href="https://nwlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/%C6%92.NWLC_SterilizationReport_2022_Appendix.pdf" target="_blank">31 states have laws in place</a> that allow forced sterilization of people with disabilities.</p>
<p>“These laws give judges the power to disregard a disabled person’s wishes and make the decision for them, supposedly for their own good,” Anafi said.</p>
<p>“In doing so they echo many of the same harmful narratives that fueled forced sterilizations … that disabled people can’t or shouldn’t make decisions about their bodies and parenting,” Anafi added. “And that it’s justifiable to take those choices away to protect disabled people from themselves.”</p>
<p><em>Clarification</em>: After publication, Rebecca Cokley’s affiliation was changed at the request of Pressley’s office and the Center for American Progress. Both said Cokley was appearing in her personal and not her professional capacity.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two cases that the United States Supreme Court is expected to rule on this summer could answer these questions and have a ripple effect on abortion access nationwide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One case challenges ease of access to abortion medication while another challenges whether a federal law concerning emergency care supersedes a state’s abortion ban. It’s the first time the nation’s highest court has reviewed abortion-related cases since overturning federal protections two summers ago. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mary Ziegler, a legal historian who has written about abortion law, noted that the emergency room case in particular can be a “game changer” pending its ruling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whatever the Supreme Court decides will have an effect on how a lot of states’ abortion bans are interpreted,” she said. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Idaho officials are seeking to disregard the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, otherwise known as EMTALA. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nearly 40 year old federal law requires hospitals with emergency rooms that receive Medicare funding to provide “stabilizing treatment” to anyone experiencing emergency medical conditions. Most hospitals in the nation receive Medicare funding, and therefore would be subject to EMTALA. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plaintiffs in the case say this is at odds with Idaho’s own abortion law, though. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://legislature.idaho.gov/statutesrules/idstat/title18/t18ch6/sect18-622/#:~:text=Search%20Idaho%20Statutes&amp;text=18%2D622.,the%20crime%20of%20criminal%20abortion." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Idaho enforces its abortion ban</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with criminal penalties up to five years in prison for people who perform them or assist people in getting them. There are limited exceptions for rape, incest and to save the life of the pregnant person, excluding protections for pregnancy complications. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doctors in Idaho have been </span><a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2024/04/23/loss-of-federal-protection-in-idaho-spurs-pregnant-patients-to-plan-for-emergency-air-transport/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sending pregnant patients out-of-state</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to comply with the state’s abortion law. During such medical emergencies, some patients are air-lifted out of the state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Stacy Seyb, a maternal fetal medicine specialist in Boise, explained that it’s become a safer alternative to send a pregnant patient elsewhere should they suspect an emergency abortion may be needed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are times they may not even need the procedure. But we can’t predict that, and we can’t predict how quickly their status might change,” Seyb told </span><a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2024/04/23/loss-of-federal-protection-in-idaho-spurs-pregnant-patients-to-plan-for-emergency-air-transport/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Idaho Capital Sun</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “I think it’s a great hardship, it’s an extra expense to our medical system, and it doesn’t make sense why something that I’ve been doing for 30 years of my career is now taboo.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Countering this, President Joe Biden’s administration argues that EMTALA should protect doctors should abortion be needed as “stabilizing treatment” in emergencies. Plaintiffs in the case from Idaho argue that interpretation of EMTALA could make it too easy for patients to get abortions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When visiting Richmond earlier this year, U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/abortion-biden-richmond-becerra-virginia/article_5343af02-b62f-11ee-8521-171afce83cb7.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xavier Becerra said that the Biden Administration would “pull every lever” </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to protect reproductive healthcare access — such as defending EMTALA in the case against Idaho.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In line with the administration’s support for protecting abortion access, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services launched a new option on the CMS.gov website for people to </span><a href="https://www.cms.gov/priorities/your-patient-rights/emergency-room-rights/how-to-file-complaint" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">file complaints</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if they feel EMTALA has not been upheld.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a ruling in the case would only apply to Idaho, it may set a precedent for more than 20 other states which have </span><a href="https://states.guttmacher.org/policies/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">deep abortion restrictions or near total bans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As the least restrictive southern state, Virginia’s Planned Parenthood is already reporting a 30% increase in out-of-state patients. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jamie Lockhart, the director of the Virginia League of Planned Parenthood, thinks the number of patients traveling for abortions outside of their home state could increase. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When and if the Supreme Court allows Idaho to do this — then it&#8217;s going to be Texas, and it&#8217;s going to be Mississippi, and Alabama, and just across the South,” Lockhart said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It concerns her, especially as she thinks about the broader maternal health outcome </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7384760/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">disparities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for patients of color, in part due to racial bias, and people living in </span><a href="https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2014/02/health-disparities-in-rural-women" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rural communities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that already have to travel further for care to begin with. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the other abortion-related case before the Supreme Court could make it more difficult to obtain abortion medication.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The outcome of </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/hundreds-protest-outside-us-supreme-court-keep-abortion-medication-accessible" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this case</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> could affect ease of access to a common drug used in early-gestation abortions — which make up </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/abortion-pills-mifepristone-supreme-court-27d18f91242eb08c4d805880ddb5bb60" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">roughly two-thirds </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">of abortions nationwide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2000, mifepristone is the first part of medicine-induced abortions or miscarriage-related care. </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/20/medication-abortion-rates-grew-10-over-the-last-few-years-report-shows/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mifepristone</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> blocks a hormone that’s needed to continue a pregnancy and another drug, misoprostol, is administered after to help bodies expel tissue. The drugs typically are used for abortions under 10 weeks of gestation, but are also used to manage miscarriages to help prevent deadly infections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abortion-opposing physicians and organizations </span><a href="https://adfmedialegalfiles.blob.core.windows.net/files/AllianceForHippocraticMedicineComplaint.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">previously argued</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in lower courts that the FDA should not have approved mifepristone 24 years ago. Now, they </span><a href="https://adfmedialegalfiles.blob.core.windows.net/files/AHM-OpeningBrief.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">argue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the drug should not have become easier to access in 2016 and 2021. The FDA changes from those years increased the limit of when it could be used from seven to 10 weeks of gestation and allowed for telehealth prescriptions, respectively. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those provisions could be affected if the court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Patients in Virginia would be forced to receive this care in person rather than via a telehealth appointment — which we know places undue and medically unnecessary barriers to care for people across Virginia who struggled to travel long distances to receive care,” Lockhart said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, when the case was heard by the Supreme Court this spring, it seemed likely the judges would </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-abortion-mifepristone-telemedicine-4406d53e8af90f6a523264f535f5adf8#:~:text=Supreme%20Court%20seems%20likely%20to%20preserve%20access%20to%20the%20abortion%20medication%20mifepristone&amp;text=The%20Supreme%20Court%20seems%20likely,conservative%20justices%20overturned%20Roe%20v." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">preserve access to the medication.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The justices may decide the plaintiffs lack the legal standing to sue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Zeigler, the legal scholar, cautions that a favorable ruling to abortion advocates in the mifepristone case may not be the end of challenges to the drug and abortion at-large.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A potential future case is building</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attempts to enforce the Comstock Act — a dormant federal law from 1873 — have </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/as-abortion-issue-heats-up-dormant-law-a-vehicle-for-potential-restrictions/article_97be880a-bc6a-11ee-97e7-1f45bf0b8393.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">been surfacing in local governments around the country</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Grayson County in Southwest Virginia </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/a-virginia-county-considered-19th-century-approach-to-abortion-restrictions/article_2b72de8a-9b04-11ee-9864-1fbc992a7e0e.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voted down</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a measure last year, while a case in </span><a href="https://sourcenm.com/2023/12/14/n-m-supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-local-anti-abortion-ordinances/#:~:text=Chacon%20argued%20for%20the%20city,Supreme%20Court%20Justice%20Briana%20Zamora." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Mexico has advanced to that state’s supreme court.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 19th Century act prohibits the mailing of “obscene” or “lewd” materials such as pornography, as well as contraception and “every article or thing designed, adapted, or intended for producing abortion.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years Congress chipped away at the act, but the abortion components have remained. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, they’ve emerged in modern-day arguments against the procedure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proponents of implementing the act interpret it as a way to stop the mailing of abortion medications and materials needed to perform an abortion or establish a clinic. Local governments have considered ordinances that employ the act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mark Lee Dickson, the architect of the national movement, told the </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/abortion-roe-versus-wade-youngkin-bristol-tennessee-virginia/article_31281cfc-15f1-11ee-8559-9b85d4db3696.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond Times-Dispatch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last summer that the ordinances are “simply requiring compliance with these federal statutes, which we believe completely stops abortion in communities.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dickson travels the country meeting with local officials who are interested in invoking the act. He and legal ally, former Texas Solicitor General Jonathan Mitchell, offer their representation in the case of legal challenges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dickson said this offer “goes up” to the U.S. Supreme Court. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Justices Thomas Alito and Clarence Thomas recently </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/29/politics/comstock-act-alito-thomas-abortion/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mentioned Comstock while hearing the FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine case</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation also offers guidance for national abortion restrictions. Its series of policy goals called “</span><a href="https://www.project2025.org/policy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Project 2025</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” has included the</span><a href="https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_CHAPTER-14.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> legal code</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for Comstock without naming the law specifically. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calling abortion medication a “gift to the abortion industry,” the guidebook asserts that the FDA should “stop promoting or approving mail-order abortions in violation of long-standing federal laws that prohibit the mailing and interstate carriage of abortion drugs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Comstock itself has not yet made it to the Supreme Court in the form of its own case, Ziegler noted how the issue is gaining salience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now, I think you&#8217;re seeing it as, you know, a major election issue and something that a lot of Republicans say a (President Donald Trump Department of Justice) would do,” Zeigler said. “Of course, Trump has essentially avoided answering the question.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While many GOP congressional candidates, including in Virginia, have </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/17/they-dont-like-abortion-but-kaines-gop-challengers-say-they-wont-seek-a-federal-ban/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said abortion regulation is a state-level issue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Democrats hope to proactively shore up federal protections legislatively. Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine has pressed to codify protections through the Reproductive Healthcare For All Act and Biden has made abortion protections a pillar of his reelection campaign.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="HEb1kNyCh2"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/17/they-dont-like-abortion-but-kaines-gop-challengers-say-they-wont-seek-a-federal-ban/">They don’t like abortion, but Kaine’s GOP challengers say they won’t seek a federal ban</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should Democrats retain the White House and make gains in Congress, they could enact various protections. But the Supreme Court still has a conservative majority that could continue its pattern of taking up legal challenges to abortion access.</span></p>

Rodney Willett, D-Henrico, speaks at Main St. Station in Richmond for Rx Partnership's 20th anniversary event.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the cost of living rises, many low-income Virginians often have to </span><a href="https://www.vhcf.org/who-and-how-we-help/rx-medicines/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">choose</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between paying for vital medication or putting food on the table. This is where <a href="https://www.rxpartnership.org" target="_blank">Rx Partnership</a> comes in – a nonprofit that works to expand medication access across the entire state and has done so for 20 years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rx Partnership executive director Amy Yarcich said the organization obtains medication either by purchasing it or through pharmaceutical company donations, where it is then sent to free clinics across the commonwealth. Since its first shipment of medication in 2004, Yarcich said Rx Partnership has supported over 80,000 patients across 31 free clinics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yarcich said the access to medication along with health care services provided by free clinics can help patients “be healthier and have one less worry when they’re looking at juggling so many things in their life.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nonprofit’s origin dates to 2003, when a group of healthcare professionals collaborated to create a more efficient way to access medication in Virginia for patients who need it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There were processes with pharmaceutical companies that were really cumbersome, time consuming and just not working well,” Yarcich said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, Rx Partnership sees a significant demand in medication from clinics serving low-income, uninsured patients, despite the jump in Virginians with Medicaid coverage after the state expanded the program in 2019. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A patient “may turn up to a pharmacy counter to find out an inhaler costs $125 and they may abandon that prescription because they just don’t have that,” Yarcich said. “They’re making tough decisions about whether to get dinner that evening or be able to afford medication.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rx Partnership also works with free clinics to provide medication for the underinsured — patients who don’t qualify for Medicaid but can’t afford to pay large out-of-pocket expenses through commercial insurance. Free clinics can help enroll eligible patients on Medicaid and provide medication in instances where a person is waiting to receive benefits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, Yarcich said because there are so many free clinics with pharmacies, Rx Partnership helps alleviate medication access in “pharmacy deserts” — areas where no traditional pharmacies are available. According to a June Board of Pharmacy report, </span><a href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/l/GetFile.cfm?File=meeting%5C30%5C37183%5CAgenda_DHP_37183_v1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">five</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Virginia counties — Rappahannock, Nelson, King and Queen, Surry and Charles City — don’t have a single pharmacy. Fifteen counties only have one pharmacy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patients who face barriers like lack of transportation can receive medication through mail delivery, a program Rx Partnership started in response to COVID-19.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re there to catch people who fall through the cracks,” Yarcich said. “We want to make sure there is that safety net and people dont go without things and find themselves in crisis in the emergency room.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average Virginian may not realize this support system exists, Yarcich said, because Rx Partnership mainly works behind the scenes with free clinics and pharmaceutical companies. In an effort to raise awareness during its 20-year anniversary, the nonprofit is displaying an exhibit of its work and accomplishments at Main St. Station in Richmond. The display will remain until May 31.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Maybe it’s not today, maybe it’s next week, next year,” Yarcich said. Increased awareness means a person can “find themself in conversation with someone struggling and they can mention Rx Partnership.”</span></p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note:</em> This story has been updated to reflect Rx Partnership has supported 80,000 patients since 2004, not 8,000.</p>

Advocates celebrate its availability but say access is still lacking in terms of cost barriers and insurance coverage.

<p>“My parents are immigrants from India, and it’s been over the counter there since my mom can remember,” said Srinivasan, a recent graduate of University of California Los Angeles.</p>
<p>More than 100 countries were already selling birth control without a prescription before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration — one year ago as of last Thursday — approved Opill. Though the hormonal, over-the-counter birth control pill was approved in May 2023, it didn’t reach online retailers or the shelves of major drug stores across the country until a couple of months ago. 	<div class="newsroomSidebarContainer ">
	<div class="newsroomSidebar">A<span class="gmail-Apple-converted-space"> </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB609" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bill</a><span class="gmail-Apple-converted-space"> </span>by Del. Marcia Price, D-Newport News to establish a fundamental right to access and use birth control, independent of the U.S. Constitution, was passed by the Virginia General Assembly in the 2024 legislative session. It <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+ful+HB609+pdf" target="_blank">specified</a> that citizens should be able to access certain types of contraceptives including intrauterine devices (IUDs), oral and hormonal contraceptives, emergency birth control methods, and several others. The measure, and its companion <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB237" target="_blank">Senate bill </a>by Sen. Ghazala F. Hashmi, D-Richmond, received bipartisan support in both chambers.</p>
<div>The measure was amended by Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who tried to tie the bill to Supreme Court precedents that deem the restriction of birth control access as a privacy violation. The governor&#8217;s amendment also stripped the bill of specific types of contraception whose access would be protected by law.  The legislation&#8217;s patrons Price and Hashmi said in a <a href="https://www.wric.com/news/virginia-news/two-bills-concerning-contraception-access-back-in-youngkins-hands/" target="_blank">statement</a> that Youngkin &#8220;is not only playing games with voters but also with our health care.&#8221; Lawmakers rejected the amendment, sending the measures back to Youngkin, who has until May 17 to either sign the bills in their original form, or veto them. If he does neither, the measures will become law.</div>
</div>
	</div>
	
<p>Opill is a progestin-only birth control pill, which is slightly different from the typical prescription of a progestin and estrogen combination pill. Dr. Kristin Lyerly, an OB-GYN in Green Bay, Wisconsin, said that means the oral contraceptive is still very safe and 98% effective, but the user has to be more diligent about making sure it’s taken at the same time every day. If the time window is missed by three hours or more, there is a higher chance of unintended pregnancy, so she recommends that people use a backup form of protection for the next 48 hours while they get back on schedule.</p>
<p>Srinivasan, 21, gets health care coverage through her parents’ private insurance, but she said when she called clinics to see if she could get a birth control prescription last year, the first appointment that was available was six months out.</p>
<p>She happened to be working with Free the Pill, a group of reproductive health advocates and health care providers, on getting Opill approved by the FDA, so she decided to hold off.</p>
<p>“Almost out of spite, I was like, ‘I’m going to wait and get this over the counter.’”</p>
<p>On March 22, just after Opill hit the U.S. market, Srinivasan drove with a friend to a nearby Walgreens to buy their first packs, which cost about $20 each. The two recorded a TikTok of themselves taking their first doses.</p>
<p>“It was a very joyous and empowering moment to be able to take that for the first time,” Srinivasan said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Contraception access is key post-Dobbs, researcher says</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Dr. Daniel Grossman, director of the Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health program at the University of California San Francisco, has been at the forefront of the effort to get FDA approval for an over-the-counter birth control pill since 2004, and is part of the steering committee of Free the Pill. His research efforts included a study showing that women who had direct access to the pill in areas like Texas border towns where people could cross into Mexico to get it directly stayed on it longer than those who needed a prescription. His research also found that people generally didn’t support age restrictions, and the FDA approval for Opill does not have an age restriction.</p>
<p>Grossman said more access to contraception is important for overall reproductive health, but it’s especially important in the wake of the Dobbs decision in 2022 that overturned Roe v. Wade and led 14 states to enact near-total abortion bans.</p>
<p>“Improved access to contraception isn’t going to solve the crisis of abortion access that we’re currently facing, but that said, in this moment — when people in half of the states have very limited options for abortion care and there are growing threats on access to contraception — I think it’s important that we do everything we can to expand access to all methods of birth control where that’s possible,” Grossman said.</p>

<p>Aside from a few expected and manageable side effects, including headaches and light bleeding, Srinivasan said she’s had a good experience with the pills and their availability so far. But there’s room for improvement, she said, and Free the Pill is advocating for more cost assistance support and coverage from national private insurance companies.</p>
<p>Free the Pill launched an<a href="https://actionnetwork.org/letters/sign-and-send-the-petition-to-president-biden-over-the-counter-birth-control-must-be-covered-by-insuranceno-prescription-required?source=direct_link&amp;referrer=group-ibis-reproductive-health" target="_blank"> online petition</a> this week to pressure President Joe Biden and his administration to require insurance plans to include coverage for Opill. It had 35,000 signatures as of Thursday afternoon.</p>
<p>Srinivasan said she tried to apply for assistance but wasn’t able to because she has insurance, and only those without any form of private or public insurance can apply. Qualifying applicants also have to have a household income at or below 200% of the<a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/topics/poverty-economic-mobility/poverty-guidelines" target="_blank"> federal poverty line</a>, which is $15,060 for a single person. A 2022 survey from Advocates for Youth found that 1 in 3 of those surveyed cited affordability as one of the biggest barriers to accessing contraception.</p>
<p>“At a $20 price point, it’s something I can afford because I have a job and I live in California, where the minimum wage is over $17 an hour, but it’s definitely not something my peers in other states can afford that easily,” Srinivasan said. “I hope they adjust that, because it’s definitely not reaching the people that it should be reaching right now.”</p>

<p>The anti-abortion movement’s use of Christianity in arguments might create the impression that broad swaths of religious Americans don’t support abortion rights. But a recent report shows that Americans of various faiths and denominations believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.prri.org/research/abortion-views-in-all-50-states-findings-from-prris-2023-american-values-atlas/" target="_blank">Public Religion Research Institute</a> survey of some 22,000 U.S. adults released last week, 93% of Unitarian Universalists, 81% of Jews, 79% of Buddhists and 60% of Muslims also hold that view.</p>
<p>Researchers also found that most people who adhere to the two major branches of Christianity — Catholicism and Protestantism — also believe abortion should be mostly legal, save for three groups: white evangelical Protestants, Latter-day Saints and Jehovah’s Witnesses.</p>
<p>Historically, the Catholic Church has opposed abortion. But the poll found that 73% of Catholics of color — PRRI defines this group as Black, Asian, Native American and multiracial — support the right to have an abortion, followed by 62% of white Catholics and 57% of Hispanic Catholics. 	<div class="newsroomSidebarContainer ">
	<div class="newsroomSidebar">Religious views on abortion vary greatly in Virginia. According to a 2014 <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religious-landscape-study/database/state/virginia/views-about-abortion/#demographic-information" target="_blank">Pew Research Center survey</a> of Virginia adults, mainline protestants — including methodists, lutherans, episcopalians, presbyterians and other denominations — appeared to be the most accepting of abortion rights, with 62% believing abortion should be legal in all or most cases.</p>
<div></div>
<div>Catholic Virginians were split on the topic, with 48% agreeing that abortion should be legal in all or most cases, and 48% disagreeing on the same point.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Evangelical protestants seemed the least accepting of abortion access, with 41% of baptist, pentecostal, non denominational and other congregations believing abortion should be legal in all or most cases.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Of the Virginia citizens surveyed who identified as unaffiliated with any religious group, 70% believed abortion access should be legal all or most of the time.</div>
</div>
	</div>
	
<p>The findings show that interfaith views on abortion may not be as simple as they appear during political debate, where the voices of white evangelical legislators and advocates can be the loudest.</p>
<p>States Newsroom spoke with Abrahamic religious scholars — specifically, experts in Catholicism, Islam and Judaism — and reproductive rights advocates about varying perspectives on abortion and their history.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Abortion views in America before Roe v. Wade</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/05/religious-right-real-origins-107133/" target="_blank">Moral Majority</a> — a voting bloc of white, conservative evangelicals who rose to prominence after the U.S. Supreme Court Roe v. Wade ruling in 1973 — is often associated with spearheading legislation to restrict abortion.</p>
<p>Gillian Frank is a historian specializing in religion, gender and sexuality who teaches at the Stevens Institute of Technology in New Jersey. Frank said evangelical views on abortion were actually more ambivalent before the early ’70s Roe decision established the federal right to terminate a pregnancy. (The Supreme Court upended that precedent about two years ago.)</p>
<p>“What we have to understand is that evangelicals, alongside mainline Protestants and Jews of various denominations, supported what was called therapeutic abortion, which is to say abortion for certain exceptional causes,” Frank said, including saving the life or health of the mother, fetal abnormalities, rape, incest and the pregnancy of a minor. Religious bodies like the Southern Baptist Convention and the National Association of Evangelicals said abortion was OK in certain circumstances, he added.</p>
<p>Evangelical Protestants before Roe did not endorse “elective abortions,” Frank said, or what they called “abortion on demand,” a phrase invoked by abortion-rights opponents today that he said entered the American lexicon around 1962.</p>
<p>The 1973 ruling was seismic and led organizations opposing abortion, such as the National Right to Life Committee — formed by the Conference of Catholic Bishops — to sprout across the country, according to an article published four years later in <a href="https://www.facingsouth.org/2022/06/archives-right-life-southern-strategy" target="_blank">Southern Exposure</a>. Catholic leaders often lobbied other religious groups — evangelicals, Mormons, orthodox Jews — to join their movement and likened abortion to murder in their newspapers.</p>
<p>After Roe, “abortion is increasingly associated with women’s liberation in popular rhetoric in popular culture, because of the activism of the women’s movement but also because of the ways in which the anti-abortion movement is associating abortion with familial decline,” Frank said. Those sentiments, he said, were spread by conservative figures like Phyllis Schlafly, a Catholic opposed to feminism and abortion, who campaigned against and managed to block the Equal Rights Amendment in the 1970s.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Polls suggest the views of Catholic clergy and laypeople diverge</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Catholicism is generally synonymous with opposition to abortion. According to the <a href="https://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/human-life-and-dignity/abortion/respect-for-unborn-human-life" target="_blank">United States Conference of Catholic Bishops</a>, the church has stood against abortion since the first century. The conference <a href="https://bible.usccb.org/bible/jeremiah/1" target="_blank">points</a> to Jeremiah 1:5 in the Bible to back up arguments that pregnancy termination is “contrary to the moral law.”</p>
<p>But nearly 6 in 10 American Catholics believe abortion should be mostly legal, according to a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/04/12/9-facts-about-us-catholics/" target="_blank">Pew Research Center</a> report released last month.</p>
<p>Catholics for Choice spokesperson Ashley Wilson said that there’s a disconnect between the church as an institution and its laity. “We recognize that part of the problem is that the Catholic clergy, and the people who write the official teaching of the church, are all or mostly white male — my boss likes to say ostensibly celibate men — who don’t have wives,” Wilson said. “They don’t have daughters. They have no inroads into the lives of laypeople.”</p>
<p>Her group plans on going to Vatican City in Rome this fall to lift up stories of Catholics who’ve had abortions. The organization is also actively involved in efforts to restore abortion access — <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/see-data-reproductive-rights" target="_blank">14 states have near-total bans</a> — through direct ballot measures in <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/its-not-extraordinary-its-health-care-says-leader-colorado-abortion-ballot-initiative" target="_blank">Colorado</a>, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/fl-supreme-court-allows-rigid-6-week-abortion-ban-clears-abortion-rights-amendment-ballot" target="_blank">Florida</a> and <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/more-380000-missourians-sign-initiative-petition-put-abortion-ballot" target="_blank">Missouri</a> this year.</p>
<p>Catholic dioceses and fraternities are often behind counter-efforts to proposed ballot questions. They poured <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/abortion-2024-ballot-campaigns-could-see-millions-funding-familiar-players" target="_blank">millions</a> into campaigns in <a href="https://www.facingsouth.org/kentucky-abortion-ballot-measure-money" target="_blank">Kansas and Kentucky</a> in 2022 to push anti-abortion amendments, and also in <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/ohio-catholic-bishops-spent-big-failed-effort-defeat-abortion-rights-amendment" target="_blank">Ohio</a> last year to defeat a reproductive rights ballot measure but they failed in each state.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Ensoulment and mercy in Islam</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Tenets of Islam — the second largest faith in the world — often make references to how far along a person’s pregnancy is and whether there are complications. University of Colorado Law professor Rabea Benhalim, an expert of Islamic and Judaic law, said there’s a common belief that at 40 days’ gestation, the embryo is akin to a drop of fluid. After 120 days, the fetus gains a soul, she said.</p>
<p>While the Quran doesn’t specifically speak to abortion, Benhalim said <a href="https://islamicstudies.info/reference.php?sura=23&amp;verse=12-14#:~:text=(23%3A12)%20We%20created,then%20We%20caused%20it%20to" target="_blank">Chapter 23: 12-14</a> is considered a description of a fetus in a womb. The verses are deeply “important in the development of abortion jurisprudence within Islamic law, because there’s an understanding that life is something that is emerging over a period of stages.”</p>
<p>In some restrictive interpretations of Islam, there’s a limit on abortion after 40 days, or seven weeks after implantation, Benhalim said. In other interpretations, because <a href="https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6939-15-10" target="_blank">ensoulment</a> doesn’t occur until 120 days of gestation, abortion is generally permitted in some Muslim communities for various reasons, she said. After ensoulment, abortion is allowed if the mother’s life is in danger, according to religious doctrine.</p>
<p>Sahar Pirzada, the director of movement building at HEART, a reproductive justice organization focused on sexual health and education in Muslim American communities, confirmed that some Muslims believe in the 40-day mark, while others adhere to the 120-day mark when weighing abortion.</p>
<p>“How can you make a black-and-white ruling on something that is going to be applied across the board when everyone’s situation is different?” she asked. “There’s a lot of compassion and mercy with how we’re supposed to approach matters of the womb.”</p>
<p>The issue is personal for Pirzada, who had an abortion in 2018 after her fetus received a fatal diagnosis of <a href="https://wapo.st/4a8wMWO" target="_blank">trisomy 18</a> when she was 12 weeks pregnant. “I wanted to terminate within the 120-day mark, which gave me a few more weeks,” she said.</p>
<p>She consulted scholars and Islamic teachings before making the decision to end her pregnancy, she said, and mentioned the importance of rahma — mercy — in Islam. “I tried to embody that spirit of compassion for myself,” she said.</p>
<p>Pirzada, who is now a mother of two, had the procedure at exactly 14 weeks on a day six years ago that was both Ash Wednesday and Valentine’s Day. She said she felt loved and surrounded by people of faith at the hospital, where some health care workers had crosses marked in ash on their foreheads. “I felt very appreciative that they were offering me care on a day that was spiritual for them,” she said.</p>
<p>Seeing the stories of people with pregnancy complications in the period since the Supreme Court overturned the federal right to an abortion has left her grief stricken. For instance, Kate Cox, a Texas woman whose fetus had the same diagnosis as Pirzada’s, was denied an abortion by the state Supreme Court in December. Cox had to travel elsewhere for care, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/texas-supreme-court-blocks-order-allowing-abortion-woman-who-sought-it-leaves-state" target="_blank">Texas Tribune</a> reported.</p>
<p>Benhalim, the University of Colorado expert, said teachings in Islam and Judaism offer solace to followers who are considering abortion, as they can provide guidance during difficult decisions.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">No fetal personhood in Judaism </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In Jewish texts, the embryo is referred to as water before 40 days of gestation, according to the <a href="https://www.ncjw.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Judaism-and-Abortion-FINAL.pdf" target="_blank">National Council of Jewish Women</a>. Exodus: 21:22-23 in the <a href="https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/shemot-exodus-chapter-21" target="_blank">Torah</a> mentions a hypothetical situation where two men are fighting and injure a pregnant woman. If she has a miscarriage, the men are only fined. But if she is seriously injured and dies, “the penalty shall be a life for a life.”</p>
<p>This part of the Torah is interpreted to mean that a fetus does not have personhood, and the men didn’t commit murder, according to the council. But this may not be a catchall belief — Benhalim noted that denominations of Judaism have different opinions on abortion.</p>
<p>Today, Jewish Americans have been at the forefront of legal challenges to abortion bans based on religious freedom in <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/religion-based-claims-are-piling-against-floridas-15-week-abortion-ban" target="_blank">Florida</a>, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/indiana-court-appeals-affirms-rfra-based-abortion-ban-challenge" target="_blank">Indiana</a> and <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/jewish-women-cite-kentuckys-religious-freedom-law-contesting-state-abortion-ban" target="_blank">Kentucky</a>. Many of the lawsuits have interfaith groups of plaintiffs and argue that restrictions on termination infringe on their religion.</p>
<p>The legal challenge in Indiana has been the most successful. Hoosier Jews for Choice and five anonymous plaintiffs sued members of the state medical licensing board in summer 2022, when Indiana’s near-total abortion ban initially took effect.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs argued that the ban violated the state’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and the court later let the claim receive class-action status. Several Jewish Hoosiers said they believe life begins after a baby’s first breath, and that abortion is required to protect the mother’s health and life, according to court documents.</p>
<p>Last month, the Indiana Court of Appeals <a href="https://www.aclu-in.org/sites/default/files/field_documents/2024.04.24_-_decision.pdf" target="_blank">ruled</a> that the plaintiffs have the right to sue the state but sent the request for a temporary halt on the ban back to a lower court.</p>
<p>While the decision was unanimous, Judge Mark Bailey issued a separate concurring opinion explaining his reasoning and criticizing lawmakers — “an overwhelming majority of whom have not experienced childbirth” — who assert they are protectors of life from the point of conception.</p>
<p>“In my view, this is an adoption of a religious viewpoint held by some, but certainly not all, Hoosiers,” he wrote. “The least that can be expected is that remaining Hoosiers of child bearing ability will be given the opportunity to act in accordance with their own consciences and religious creeds.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an </span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/clinicians/reporting-adverse-events-in-children-following-exposure-to-thc-and-cbd-containing-products/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">April 24 letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to clinicians, State Health Commissioner Karen Shelton said her agency had received enough reports of minors getting sick from products containing CBD and THC, chemical compounds found in cannabis, that the state was establishing a “special surveillance system” to keep tabs on the issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Reported symptoms for these adverse events have included vomiting, hallucinations, low blood pressure, low blood sugar, altered mental status and anxiety,” Shelton wrote, adding that “some hospitalizations have occurred” as a result of minors consuming cannabis products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The letter specifically asks that local health departments be made aware of any cannabis-related hospitalizations in patients under 18 years old and any “clusters of adverse events” affecting multiple minors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“After a hospitalization or cluster is reported, VDH staff will collect information about the illness(es), possible exposures, and laboratory results,” the letter says.</span></p>

(Source: Virginia Department of Health)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Health Department provided data showing an increase in emergency room visits involving minors being exposed to cannabis, and said the new surveillance system will help bolster those tracking efforts. In 2019, there were 52 ER visits. By 2023, the number had grown to 377.</span></p>
<p>That data only covers emergency room visits and doesn&#8217;t reflect every incident reported to health officials.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a result of these data, the special surveillance system was established in order for VDH to receive these reports directly and better assess the impact of adverse events related to consumption of products containing THC or CBD among children in the Commonwealth,&#8221; said Health Department spokesperson Cheryle Rodriguez.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The letter also points to an </span><a href="https://redcap.vdh.virginia.gov/redcap/surveys/?s=7R4T3M7KFL" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online portal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allowing anyone who had an adverse experience with cannabis products to submit a report to the Health Department with information about what happened, where the product was obtained and how it was labeled. The agency also noted that lab testing is available to “support patient and product testing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tracking system set up by health officials is the latest government effort to mitigate the downsides of cannabis, as policymakers continue to debate what to do about adult use of marijuana and products close enough to weed to produce a similar high. Earlier this year, Gov. Glenn Youngkin pointed to health risks to children as one of his reasons for vetoing legislation that would have legalized retail sales of marijuana for purely recreational use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The most concerning consequence of cannabis commercialization is its impact on adolescents and our children,” Youngkin said in his veto statement, which also cited data showing increases in calls to poison control centers for children who consumed cannabis edibles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There have been numerous news stories in the past few years of THC-related overdoses at Virginia schools, some of them being serious enough to require hospitalization. Last year, a high school in the city of Richmond took the unusual step of banning all candy after four students suffered “medical distress” after eating edibles believed to contain a form of THC, the intoxicating element found in marijuana, </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/education/hemp-richmond-public-schools-edibles-virginia-cannabis-control-authority/article_fac073be-84d4-11ee-93ab-eb2e982913a0.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As lawmakers have relaxed Virginia’s laws on adult possession of small amounts of marijuana, they’ve taken steps to crack down on legally murky products like delta-8 THC, which produces a high similar to marijuana but has gone largely unregulated because it’s typically derived from hemp plants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michelle Peace, a forensic science professor at Virginia Commonwealth University who specializes in vaping and cannabis research, said data collection and better testing will help health officials “get their arms around” the issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s important to know how pervasive the problem is,” Peace said in an interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peace has been doing her own research into the vaping habits of Virginia K-12 students by testing the contents of vape equipment confiscated by school officials. Out of 369 submissions, 82% contained nicotine and 18% had some form of THC. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of that THC was “very highly concentrated,” Peace said, making it more likely that the user would experience negative effects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At the end of the day, there needs to be proper attribution as to what the child actually consumed,” Peace said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the 4,652 adults released from state prisons in 2022, the study shows 85% were enrolled in Medicaid within one month of their release. While 13%, or 514 of these adults had a diagnosis of opioid use disorder, only a quarter received medication treatment through Medicaid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By comparison, 78% of all Medicaid members with an opioid use disorder in state fiscal year 2021 received treatment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Based on national statistics, we expected more people to receive a diagnosis and treatment for opioid addiction,” said Dr. Peter Cunningham, the lead study researcher and interim chair of the Department of Health Policy at VCU’s School of Population Health. “This is concerning because having an undiagnosed, untreated opioid use disorder greatly increases the risk of overdose.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study is part of an ongoing evaluation with the Department of Medical Assistance Services to review the addiction recovery and treatment services program, a comprehensive benefit designed to provide substance use disorder treatment services to Medicaid members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Virginia expanded Medicaid in 2019, Cunningham said most adults being released from jails or prisons in the commonwealth qualify for coverage. However, delays in setting up a treatment plan and complications transitioning back to community living pose several barriers to accessing healthcare needs. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Barriers to care</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While incarcerated individuals are able to apply for Medicaid, their benefits — including substance use disorder treatment services — are unavailable to them until after their release. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That system, said Libby Jones, program director at the Overdose Prevention Initiative, is by design through the federal Medicaid inmate exclusion policy in the Social Security Act of 1965. As a result, the burden of inmate healthcare expenses falls to the local jurisdiction where jails and prisons are located. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That is a problem in the sense that oftentimes folks are only getting the bare minimum of their healthcare addressed,” Jones said. “What’s not being addressed are the underlying issues.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cunningham emphasized that there needs to be a focus on identifying and getting people into treatment before they’re released, as opioid addictions can still be fueled while incarcerated. However, he said facilities may express hesitancy offering medication assisted treatment because some are classified as controlled substances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Utilizing Medicaid benefits upon release can also be challenging, Cunningham said. When a person enrolls in Medicaid, he said they start out in the “fee-for-service” system where they don’t have a particular network of providers, meaning “you’re kind of on your own to figure out …  where you’re going to go.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some individuals have to wait up to a month after their release to be assigned a specific health plan to help navigate their benefits and find providers, a time frame Jones said is crucial for accessing treatment. According to a 2018 North Carolina </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6085027/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, formerly incarcerated individuals are 40 times more likely to overdose within the first two weeks after their release. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s not only a concern in terms of the increased risk of overdose and death, but it’s also if their addiction isn’t managed, that’s going to affect their transition into the community,” Cunningham said. “It’s going to affect their ability to find work and stable housing and it’s potentially going to lead to reincarceration.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many formerly incarcerated individuals face additional barriers to treatment upon their release, said Cunningham, like lacking a stable home or transportation, as well as being unaware of their options to get help. That transition period, he said, can be very unstable and uncertain and getting treatment may not be a priority for some. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of them are kind of just falling through the cracks,” Cunningham said. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Solutions moving forward</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jones said treatment programs within jails and prisons have been shown to have a great impact on reducing overdoses, recidivism rates and lowering costs for the facilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, Chesterfield County Jail has a program, funded primarily by grants and the county itself, that provides access to both medication for opioid disorder treatment and therapy. The re-arrest rate for people in the program, Jones said, was almost half for people who were released from jail who hadn’t been in the program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the Chesterfield jail program’s success, the Fairfax County Adult Detention Center is the only other jail in the commonwealth to utilize it. Members of Congress, including U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Prince William, visited the facility this January to hear from inmates participating in the program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inmates “feel hope for their life post-release because they are finally stable, they’re able to learn skills that will help them gain employment,” Jones said. “None of this would have been possible had they not received treatment.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investing in similar programs has been shown to also save money for prisons and jails. A 2022 Kentucky criminal justice treatment outcome </span><a href="https://corrections.ky.gov/Divisions/ask/Documents/CJKTOS_FY2021%20Report_FINAL_2022-02-02.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showed that for every $1 spent on the state’s correction-based substance use disorder treatment, there is a $4.54 cost offset. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jones said having Medicaid services provided during incarceration would “dramatically” help address treatment accessibility by covering some of the costs typically paid for by localities and could bring about similar programs in other jails and prisons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not only would it pay for the medications, it would also establish … standards of care. … If you are a Medicaid beneficiary, there are certain standards of care that you are entitled to,” Jones said. “So having those standards of care all put into place in the carceral system would also improve healthcare.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is why Jones is advocating for Congress to pass two bills, the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3074/cosponsors" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due Process of Continuity of Care Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/2400/all-info" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reentry Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, both of which are bipartisan and backed by U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond. The former would allow inmates to retain their Medicaid benefits while incarcerated and the latter, also backed by U.S. Reps. Gerald Connolly, D-Fairfax, and Spanberger, would restart the inmate’s benefits 30 days prior to their release to prevent gaps in coverage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some might disagree with the concept of investing in inmates or formerly incarcerated individuals, Cunningham emphasized that most people in prisons and jails are going to be released at some point and should be given the opportunity to succeed in life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whatever your view on people with criminal records or people in prisons is, I think it’s in everybody’s best interest to make sure that when they are released, we give them the best chance to reintegrate into the community,” Cunningham said.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr">Clements went back to jail, and her baby experienced withdrawal for 30 days. Once she was released, Clements gave her baby up for adoption and started using drugs again.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It became a way of living,” Clements said. “That’s the way I got through life.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">The number of jailed pregnant women fighting addiction has increased amid the skyrocketing opioid use in the past decade that led Virginia to <a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/commissioner/declaration-of-public-health-emergency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/commissioner/declaration-of-public-health-emergency/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1714647947920000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3Bk7tfBaphvGmOddAnqlhw">declare</a> a public health emergency in 2016. While the state has started to fund more recovery and treatment efforts, incarcerated mothers have fewer resources.

<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Finding Recovery Behind Bars</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Chesterfield County Sheriff Karl Leonard started the HARP program after annual overdose deaths in the county hit double digits on March 8, 2016.</p>
<p dir="ltr">People would get clean and sober in jail and then go back to the community. In reality, nothing was being done to help them, Leonard said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We wanted to start releasing recovered addicts back into the community with the tools, the knowledge, the equipment to be able to deal with all those issues that led them to use drugs before they got into the jail,” Leonard said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">HARP currently does not offer programs geared towards pregnant women, but does offer parenting classes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Chesterfield jail does not provide prenatal care, so pregnant inmates are sent to Riverside in Prince George County. Riverside had 475 pregnant inmates in a little over eight years, according to the jail.</p>
<p dir="ltr">HARP predates the Opioid Abatement Authority, an organization created by the General Assembly in 2021 to handle incoming opioid lawsuit settlement money. Virginia is beginning to receive millions of what will be an estimated $1.1 billion, according to the OAA.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“One of the rules for the use of the funds, which we disagree with very much, is that the funds cannot be used for any existing programs,” Leonard said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A locality <a href="https://www.oaa.virginia.gov/about/#:~:text=Cities%20and%20counties%20can%20expand,no%20indirect%20costs%20are%20allowed.&amp;text=Each%20city%20and%20county%20in,accordance%20with%20the%20statewide%20MOU." target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.oaa.virginia.gov/about/%23:~:text%3DCities%2520and%2520counties%2520can%2520expand,no%2520indirect%2520costs%2520are%2520allowed.%26text%3DEach%2520city%2520and%2520county%2520in,accordance%2520with%2520the%2520statewide%2520MOU.&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1714647947920000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3ITJN7ZZy_h6hjmExC0glU">cannot</a> use OAA money to supplant existing expenditures but can receive funding if they expand existing programs or implement new programs, according to its website.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Support for Incarcerated Pregnant Women</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Many women do not even know they are pregnant when they enter jail, according to Henrico County West Jail Capt. Pamela Dismuke. Female inmates are <a href="https://vadoc.virginia.gov/files/operating-procedures/700/vadoc-op-720-2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://vadoc.virginia.gov/files/operating-procedures/700/vadoc-op-720-2.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1714647947920000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0AYL_wVgWdVATkZsnXq4Yp">required</a> to take a pregnancy test when they enter.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I like to say a lot of the time jail kinda saved them, because had she not known she was pregnant she’d probably still be doing drugs and hurting the baby even more,” Dismuke said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Dismuke started a program for pregnant inmates two years ago. She contacted someone who works for the Department of Corrections and is a doula, or a person who provides guidance and support to a pregnant woman during labor.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Incarcerated pregnant women need specific food, supplements, exercise and even postpartum help that is not common practice throughout the system.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Special: The VA opioid epidemic and how services are helping incarcerated mothers" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_lGZ5DciPJE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p dir="ltr">The nonprofit Virginia Prison Birth Project pairs pregnant women in the Henrico jail with a doula and also shares nutritional food and information on a baby’s development and care, in addition to a weekly yoga class. Doulas also offer support by delivering breastmilk to the baby’s caretaker.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The organization provided the first doula-supported birth for a pregnant inmate in Virginia in 2019, according to its <a href="https://virginiaprisonbirthproject.org/what-we-do#:~:text=In%202019%20we%20provided%20the,have%20an%20established%20referral%20system." target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://virginiaprisonbirthproject.org/what-we-do%23:~:text%3DIn%25202019%2520we%2520provided%2520the,have%2520an%2520established%2520referral%2520system.&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1714647947920000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1DjXg7BTgOImsLnsDqb_ff">website</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Many women learn through the program how drugs hurt their babies, and it helps them take better care of themselves, Dismuke said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bobbie Jo Lashway, a pregnant inmate at Henrico County West Jail, said there are few programs aimed at her subgroup, despite large numbers of incarcerated pregnant women.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lashway enjoys the yoga program and is thankful people take time out of their day to share experiences.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It’s good on a human connection level that we don’t get in here,” Lashway said.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Funding Efforts to Combat the Epidemic</h4>

<p dir="ltr">The OAA has not funded any programs related to incarcerated pregnant or parenting women, but has funded jail programs, according to Rosatelli.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It was a pretty powerful thing to observe about the work we do and it being put into action,” Rosatelli said, about a visit last year to an OAA-funded recovery center for women in Washington County.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The OAA has distributed about $34 million, which has been used for initiatives such as recovery homes, education and prevention efforts and marketing campaigns, according to Rosatelli.</p>

(Photo by Scott Bauer/USDA Agricultural Research Service)</p><p>Starting next week, certain dairy cattle must be tested for avian influenza before they can be transported to a different state, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced Wednesday.</p>
<p>The requirement is among several that will expand the testing, reporting and monitoring of the cattle to reduce the spread of bird flu among the animals.</p>
<p>The new rules follow evidence that highly pathogenic avian influenza — which is commonly spread by migrating birds — has transmitted from cow to cow and from cattle to poultry, and that infected cows might not show symptoms of illness, the USDA said. Last week, an analysis of the virus from a Kansas cow showed that it had acquired “an adaptation to mammals.”</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said tests had revealed fragments of the virus in pasteurized milk, but that they don’t pose a risk to public health.</p>
<p>“While we are taking this action today, it is important to remember that thus far, we have not found changes to the virus that would make it more transmissible to humans and between people,” the USDA said Wednesday.</p>
<p>It has been a month since the virus <a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2024/04/17/two-veterinarians-hundreds-of-miles-apart-solved-a-cow-sickness-whodunit/" target="_blank">was first confirmed</a> to have infected dairy cattle in Texas. The virus has now been detected in 33 dairy herds in eight states, the USDA said. Part of that spread has been attributed to the transportation of infected cows to new herds.</p>
<p>The cows most often recover from infection after a week or so, but their tainted milk cannot be used for commercial human consumption. The virus is often deadly for poultry and can rapidly infect flocks.</p>
<p>The rules set to take effect on Monday require lactating dairy cattle to test negative for influenza A before they are transported across state lines, and that requirement might be expanded to other types of dairy cattle in the future.</p>
<p>Labs must also report their confirmed infections of livestock to the USDA, and certain herd owners must provide details about where their cattle have been transported.</p>
<p>Further information about the new rules is forthcoming, and state agriculture officials declined for now to say what impact they will have on Iowa dairy farmers.</p>
<p>“We are still awaiting specific guidance from USDA regarding this new interstate movement order,” said Don McDowell, a spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship.</p>
<p>John Maxwell, a dairy farmer near Davenport, Iowa, predicted that the effects for most dairies in Iowa will be inconsequential and that it’s best to be cautious and increase testing until more is known about the disease.</p>
<p>“We have to do tests anyway,” he said, in reference to dairy cattle he sells out-of-state. “So it would be one more test and whatever the cost it might be. One more is not the end of the world.”</p>
<p>The USDA has said it will reimburse farmers for testing of sick and asymptomatic cattle.</p>
<p>States with confirmed bird flu infections of dairy cattle include Kansas, Idaho, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, South Dakota and Texas.</p>
<p>A virus similar to what has infected cows has been found in poultry flocks in Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico and Texas, the USDA said.</p>

(Sofia Resnick/States Newsroom)</p><p>U.S. Supreme Court justices spent two hours Wednesday morning debating whether a federal law about emergency treatment encompasses abortion care even in states with strict abortion bans, with no clear indication of how they may ultimately rule.</p>
<p>A decision could come as soon as the end of June whether Idaho’s near-total abortion ban means doctors who might need to terminate a pregnancy during a health emergency would be protected from prosecution under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, or EMTALA, a federal law that requires hospitals to treat patients who come to an emergency room regardless of their ability to pay. That includes treatment to prevent serious damage to bodily functions.</p>
<p>If the court decides the law does not provide that protection, then hospitals and doctors in Idaho have said they will have to continue <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/loss-federal-protection-idaho-spurs-pregnant-patients-plan-emergency-air-transport" target="_blank">transferring patients out of state</a> for that treatment. Since January, when the court decided to take the case and struck down an injunction that provided protection under EMTALA, transfers out of state for pregnancy complications that may require termination increased from one in 2023 to six over the course of four months.</p>
<p>The court’s liberal wing — Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson — ​​questioned Idaho Deputy Attorney General Josh Turner about what EMTALA explicitly says about stabilizing treatment and whether abortion procedures fall into that definition when complications occur before a fetus can survive outside of the womb.</p>
<p>Turner argued that Idaho’s law should supersede federal law in the case of abortion procedures, even if it goes against commonly accepted medical care standards.</p>
<p>Sotomayor rejected that argument.</p>
<p>“There is no state licensing law that would permit the state to say, ‘Don’t treat diabetics with insulin. Treat them only with pills,’” Sotomayor said. “Federal law would say you can’t do that.”</p>
<p>She said federal law requires treatment of a person who is at risk of serious medical complications without that treatment, but Idaho’s law does not provide that much leeway.</p>
<p>“Idaho law says the doctor has to determine not that there’s really a serious medical condition, but that the person will die. That’s a huge difference, counsel,” she said.</p>
<p>Idaho’s abortion ban went into effect in August 2022, a few months after the U.S. Supreme Court issued its Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision that overturned Roe v. Wade, ending federal protection for abortion access and allowing states to regulate it instead. Providers who are prosecuted for performing an abortion are subject to two to five years in prison plus the loss of their medical license, and they are also subject to civil enforcement laws by any family members related to the person who had the abortion.</p>

<p>The justices repeatedly asked Turner to identify situations where a doctor might provide an abortion as part of stabilizing care and it would not be allowed under Idaho law. He continued to point to the state’s exception to save a patient’s life and referred to a doctor’s “good faith medical judgment” being enough to avoid prosecution.</p>
<p>The government listed nine emergency medical conditions where termination of the pregnancy may be the recommended treatment to stabilize a patient’s condition, including when the water breaks before a fetus is viable or when a patient experiences uncontrolled high blood pressure or bleeding. Idaho doctors identified one recent “traumatic” case when a patient had to wait until advanced infection set in before the doctor felt secure enough to end the pregnancy. Others are sending patients out of state as soon as termination might be needed to avoid having to wait until they meet qualifications under Idaho’s exception to prevent death.</p>
<p>Justice Amy Coney Barrett, considered one of the court’s more conservative members, said Turner was hedging in his answers and asked what happens if another doctor or prosecutor reaches a contrary conclusion about what the appropriate medical treatment should have been.</p>
<p>“That, your honor, is the nature of prosecutorial discretion,” Turner said.</p>
<p>Barrett also asked if Idaho had released any legal guidance about its abortion laws, the way a federal health agency might issue guidance. Turner said the “guiding star” is the Idaho Supreme Court’s opinion from August 2022 interpreting the abortion statute, where it said the law does not require imminence of death or medical certainty for a physician to intervene. The Idaho court also said another doctor’s opinion would only be considered if they accused the doctor who performed the abortion of acting in bad faith.</p>
<p>U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said for those reasons, women in Idaho are not getting the treatment they need, often in already-tragic situations where a wanted pregnancy is lost because of complications.</p>
<p>“They are getting airlifted to Salt Lake City and to neighboring states where there are health exceptions in their laws,” she said. “The doctors can’t provide the care until they can conclude that a prosecutor looking over their shoulder won’t second guess that maybe it wasn’t really necessary to prevent death.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Conservatives ask about conscience objections</h4>

	
<p>The more conservative justices offered mixed questions to Prelogar, who argued on behalf of the government. Justice Neil Gorsuch posed questions related to the federal Supremacy Clause about when federal law can override state law in the context of medicine, while Barrett asked whether conscience exceptions exist for doctors who don’t feel comfortable terminating a pregnancy even in emergency situations. Or if a hospital did not want to provide the procedure, such as a Catholic hospital, would be exempt under EMTALA for conscience reasons. One of Idaho’s largest hospital systems, Saint Alphonsus, is a Catholic hospital.</p>
<p>Prelogar confirmed that yes, individual doctors and entire medical entities qualify for those conscience objections and are therefore not required to perform an abortion under EMTALA. But at a hospital that did not have a blanket objection, they would take individual objections into consideration for appropriate staffing so that there is always someone available to provide that care if necessary.</p>
<p>“If the question is, could you force an individual doctor to step in over a conscience objection, the answer is no, and I want to be really clear about that,” Prelogar said.</p>
<p>Justice Sam Alito also asked Prelogar if EMTALA could be understood to apply to other emergency situations such as a mental health emergency, if someone was expressing suicidal thoughts and wanted to end their pregnancy to resolve those thoughts. Idaho’s legal representation, conservative religious law firm Alliance Defending Freedom, argued in its brief to the court that a ruling in favor of EMTALA protection would allow such situations to occur. Prelogar said no, the proper treatment would be to administer medications to alleviate the suicidal thoughts.</p>
<p>“There can be grave mental health emergencies, but EMTALA could never require pregnancy termination as the stabilizing care … because that wouldn’t do anything to address the underlying brain chemistry issue that’s causing the mental health emergency in the first place,” Prelogar said. “If she happens to be pregnant, it would be incredibly unethical to terminate her pregnancy. She might not be in a position to give any informed consent.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Demonstrators, legislators from Idaho comment on court case</h4>

	
<p>Hundreds of abortion rights advocates, medical professionals and two Idaho legislators gathered outside the U.S. Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday morning before the arguments advocating for the court to uphold EMTALA as a guiding principle regardless of state abortion laws. On the anti-abortion rights side, Idaho-based crisis pregnancy center Stanton Healthcare argued the case was about forcing states with abortion bans to perform them. Danielle Versluys, the organization’s chief operating officer, said women with complications should deliver a baby naturally, regardless of the circumstances.</p>
<p>“The outcome is the same — a dead baby — but the difference is one is natural, and the other is not,” she said. “And one allows the woman the natural process to give birth and to grieve, and the other one is unnatural.”</p>
<p>Rep. Ilana Rubel, a Democrat and the legislature’s minority leader, told States Newsroom the case is a waste of state taxpayer dollars.</p>
<p>“It is, frankly, stunning that leaders in our state think that this is something they want so badly they were willing to take it to the Supreme Court to deprive women of appropriate care in medical emergencies,” Rubel said. And with the Idaho Legislature adjourned for the year, she added, “If the Supreme Court does not give us EMTALA back, there will be no lifeline for women at least until 2025.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve known Tim for three decades. Early on, he was a member of the Virginia Capitol Correspondents Association by virtue of his job as Richmond correspondent for Charlottesville’s NBC affiliate, WVIR-TV.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then he hopped the fence into Republican Party politics, serving a variety of roles with candidates and GOP organizations in Virginia and beyond. We came into each other’s orbits most closely when he was the chief spokesman for George Allen’s successful 2000 U.S. Senate campaign. We would intersect frequently in his spokesman roles with Jerry Kilgore’s attorney general office and Kilgore’s unsuccessful gubernatorial bid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tim’s sharp mind made him one of the best at what he did when he was on his game. And by “on his game,” I mean sober. Because much of the time, he wasn’t, a fact as plain as it was tragic. He went through more high-profile political jobs in a few years than most people can hold in a lifetime and many ended badly, victims of his rapacious alcoholism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I couldn’t help but like Tim. He is engaging and witty. We share an affinity for the niche film “O Brother, Where Art Thou?” and would frequently greet each other with lines from it. We bonded over a mutual love of sports, a family legacy for him. His grandfather,</span><a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/danny-murtaugh-could-talk-and-manage-like-few-others" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Danny Murtaugh</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, managed the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1960s and ’70s when they won two World Series championships, and it’s a stain on the Baseball Hall of Fame that he’s still not in it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, covering Virginia government for The Associated Press, I had to keep my political leanings locked in a vault and out of my copy. There were times when I agreed with Tim and others when I did not. Differences aside, I respected him and what he </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">could</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> be professionally if only he could put the bottle aside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were times from 2000 to 2012 when I saw Tim alarmingly drunk. Turns out, I didn’t know the half of it. This month, he raised the curtain on his grim, long-running addiction and the resolute struggle that ultimately brought him to lasting sobriety in an</span><a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Swing-Hard-in-Case-You-Hit-It/Tim-Murtaugh/9798888453247" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">unsparing autobiography</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> titled “Swing Hard In Case You Hit It.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His book starkly recounts his two arrests for driving under the influence, many more for public intoxication, and days spent incarcerated because of it. He writes unflinchingly of his five stints in rehab and how, after each, he quickly put a drink in his hand. One cringes as he chronicles one firing after another and the disqualifying behavior that led to each. It’s a litany of opportunities gained and subsequently squandered. Reading those accounts is like watching a train hurtling toward a washed-out bridge over a deep gorge — awful to behold, helpless to stop, impossible to look away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The book — indeed, much of the credit for the redemption of Tim Murtaugh — he attributes to his patient, loving and steadfast wife, Dena, who somehow stood beside him at his worst.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would be dead or in jail if it weren’t for Dena,” he said in a Zoom interview this week from the home the couple share with their two young sons near Leesburg. “That’s obvious to me, knowing the state that I was in at the time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was not always something she did gladly. The destruction his drinking wrought was hard to endure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why she decided I could be saved — or was worth saving — I don’t know,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The book, he said, could never have been written while he was still in alcohol’s daily grip, even to the point of having to start each day swilling Jägermeister and continue drinking through the day just to function.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His moment of clarity came in May 2015 when he awoke in the Fairfax County Jail after being arrested for public intoxication from a blackout-level bender at a bar along U.S. 1 near Alexandria. The offense was a misdemeanor, but it would have violated terms of his probation from his second DUI conviction and subjected him to 80 days behind bars, something he recognized as fatal to both his career and his marriage. His attorney convinced a prosecutor that this time, Murtaugh would change for good, and the public drunkenness charge was dropped with the stern warning never to appear in court again for an alcohol-related offense or face the full wrath of the law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next month marks nine years since Tim last tasted alcohol. Since then, he has held communications posts for the U.S. secretary of agriculture and as the chief spokesman for Trump’s 2020 reelection campaign, appearing frequently on national telecasts defending his boss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through it all, even when alcohol held the upper hand, Murtaugh said he was drawn to books other alcoholics had written about their battles with addiction — the success stories as well as the tragedies. Once he got sober and stayed that way, he said, the idea of writing his own memoir appealed to him as a way to help others with their journey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I thought that if I ever wrote a book, then I would write one of those because those books helped me a lot,” he said. “If somebody is having a hard time and they pick up my book for 10 minutes, if, in that time that they’re holding my book, they don’t pick up a drink, then it was worth writing, even if that only happens one time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dena, whom he first met when she was on the U.S. House staff of then-Rep. Thelma Drake, R-Va. whose reelection campaign he was advising, also made the wise argument that a thorough confession could inoculate him from having his past used against him in the Machiavellian world of partisan politics. The decision to proceed, he said, was surprisingly easy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For years, I did regard it as deep, dark secrets that I would protect at any cost. I was deathly afraid of anybody finding out about the true depths of the trouble that I’d been in. But over time, I’d talk about it in (Alcoholics Anonymous) meetings … in rehab, at home where my wife knows all about it. It became less of a scarlet letter and more just part of my background and part of who I was,” he said. “Now, it helps a lot that I wasn’t doing those things anymore and that I could accurately talk about them as though they were things of the past because they were.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Trump grudgingly left the White House in January 2021, Murtaugh said he sought to leverage his high-visibility post serving a former president into work outside politics but found his association with Trump made him too much of a liability for major corporations. So he stuck with the field he knows and formed his own company, Line Drive Public Affairs, that advises political clients on a contract basis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tim is a man more at ease now: his eyes clear, his future instead of a drink in his hands. He knows that resisting alcohol’s whispered seductions will be a day-to-day fight for the rest of his life. He appreciates what he’s gained and knows how easily he could lose it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My two little boys have never seen their dad take a drink,” he said, “and I want it to stay that way.”</span></p>

<p>Iyman Hamad, a Palestinian American public health graduate student at Wayne State University in Detroit, had to search online to figure out which race or ethnicity box she should check at the doctor’s office and on school forms.	<div class="newsroomSidebarContainer ">
	<div class="newsroomSidebar">According to 2020 Census Bureau <a href="https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/stories/2023/09/mena-population/table-2-dhc-a-mena-population.jpg" target="_blank">data</a>, there are at least 128,643 people who identify as Middle Eastern and North African living in Virginia. Of this group, the largest population is Iranian, with 24,777 members, followed by Lebanese, with 20,729 members and Egyptian, with 18,394 members. </div>

<p>And Itedal Shalabi, who runs an Arab American family services center in the Chicago area and is also Palestinian, said misinformation and hesitancy about COVID-19 vaccines were rampant in her community. Because Arab Americans were considered to be white in the absence of a category for them, county funding for outreach in minority communities was delayed, probably causing avoidable deaths, she said.</p>
<p>“In that time, we had so many Arab Americans die, especially elderly,” she said. “By the time we got the funding, we had so much work to do to catch up, while other [minority] communities were taking advantage of the shot.”</p>
<p>For decades, U.S. residents with heritage from the Middle East and North Africa, which is known internationally as the MENA region, have been classified by the government as white. The grouping masked differences in income, health, housing and other important markers. And when public health officials lack data on COVID-19 deaths or vaccine uptake in the MENA community, for example, it’s difficult to distribute dollars and other public resources effectively.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" title="“Census Bureau’s proposed changes threaten to undercount people with disabilities, advocates say” — Stateline" src="https://stateline.org/2023/12/29/census-bureaus-proposed-changes-threaten-to-undercount-people-with-disabilities-advocates-say/embed/#?secret=MQPnYOA9Ip#?secret=xwXvhypnF0" width="500" height="489" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-scripts" data-secret="xwXvhypnF0" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>“The lack of a dedicated identifier makes it hard to isolate data,” said epidemiologist Nadia Abuelezam, an associate professor at the Boston College Connell School of Nursing and the daughter of Palestinian refugees. “Systemically, structurally, we were ignored, or our needs were ignored.”</p>
<p>Last month, the federal Office of Management and Budget <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/briefing-room/2024/03/28/omb-publishes-revisions-to-statistical-policy-directive-no-15-standards-for-maintaining-collecting-and-presenting-federal-data-on-race-and-ethnicity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approved</a> revisions to race and ethnicity data collection across federal agencies, including the addition of a new MENA category to the census. They are the first race and ethnic category changes since 1997. Along with a combined race/ethnicity category, the changes include a combined Hispanic or Latino checkbox and removal of phrases that can be considered pejorative, including “Negro” and “Far East.” Federal officials <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/01/27/2023-01635/initial-proposals-for-updating-ombs-race-and-ethnicity-statistical-standards" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have said</a> these revisions will yield more accurate counts and use language “respectful of how people refer to themselves.”</p>
<p>The new federal classification of MENA people is geographical and includes people from Arabic-speaking groups, such as Lebanese, Algerians, Egyptians, Palestinians and Syrians, as well as people from non-Arabic-speaking groups, such as Iranians and Israelis. It also includes ethnic groups who live in multiple countries, such as Assyrian, Kurdish and Chaldean people.</p>
<p>The updates will appear on the next census in 2030, but by next year, federal agencies must submit detailed plans on how they will incorporate the new requirements.</p>

<p>Apart from independent studies by academic and nonprofit researchers, little is known about the health of Middle Eastern and North African people in the U.S. Experts and advocates hope the census change will spur local and state health agencies to update their own data collection methods to shed light on health inequities and needs.</p>

<p>Her research on Massachusetts mothers has found, for example, that Black Arab mothers had higher odds of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33019995/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preterm birth</a> and low birthweight than Arab mothers classified as white, while Arab mothers were <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0033354920941146" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more likely</a> to suffer gestational diabetes than white mothers.</p>
<p>One <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s40615-022-01298-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a> found that from the beginning of the pandemic through July 2021, about 17% of Arab Americans in Michigan tested positive for COVID-19 compared with 11% of Hispanic people, 9.8% of Black people and 7.5% of white people.</p>
<p>Similarly, researchers who study aging and Alzheimer’s and related dementias <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9633450/#:~:text=The%20prevalence%20of%20cognitive%20limitations%20was%2017.3%25%20among%20MENA%20immigrants,non%2DHispanic%20Whites%20from%20Europe." target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> that confusion and memory issues, which can be early symptoms of the diseases, were found among 17% of MENA immigrants, compared with 9.6% of U.S.-born white people.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" title="“5 Southern states had most of the nation’s population growth” — Stateline" src="https://stateline.org/2023/12/20/5-southern-states-had-most-of-the-nations-population-growth/embed/#?secret=6pmaROyzxi#?secret=j8OYG0qMm8" width="500" height="432" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-scripts" data-secret="j8OYG0qMm8" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>The change in categories only applies to federal agencies, not state governments, said Rima Meroudeh, director of the National Network for Arab American Communities. However, the official forms used by states, health agencies and school systems typically mirror the categories used by the census, and the change provides “something much more concrete as we advocate at the state level because they want interoperability between state and federal data,” she said.</p>
<p>Awad, the University of Michigan psychologist, studies mental health and the influence of discrimination in the MENA community. She said the change will help her illuminate social determinants of health, such as housing and environment, income, access to resources, health care and transportation, as well as trauma experiences. Awad and other researchers also are interested in exploring the prevalence of health conditions such as asthma and cardiovascular disease in MENA communities.</p>
<p>“A group of us have been working for years advocating for this box,” Awad said. It’s “been long overdue, and finally, we are going to be able to collect data to truly delve into some unanswered questions. We know there are disparities, but we don’t actually truly understand the extent because there hasn’t been systematic data collection.”</p>
<p>The health data that schools collect also is skewed, said Matt Jaber Stiffler, who co-founded the Center for Arab Narratives, part of the Arab Community Center for Economic and Social Services, or ACCESS. For example, Stiffler said, Arab children are the majority of K-12 students in Dearborn, Michigan, but state data identifies them as white.</p>
<p>Inclusion would “give a better picture of who these communities are and what their needs might be,” Stiffler said.</p>
<h4 class="editorialSubhed">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Population counts</h4>

	</h4>
<p>So far, federal population counts of MENA communities have been estimates. For the first time, the 2020 census offered a write-in option so respondents could mark their race and ethnicity as “white” but write in their ancestry. <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2023/09/2020-census-dhc-a-mena-population.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">About 3.5 million people</a> wrote in MENA countries of origin, with Lebanese, Iranians and Egyptians making up nearly half of them.</p>
<p>California, Michigan and New York had the largest MENA populations, with more than 300,000 residents combined. Those states were trailed by Texas, Florida, Illinois and New Jersey. Prior to the 2020 write-ins, the American Community Survey, an ongoing survey by the U.S. Census Bureau, provided limited estimates.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/middle-eastern-and-north-african-immigrants-united-states" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Migration Policy Institute</a>, a think tank that analyzes immigration policy, the 1920 census reported around 50,000 people from the MENA region. In the years since, a steady flow of Palestinians, Egyptians, Iraqis, Syrians and others have immigrated to the U.S., some after the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, and many more after the U.S. loosened its restrictive immigration policies in 1965. By 1980, the MENA population in the U.S. had risen to about 224,000.</p>
<p>Last August, Illinois became the <a href="https://www.illinois.gov/news/press-release.26835.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first</a> state to enact a law mandating all state agencies that collect race and ethnicity data include a MENA category. Lawmakers in California and Michigan are considering similar bills.</p>
<p>“We should incorporate this at all levels, whether in our health system data or educational systems, like on university levels,” said <a href="https://www.surveypractice.org/article/89387-inclusion-of-the-mena-category-in-the-u-s-census-will-mena-individuals-and-their-health-disparities-be-finally-visible" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sarah Abboud</a>, an assistant professor at the University of Illinois Chicago who studies health outcomes among Arab immigrants.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" title="“More states offer health care coverage for certain immigrants, noncitizens” — Stateline" src="https://stateline.org/2024/01/26/more-states-offer-health-care-coverage-for-certain-immigrants-noncitizens/embed/#?secret=GMvHxUdPWB#?secret=8K0BytSzbR" width="500" height="440" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-scripts" data-secret="8K0BytSzbR" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>Some critics <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/10/16/census-race-eliminate-race-box/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argue</a> that the census should move away from categorizing people by race, instead of adding new racial categories. They point to the Human Genome Project, which found that humans share 99.9% of their DNA. Race, some argue, is a social construct, a relic of the 18th century.</p>
<p>But public health experts have demonstrated that racism affects people’s health, and Abboud said that Arab Americans experience worse health outcomes because of it. Additionally, immigrants displaced by war, such as Palestinian and Syrian refugees and their children, may have unique stressors around trauma.</p>
<p>Shalabi, of Arab American Family Services in Chicago, said inclusion of MENA in data is long overdue.</p>
<p>“We’re so excited because it’s about time that our community was identified, was visible, and in a way that really works toward their betterment of health and … being part of the American fabric,” she said.</p>

Employers must grant staff certain accommodations for pregnancy-related conditions. (Paul Morigi/Getty Images)</p><p>Rules on how employers can comply with a federal law that provides protections for pregnant workers are set to take effect in roughly two months.</p>
<p>The U.S. <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/newsroom/eeoc-issues-final-regulation-pregnant-workers-fairness-act" target="_blank">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a> provided clarity to employers and employees about the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act on April 15. Under the <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/statutes/pregnant-workers-fairness-act" target="_blank">statute</a>, employers with 15 or more workers must grant pregnant workers’ requests for accommodations, as long as the changes don’t pose “undue hardship” on the employer.</p>
<p>Congress passed the PWFA in December 2022, and the law took effect in <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/pregnant-workers-have-new-protections-heres-what-expect-your-boss" target="_blank">June 2023</a>. But the EEOC allowed considerable time for public comment on proposed rules.</p>
<p>Roughly 100,000 comments were submitted to the commission, including about 54,000 urging the agency to exclude abortion from the definition of “pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions,” and some 40,000 supporting the inclusion of abortion.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the commission decided to include abortion as a condition for which workers can seek accommodations, such as time off. The decision was based on the plain text of the measure, according to a 400-page <a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2024-07527.pdf" target="_blank">document</a> explaining PWFA guidance. The rules will be published in the <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2024-07527/implementation-of-the-pregnant-workers-fairness-act" target="_blank">Federal Register</a> on April 19, but they don’t take effect until 60 days later.</p>
<p>“The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is a win for workers, families, and our economy. It gives pregnant workers clear access to reasonable accommodations that will allow them to keep doing their jobs safely and effectively, free from discrimination and retaliation,” said Charlotte Burrows, the EEOC chair, in a statement.</p>
<p>Under the law, pregnant workers and prospective employees should be allowed: water breaks, food breaks, restroom breaks, a stool to sit on while working, time off for doctors’ appointments, temporary reassignments and remote work, for example. Americans with jobs can also ask for accommodations when they’re recovering from abortion, lactation, infertility treatments, miscarriages and stillbirths.</p>
<p>Organizations that support gender equality in the workplace celebrated the rules’ finalization.</p>
<p>“The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is a life-changing protection for pregnant and postpartum workers nationwide, ensuring they aren’t forced off the job or denied the accommodations they need for their health,” <a href="https://www.abetterbalance.org/press-release-a-better-balance-applauds-the-eeoc-for-announcing-robust-final-rule-for-the-implementation-of-the-pregnant-workers-fairness-act/" target="_blank">said</a> Dina Bakst, co-president of A Better Balance, in a statement. Bakst’s group has pushed for the legislation’s passage for more than a decade.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/pregnant-workers-have-new-protections-heres-what-expect-your-boss" target="_blank">States Newsroom</a> economy reporter Casey Quinlan previously reported that the law was crafted to address gaps in the civil rights measures, such as the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, which prohibits discrimination against pregnant employees but requires someone to find a colleague who was given similar accommodations for comparison. A 2022 <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/bpc-morning-consult-pregnancy-discrimination/" target="_blank">poll</a> found that 1 in 5 mothers have experienced pregnancy discrimination at work.</p>
<p>“This is an important moment for pregnant workers, those with pregnancy difficulties or complications, and those who are considering having a baby,” <a href="https://nationalpartnership.org/news_post/npwf-commends-rule-finalizing-strong-protections-for-2-8-million-pregnant-workers/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=source&amp;utm_campaign=ej_pwfa" target="_blank">said</a> Jocelyn Frye, president of the National Partnership for Women and Families.</p>
<p>​​Frye said the rules will strengthen “protections for millions of workers, in spite of recent extreme partisan attempts to overturn this bipartisan law.” Abortion rights opponents criticized the determination that abortion counts as a pregnancy-related condition.</p>

<p>“Adding this controversial provision into the PWFA is wrong. Period,” said U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx, a North Carolina Republican, in a <a href="https://edworkforce.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=410447" target="_blank">statement</a> last week. “Abortion is not a medical condition related to pregnancy; it is the opposite.” Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative law firm, <a href="https://adflegal.org/press-release/biden-admin-hijacks-pregnant-workers-law-impose-illegal-abortion-mandate" target="_blank">said</a> in August that the inclusion of abortion as a reasonable accommodation was “federal overreach.”</p>
<p>The law has also been subject to litigation. A federal judge recently blocked the enforcement of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act in Texas after Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton sued President Joe Biden’s administration over its passage and other provisions in a 2022 $1.7 trillion spending package. Paxton argued that the act was unconstitutional because it was passed by proxy votes, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-judge-rules-against-pregnant-workers-win-paxton?emci=3328f72b-73d6-ee11-85f9-002248223794&amp;emdi=00497b0b-fad6-ee11-85f9-002248223794&amp;ceid=526826" target="_blank">Texas Tribune</a> reported.</p>
<p>Adam Cyr, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Justice, declined to comment Wednesday on whether the agency will appeal the decision to the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>
<p>“Texas: Won’t let you have an abortion but also won’t do anything to help you have a safe and healthy pregnancy,” U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, a Pennsylvania Democrat, said in a statement to the <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/pregnant-workers-fairness-act-blocked-texas-unconstitutional" target="_blank">Pennsylvania Capital-Star</a> in February after the ruling. Casey co-sponsored the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act and first introduced the bill in 2012.</p>

<figure></figure>
<p>Chemists invented PFAS in the 1930s to make life easier: Nonstick pans, waterproof clothing, grease-resistant food packaging and stain-resistant carpet were all made possible by PFAS. But in recent years, the growing number of <a href="https://theconversation.com/pfas-forever-chemicals-why-epa-set-federal-drinking-water-limits-for-these-health-harming-contaminants-227621" target="_blank">health risks found to be connected to these chemicals</a> has become increasingly alarming.</p>
<p>PFAS — perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances – are now either suspected or <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002%2Fetc.4890" target="_blank">known to contribute</a> to thyroid disease, elevated cholesterol, liver damage <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/research/what-we-study/pfas" target="_blank">and cancer</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002%2Fetc.4890" target="_blank">among other health issues</a>.</p>
<p>They can be found in the blood of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp.10598" target="_blank">most Americans</a> and in many drinking water systems, which is why the Environmental Protection Agency in April 2024 finalized the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sdwa/and-polyfluoroalkyl-substances-pfas" target="_blank">first enforceable federal limits</a> for six types of PFAS in drinking water systems. The limits – between 4 and 10 parts per trillion for PFOS, PFOA, PFHxS, PFNA and GenX – are less than a drop of water in a thousand Olympic-sized swimming pools, which speaks to the chemicals’ toxicity. The sixth type, PFBS, is regulated as a mixture using what’s known as a <a href="https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2023-03/How%20do%20I%20calculate%20the%20Hazard%20Index._3.14.23.pdf" target="_blank">hazard index</a>.</p>
<p>Meeting these new limits won’t be easy or cheap. And there’s another problem: While PFAS can be filtered out of water, these “forever chemicals” are hard to destroy.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.doudrick.info" target="_blank">My team</a> at the University of Notre Dame works on solving problems involving contaminants in water systems, including PFAS. We explore new technologies to remove PFAS from <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acsestengg.3c00515" target="_blank">drinking water</a> and to <a href="https://serdp-estcp.mil/projects/details/fdbcb209-b9be-4f1c-8ae1-88d2c839c471" target="_blank">handle the PFAS waste</a>. Here’s a glimpse of the magnitude of the challenge and ways you can reduce PFAS in your own drinking water.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Removing PFAS will cost billions per year</h4>

	
<p>Every five years, the EPA is required to choose 30 <a href="https://www.epa.gov/dwucmr" target="_blank">unregulated contaminants to monitor</a> in public drinking water systems. Right now, 29 of those 30 contaminants are PFAS. The tests provide a sense of just how widespread PFAS are in water systems and where.</p>
<p>The EPA has taken over 22,500 samples from about 3,800 of the 154,000 public drinking water systems in the U.S. In 22% of those water systems, its testing found at least one of the six newly regulated PFAS, and about 16% of the systems exceeded the new standards. East Coast states had the largest percentage of systems with PFAS levels exceeding the new standards in EPA tests conducted so far.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" id="sngZl" class="tc-infographic-datawrapper" style="border: none;" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/sngZl/10/" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Under the new EPA rules, public water systems have until 2027 to complete monitoring for PFAS and provide publicly available data. If they find PFAS at concentrations that exceed the new limits, then they must install a treatment system by 2029.</p>
<p>How much that will cost public water systems, and ultimately their customers, is still a big unknown, but it won’t be cheap.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2024-04/pfas-npdwr_fact-sheet_general_4.9.24v1.pdf" target="_blank">EPA estimated the cost</a> to the nation’s public drinking water systems to comply with the news rules at about US$1.5 billion per year. But <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/environment-and-energy/3m-heads-to-trial-in-existential-143-billion-pfas-litigation" target="_blank">other estimates</a> suggest the total costs of testing and cleaning up PFAS contamination will be much higher. The American Water Works Association put the cost at <a href="https://www.awwa.org/AWWA-Articles/awwa-statement-on-proposed-pfas-drinking-water-standards" target="_blank">over $3.8 billion per year</a> for PFOS and PFOA alone.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" id="d50mz" class="tc-infographic-datawrapper" style="border: none;" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/d50mz/5/" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/pfc" target="_blank">There are more than 5,000 chemicals</a> that are considered PFAS, yet only a few have been studied for their toxicity, and even fewer tested for in drinking water. The United States Geological Survey estimates that <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/news/national-news-release/tap-water-study-detects-pfas-forever-chemicals-across-us" target="_blank">nearly half of all tap water</a> is contaminated with PFAS.</p>
<p>Some money for testing and cleanup <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/environment-and-energy/infrastructure-law-gears-10-billion-to-fight-pfas-in-water" target="_blank">will come from the federal government</a>. Other funds will come from 3M and DuPont, the leading makers of PFAS. 3M agreed in a settlement to pay <a href="https://apnews.com/article/pfas-drinking-water-settlement-3m-fa41cadfe0d65b9723377a681df43af1" target="_blank">between $10.5 billion to $12.5 billion</a> to help reimburse public water systems for some of their PFAS testing and treatment. But public water systems will still bear additional costs, and those costs will be passed on to residents.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Next problem: Disposing of &#8216;forever chemicals&#8217;</h4>

	
<p>Another big question is how to dispose of the captured PFAS once they have been filtered out.</p>
<p>Landfills are being considered, but that just pushes the problem to the next generation. PFAS are known as “forever chemicals” for a reason – they are incredibly resilient and don’t break down naturally, so they are hard to destroy.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that PFAS can be broken down with energy-intensive technologies. But this comes with steep costs. Incinerators must reach <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document/EPA-HQ-OLEM-2020-0527-0002" target="_blank">over 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit (1,000 Celsius)</a> to destroy PFAS, and the possibility of creating potentially harmful byproducts is <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2019-09/documents/technical_brief_pfas_incineration_ioaa_approved_final_july_2019.pdf" target="_blank">not yet well understood</a>. Other suggested techniques, such as <a href="https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)EE.1943-7870.0001957" target="_blank">supercritical water oxidation</a> or <a href="https://www.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/2009997/air-force-tests-plasma-reactor-to-degrade-destroy-synthetic-chemical-compounds/" target="_blank">plasma reactors</a>, have the same drawbacks.</p>
<p>So who is responsible for managing PFAS waste? Ultimately the responsibility will likely fall on public drinking water systems, but the EPA has no waste regulations for PFAS.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Steps to protect your home from PFAS</h4>

	
<p>Your first instinct might be to use bottled water to try to avoid PFAS exposures, but a recent study found that <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/bottled-water/pfas-in-bottled-water-new-study-finds-a1111233122/" target="_blank">even bottled water</a> can contain these chemicals. And bottled water is regulated by a different federal agency, the Food and Drug Administration, which has no standards for PFAS.</p>
<p>Your best option is to rely on the same technologies that treatment facilities will be using:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Activated carbon</strong> is similar to charcoal. Like a sponge, it will capture the PFAS, removing it from the water. This is the same technology in refrigerator filters and in some water pitcher filters, like Brita or PUR. Note that many refrigerator manufacture’s filters are not certified for PFAS, so don’t assume they will remove PFAS to safe levels.</li>
<li><strong>Ion exchange resin</strong> is the same technology found in many home water softeners. Like activated carbon, it captures PFAS from the water, and you can find this technology in many pitcher filter products. If you opt for a <a href="https://uswatersystems.com/products/pioneer-whole-house-lead-cyst-pfoa-pfos-removal-system" target="_blank">whole house</a> treatment system, which a plumber can attach where the water enters the house, ion exchange resin is probably the best choice. But it is expensive.</li>
<li><strong>Reverse osmosis</strong> is a membrane technology that only allows water and select compounds to pass through the membrane, while PFAS are blocked. This is commonly installed at the kitchen sink and has been <a href="https://nicholas.duke.edu/news/not-all-home-drinking-water-filters-completely-remove-toxic-pfas" target="_blank">found to be very effective</a> at removing most PFAS in water. It is not practical for whole house treatment, but it is likely to remove a lot of other contaminants as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a private well instead of a public drinking water system, that doesn’t mean you’re safe from PFAS exposure. Wisconsin’s Department of Natural Resources estimates that <a href="https://www.wpr.org/environment/study-pfas-detected-71-percent-shallow-private-wells-tested-statewide" target="_blank">71% of shallow private wells</a> in that state have some level of PFAS contamination. Using a certified laboratory to test well water for PFAS can run $300-$600 per sample, a cost barrier that will leave many private well owners in the dark.</p>
<p>For all the treatment options, make sure the device you choose is certified for PFAS <a href="https://www.nsf.org/" target="_blank">by a reputable testing agency</a>, and follow the recommended schedule for maintenance and filter replacement. Unfortunately, there is currently no safe way to dispose of the filters, so they go in the trash. No treatment option is perfect, and none is likely to remove all PFAS down to safe levels, but some treatment is better than none.</p>

Glenn Youngkin recently took action on a flurry of Virginia legislators’ measures related to reproductive health, mostly blocking bills designed to preserve the public’s access to abortions and birth control as these same issues roil national debates and as other states pass laws that restrict womens’ bodily autonomy and roll back decades of abortion protections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, a surprising signoff: Youngkin, a Republican, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB78" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">signed a bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Del. Vivian Watts, D-Fairfax, that prevents electronic menstrual data — often collected in period-tracking digital apps — from being subject to search warrants, subpoenas or court orders. Watts said in a phone interview Wednesday that her bill is a “preventative measure” that, considering the social climate of the nation, is warranted.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;The 1864 abortion ban is a feature, not a bug, of the GOP&#8217;s assault on reproductive rights&#8221; &#8212; Arizona Mirror" src="https://azmirror.com/2024/04/10/the-1864-abortion-ban-is-a-feature-not-a-bug-of-the-gops-assault-on-reproductive-rights/embed/#?secret=xix0dTUif4#?secret=bAa0vHLXBJ" data-secret="bAa0vHLXBJ" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Arizona Supreme Court just allowed a law that goes back to the 1800s to override a law passed within the last decade,” Watts said, referencing the state’s recent decision to uphold a 160-year-old statute that bans virtually all abortions and reject a 2022 law that allowed abortions up to the 15th week of pregnancy. When the newly-reenacted antebellum era law was first created, Arizona wasn’t a state, women couldn’t vote, and slavery was an ongoing American tradition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arizona’s near-total abortion ban is the latest example of how access to abortions has been increasingly limited since the Supreme Court of the United States overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, removing Constitutional protections for the procedure that is often </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N2TC0VD/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">necessary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to save womens’ lives or health. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My surprise at Youngkin greenlighting Watts’ bill isn’t based on the common sense merit of the measure. Protecting individuals’ private health information should be the standard of any state that respects its citizens. And it’s just downright creepy to imagine a Virginia judge or law enforcement officer scrutinizing the date and duration of peoples’ periods.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That Youngkin advanced that bill while vetoing several other reproductive health measures is what seemed like an unexpected mixed message to me, Virginia abortion </span><a href="https://x.com/ProtectChoice/status/1776404452678783176" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advocates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Watts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am amazed that there&#8217;s the recognition of the importance of privacy as a basic human right,” Watts said of Youngkin signing her bill, “that&#8217;s not being recognized in the other abortion-related legislation, where the right of a private decision is not being respected.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which pieces of related legislation did the governor reject or alter?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He shot down a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB15" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> carried by Sen. Barbara Favola, D-Arlington, to prevent the extradition of people who come to Virginia for an abortion from other states where the procedure is illegal, should that person face related criminal charges in their home state. The bill’s extradition protection would have extended to doctors and medical workers who performed or assisted with out-of-state patients’ Virginia abortions, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By vetoing this bill, the governor has refused to provide a layer of protection that Virginia healthcare professionals believe is necessary to ensure that they can provide abortion care without the fear of prosecution,” Favola</span><a href="https://x.com/BarbaraFavola/status/1776595597404917998" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> posted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on social media platform X. Doctors and women seeking abortions in the state “deserve the peace of mind this bill would’ve provided,” she added.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB716" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Del. Candi Mundon King, D-Dumfries, and Sen. Jennifer Carroll Foy, D-Prince William, </span><b> </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">that would have protected medical professionals who provide abortion care from disciplinary actions by the Board of Medicine also met Youngkin’s ax.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said no to a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB1098" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Del. Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke, mandating companies with 50 or more employees provide workers up to 10 days of unpaid bereavement leave after a family members’ death, but also, importantly, after a miscarriage, an unsuccessful “reproductive technology” procedure like in vitro fertilization, a stillbirth or following a medical diagnosis that “negatively impacts pregnancy or fertility.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB609" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Del. Marcia Price, D-Newport News to establish a right to access and use birth control regardless of the American Constitution’s requirements was, like Watts’ bill, an effort to protect reproductive health care from future federal restrictions that may be on the horizon. Youngkin </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+ful+HB609H1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">amended</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and weakened, the bill by predicating Virginians’ right to contraceptives on landmark Constitutional contraceptive protections, ones that could be overturned just like Roe. v. Wade. By doing so, he took the teeth right out of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin didn’t fully reject a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB819" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">measure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Sen. Ghazala F. Hashmi, D-Richmond, and King to mandate insurance companies cover birth control; he amended it by adding a loophole allowing insurers to be exempt based on their religious or ethical beliefs. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2016/06/21/where-major-religious-groups-stand-on-abortion/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Religious beliefs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about the God-given sanctity of life are the bedrock of America’s anti-abortion movement. Some use their religious beliefs to </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/06/20/lgbtq-people-americans-largely-oppose-religious-based-discrimination/70335484007/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">discriminate against LGBTQ+ people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Slaveowners used their religious beliefs to condone owning human beings, even </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/the-bible-was-used-to-justify-slavery-then-africans-made-it-their-path-to-freedom/2019/04/29/34699e8e-6512-11e9-82ba-fcfeff232e8f_story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reading Bible passages</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about servants obeying their masters to enslaved Black people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem with the governor tacking on a religious beliefs exemption to Hashmi’s bill is that, historically and presently, religious beliefs have been a convenient way for some people to excuse their bad behavior, spread prejudices and enforce their agendas at the expense of others’ lives, liberty and wellbeing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is the last Southern state to preserve access to abortion with no new restrictions after Roe’s overturning. Our commonwealth is now a sanctuary of last resort for people who can’t get abortion care that they desperately need where they live. As the reproductive health culture wars rage on, it’s imperative that Virginia’s laws reflect what citizens need and want: laws that support their health and ensure the best quality of life possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immediately after torching most abortion bills and diluting one to cement birth control as a human right, Youngkin started touting his </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2024/april/name-1025084-en.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">revised budget</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a way for state lawmakers and their constituents to reach “common ground.” But by rejecting the legislature’s reproductive health measures, our governor also rejects the rights and will of many Virginians and contributes to the deepening political and cultural divides fracturing our country.</span></p>

(Courtesy of Kelly Shannon) </p><p><strong><em>Editor’s note: </em></strong><em>This is the fourth installment of an occasional States Newsroom series called When and Where: Abortion Access in America, profiling individuals who have needed abortion care in the U.S. before and after Dobbs. The first installment can be found </em><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/and-after-dobbs-questions-when-and-where-affect-abortion-access" target="_blank"><em>here</em></a><em>, the second installment is</em><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/womans-health-matters-abortion-access-allowed-new-hampshire-woman-become-mom" target="_blank"><em> here</em></a><em>, and the third is</em><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/two-women-needed-end-their-pregnancies-only-one-got-do-it-her-terms" target="_blank"><em> </em><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>Kelly Shannon was grieving a pregnancy she would need to terminate because of multiple fetal anomalies when she got the call that Alabama doctors wouldn’t approve an abortion procedure despite exceptions in the law. That meant she would have to leave the state.</p>
<p>Shannon, 36, was about 16 weeks along in January 2023 when genetic testing – and confirmation from an amniocentesis – showed her fetus likely had Trisomy 21, better known as Down syndrome. It didn’t take long for the doctor to determine the fetus likely wouldn’t survive to term. There was fluid buildup in the head and body, evidence of a heart defect, and a tumor on the abdomen that was roughly one-third the size of its entire body.</p>
<p>“There was so much decision-making and processing, and you’re still feeling the baby kick the whole time,” Shannon said. “And every time she would kick, I was just sitting there like, ‘I’m so sorry. I wish I got to be your mom, but I don’t get to be your mom.’”</p>
<p>Three years before the U.S. Supreme Court issued the Dobbs decision in June 2022 and returned the ability to regulate abortion to the states, Alabama had already passed an abortion ban. Gov. Kay Ivey said at the time she signed the bill that even though it was likely unenforceable since abortion was still legal nationally, it was a signal to the courts to overturn Roe v. Wade. A group of physicians challenged the Alabama law in court and received a preliminary injunction that had barred its enforcement for years. But when Dobbs took effect, the injunction was lifted. Doctors are now subject to felony charges with punishment of up to life in prison.</p>
<p>Alabama is one of few states with an abortion ban at any stage of pregnancy that also contains an exception for lethal fetal anomalies. In the law, it’s defined as a condition from which the fetus would die after birth or shortly thereafter, or be stillborn. There are also exceptions for performing an abortion to save a pregnant patient’s life or preserve their health. However, according to the latest WeCount report of abortions performed since Dobbs, Alabama has recorded zero abortion procedures. Activists have argued that exceptions in abortion bans are meaningless because there is too much fear and uncertainty about what circumstances will qualify for an exception.</p>
<p>Down syndrome is the most common chromosomal abnormality, and more often occurs when the pregnant person is over the age of 35. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, infants with Down syndrome and a heart defect are five times more likely to die in their first year of life than those without.</p>
<p>Each abnormality on its own would possibly have been manageable, Shannon said, but the maternal-fetal medicine specialist told her the combination meant she would likely either miscarry at some point during the pregnancy or her daughter’s life would be short and punctuated by multiple surgeries. Shannon and her husband made the difficult decision at that point to terminate.</p>
<p>“That made the decision easier because it was like, well now if I know I’m going to lose her regardless, I can lose her on a controlled timeline, protect my health, start the grieving process, get healthy and then still be able to have another child,” she said.</p>
<p>Shannon filled out paperwork and made a termination appointment pending approval from the other maternal-fetal medicine specialists at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Her doctor felt confident that given the severity of the anomalies, the abortion would be allowed.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘I don’t think I would’ve taken that risk on me’ </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>A few days later, in the car on her way to meet her husband and toddler at a local dog park, the doctor called back.</p>
<p>“I knew why she was calling me. I knew that was the day the (second) committee was supposed to meet and she’d be calling me with their decision,” Shannon said.</p>
<p>Shannon scheduled the Jan. 24  termination date, made arrangements to take leave from work and had decided on cremation. But with one phone call, all the decisions she’d made had to change.</p>
<p>The termination had easily been approved by the first committee, and it seemed like the higher-level committee would sign off too. But in a halting manner, the doctor explained the committee had decided since each condition by itself was survivable, it didn’t meet the criteria for termination. She told Shannon it was the hardest phone call she’d made in her professional career.</p>
<p>The only way the committee might approve the request was if the fetus also developed a condition called hydrops fetalis, an excessive buildup of fluid that is often fatal. Shannon said that put her in a strange place of having some kind of hope that her pregnancy was even worse than originally thought. But she wasn’t upset with the doctors themselves.</p>
<p>“I mostly just felt sorry for them, even at the time,” she said. “As angry as I was that I wasn’t going to get to handle my pregnancy and my termination in the way that made the most sense to me … if I had been in their shoes and thought well, is this one case worth my license and jail time and prosecution? Her life’s not in danger, her baby’s probably going to die. I don’t think I would’ve taken that risk on me.”</p>
<p>The manager of public relations at the University of Alabama at Birmingham said no one was available to speak with States Newsroom for this story.</p>
<p>She had one more ultrasound at 17 weeks, where her providers checked for hydrops, but there was no presence of it. As the pregnancy had progressed further since the last ultrasound,  multiple holes between the chambers of the fetus’s heart were clearly visible, and the tumor had grown .7 centimeters. Despite the increased severity of those issues, without hydrops, she still had to go out of state.</p>
<p>A scheduling error meant Shannon had to wait two more weeks before she could get an appointment at a hospital in Richmond, Virginia — an 11-hour drive. Rather than bring her husband and toddler along for the ordeal, Shannon’s parents accompanied her. It was the first night she’d ever spent away from her toddler.</p>
<p>She chose to be induced for the procedure. After a long day of waiting, Shannon gave birth a few minutes before midnight and got to hold her daughter.</p>
<p>“I kept her with me until about 2 or 3 in the morning,” she said.</p>
<p>The logistics of what to do with the remains became more complicated since she was now more than 700 miles away from home and wouldn’t be able to visit a burial site in Virginia the way she could have in Alabama. She opted to have her daughter buried with other babies that had died because of miscarriage, termination or other premature causes.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Baby boy born in mid-March </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In mid-March, Shannon gave birth to a healthy baby boy that was a surprise pregnancy. She had been aiming for her next pregnancy to happen over the summer, when she wasn’t teaching.</p>
<p>“When I found out I was pregnant, I just started crying. Instead of being excited, the trauma came back,” she said. “And I felt like, I want to be excited and happy, but I’m not there yet because I don’t know if we get to keep this one yet either.”</p>
<p>She said she wants her story to make a difference, in hopes that another person doesn’t have to go through the same pain.</p>
<p>“I get angry whenever I see people with the ‘choose life’ bumper stickers and license plates, because they’re not thinking about me. They’re not recognizing that it’s not a black and white issue, it’s nothing but shades of gray when you’re dealing with pregnancy, particularly high-risk pregnancy,” Shannon said. “I am a married, white, straight, Christian, grew-up-in-the-church woman who was attempting to grow her family within the bounds of marriage, and I just keep thinking, if anybody is going to be able to change a mind about this issue, shouldn’t it be me?”</p>
