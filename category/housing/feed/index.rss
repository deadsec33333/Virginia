Dozens of media outlets republished our stories, too, which helped us reach new readers inside and outside the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, our readers were especially hungry to learn more about blue catfish and the invasive species&#8217; culinary potential, the state&#8217;s most stately trees and why preserving them is vital, a local school board that made history as the first in the nation to re-name schools after Confederate figures and another that sued a special needs student&#8217;s parent for $600,000. Here&#8217;s a recap of those stories and our other most-read reports and commentary of 2024.</span></p>

However citizens of the commonwealth view Shenandoah County School Board’s recent decision, Virginia appears to be the first in the nation to restore Confederate school names, after years of vigorous community engagement, a controversial renaming process, and a change in board priorities related to race, diversity and inclusion. <strong><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/20/virginia-school-board-restores-confederate-names/">Read more.</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>From the story:</strong> Of the roughly 2 million Virginians who’d been enrolled in Medicaid before the COVID-19 pandemic, over 480,000 of them have been disenrolled as of this August. Typically eligibility determinations are made annually, but they’d been on pause nationwide amid the pandemic due to federal policy. That’s changed over the past year in what’s colloquially referred to as “Medicaid Unwinding” as provisions of federal law have expired. <em><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/nearly-500000-virginians-in-medicaid-have-been-disenrolled/"><strong>Read more.</strong></a></em></p>

Last Monday, Youngkin awarded a $250,000 grant to Sea Farms, a family-owned and -operated aquaculture and seafood processing business with operations in Gloucester and Mathews counties, that among other uses will pay for a blast freezer that will increase the amount of blue catfish the company can buy and sell. </span><em><strong><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/05/blue-catfish-are-invasive-in-virginia-the-state-is-paying-to-get-more-of-them-on-peoples-tables/">Read more.</a></strong></em></p>

General Assembly members mostly understand the connection, leading to a lively debate in last year’s legislative session over whether to override some local permit denials for solar projects – and if so, how to ensure the localities still have some say. Though none of the legislative proposals moved forward last year, the topic has become a central one for the recently revamped Commission on Electric Utility Regulation (CEUR). </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/03/data-centers-approved-solar-farms-rejected-what-is-going-on-in-rural-virginia/"><b>Read more.</b></a></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Glen Sturtevant, R-Chesterfield, has been frustrated by large investment firms purchasing homes in Virginia. Both in </span><a href="https://x.com/GlenSturtevant/status/1860751697703739745" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">posts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on social media and in a Zoom call open to the public and press on Wednesday, he outlined some policy proposals that he hopes can help with affordable housing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, he laid out his legislative efforts to reign in investment firms. After an unsuccessful </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/SB693" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">attempt </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in 2024, he said that he’s reworking his bill for the 2025 session. If passed, it would prohibit investment firms worth more than $50 million from purchasing homes. Similar ideas have </span><a href="https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2024/01/05/hedge-fund-rental-housing-home-affordable-representative-adam-smith-congress-" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">been introduced </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in Congress and other state legislatures, so Sturtevant wants to try it in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is intended to target the big Wall Street investors, not your mom-and-pop investors who buy a home and flip it or who have a duplex under management,” he said.</span></p>

Glen Sturtevant, R-Chesterfield, in 2019. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mostly, he hopes it can help people who are struggling to afford a home, particularly first-time homebuyers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A meeting attendee named Holly Dougherty wrote in the group chat that her adult children are losing out on homebuying opportunities to investors with cash offers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There needs to be a way to keep young families in the community,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sturtevant said that anecdotally, it’s been a “nightmare” for “millennials and older Gen Zers who are coming out of school and trying to buy their first home.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He pointed to data from </span><a href="https://www.redfin.com/news/investor-home-purchases-q2-2024/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Redfin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that confirms a spike in investment firms purchasing homes. Investors bought one out of every six homes in the nation and one out of every four low-priced homes that sold in the second quarter of this year. Single-family homes made up nearly 70% of their purchases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sturtevant also pointed out how investment firms can sit on properties rather than redeveloping them or selling them, with a team of people analyzing the best moment they can sell for the highest price, despite having an advantage over individual buyers when acquiring the property in the first place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s ultimately not fair for them to be competing with regular people,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other legislation Sturtevant wants to spearhead would allow homebuyers to inherit a seller’s mortgage and its rate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An example of where people could see immediate benefit through that measure, he said, are people who were able to purchase a home or refinance their home during lower rates when the COVID-19 pandemic was surging. A new buyer could inherit that benefit if the law were to pass. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And finally, he said he is exploring ways to incentivize companies in the commonwealth to offer down payment assistance to employees. He said that the idea is to benefit both young employees who may lack the cash for down payments while also nurturing workforce development and keeping people in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while Sturtevant is still fine-tuning his proposals with Virginia’s Division of Legislative Services — legal experts that assist lawmakers in drafting legislation — he stressed that the laws are only part of broader solutions when it comes to the state’s affordable housing issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris Saxman, a former state delegate who hosted the Zoom call, noted how “everybody seems to be having housing issues these days.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing was a prominent topic in this year’s local and federal elections. Presidential candidates Kamala Harris (who </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/how-kamala-harris-new-policy-plan-could-impact-housing-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">offered </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">a downpayment assistance proposal) and President-elect Donald Trump talked about the nation’s housing needs during their campaigns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though housing is typically addressed at the local level, in Wednesday’s Zoom Saxman and Sturtevant reflected on ways state and federal governments can help with supply and affordability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saxman said that he thinks Sturtevant’s bills might be hard to vote against, especially with the House of Delegates up for election in 2025. His ideas will first need to clear the Senate before review by the House and approval from the governor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, who chairs the Housing Commission, welcomes Sturtevant’s intended work in addressing housing issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But she stressed that Republicans have not always been on board with supporting other efforts to boost affordable housing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Accessible and affordable housing has been at the forefront of the Democratic agenda for decades, (with) proposals often thwarted by our Republican colleagues,” she said. “That was never more evident than during the housing crisis in the 2009-2010 time frame and during the eviction crisis. Many voted against the budget that included funding for the Housing Trust Fund.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Locke said that she is “glad to know some finally understand this is a serious problem.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have put forward measures this year to address housing challenges in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield and Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield carried a proposal called “5,000 Families,” which would provide rental relief to certain families with school-age children to prevent displacement during academic years. Though it did not pass this year, housing groups have their </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/25/virginia-housing-groups-look-ahead-to-2025-for-legislative-funding-solutions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">eye on it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for next session. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Jeremy McPike’s Senate Bill 597 would have </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/bill-to-boost-affordable-housing-advances-to-youngkin/article_33e7b884-dd8e-11ee-96af-a7e0399a77a3.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">allowed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more local governments to utilize federal housing tax credits to encourage the development of additional affordable housing — typically associated with ranges of an area’s median income. The bill cleared both chambers before being vetoed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both proposals may resurface in the next legislative session beginning in January, and Sturtevant will try again on his investment firm bill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislature was able to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/10/these-new-housing-laws-will-take-effect-next-month/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">approve a series of housing reforms </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">this year. Some support renters, while another bill established a workgroup that can explore future </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/25/virginia-considering-future-building-code-updates-that-could-help-with-infill-development/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">building code changes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Another successful bill was aimed at protecting existing mobile home parks — a vulnerable but affordable type of housing for which residents own their homes, but not the land beneath it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Youngkin also recently issued </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/workforce-housing-directive-to-bolster-economic-development-and-new-home-construction-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a directive </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to invest up to $75 million towards localities that want to bolster housing supply tied to new job creation over the next five years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This isn’t partisan stuff,” Saxman said. </span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce for the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of Virginians who are unhoused has been on the rise, according to various data sources. A </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/local/richmond/2024/01/08/homelessness-virginia-statistics-data-how-many" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development showed that in 2023, roughly 7.8 per 10,000 people in Virginia were experiencing homelessness. Recent point-in-time counts in the greater Richmond area showed an </span><a href="https://irp.cdn-website.com/5f4255d0/files/uploaded/_GRCoC_2024_Annual_Report_%287%29.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in unhoused citizens over the past year.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While localized data can point to particular spikes in unhoused populations it doesn’t encompass all types of housing crises people can face, or truly capture how many people experience homelessness over time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laura Dobbs, a policy analyst with Housing Opportunities Made Equal, noted that someone might technically be homeless for only a few months, as opposed to someone more permanently unhoused who lives on streets, in parks or in shelters. But their temporary status is “still traumatic,” she stressed, and can still take time to financially and emotionally recover from. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s a lot of people that whether they live in a hotel or they’re couch surfing or splitting their kids between different family members — they may only be homeless for three months, but it’s still an unstable three months,” Dobbs said. “Those people might not get captured in a point-in-time count, but they still need services to help them regain stability.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s why her organization and others support state legislation aimed at helping to reduce or prevent evictions as well as broader efforts to increase housing stock and affordability. And of course, continued funding for organizations that work directly with those who are experiencing homelessness is a continuing need, she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Solving the housing crisis is primarily local through things like zoning and planning, but the state can incentivize things,” said Homeward executive director Kelly King Horne. Her organization is part of the Greater Richmond Continuum of Care — a consortium of groups working to prevent and reduce homelessness. Various organizations around Virginia coordinate on this work as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A</span><a href="https://irp.cdn-website.com/5f4255d0/files/uploaded/_GRCoC_2024_Annual_Report_%287%29.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published last month found that Greater Richmond Continuum of Care agencies encountered over 7,500 people seeking assistance within fiscal year 2024, ranging from emergency shelter requests to needing assistance to stay in their homes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other Richmond-area efforts have been underway over the last year as well. This past June, people were able to move into Cool Lane Commons, an 86-unit supportive housing apartment in Henrico County. The project stemmed from collaboration of local governments and organizations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a new (Richmond Redevelopment and Housing Authority) policy approved by HUD, the GRCoC Coordinated Entry System can make referrals directly to projects like this,” the continuum’s latest report stated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This past October the City of Richmond also opened its Office of Homeless Services on Chamberlayne Avenue. For people who lack a phone or computer, the center is a face-to-face option for connections to various regional housing resources. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those in need of shelter, however, a mens’ and veterans’ shelter on Grace St. plans to close by the end of the year due to funding challenges. This knowledge, paired with a recent Richmond city council vote to allocate $2 million to a new animal shelter, inspired Virginia’s NAACP housing chair Tracey Hardney-Scott to </span><a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/richmond-naacp-city-council-funding-nov-18-2024" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voice concern</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can&#8217;t be saying that animals would take precedence over people,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hardney-Scott hopes to see a boost in funding that can be earmarked specifically for shelters. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Legislative proposals</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Isabel McLain with the Virginia Housing Alliance said that her organization will press lawmakers on funding for housing efforts in their next revision of the state budget. Examples include funding that can go towards rapid rehousing efforts and operational funding for organizations that work with unhoused or vulnerable residents. It will also support efforts to assist people before they experience homelessness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Housing Alliance will also be supportive of programs that can help prevent displacement, such as a proposal called “5,000 Families.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carried last year by Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield and Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield, the initiative failed to make it into the most recent state budget. If implemented, the program would provide rental relief to certain families with school-age children to prevent displacement during academic years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something Dobbs said she’ll be watching for is anti-rent gouging legislation. Earlier this year, Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax carried a bill that would allow localities to set their own provisions that would require landlords to give two months’ written notice ahead of rent increases. It would also set certain parameters of what the increases could be. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hardney-Scott said that her organization is in conversation with legislators about which specific bills may be introduced or reintroduced next year. Like McLain, a revival of Boysko’s bill is something she plans to keep watch for. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bill that could get another shot at becoming law may be one the legislature already approved: </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/bill-to-boost-affordable-housing-advances-to-youngkin/article_33e7b884-dd8e-11ee-96af-a7e0399a77a3.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 597</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Sen. Jeremy McPike, D-Prince William, would have allowed more Virginia localities to craft zoning ordinances to encourage affordable housing by using special federal tax credits. Despite House and Senate approval, Gov. Glenn Youngkin </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb597" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the bill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Hardney-Scott engages with legal and nonprofit organizations and lawmakers, she hopes to see more widespread discussion of the role housing plays in peoples’ lives and communities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re not having enough conversations about how (housing struggles) affect health and education or contribute to crime,” Hardney-Scott said. “Housing is the one thing that everybody needs.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Federal housing changes may be on the horizon</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Horne, of Homeward noted how some housing solutions may be out of any states’ hands. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Funding is always going to be number one, especially if there’s cuts at the federal level,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dobbs concurred. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s hard to predict just how much (funding is) going to be cut from HUD,” she said. “A lot of local governments rely on funding from HUD to do things that come with services and prevention efforts, and without that federal funding, we&#8217;re really going to rely on the state even more to help support localities.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though President-elect Donald Trump has shied away from the “Project 2025” playbook from conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation, he has been </span><a href="https://www.heritage.org/impact/trump-administration-embraces-heritage-foundation-policy-recommendations" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">praised by the organization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for utilizing their guidance in his previous term. Several of its authors are former Trump officials, including former HUD secretary Dr. Ben Carson. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chapter 15</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of “Project 2025” Carsonhe suggested that Congress should </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“consider a wholesale overhaul of HUD that contemplates devolving many HUD functions to states and localities with any remaining federal functions consolidated to other federal agencies.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s both unclear how long such a downsizing of the federal agency would take and if it would happen, but Virginia housing advocates stress that the state legislature continues to empower and support local governments and organizations that work with them. </span></p>

A shortage of new homes is driving continued high housing costs, casting doubt on Virginia's future growth. (Parker Michels-Boyce/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Virginia will help fund housing construction near major business developments, Gov. Glenn Younkgin announced this week.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new executive order, on the heels of an announcement about a major manufacturing development near Danville, sets a goal of investing $75 million towards localities that want to bolster housing supply tied to new job creation over the next five years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The private sector is ready to step in and meet the needs of our growing workforce with much needed workforce housing,” Youngkin said in a release announcing his order. “(This) announcement advances these efforts by accelerating workforce housing development and requiring local governments to support the housing growth that Virginia needs.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How the funding will fuel housing supply</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a shortage of about 200,000 affordable housing units and a housing demand of about 4 million units overall, according to a </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/landing-2021-affordable-housing-in-virginia.asp" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and state government </span><a href="https://virginiabusiness.com/byline/department-of-housing-and-community-development/#:~:text=Virginia%20has%20a%20housing%20supply,according%20to%20the%20executive%20order." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the new investments aim to help foster construction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin anticipates his new order can help create about 5,000 units. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/eo/EO---42---Catalyzing-Housing-Development-for-Critical-Workforce-and-Economic-Development-Needs-with-Interagency-Collaboration.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Executive Order 42</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Workforce Housing Investment Program will consist of loans, subsidies and grants for localities and nonprofits to develop new housing near new employers in regions of the state. It also states that localities planning to tap into the Virginia Business Ready Sites Program will need to provide housing plans to demonstrate how they can accommodate job growth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One such example could be near the Berry Hill megasite in Pittsylvania County, which spans over 3,500 acres near Danville and has emerged as a development-ready site that could attract companies to the area. Ahead of Youngkin’s workforce housing announcement, Tennessee-based Microporous </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/11/14/how-big-is-the-microporous-announcement-here-are-11-ways/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced plans </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">for a battery plant at the location that is slated to provide over 2,000 jobs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Danny Marshall, R-Danville, said in an interview this summer that he anticipated the area could be ripe for tapping into various funding opportunities to address the conflation of job growth and housing strains. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Macaulay Porter, a deputy communications director for the governor, noted that while the funding is going to be available statewide, “localities with the highest imbalance of job growth to housing” stand to benefit the most. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysis from the state’s housing department has indicated that feature typically applies to areas in Southwest Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the Virginia Tobacco Region Revitalization Commission had also announced a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/workforce-housing-pilot-launches-to-support-southern-and-southwestern-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">workforce housing funding program </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">over the summer. That pilot program has about $2 million in its coffers to disperse to applicants on a rolling basis.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Virginia Housing and Community Development study from 2022 noted how the state’s </span><a href="https://dmz1.dhcd.virginia.gov/HB854/pdf/hb854-full-report-print.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fastest growing regions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the previous decade were  Northern Virginia, the Northern Shenandoah Valley and central Virginia’s Richmond. Conversely, rural areas of the state saw job losses. Those numbers could change in future census data as economic developments in rural areas attract or retain populations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some of her district entails urban areas, Sen. Lashresce Aird, D-Petersburg, previously told The Mercury that she anticipates rural portions of her district could benefit from workforce and housing development. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Housing continues to be a big strain on how we’re going to get workers to come here,” she said. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the 2025 legislative session on the horizon, lawmakers will continue to work on </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/10/these-new-housing-laws-will-take-effect-next-month/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">various other housing proposals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — ranging from preserving existing affordable housing to rental assistance or protections, to support for ways localities can tap into federal housing development funds. </span></strong></p>

</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s next building code update isn’t until 2027, but state lawmakers are already proactively thinking about ways it could be tweaked to help foster development on vacant or underutilized urban parcels and encourage affordable housing. An advisory group is expected to produce recommendations for how Virginia might update its zoning code to allow for certain multi-unit buildings over three stories to only need one stairwell instead of several. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea is that in lieu of an extra stairwell, buildings on smaller parcels in urban areas can still be developed or redeveloped to create additional housing units. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you go from three to six floors, you open up a lot more options for units,” said Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, who carried a bill to create the advisory group in this year’s legislative session. “It’s not a cure-all, but it does allow you to redevelop and increase your units.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The advisory group is weighing the pros and cons of doing so and preparing recommendations to share by the end of this year. His bill, also carried by Del. Adele McClure, D-Arlington, passed the legislature with bipartisan support before being signed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re seeing an increased momentum across the country, both at the state level and the locality level, because of, to be quite frank, the housing crunch, the supply crunch, the affordability crunch,” VanValkenburg said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He points to localities that have allowed for single-staircases for buildings up to six floors — like Seattle, Washington, New York, New York and Honolulu, Hawaii. These types of structures require considering factors like caps on square footage or number of residential units per floor or specific additional fire safety measures.  At the state level, Tennessee passed </span><a href="https://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/BillInfo/Default.aspx?BillNumber=SB2834&amp;GA=113" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a law </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">this year to allow localities to adopt building code sections for single-stairwell residential buildings up to six stories. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the concept could help with housing and infill development, public safety officials do note fire hazard concerns. Steven Sites, a fire marshal in Fairfax who serves on the advisory group, noted potential issues in single-stair buildings over three floors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, he said that not all fire vehicles have the equipment to reach higher windows and he noted how both firefighters and residents would utilize the same stairwell when residents are trying to evacuate as firefighters respond to a fire. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said that if Virginia were to pursue allowing for single-stair buildings up to six floors, there could be things to “make this have a better look and feel for fire service.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That could entail requiring smoke detectors in the common areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Currently in the code in an apartment-style building like this, there&#8217;s no requirement for smoke detection in these common areas,” he said. “So we know that&#8217;s a piece that could be added.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that another consideration could be if certain localities should be allowed to tap into single-stair code or if it would become a statewide requirement for buildings up to six floors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VanValkenburg said that he and McClure didn’t want to “legislate building codes.” He said that they saw their measure to create an advisory group as a way to encourage adoption of single-staircase allowances when Virginia updates its zoning code in 2027. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report from the advisory committee will be one part of the larger process when Virginia next updates its building code. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew Clark, vice president of government affairs for the Home Builders Association of Virginia, previously told The Mercury how tweaking staircase requirements can help solve development issues in spaces that are ripe for housing but would otherwise be abandoned projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This has the potential to unlock some really challenging sites in cities and built out areas that are trying to figure out how to do infill right,” Clark said. “Removing one staircase can really change the equation on what housing can be provided more affordably. Once you start opening up square footage from the staircases and corridors that eat up so much space, you can create more of a communal feel for new buildings.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the advisory group works on recommendations, it will still be some time before the state could consider adopting any of them. But VanValkenburg and McClure’s bill was part of a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/10/these-new-housing-laws-will-take-effect-next-month/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">handful of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> housing-related bills to pass the legislature this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aimed at addressing growing housing affordability issues in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s zoning, it’s the building code, it’s money in the affordable housing trust fund — it’s a bunch of different things,” VanValkenburg said of the various efforts it will take from various people and entities to help with Virginia’s affordable housing issues. “But this is a pretty low-hanging fruit policy idea, I think.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, voters will get dozens of chances to answer that question. All 11 of the commonwealth’s congressional seats are on the ballot, as is one Senate seat, the mayor’s office and all city council posts in Alexandria and Richmond, plus more council seats in Hampton, Harrisonburg, Norfolk, Roanoke, Virginia Beach, and beyond. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These elections involve a wide range of issues.  But in a sense, they boil down to one – housing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unaffordable housing drives the greatest problems across Virginia and the nation.  High housing prices — largely the result of a decades-old housing shortage and restrictive zoning laws — shape where you work, the length of your commute, and the carbon footprint of that journey.  Housing costs affect the size of your home, and with it decisions over how many children to have or whether to have them at all. Record-breaking home prices and skyrocketing rents limit how much families can spend on healthy food and doctor’s visits.  And with real estate making up the brunt of household wealth, rising home prices drive a widening wealth gap between homeowners and renters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My organization </span><a href="https://homeofva.org/learn-and-live-2/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently helped to highlight</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> how unaffordable housing helps to fuel two other enduring agonies — school segregation and racial inequality.  In the Richmond region, as with so many areas across the United States, the obvious racial segregation of our communities is mirrored in our schools.  And with that separation comes major differences in access to opportunity.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Few neighborhoods with affordable housing in the Richmond area have access to schools with top-tier scores for reading proficiency.  And children living in high-poverty neighborhoods here tend to learn from teachers who lack expertise in their fields.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think about that: high housing prices are segregating schools and limiting children’s futures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s not all.  Black and Latino individuals rent their homes </span><a href="https://www.nar.realtor/blogs/economists-outlook/racial-disparities-in-homeownership-rates" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more often</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than their white neighbors, so rent hikes have an outsized impact.  At the same time, the homeownership gap between Black and white Americans — </span><a href="https://ncrc.org/the-racial-wealth-divide-and-black-homeownership-new-data-show-small-gains-deep-fragility/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">larger today than in 1900</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — continues to grow, and that </span><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/black-wealth-is-increasing-but-so-is-the-racial-wealth-gap/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a shameful wealth gap.  The average Black family in the United States owns just 15% of the wealth of the average white family.  Unequal access to housing opportunities sits at the heart of this problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it’s a problem holding everyone back.  In the half-century between 1964 and 2009, </span><a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/mac.20170388" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a recent study found</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, U.S. GDP would have been 13.5% higher if Americans had greater access to affordable housing.  </span><a href="https://kirwaninstitute.osu.edu/sites/default/files/documents/Principles-for-Equitable-and-Inclusive-Civic-Engagement-1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other research</span></a> <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9298745/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has shown</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that communities where people from diverse backgrounds regularly encounter each other tend to have higher levels of trust among residents and more confidence in civic institutions.  In other words, high-priced housing not only segregates communities and trims our economic sails. It also makes us bad neighbors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does this have to do with November’s elections?  The problems we face are rooted in failures of policy.  And that means we can change them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The presidential contest presents two starkly different visions of how to address the housing crisis.  And Virginia’s Senators have co-sponsored </span><a href="https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/warner-kaine-colleagues-introduce-legislation-to-help-first-time-first-generation-homebuyers-narrow-the-wealth-gap" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">housing legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would offer one way to level the playing field.  Washington will have things to say about housing in America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But most housing politics is local.  The most effective ways to support affordable and fair access to housing start close to home, in our neighborhoods and city or county councils, where we can make our voices heard.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember the local races I mentioned earlier?  Local candidates elected in November will decide whether their communities offer a “welcome” mat or a “do not enter” sign to the next generation of would-be residents.  They will have thumbs on the scale in decisions over zoning, deciding what will be built and where.  Those zoning decisions will affect construction costs, which get passed along to homeowners and renters, so local officials will shape household budgets as well.  Local races may appear down the ballot, but they’re right at the top of daily concerns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, these days, housing isn’t red or blue.  We live in a hyper-partisan time, but voters and candidates across the political spectrum have solutions to offer.  Housing has proven to be the rare issue that attracts common sense, well-intentioned problem solvers from the left and right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At my organization, we’ve found that when we show up for housing, we win: Earlier this year, HOME of VA passed through the General Assembly all ten of our priority bills.  The governor signed into law three of these bills, expanding protections for those facing evictions and boosting state funding for fair housing outreach and education.  While he vetoed the other seven, we’ve proven that fair housing legislation has champions on both sides of the aisle.  After all, this isn’t about politics — it’s about what’s right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginians keen to put down roots in communities across the commonwealth — or find a way to stay amid rising costs — deserve fairness, choice, and affordability.  Up and down the ballot, those values need our votes.  We can do better than segregated communities sprawling across unaffordable regions where inequality grows.  We can vote for fair access to affordable housing.  We owe it to ourselves, our families and our neighbors to get it right.  </span></p>

(Seksan Mongkhonkhamsao/Getty Images)</p><p>In a <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4812158" target="_blank">recent study </a>evaluating how chatbots make loan suggestions for mortgage applications, researchers at Pennsylvania’s Lehigh University found something stark: there was clear racial bias at play.</p>
<p>With 6,000 sample loan applications based on data from the 2022 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the chatbots recommended denials for more Black applicants than identical white counterparts. They also recommended Black applicants be given higher interest rates, and labeled Black and Hispanic borrowers as “riskier.”</p>
<p>White applicants were 8.5% more likely to be approved than Black applicants with the same financial profile. And applicants with “low” credit scores of 640, saw a wider margin — white applicants were approved 95% of the time, while Black applicants were approved less than 80% of the time.</p>
<p>The experiment aimed to simulate how financial institutions are using AI algorithms, machine learning and large language models to speed up processes like lending and underwriting of loans and mortgages. These “black box” systems, where the algorithm’s inner workings aren’t transparent to users, have the potential to lower operating costs for financial firms and any other industry employing them, said Donald Bowen, an assistant fintech professor at Lehigh and one of the authors of the study.</p>
<p>But there’s also large potential for flawed training data, programming errors, and historically biased information to affect the outcomes, sometimes in detrimental, life-changing ways.</p>
<p>“There’s a potential for these systems to know a lot about the people they’re interacting with,” Bowen said. “If there’s a baked-in bias, that could propagate across a bunch of different interactions between customers and a bank.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How does AI discriminate in finance?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Decision-making AI tools and large language models, like the ones in the Lehigh University experiment, are being used across a variety of industries, like healthcare, education, finance and even in the judicial system.</p>
<p>Most machine learning algorithms follow what’s called classification models, meaning you formally define a problem or a question, and then you feed the algorithm a set of inputs such as a loan applicant’s age, income, education and credit history, Michael Wellman, a computer science professor at the University of Michigan, explained.</p>
<p>The algorithm spits out a result — approved or not approved. More complex algorithms can assess these factors and deliver more nuanced answers, like a loan approval with a recommended interest rate.</p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia legislators should be learning all they can about AI&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/05/virginia-legislators-should-be-learning-all-they-can-about-ai/embed/#?secret=COdvUyJeRx#?secret=HdVZUVCS4F" data-secret="HdVZUVCS4F" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>Machine learning advances in recent years have allowed for what’s called deep learning, or construction of big neural networks that can learn from large amounts of data. But if AI’s builders don’t keep objectivity in mind, or rely on data sets that reflect deep-rooted and systemic racism, results will reflect that.</p>
<p>“If it turns out that you are systematically more often making decisions to deny credit to certain groups of people more than you make those wrong decisions about others, that would be a time that there’s a problem with the algorithm,” Wellman said. “And especially when those groups are groups that are historically disadvantaged.”</p>
<p>Bowen was initially inspired to pursue the Lehigh University study after a smaller-scale assignment with his students revealed the racial discrimination by the chatbots.</p>
<p>“We wanted to understand if these models are biased, and if they’re biased in settings where they’re not supposed to be,” Bowen said, since underwriting is a regulated industry that’s not allowed to consider race in decision-making.</p>
<p>For the official study, Bowen and a research team ran thousands of loan application numbers over several months through different commercial large language models, including OpenAI’s GPT 3.5 Turbo and GPT 4, Anthropic’s Claude 3 Sonnet and Opus and Meta’s Llama 3-8B and 3-70B.</p>
<p>In one experiment, they included race information on applications and saw the discrepancies in loan approvals and mortgage rates. In other, they instructed the chatbots to “use no bias in making these decisions.” That experiment saw virtually no discrepancies between loan applicants.</p>
<p>But if race data isn’t collected in modern day lending, and algorithms used by banks are instructed to not consider race, how do people of color end up getting denied more often, or offered worse interest rates? Because much of our modern-day data is influenced by disparate impact, or the influence of systemic racism, Bowen said.</p>
<p>Though a computer wasn’t given the race of an applicant, a borrower’s credit score, which can be influenced by discrimination in the labor and housing markets, will have an impact on their application. So might their zip code, or the credit scores of other members of their household, all of which could have been influenced by the historic racist practice of redlining, or restricting lending to people in poor and nonwhite neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Machine learning algorithms aren’t always calculating their conclusions in the way that humans might imagine, Bowen said. The patterns it is learning apply to a variety of scenarios, so it may even be digesting reports about discrimination, for example learning that Black people have historically had worse credit. Therefore, the computer might see signs that a borrower is Black, and deny their loan or offer them a higher interest rate than a white counterpart.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Other opportunities for discrimination </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Decision making technologies have become ubiquitous in hiring practices over the last several years, as application platforms and internal systems use AI to filter through applications, and pre-screen candidates for hiring managers. Last year, New York City began requiring employers to <a href="https://www.hrdive.com/news/nyc-ai-in-hiring-law-enforcement-begins-july-5/647373/" target="_blank">notify candidates</a> about their use of AI decision-making software.</p>
<p>By law, the AI tools should be programmed to have no opinion on protected classes like gender, race or age, but some users allege that they’ve been discriminated against by the algorithms anyway. In 2021, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission launched an initiative to examine more closely how new and existing technologies change the way employment decisions are made. Last year, the commission settled its first-ever AI discrimination hiring lawsuit.</p>
<p>The New York federal court case ended <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/newsroom/itutorgroup-pay-365000-settle-eeoc-discriminatory-hiring-suit" target="_blank">in a $365,000 settlement</a> when tutoring company iTutorGroup Inc. was alleged to use an AI-powered hiring tool that rejected women applicants over 55 and men over 60. Two hundred applicants received the settlement, and iTutor agreed to adopt anti-discrimination policies and conduct training to ensure compliance with equal employment opportunity laws, <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/eeoc-settles-first-of-its-kind-ai-bias-lawsuit-for-365-000" target="_blank">Bloomberg reported</a> at the time.</p>
<p>Another anti-discrimination lawsuit is pending in California federal court against AI-powered company Workday. Plaintiff Derek Mobley alleges he was passed over for more than 100 jobs that contract with the software<a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/workday-must-face-novel-bias-lawsuit-over-ai-screening-software-2024-07-15/" target="_blank"> company because he is Black, older than 40 and has mental health issues, </a>Reuters reported this summer. The suit claims that Workday uses data on a company’s existing workforce to train its software, and the practice doesn’t account for the discrimination that may reflect in future hiring.</p>
<p>U.S. judicial and court systems have also begun incorporating decision-making algorithms in a handful of operations, like risk assessment analysis of defendants, determinations about pretrial release, diversion, sentencing and probation or parole.</p>
<p>Though the technologies have been cited in <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/01/ai-is-making-its-way-into-the-courtroom-and-legal-process.html" target="_blank">speeding up</a> some of the traditionally lengthy court processes — like for document review and assistance with small claims court filings — experts caution that the technologies are not ready to be the primary or sole evidence in a “consequential outcome.”</p>
<p>“We worry more about its use in cases where AI systems are subject to pervasive and systemic racial and other biases, e.g., predictive policing, facial recognition, and criminal risk/recidivism assessment,” the co-authors of a paper in <a href="https://judicature.duke.edu/articles/ai-in-the-courts-how-worried-should-we-be/#:~:text=AI's%20uses%20in%20the%20justice,actually%20helping%20to%20decide%20cases." target="_blank">Judicature’s 2024 edition</a> say.</p>
<p>Utah passed a law earlier this year to combat exactly that. <a href="https://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?mode=show_text&amp;id=ID:bill:UT2024000H366&amp;verid=UT2024000H366_20240313_0_E&amp;" target="_blank">HB 366</a>, sponsored by state Rep. Karianne Lisonbee, R-Syracuse, addresses the use of an algorithm or a risk assessment tool score in determinations about pretrial release, diversion, sentencing, probation and parole, saying that these technologies may not be used without human intervention and review.</p>
<p>Lisonbee told States Newsroom that by design, the technologies provide a limited amount of information to a judge or decision-making officer.</p>
<p>“We think it’s important that judges and other decision-makers consider all the relevant information about a defendant in order to make the most appropriate decision regarding sentencing, diversion, or the conditions of their release,” Lisonbee said.</p>
<p>She also brought up concerns about bias, saying the state’s lawmakers don’t currently have full confidence in the “objectivity and reliability” of these tools. They also aren’t sure of the tools’ data privacy settings, which is a priority to Utah residents. These issues combined could put citizens’ trust in the criminal justice system at risk, she said.</p>
<p>“When evaluating the use of algorithms and risk assessment tools in criminal justice and other settings, it’s important to include strong data integrity and privacy protections, especially for any personal data that is shared with external parties for research or quality control purposes,” Lisonbee said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Preventing discriminatory AI</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Some legislators, like Lisonbee, have taken note of these issues of bias, and potential for discrimination. Four states currently have laws aiming to prevent “algorithmic discrimination,” where an AI system can contribute to different treatment of people based on race, ethnicity, sex, religion or disability, among other things. This includes Utah, as well as California (<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billStatusClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200SB36" target="_blank">SB 36</a>), Colorado (<a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb21-169" target="_blank">SB 21-169</a>), Illinois (<a href="https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/BillStatus.asp?DocNum=53&amp;GAID=16&amp;DocTypeID=HB&amp;LegId=127865&amp;SessionID=110&amp;GA=102" target="_blank">HB 0053</a>).</p>
<p>Though it’s not specific to discrimination, Congress introduced a bill in late 2023 to amend the Financial Stability Act of 2010 to include federal guidance for the financial industry on the uses of AI. This bill, the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/3554/text" target="_blank">Financial Artificial Intelligence Risk Reduction Act</a> or the “FAIRR Act,” would require the Financial Stability Oversight Council to coordinate with agencies regarding threats to the financial system posed by artificial intelligence, and may regulate how financial institutions can rely on AI.</p>
<p>Lehigh’s Bowen made it clear he felt there was no going back on these technologies, especially as companies and industries realize their cost-saving potential.</p>
<p>“These are going to be used by firms,” he said. “So how can they do this in a fair way?”</p>
<p>Bowen hopes his study can help inform financial and other institutions in deployment of decision-making AI tools. For their experiment, the researchers wrote that it was as simple as using prompt engineering to instruct the chatbots to “make unbiased decisions.” They suggest firms that integrate large language models into their processes do regular audits for bias to refine their tools.</p>
<p>Bowen and other researchers on the topic stress that more human involvement is needed to use these systems fairly. Though AI can deliver a decision on a court sentencing, mortgage loan, job application, healthcare diagnosis or customer service inquiry, it doesn’t mean they should be operating unchecked.</p>
<p>University of Michigan’s Wellman told States Newsroom he’s looking for government regulation on these tools, and pointed to <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/6936/text#:~:text=Introduced%20in%20House%20(01%2F10%2F2024)&amp;text=To%20require%20Federal%20agencies%20to,the%20use%20of%20artificial%20intelligence." target="_blank">H.R. 6936</a>, a bill pending in Congress which would require federal agencies to adopt the Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The<a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ai/NIST.AI.100-1.pdf" target="_blank"> framework</a> calls out potential for bias, and is designed to improve trustworthiness for organizations that design, develop, use and evaluate AI tools.</p>
<p>“My hope is that the call for standards … will read through the market, providing tools that companies could use to validate or certify their models at least,” Wellman said. “Which, of course, doesn’t guarantee that they’re perfect in every way or avoid all your potential negatives. But it can … provide basic standard basis for trusting the models.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">RICHMOND, Va. &#8212; Older adults age 55 and up accounted for 44% of the homeless population in the Greater Richmond region, according to a recent annual count.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Homelessness in the region increased 20% from <a href="https://irp.cdn-website.com/5f4255d0/files/uploaded/July%202023%20PIT%20Infographics%20(5).pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://irp.cdn-website.com/5f4255d0/files/uploaded/July%25202023%2520PIT%2520Infographics%2520(5).pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1727730020257000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2R5s5pTvOBzX0VvvOUbtjq">2023</a>, while older adult homelessness rose two percentage points, based on recent data collected by the Homeward VA point-in-time <a href="https://www.homewardva.org/point-in-time-count" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.homewardva.org/point-in-time-count&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1727730020257000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1YJoePWru4_70bbTL4rhWA">count</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Older adults have vulnerabilities that don&#8217;t exist for other renters or homeowners, according to Benjamin Teresa, the director of <a href="https://rampages.us/rvaevictionlab/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://rampages.us/rvaevictionlab/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1727730020257000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3U92FK2Mt09nBbfvb2voex">RVA Eviction Lab</a>. Limited income, medical costs, rising housing costs, evictions and more can all factor into the displacement of older adults.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Like others in the region, older adults face a lack of affordable housing and rising rents, but they have a fixed source of income from Social Security benefits or pensions, Teresa said. They often are unable to have two sources of income to support increased housing costs.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> A growing trend is for people to work longer, well into their 60s or 70s, as an effort to afford their cost of living, according to Teresa.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Anything such as unexpected medical bills can impact finances and may lead to decisions like forgoing medication to pay rent, or paying medical bills and falling behind on rent, according to Teresa.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The number of single adults 50 or older who experience homelessness jumped from 11% in the early 1990s to approximately 37% in 2003, according to <a href="https://endhomelessness.org/blog/paint-by-numbers-older-americans-and-homelessness/#:~:text=138%2C098,not%20meant%20for%20human%20habitation" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://endhomelessness.org/blog/paint-by-numbers-older-americans-and-homelessness/%23:~:text%3D138%252C098,not%2520meant%2520for%2520human%2520habitation&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1727730020257000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2f6_VHttPDBDLNbCZpQGmJ">an article from the National Alliance to End Homelessness</a>. That percentage then gradually rose to almost 50% in the 2020s.</p>
<p dir="ltr">High property taxes add more burden, Teresa said. Low-income seniors cannot maintain the spike in taxes when a home’s value increases over time, often from neighborhood development and sometimes gentrification.</p>
<p dir="ltr">They even continue to live in unsafe or unhealthy housing conditions because they cannot afford the maintenance. Deteriorating homes are often foreclosed or “predatory investors” buy the home for much less than it&#8217;s worth, which creates housing instability, according to Teresa.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It’s really important for the city to be investing in affordable housing that would certainly help seniors and help all renters,” Teresa said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Emergency rental assistance was successful during the pandemic but post-pandemic eviction filings have increased as assistance stopped. Good quality and higher paying jobs are crucial to help afford housing costs, according to Teresa.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Housing problems are not just housing problems,” Teresa said.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Leading cause of evictions for older adults</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Olivia Seksinsky, a staff attorney at the <a href="https://cvlas.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cvlas.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1727730020257000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2TSCZgickLOKJTRzE0ceiH">Central Virginia Legal Aid Society, </a>works exclusively for eviction defense. Almost 32% of tenants she represented since 2021 are over the age of 55, she said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lawyers with the organization provide free civil legal services and education to low-income individuals in need, according to its website.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The leading cause of eviction for older adults is the lack of affordable housing and landlords “stringency” with a tenant’s rental history records, Seksinsky said. Prior evictions tarnish records and a tenant’s credibility, which can hinder the homing process.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Eviction leads to homelessness just because it kind of can close you out of a lot of new housing options,” Seksinsky said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Although housing assistance for older adults is available, it is “harder to come by now,” because the need is so widespread, according to Seksinsky.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Older adults may have health concerns, mainly mobility issues, that make it harder to move out before the eviction process starts, she said.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Legislative changes experts say could help</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Seksinsky hoped the failed <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB721" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241%2Bsum%2BHB721&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1727730020257000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2Vm1cHN4hoL-hHAqsHDAJf">House Bill 721</a>, which focused on rent control, would pass earlier this year to help deter eviction filings. It was the third time Del. Nadarius Clark, D-Suffolk, introduced similar legislation to stabilize rent. Lawmakers <a href="https://rvamag.com/politics/rent-control-measures-fail-to-progress-in-legislative-session.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://rvamag.com/politics/rent-control-measures-fail-to-progress-in-legislative-session.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1727730020257000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0KtNIakb_eykqPQNum2nOp">wanted </a>to see some research or maybe a pilot program.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“When the landlord has no limit to how often they can raise the rent … the landlord can keep raising the rent,” Seksinsky said. “It eventually becomes impossible to afford unless that senior citizen is then forced to go back to work or borrow money.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">A rent cap and more advocacy for public assistance programs will help, specifically with moving costs to transition when affordable housing is needed, Seksinsky said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">LeadingAge Virginia is an association of nonprofits that provide senior housing, assisted living, nursing homes, adult day centers and home and community-based services to older adults, according to its <a href="https://leadingagevirginia.org/page/About" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://leadingagevirginia.org/page/About&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1727730020257000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2_Za2cxlxuFR5lfY-c_1Ua">website</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The association advocates for legislation that improves the affordability and accessibility of high-quality housing for older adults, according to Vice President and Legislative Counsel for LeadingAge Virginia, Dana Parsons.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Its legislative priorities include increasing funding, enacting regulatory reforms to streamline development, and integrating supportive services to ensure full care within these communities, according to Parsons.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Stable housing is key to preserving dignity, improving health outcomes, ensuring economic stability, and fostering strong community support,” Parsons stated.</p>

(Screenshot courtesy U.S. Senate Budget Committee livestream)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WASHINGTON – Conversations about things like zoning laws, permits, or use of housing subsidies typically happen in city or county government chambers rather than those of the U.S. Senate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But people in localities across the nation, including Virginia, are experiencing the persistent challenges of finding and affording a place to live. So, the <a href="https://www.budget.senate.gov/hearings/the-costs-of-inaction-economic-risks-from-housing-unaffordability" target="_blank">Senate&#8217;s budget committee had a hearing Wednesday</a> to listen to a cohort of various housing experts about ways the federal government can help. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As housing costs outpace wages, today more than 10 million Americans spend over half of their income on housing — leaving little for essentials like food, healthcare and education,” said Greta Harris, president and CEO of the Richmond-based Better Housing Coalition, who was a guest speaker at the hearing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also noted ripple effects that stem from housing issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This suppresses consumer demand and hampers economic growth,” Harris added. “Businesses in both urban and rural areas struggle to attract and retain talent because workers can’t afford to live nearby.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the state and local level, Virginia is already spearheading some targeted solutions. A state commission recently launched a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/workforce-housing-pilot-launches-to-support-southern-and-southwestern-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">workforce housing pilot program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the state’s southwestern and Southside regions, and the city of Richmond earmarked money in its budget to create a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/19/could-this-right-to-counsel-program-for-evictions-become-a-statewide-model/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">right-to-counsel program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for people facing evictions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developers around Virginia and America continue to tap into use of federal Low Income Housing Tax Credits to bolster construction of below-market-rate housing available to certain percentages of area median income. Expanding the federal program was floated by several senators during the hearing (and is part of Vice President </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/how-kamala-harris-new-policy-plan-could-impact-housing-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kamala Harris’ housing plans </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">if elected president). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris, of the Better Housing Coalition, said that LIHTC has been an “extremely effective” tool.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaker of Rhode Island’s house of representatives, Joseph Shekarchi, was also a guest at the hearing. He shared his perspective pressing for </span><a href="https://rhodeislandcurrent.com/2024/02/05/rhode-island-needs-to-pick-up-the-pace-to-tackle-affordable-housing-crisis/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">various housing policies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Rhode Island’s legislature, such as streamlining permitting and appeals processes for developments and investments in its housing production fund. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can do all the policy programming we want, but if a child doesn’t have a safe place to sleep, what does it all mean?” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a state lawmaker, he implored Congress to provide “greater funding mechanisms and grant opportunities to develop more housing, foster public-private partnerships, and to see further expansion of financial assistance” for renters and first-time homebuyers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Republican senators and some guest speakers cautioned against more government spending. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, took particular aim at Harris’ proposal of $25,000 in downpayment assistance for first-time homebuyers. If elected president, that plan would hinge on congressional approval. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His concern was echoed by guest speaker Ed Pinto, co-director of AEI Housing Center, a conservative think tank.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pinto said Harris’ proposal is “almost certain to lead to higher home prices, thereby, more than eliminating the intended benefits. Millions of program recipients would become price setters in their neighborhood.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He projected the downpayment assistance would cost the U.S. $100 billion over four years and wouldn’t help with supply issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This would be a wealth transfer to existing homeowners and really rewarding NIMBY opposition to additional supply,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NIMBY, which stands for “not in my backyard,” is a casual term used when discussing housing policy for people who oppose new developments or types of developments.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally, lawmakers and the guest speakers agreed that increased housing supply will help with affordability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pinto did thank Virginia’s senators Tim Kaine and Mark Warner along with Van Hollen, D-Md., for their introduction of the LIFT Act, which draws inspiration from Pinto’s own proposals. The Low-Income First-Time Homebuyers Act would offer 20-year mortgages to first-time buyers whose incomes don’t exceed a certain threshold. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warner joked to Pinto that he might need help recruiting some Republicans onto the bill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine also noted bipartisan consensus on </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/09/white-house-gop-housing-federal-land-00170616" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">selling off some vacant federally-owned land for new housing construction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., asked if housing issues should be best handled by local governments and the private sector, Harris of the Better Housing Coalition responded that the federal government can help with a power check. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Left to its own devices, the market is not equitable and it serves certain portions of our society and not all,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s where encouragement of local zoning reforms by the state and federal government could help localities increase their supply through more development. From his perspective as a Rhode Island state lawmaker, Shekarchi said localities are going to need all the help they can get.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We need federal subsidies. We need land use reform on a local level. We need the federal government to step in, because the states and the local communities cannot do it alone.”</span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia launched a workforce housing pilot program this summer aimed at both attracting economic development to the southern and southwestern portions of the state and bolstering local affordable housing supply. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With $2 million in allocated funding, the Virginia Tobacco Region Revitalization Commission launched the program in late July. For-profit and nonprofit developers can now </span><a href="https://revitalizeva.org/economic-development-workforce-housing-incentive-pilot-program/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">apply for the funding on a rolling basis </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to help with site development, infrastructure, or direct housing construction costs. The units built with the funding can be  for purchase or for rent, but the goal is to help people live where they work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have all heard the stories about folks being priced out of homes or unable to buy,” said Stephen Versen, deputy director of the Virginia Tobacco Region Revitalization Commission. “While that is of course a serious issue, the economic development impact of having a lack of workforce housing can also be huge.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As more companies are </span><a href="https://www.virginiabusiness.com/article/hitting-the-jackpot/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">developing worksites in rural areas of Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — contributing factors for job and population growth — the lack of affordable housing is becoming too hard to ignore, noted Del. Danny Marshall, R- Danville, a member of the commission.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also pointed to an upcoming </span><a href="https://www.ialr.org/third-annual-southern-virginia-regional-housing-summit/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">housing summit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> taking place in the area next month where contractors, bankers, home renovators, architects and community housing advocates are encouraged to attend. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Versen said that as of mid-September, four applications have been received through the online portal and several localities have reached out to learn more about the pilot. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a new pilot so we’re excited to see what we can learn and I hope a decision can be made on awards by May (2025) at the latest,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tobacco Region Commission will have had a few meetings by then and applications will have more formally progressed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Marshall pointed to the Berry Hill megasite in Pittsylvania County as a prime example of where the program could be implemented. The publicly-owned space spans over 3,500 acres near Danville and has emerged as a development-ready site that could attract various companies in the area. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s gonna take a while to build,” he said of some ongoing developments at Berry Hill. “So at the same time, we wanted to go ahead and help with workforce housing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Berry Hill continues to catch the eye of businesses — some of which may want to tap into the workforce housing program — fellow commission member Sen. Lashresce Aird, D-Petersburg, noted how the program can help boost other areas of Virginia’s former Tobacco Region. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her district, anchored in Petersburg, spans southward to include Sussex, Surry, Dinwiddie and Prince George counties along with the city of Hopewell. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As parts of her district and others in the commission’s purview seek to attract new industries, “housing continues to be a big strain on how we&#8217;re going to get workers to come here.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aird said that not only can the program help with affordable housing options but it can “further attract a new industry or company to look in a place where they might not have looked before.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interested applicants can submit </span></i><a href="https://revitalizeva.org/ninja-forms/68hlh/" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span></i><a href="https://revitalizeva.org/economic-development-workforce-housing-incentive-pilot-program/" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional details </span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">are on the commission’s website.</span></i></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce for The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically a very local issue, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/how-kamala-harris-new-policy-plan-could-impact-housing-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">presidential candidates </span></a> are discussing housing policy <span style="font-weight: 400;">this year and Virginia’s state legislature </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/10/these-new-housing-laws-will-take-effect-next-month/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">continues to play a role in addressing related issues</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The state’s capital city, Richmond, has a mayoral election in November that could shape housing policy for at least the next four years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year council passed a</span><a href="https://richmondva.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6112907&amp;GUID=93BD96AB-6A5A-40B4-A50B-A29A36C706FA&amp;Options=&amp;Search=" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> resolution to declare that the city had a housing crisis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Efforts to help will be paramount for the city’s legislative body and next mayor because Richmond’s </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/19/could-this-right-to-counsel-program-for-evictions-become-a-statewide-model/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">eviction rate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is second highest in the nation, the amount of people experiencing homelessness is </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2024-08-26/homeward-greater-richmond-continuum-of-care-homeless-report-july-2024" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on the rise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the city has not been immune to national struggles for people to </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/local/richmond/2023/10/23/richmond-housing-affordability-six-figures" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">afford purchasing homes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond’s five candidates for mayor — Andreas Addison, Danny Avula, Michelle Mosby, Maurice Neblett and Harrison Roday — share their ideas on this front, including dedicating more money to existing land trust funds, supporting updated zoning that will foster the development of more housing and diversify housing types, and furthering existing eviction diversion programs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below is an overview of some of their other proposals.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Land value taxes</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having passed</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+SB725" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Virginia law allows for the use of land value taxes, when property is taxed by the land and not the structure sitting on top of it. Addison, as a Richmond City Council member representing District 1, advocated for that law and asked then-state Sen. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, to carry it. Now he wants to see it put to use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said this measure can help homeowners, particularly seniors and people on fixed incomes, to remain in their homes. Usually home sales in a neighborhood are what drives peoples’ tax assessments up over time and can push longer-term residents out of certain neighborhoods. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Land value taxes could also spur action on vacant or blighted properties because it would become more costly to hold onto empty properties than to develop them. Addison noted empty lots and derelict buildings around Richmond that could become housing or mixed-use development if owners had a nudge to move forward on projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This strategy lowers the tax burden on residents and incentivizes investors who are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">sitting on valuable property to either sell it or develop it, which will spur the development </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">of infill,” Addison said. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Fast tracking the approval process for affordable developments</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mosby, who represented District 9 as a city councilor 2013-2016, wants to create an Affordable Housing Strike Team, she said. It would be composed of key department heads involved in housing and development approvals within the city, their work overseen by her office as mayor to “ensure accountability and efficiency,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal is simple — cut through the red tape and get affordable housing projects completed as quickly as possible,” Mosby said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, Roday, who founded the community development nonprofit Bridging Virginia, plans to institute a “shot clock” approach to building permits in Richmond. When asked for more details of how that could work, he pointed to how</span><a href="https://www.ncleg.gov/BillLookUp/2023/H332" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> North Carolina’s state legislature has proposed a statewide mandate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to “set clear targets for results.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Resident feedback boards </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Roday and Avula plan to create advisory boards that can weigh in on housing policy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As more than half of the renters in Richmond </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/local/richmond/2024/02/05/richmond-renters-cost-burden-unaffordable" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spend more than 30% of their income on rent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Roday’s board would have a focus on renters, he said. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Bolstering the Office of Community Wealth Building</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avula, a pediatrician and former director of the Richmond and Henrico Health Districts</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">wants to allocate additional funding for case workers in the Office of Community Wealth Building with a goal of helping low-income Richmonders be better able to raise their incomes — thus alleviating some of the strain of housing costs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This level of intensive support gives families residing in (Richmond Redevelopment and Housing Authority) properties a greater likelihood of upward economic mobility,” he said. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Support for public housing residents</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Richmond Redevelopment and Housing Authority manages about 4,000 units around the city and owns some undeveloped land parcels as well. This summer it </span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/local-news/richmond/richmond-redevelopment-and-housing-authority-will-open-up-specific-waitlists-at-the-end-of-june/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">opened up waitlists,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which can expand housing access for people who need it most, but earlier this year had </span><a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/richmond-public-housing-authority-pausing-evictions-april-19-2024" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filed eviction proceedings that it later paused as it reviewed its rent calculations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addison noted how the council was able to bolster the Richmond Redevelopment and Housing Authority’s ongoing work on the Creighton Court transformation, but said that the city will need to “think more outside of the box” on additional funding for RRHA’s needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said Richmond could explore a local add-on to the federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit program, a federal resource that some Virginia localities have access to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We just need the political will to go to bat for residents in public housing,” Addison said. “It doesn&#8217;t just take new revenue streams, it takes political courage.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Accountability for landlords on maintenance</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mosby plans to “go after” landlords who let their properties deteriorate. To address this, she said that “ we will focus on enforcement and proactive partnerships with landlords, tenants, the fire department, and code enforcement to ensure buildings are maintained and safe.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her administration will also ensure that code enforcement officers are able to monitor properties to take action when violations are visible.  </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Boosting nonprofit organizations and supporting public-private partnerships</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city has already been working with local organizations, like Continuum of Care — a local network of homelessness resource groups that receive federal funding — or Habitat for Humanity, for example. Continuing collaborations and building partnerships will be important, candidates said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By working with groups like Virginia Supportive Housing, we can offer not just a place to live but also job training, healthcare, and other critical services to address the root causes of homelessness,” said  Neblett, an entrepreneur and first-time candidate for elected office. “We can’t forget the recovery community in this, people working to rebuild their lives deserve every opportunity to have stable housing as they recover.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other candidates  also mentioned ways the city can bolster efforts of nonprofit organizations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addison noted how Project:HOME purchased a mobile home park in Chesterfield County to preserve it for residents. He’d like to support the organization in efforts to preserve affordable neighborhoods and construct new home types. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roday stressed how public-private partnerships can help yield more home construction and that projects should be available at or below 50% of Richmond’s area median income.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can invest more in affordable housing with public-private partnerships that include flexible capital, including municipal dollars,” Roday said. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Local requests to the state legislature</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, there are many instances where local government needs permission from the state government to take certain actions, and more broadly,  state laws related to housing can make a significant impact on certain localities. Ahead of the 2025 legislative session, Richmond’s mayoral candidates already have ideas on what to press the legislature for. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addison said that he supports a proposal that failed this previous legislative session. </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/10/these-new-housing-laws-will-take-effect-next-month/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dubbed “5,000 Families,” </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">the bipartisan effort from Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield and Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield would help families that experience a housing crisis during a school year remain in place through funding vouchers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also has his eye on a bill by Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, that the legislature plans to address next year that would set a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB721" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cap on how much landlords can increase rent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> within a year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mosby plans to advocate for state-level assistance on solutions to sheltering localities’ unhoused populations and for more funding that localities can use towards affordable housing development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roday and Avula both said they would push for more funding to Virginia’s K-12 education system and reshaping Richmond’s combined sewage overflow system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Both of these would add dollars to our budget from the state level,” Roday said. “Then more local dollars could be freed up to invest in housing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neblett said he’ll push for enhancements to Virgnina’s tenant protections and for more funding in the Virginia Housing Trust Fund. </span></p>

Read their responses below, and stay tuned for in-depth profiles of these candidates in the coming weeks.

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Abortion</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the only state in the South that hasn’t restricted abortion access since the Supreme Court overturned Roe. v Wade in 2022, which made abortion a federal right, Virginia is a key player in the country’s reproductive health landscape. By dismantling Roe v Wade, the nation’s highest court laid the groundwork for each state to restrict or enhance access to abortion; a spate of state bans on abortion have since emerged, with 14 states making the procedure illegal. Abortion remains legal in Virginia and state Democrats will push to enshrine it as a right in the commonwealth’s constitution next year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Republican candidates in Virginia’s congressional races assert that abortion access should be determined at the state level. In District 2, Republican incumbent U.S. Rep. Jenn Kiggans, a Navy veteran, nurse and former member of the state senate, has “consistently advocated for women to choose life, but respects exceptions for rape, incest, and life of the mother,” according to her campaign </span><a href="https://jenforcongress.com/issues/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Democratic challenger Missy Cotter Smasal, who is also a Navy veteran as well as the director of a nonprofit focused on women veterans, </span><a href="https://fb.watch/uhpo6DTiSN/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declared herself</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “the only pro-choice Navy veteran in this race.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 7, anchored in Prince William County but also spanning rural parts of the state, Spotsylvania attorney and former Green Beret Derrick Anderson, a Republican, is challenging career military officer and Democrat Eugene Vindman for the seat currently occupied by Abigail Spanberger, who is running for governor next year. Anderson has expressed support for the overturn of Roe and </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/DerrickAndersonforVA/videos/my-life-story-is-pro-life-and-thats-how-i-will-serve-in-congress-my-mother-got-p/414067620643367/?locale=ms_MY" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">called himself “pro-life” while sharing on social media</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that his mother had him as a single parent at 17 years old. Vindman plans to support </span><a href="https://vindmanforcongress.com/issues/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">access to abortions and contraception along with in vitro fertilization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 10, anchored in Loudoun County, Democratic state Sen. Suhas Subramanyam is running against Republican Mike Clancy to fill Rep. Jennifer Wexton’s seat. Wexton will not seek reelection due to a health issue, and endorsed Subramanyam during his democratic primary. He has supported an effort to </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SJ255" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">enshrine abortion protections into Virginia’s constitution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and plans to support federal protections. Clancy said that he “does not support federal action on abortion.” His campaign website lists “respect life” as a campaign issue and notes his support for resources for pregnant people and families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 9, incumbent Rep. Morgan Griffith faces Democratic challenger Karen Baker, a lawyer-turned-nurse. Griffith has voted against congressional efforts to protect abortion access and </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=402684" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Roe v. Wade had “produced decades of tragedy.” Baker wrote on her campaign website that “women’s choices must be respected.”</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Ksn63EC7JL"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/17/they-dont-like-abortion-but-kaines-gop-challengers-say-they-wont-seek-a-federal-ban/">They don’t like abortion, but Kaine’s GOP challengers say they won’t seek a federal ban</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;They don’t like abortion, but Kaine’s GOP challengers say they won’t seek a federal ban&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/17/they-dont-like-abortion-but-kaines-gop-challengers-say-they-wont-seek-a-federal-ban/embed/#?secret=H3VtqeFCdu#?secret=Ksn63EC7JL" data-secret="Ksn63EC7JL" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, who is seeking reelection, has co-sponsored the </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/kaine-others-reintroduce-reproductive-freedom-for-all-act/article_f6cbd514-a8a7-11ed-8ac8-e388ae499856.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reproductive Freedom For All Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would protect access federally, now that Roe has been overturned. His Republican challenger, retired Navy veteran Hung Cao, told Virginia Mercury this summer that he </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/17/they-dont-like-abortion-but-kaines-gop-challengers-say-they-wont-seek-a-federal-ban/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">won’t support a federal abortion ban</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He has also </span><a href="https://www.hungforva.com/right-to-life/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">called himself “pro-life.” </span></a></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Housing </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing is an issue people experience practically and constantly, amid paying rent or mortgages. Local governments handle approvals or rejections of developments and craft zoning laws that guide development potential. But state and federal lawmakers have roles to play as well — largely through funding mechanisms or taking action where housing intersects with other policy platforms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While many congressional candidates this year don’t have housing policy outlined on their websites, some have been talking about how they plan to help states and local governments from the federal level. The Mercury reached out to others for more details on what they would do to help with housing supply and affordability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 2, Incumbent Rep. Jen Kiggans did not respond to inquiry for more details on housing policy by the time of this publication, though during her time in the state legislature as a senator, she voted in favor of the </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+vot+SV0271HB1889+HB1889" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her challenger, Democrat Missy Cotter Smasal, acknowledged the Mercury’s request for comment but did not follow through with a response in time for this publication. Her website touches on housing policy while addressing the economy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We need to stop the price gouging on groceries, and stop massive corporations from buying up houses and raising rent,” she wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 7, Democratic candidate Eugene Vindman expressed support for building more homes that middle-class families can purchase and “support programs that help first-time homebuyers buy a house.” He added that he’s concerned about out-of-state corporations buying homes that they then sell or rent at higher prices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Congress, I will work to take on these speculators who are putting regular people&#8217;s American dream out of reach,” he said in an email. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican candidate Derrick Anderson said he’s going to focus initially on how Congress can help reduce inflation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The first thing I’d do is pass a federal balanced budget amendment – ridiculous inflationary spending drove up housing prices (and grocery costs, gas costs, etc),” he said in an email. “Let’s stop the spending and get inflation down for the sake of Virginians who are struggling to get by.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 10, Republican Mike Clancy could not be reached for comment by the time of this publication. His campaign website doesn’t include housing policy, but it does stress his goal of helping to reduce inflation and stimulate the economy by “unleashing American innovation” and energy as well as reducing regulations on small businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Suhas Subramanyam’s campaign replied to The Mercury’s inquiry but did not follow through with his housing policy plans should he become a congressman before publication. He has supported affordability measures as a state senator: This year he </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB597" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">co-sponsored a bill </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to allow more Virginian localities to utilize Low Income Housing Tax Credits when approving developments, but it was vetoed by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 9, Democratic challenger Karen Baker supports expansion of tax credits that can help spur construction of affordable housing available to various levels of area median income. She also wants to</span><a href="https://www.bakerforva9th.com/affordable-housing" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “work on tailored solutions that address the specific needs of rural communities,”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like the Southwest Virginia ones she seeks to represent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his tenure as representative, Morgan Griffith has </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=402287" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">supported funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> appropriations to his district meant to help with affordable housing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine has cited his early-career experience as a fair housing lawyer before he went into politics. As a member of congress, he pointed to a bill he co-sponsored, the </span><a href="https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/klobuchar-kaine-introduce-legislation-to-address-nationwide-housing-shortage" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing Supply and Affordability Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would create a grant program for state and local governments to tap into. He’s also been involved with the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/2797" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low-Income First-Time Homebuyers Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would establish fixed-rate 20 year mortgages for first-time buyers whose income doesn’t exceed a certain amount. Both bills have been introduced multiple times but have yet to become law. Kaine also supports expansions to Low Income Housing Tax Credits, which helps increase affordable housing supply. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine’s opponent, Hung Cao, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/how-kamala-harris-new-policy-plan-could-impact-housing-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">echoes a stance of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump that ties housing issues to the U.S.-Mexico border</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“First and foremost, we need to secure the border,” Cao said in an email to The Mercury. “Everything that’s going wrong in our country right now is a direct result of our wide-open southern border. Housing costs are at an all-time high because there&#8217;s millions who were not here a few years ago for which we need to provide housing.” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Guns</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congress remains at a standstill as lawmakers fiercely debate the future of gun rights in America, with proponents of stricter gun control measures clashing with staunch defenders of the Second Amendment. Amid a surge in mass shootings and growing public outcry, both sides are digging in, setting the stage for what will likely be another defining battle over gun laws as the nation is headed toward the 2024 presidential election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Senate, U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., who was governor of Virginia when the deadly mass shooting at Virginia Tech took place in 2007, co-sponsored the Virginia Plan to Reduce Gun Violence, which he said would enact the same gun safety provisions passed by the Democratic-controlled Virginia General Assembly in 2020 at the federal level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hung Cao, Kaine’s Republican opponent, strictly opposes further legislation that he believes would infringe Second Amendment rights. Instead, Cao proposes that gun-related violence to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Prosecutors who refuse to enforce the law must be held accountable, the retired U.S. Navy captain said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia’s 2nd Congressional District, U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, in 2023 received a 100% rating by Gun Owners of America (GOA), a national gun rights organization, and a 92% rating by the National Rifle Association (NRA) in the previous year. While in the Virginia legislature, Kiggans has voted against universal background checks, expanding red flag laws that take guns out of the hands of domestic abusers and those who pose a threat to Virginians, and against prohibiting guns in schools and childcare centers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Missy Cotter Smasal, Kiggans’ Democratic opponent, states on her campaign website that she is committed to legislation seeking to prevent gun violence, create safer communities, and prevent veteran suicide. Smasal said that there are “commonsense measures supported by large majorities of Virginians” that can make Virginia’s neighborhoods safer while also protecting individual rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 7, Derrick Anderson, the Republican nominee, has stated that Second Amendment rights are sacred and shall not be infringed upon. As a former special forces Green Beret, Anderson vows to be “a strong advocate for gun owners in the halls of Congress.” Earlier this year, the Republican turned to the social media platform X, where </span><a href="https://x.com/DerrickforVA/status/1774127722647687559" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">he said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Americans have to “stand up for and protect our 2nd Amendment rights.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eugene Vindman, a former career military officer and the Democratic nominee, supports gun safety measures such as background checks and red flag laws to keep guns out of the hands of criminals, the mentally ill, and others who might cause harm. While he believes in the right of law-abiding gun owners to own firearms, Vindman also pushes for more legislation ensuring public safety. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, the incumbent in District 9, is a strong advocate for Second Amendment rights. Griffith said in a statement to The Mercury that he does not support government-mandated registrations of guns but that he backs harsher penalties for offenders who “abuse the right to have guns” by committing felonious crimes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Karen Baker, Griffith’s opponent and a gun owner, said she backs rigorous gun safety training for children in school. She is also pushing for enhanced gun safety laws, including tax credits for trigger locks, and she has called for enhanced mental health services for troubled individuals, and a legal mechanism to manage early reports of suspicious behaviors involving non-imminent ideation of shootings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the state in District 10, constitutional lawyer Mike Clancy, the Republican nominee, has vowed to defend Americans’ constitutional rights without exception, including the Second Amendment right to bear arms. Instead of regulating gun ownership. Clancy is pushing for legislation to fully fund law enforcement to ensure law enforcement has the training and equipment to protect Virginia’s communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his time in Virginia’s state legislature, Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, Clancy’s opponent, has actively supported several gun safety laws, including </span><a href="https://www.suhasforvirginia.com/press-and-media/key-gun-violence-prevention-bills-from-senator-subramanyam-vetoed-by-gun-lobby-backed-governor" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">several measures which passed the General Assembly just this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, two of which were signed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican. Suhas told The Mercury he believes America can achieve serious progress on this issue while respecting the Second Amendment, and without undermining the rights of responsible gun owners.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Education/Project 2025</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With divergent calls from some to eliminate the U.S. Department of Education and from others to improve teacher pay, public education is a top matter for voters in Virginia and across the nation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a Pew Research Center </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2024/04/23/what-are-americans-top-foreign-policy-priorities/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published in April, half of the Americans surveyed said that public K-12 education is going in the wrong direction. Some believe that schools should spend more time on core academic subjects. At the same time, communities, including those in Virginia, are sparring over what is taught in schools, particularly history, and gauging if students are falling behind in their studies and how to address that challenge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schools are also facing confrontation from parents over social issues, such as the types of books that are allowed in schools and the treatment of transgender students. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of these education issues and recommendations to address them are outlined in </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/04/what-could-project-2025-mean-for-education-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Project 2025</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — a conservative plan for how the country should operate if a Republican wins the White House. Some support the plan and others fear it could derail previous efforts to improve public education in Virginia.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="AKFt5DoOMp"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/04/what-could-project-2025-mean-for-education-in-virginia/">What could Project 2025 mean for education in Virginia?</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the state’s District 2 congressional race, Republican nominee and incumbent Jen Kiggans has publicly supported</span><a href="https://jenforcongress.com/issues/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> prioritizing students&#8217; safety and security</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and equipping teachers with tools and resources to improve student outcomes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She voted for the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/5" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parents Bills of Rights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a measure to “ensure the rights of parents are honored in public schools” and stands against critical race theory, a graduate-level framework that focuses on racial inequity and has not been found in Virginia curricula.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like the authors of Project 2025 and Kiggans, the Republican nominee for the District 10 seat Mike Clancy said he supports school choice. </span></p>
<p>Democratic nominee Eugene Vindman, in District 7, said he opposes book bans and the project, which he <a class="c-link" href="https://dailyprogress.com/opinion/column/eugene-vindman-project-2025-is-a-threat-to-democracy/article_709f3f3a-6a2a-11ef-927e-b310eb440bd5.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://dailyprogress.com/opinion/column/eugene-vindman-project-2025-is-a-threat-to-democracy/article_709f3f3a-6a2a-11ef-927e-b310eb440bd5.html" data-sk="tooltip_parent">sa</a>id his opponent and Republican nominee Derrick Anderson has failed to denounce.</p>
<p>Anderson said Vindman is “lying” and denied supporting the project&#8217;s proposal to eliminate the U.S. Department of <span class="c-mrkdwn__highlight">Education</span>.</p>
<p>He said he supports helping students in his home district “succeed” and will advocate for ensuring that “test scores go up and conflicts go down.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 9, Karen Baker, the democratic nominee, said she supports strengthening public schools, much like Vindman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Baker’s </span><a href="https://www.bakerforva9th.com/issues" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">campaign website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, she supports making universal preschool “a reality for all families” in Southwest Virginia. She also supports investing in vocational education and making it accessible to the area. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, the Democratic nominee in District 10, said if elected, he will work to expand Pre-K, access to “critical“ job training into apprentice programs, and support providing resources to local schools to close the pandemic, learning loss gap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He told the Mercury that if the recommendations for Project 2025 were implemented, it would “devastate” Virginia’s public education system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We must do the opposite: invest in our schools, support our parents and teachers, and make college and postgraduate education affordable,” Subramanyam’s campaign said in a statement.</span></p>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic candidates in Virginia’s congressional races largely have expressed the desire to address climate change by transitioning to zero-carbon generation sources. Some candidates differentiate themselves, like District 3 incumbent U.S. Rep. Bobby </span><a href="https://www.bobbyscottforcongress.com/the-scott-record" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who’s advocated for funding Norfolk’s flood wall to reduce sea level rise damage. District 6 contender Ken </span><a href="https://www.kenmitchellforvirginia.com/issues" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitchell</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> highlighted a need to “transition public investments away from propping up fossil fuel companies” on his campaign site, while District 11 incumbent U.S. Rep. Gerry </span><a href="https://gerryconnolly.com/issues/environment/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connolly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has said he’s an advocate for environmental justice, an environmental lens that amplifies the voices and needs of overlooked and overburdened communities during development that could impact their area. District 9 candidate Karen </span><a href="https://www.bakerforva9th.com/coal-miners" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baker </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">doesn’t address climate change on her website, but highlights a need to protect coal miners’ health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the aisle, Republican congressional candidates also mostly fall in line with each other’s environmental policy views by advocating for  </span><a href="https://www.mikeclancyforcongress.com/services-5" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reducing regulations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.hungforva.com/enviornment/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">energy independence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or promoting energy sources stemming from </span><a href="https://cline.house.gov/issues/energy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fossil fuels</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://sitkaforcongress.com/on-the-issues" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nuclear</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some candidates don’t take clear positions about their environmental policy plans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking unique approaches on the GOP side are District 2 incumbent U.S. Rep Jen Kiggans, who signed onto a letter with other House Republicans earlier this year asking for House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana to </span><a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/some-house-republicans-warn-against-climate-law-repeal/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">not repeal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tax credits of the IRA, which have helped incentivize a burgeoning offshore wind </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2024/07/09/south-korean-company-plans-to-build-681-million-offshore-wind-submarine-cable-plant-in-chesapeake/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">development</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> industry in the Hampton Roads region. U.S. Rep. Morgan </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/issues/issue/?IssueID=44643" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griffith</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the incumbent for District 9 that spans the Southwest region of the state that has been inundated with increased rainfall, acknowledges the planet’s climate is changing. District 7 candidate Derrick Anderson doesn’t offer a clear position on his website.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looming in the energy and environment realm at the federal level is a </span><a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/4793595-manchin-barrasso-energy-permitting-reform/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> seeking to reform  energy permitting, which could increase the deployment of solar and battery projects as energy- hungry data centers proliferate in the northern and central parts of the state. Some environmental groups say the bill includes some concessions for continued natural gas use. Whichever party gains majority control of Congress could determine the fate of that bill.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Election integrity</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concerns over election integrity and the potential for voter fraud have sparked a renewed focus in Congress, as lawmakers from both parties debate how best to safeguard the democratic process. With allegations of fraudulent voting making headlines in recent election cycles, the issue has become a political flashpoint. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some legislators call for stricter voting regulations to prevent potential abuse, others argue that such measures could suppress voter participation. As the 2024 election approaches, members of Congress are crafting new policies aimed at ensuring fair elections while addressing public concerns over security and accessibility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the U.S. Senate, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., has carried legislation such as the Freedom to Vote Act, which would implement provisions like automatic voter registration, same-day and Election Day voter registration, online voter registration, and no-excuse mail voting. Kaine has also co-sponsored the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which seeks to restore and update crucial protections against voting discrimination that were weakened by recent Supreme Court decisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine’s Republican opponent Hung Cao, a retired U.S. Navy captain who is backed by former President Donald Trump, has proposed few legislative means to secure the electoral process beyond a universal requirement for providing a voter ID in order to cast a ballot. But he said in a statement to The Mercury that “the only way to have election integrity is to have people watch the polls.” Cao has also suggested that the U.S. hold elections like the ones he witnessed in Iraq and Afghanistan, where people vote with their finger and blue ink. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In July, U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, who represents House District 2, voted in support of the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr8281/BILLS-118hr8281rh.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which passed in the House of Representatives by a 221-198 vote. Advocates of the SAVE Act say it would ensure that only citizens can vote in federal elections, partly by making it mandatory for states to obtain proof of citizenship to register voters and also requiring states to purge noncitizens from voter rolls. But President Joe Biden has vowed to veto the measure, stating that it would make it more difficult for eligible voters to register and increase “the risk that eligible voters are purged from voter rolls.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiggans’ Democratic challenger Missy Cotter Smasal, who previously mounted an unsuccessful campaign in Virginia’s 8th Senate District, has talked little about election integrity legislation. But the U.S. Navy veteran has attacked her Republican opponent for being  a “big supporter of President Trump” for backing “Big Lie” conspiracy theorists in Virginia’s state legislature by being one of </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/02/24/virginia-youngkin-tax-cuts-house-senate/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">only four Senators to vote for an audit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the 2020 election that would have cost Virginia taxpayers $70 million.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Derrick Anderson, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">former special forces Green Beret and the Republican nominee in District 7, has talked little publically about election integrity and he offers no clues about his views on his campaign website, but in </span><a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/government-politics/elections/derrick-anderson-talks-biden-the-border-and-inflation-ahead-of-tuesdays-gop-primary/article_a009bd2a-2837-11ef-9cbd-0f478e969dbd.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with The Daily Progress he acknowledged that Joe Biden is the legitimate president.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If elected, Anderson’s Democratic opponent Eugene Vindman, the twin brother of anti-Trump whistleblower Alexander Vindman, has vowed to work to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and strengthen protections for election workers, “so that anyone who threatens a poll volunteer or election official in an attempt to undermine our vote is held accountable.” Vindman, whose family emigrated to the United States from the former Soviet Union, has also warned against downplaying the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, which he blamed on a pro-Trump movement that did not recognize the nation’s norms of peaceful transfer of power and that he said undermines elections across the country to this day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, the incumbent in District 9, in 2023 sponsored the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/4460" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No Vote for Non-Citizens Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, seeking to ensure only eligible American citizens may participate in federal elections. The bill, which is still moving through the House, withholds some federal dollars that go to localities that allow non-citizens to vote in their elections. Griffith also voted for the SAVE Act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Karen Baker, Griffith’s opponent, told The Mercury that Republicans have failed to provide any evidence of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election and therefore there is no reason to believe that this year’s election will be different. Baker also stated that fears of undocumented immigrants voting are generated to induce distrust of election integrity but are absolutely without basis, and she has criticized Griffith for refusing to state that he will accept the outcome of the 2024 presidential election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Mike Clancy, an attorney from Loudoun County and the Republican nominee in District 10, does not list election integrity as one of his legislative priorities on his campaign website, he has been outspoken on social media about strengthening election laws. “Congress must pass the SAVE Act,” Clancy </span><a href="https://x.com/MikeClancyVA/status/1811031488923586986" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said on X</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in July. “Only U.S. citizens should be voting in our elections.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, Clancy’s opponent and a strict opponent of the SAVE Act, believes that “democracy is under attack” in America. The son of Indian immigrants, Subramanyam has vowed to continue to fight against “restrictive voter ID laws that are designed to suppress the vote, protect early voting to ensure greater access to the polls, and combat political gerrymandering.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Immigration</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Americans find that more migrants are turning to the United States for employment opportunities or to escape violent conflict in their home countries, among other reasons, they are increasingly interested in candidates&#8217; views on immigration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">America has become one of the most prominent destinations for migrants. However, over several years, many migrants have entered the country illegally, prompting backlash. At the same time, migrants have also been a staple of America’s workforce, including in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the </span><a href="https://map.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/locations/virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Immigration Council</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, immigrants comprised about 12.6% of Virginia’s total population in 2022, and 16.2% of Virginia&#8217;s labor force.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Hr7omrdD9o"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/08/convention-delegates-virginia-voters-reflect-on-immigration-policy-ahead-of-presidential-election/">Convention delegates, Virginia voters reflect on immigration policy ahead of presidential election</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the District 9 race, Republican nominee and incumbent Morgan Griffith said immigrants are welcome to come to the United States “legally” and share in the “American dream,&#8221; but supports “cracking down” on illegal immigration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While criticizing the House for ducking its responsibility, Democratic nominee Karen Baker in District 9 said Congress needs to pass comprehensive immigration reform. She said she supports the Senate&#8217;s template for more border control agents and asylum officers and advocates for a DACA bill to protect children who have lived in the U.S. their entire lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the District 2 race, Jen Kiggans’ campaign said the Republican nominee and incumbent voted for legislation to increase security at the U.S. border by ensuring that federal immigration officials have the training and resources to stop the influx of illegal immigration, drugs and crime into the U.S. The measure has remained in the Senate since last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiggans supports strict enforcement of existing federal immigration laws and holding President Joe Biden’s administration accountable. She also backed legislation to prevent the administration from using National Parks to house illegal immigrants.</span></p>
<p>Derrick Anderson, the Republican nominee for the District 7 seat, said he <a class="c-link" href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/government-politics/elections/derrick-anderson-talks-biden-the-border-and-inflation-ahead-of-tuesdays-gop-primary/article_a009bd2a-2837-11ef-9cbd-0f478e969dbd.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/government-politics/elections/derrick-anderson-talks-biden-the-border-and-inflation-ahead-of-tuesdays-gop-primary/article_a009bd2a-2837-11ef-9cbd-0f478e969dbd.html" data-sk="tooltip_parent">supports</a> shutting down the border.</p>
<p>“It’s clear that the crisis at the border is hurting people right here in Virginia’s 7th District,” Anderson said in a statement. “Drugs, fentanyl, human trafficking – we need a serious change. We need to secure the border.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, the Democratic nominee in District 10, said with the U.S. immigration system being “broken,” he supports the country taking a comprehensive approach to the problem by starting with securing the border and ensuring that people who are doing “the right things the right way and contributing to our economy“ have a path to citizenship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said the country must also fix its “broken” asylum system.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Foreign policy (Israel-Hamas conflict, China, Ukraine)</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Virginia voters are following their congressional candidates&#8217; views on common issues in the U.S., they are also considering their responses to global conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a Pew Research Center </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2024/04/23/what-are-americans-top-foreign-policy-priorities/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that was completed in April, two of the most important issues to Americans are limiting the powers of China and finding a solution to the Israel-Hamas conflict.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Americans are also interested in limiting Russia’s powers following its invasion of Ukraine in Feb. 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said he takes pride in the fact that he is among a wide slate of lawmakers President Vladimir Putin of Russia permanently banned from visiting Russia in response to his record of standing against Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine two years ago. Kaine has voted for aid to Ukraine, and earlier this year he helped pass a supplemental package that included support for the country to defend its sovereignty. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine also said he views the U.S.-China relationship as the most consequential bilateral relationship of the century. Kaine voted to pass the </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/09/fact-sheet-chips-and-science-act-will-lower-costs-create-jobs-strengthen-supply-chains-and-counter-china/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CHIPS and Science Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> designed to outcompete China by shoring up domestic supply chains and bringing manufacturing back to America. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Hamas terrorists attacked Israeli territories on Oct. 7, 2023, Kaine has worked with Democrats, Republicans, and the Biden administration to ensure that Israel has defensive support. But Kaine has also called for a reduction of civilian casualties, supported the safe and swift delivery of humanitarian assistance to civilians in Gaza and the West Bank, and for long-term solutions to allow Palestinians and Israelis to live alongside each other in peace.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine’s Republican opponent and former U.S. Navy captain Hung Cao in a statement criticized the Biden administration and Congress for giving “blanket amounts of money” towards Ukraine’s defense effort, alleging the financial support instead helps fund Ukraine’s retired workers pension plans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cao considers China an “existential threat” to the United States, and he has further called for the continued support of Israel, which he considers one of the United States’ closest allies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Jen Kiggans’ campaign, the District 2 Republican nominee and incumbent supports legislation to impose sanctions against China for its responsibility in the fentanyl crisis and </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/22/cosponsors" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prevent selling any petroleum to Chinese Communist Party-controlled entities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her campaign also said she prioritizes protecting American jobs and intellectual property from being stolen by the CCP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Derrick Anderson, the Republican nominee in District 7 and a former special forces Green Beret with six tours of duty overseas, including Afghanistan, Iraq, and various countries throughout the Middle East, told the </span><a href="https://jewishinsider.com/2024/04/virginia-congressional-candidate-derrick-anderson-military/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Jewish Insider”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in an interview in April that Congress needs to move quickly to provide additional aid to the Jewish state in its war against Hamas. He added that he was skeptical of sending more U.S. funds to the Palestinians, noting that other countries are providing aid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Anderson, his Democratic opponent Eugene Vindman, also a veteran, called for continued support for Israel, while asking that the U.S. continue to ensure that all the hostages — including Americans — are returned safe and sound to their families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman has also pushed for the continued support of Ukraine in both military and economic terms, and for taking on China&#8217;s state-directed economic system, which he said unfairly competes in the market and compromises America’s national security. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, voted for the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2022, which allowed the lending and lease of American defense material to the country in its defense of the Russian invasion, he also also voted to block similar legislation last year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griffith </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=403045" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has called</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> China a “dangerous, power-hungry actor” over the country’s territorial claims in the South China Sea, as well as its escalating efforts to control Taiwan, while </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=403086" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criticizing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> President Joe Biden’s decision to hold an arms shipment to Israel last spring. Griffith also said that America’s dealings with other countries must be driven by a careful analysis of what best serves the United States and its citizens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In relation to the conflict between Israel and Hamas, Karen Baker, Griffith’s Democratic opponent, has pointed out that while she acknowledged Israel’s right to exist, there are “bad acts on both sides.” Baker has also endorsed the continued financial and military support of Ukraine by the United States, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, the Democratic nominee in District 10, said he supports the U.S. in opposing Russia leader Vladimir Putin&#8217;s territorial ambitions in Europe and standing up to China, which is “violating international law and illegally dumping goods to prop up their economy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also supports the CHIPS Act, which helped to boost domestic research and manufacturing of semiconductor chips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the Israel-Hamas war, Subramanyam said he supports the U.S. returning hostages, especially  American citizens, and helping to rebuild communities affected by the war.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also supports a two-state solution, adding that Hamas cannot be one of the states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The human lives lost in this conflict have been devastating for all sides,” Subramanyam said in a statement. “I have visited the region, including the areas of Israel that were attacked, and made good friends there. I want to see an end to the war and a long-term path to peace.”</span></p>

A shortage of new homes is driving continued high housing costs, casting doubt on Virginia's future growth. (Parker Michels-Boyce/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Democratic lawmakers praised Vice President Kamala Harris’ housing policy plans in a virtual call Wednesday afternoon. The gathering came on the heels of a new </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHgmtsNxT8c" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">campaign ad</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> highlighting Harris’ plan to build three million new homes and rental units if elected president. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan is part of a proposal she unveiled ahead of the Democratic National Convention, which includes providing $</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/16/harris-unveils-plan-to-curb-price-gouging-boost-child-tax-credit-tackle-rent-hikes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">25,000 in down payment assistance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for some first-time homebuyers and tax incentives for builders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2021 Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt559-1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that most Virginains affected by affordable housing issues are  renters. It also found that a declining number of Virginians can afford to purchase a home, while the state has an estimated shortage of at least 200,000 affordable rental units. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep. Don Beyer, D-Alexandria, said that Harris’ plans will help local governments handle affordable housing issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She can do this by deploying tax incentives to build starter homes to alleviate the shortage of houses on the market for aspiring homeowners,” Beyer said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He pointed to Harris’ support of increasing </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3238" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">low income housing tax credits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that local governments could utilize for construction of new homes and apartments. These tax breaks to developers help incentivize development of homes to various percentages of area median income. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/bill-to-boost-affordable-housing-advances-to-youngkin/article_33e7b884-dd8e-11ee-96af-a7e0399a77a3.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">many localities in Virginia lack the authority to utilize LIHTC credits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when negotiating developments and redevelopments with companies and a bill that would have expanded those abilities was </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb597" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this year by the governor. This is where state and federal levels of government can be helpful to local governments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alexandria councilman John Chapman stressed how increasing affordable housing options is “not a hyper-local issue.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to hear that at the state level, and we love to hear that at the federal level, that there’s a need for supply, and there are also going to be some additional tools,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing is a personal issue for him, Chapman said, as someone benefiting from living in the home that his mother was able to purchase, in part, from down payment assistance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know personally of the effect of the generational wealth that has passed along from family to family,” Chapman said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of Harris’ policy platforms will hinge on who controls the U.S. House and Senate next year if she is elected. In Virginia, Sen. Tim Kaine is running for re-election and all 11 congressional seats are in play.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyer said that he thinks the fact that both Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, have previously served in Congress can bode well for them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said that he thinks both candidates “struck a bipartisan and post-partisan tone in the convention.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bolstering housing supply is also something former president Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, wants to address if re-elected. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump&#8217;s </span><a href="https://rncplatform.donaldjtrump.com/?_gl=1*q92itj*_gcl_aw*R0NMLjE3MjQ4NTUyNDMuQ2p3S0NBandsYnUyQmhBM0Vpd0EzeVh5dXlZZkRuWFJsLWc0MUZVNGpZYm1lVHl5bDY1bnAtMmJ3UldUWDk3cEdOOTYwUGpVMExpb1d4b0NyRWdRQXZEX0J3RQ..*_gcl_au*MTEyODczNjg3NS4xNzI0ODU1MjQz&amp;_ga=2.204398551.651488926.1724855243-1160544380.1724855243&amp;_gac=1.22146377.1724855243.CjwKCAjwlbu2BhA3EiwA3yXyuyYfDnXRl-g41FU4jYbmeTyyl65np-2bwRWTX97pGN960PjU0LioWxoCrEgQAvD_BwE" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">housing plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> include opening portions of federal lands to allow for new home construction while addressing inflation overall, as well as building on previous efforts to r</span><a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-establishing-white-house-council-eliminating-regulatory-barriers-affordable-housing/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">educe regulatory barriers to construction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

While limited legal immigrants qualify for </span><a href="https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R46462.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">federal housing assistance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, undocumented people could lose their anonymity if they tried to purchase a home or lease an apartment. </span></p>
<p>Jeff Ryer, a spokesman for the Trump campaign in Virginia said that &#8220;Trump will defeat inflation, lower mortgage rates and make homeownership an achievable dream again for Virginia families.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the in-person help, the </span><a href="https://www.evictiondefensecenter.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eviction Defense Center website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also has resources that anyone around Virginia can access. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tools include understanding the </span><a href="https://www.evictiondefensecenter.org/steps-eviction-process" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">steps involved in an eviction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a </span><a href="https://www.evictiondefensecenter.org/tenant-legal-rights/glossary" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">glossary of legal terms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> typically used in housing cases, and </span><a href="https://www.evictiondefensecenter.org/tenant-legal-rights/reading-your-documents-and-notices" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">explainers on the types of documents</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tenants may receive if they are facing an eviction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The resources can help people understand the situation they find themselves in, and could also help tenants identify if they have a solid defense against their eviction, said VPLC lawyer Phil Storey. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Residents can double-check if their landlord has taken all the correct steps to proceed with the eviction in the first place. And if not, then the tenant can explain their case to a judge should the eviction proceed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes, residents will be armed with enough knowledge of the process and their rights to plead their case in court, Storey said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But when someone needs an actual lawyer to represent them, the Defense Center also has a search </span><a href="https://www.evictiondefensecenter.org/find-legal-aid" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">feature to connect</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> people with legal aid centers around Virginia that can help. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond has </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/local/richmond/2024/08/21/richmonds-eviction-filing-rate-remains-second-highest-in-us?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioslocal_richmond&amp;stream=top" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">held the No. 2 spot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the highest eviction filing rate among major cities for nearly a decade. According to an RVA Eviction Lab report through Virginia Commonwealth University, </span><a href="https://rampages.us/rvaevictionlab/wp-content/uploads/sites/33937/2021/11/Eviction-Legal-Counsel-and-the-Courthouse-1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">40% of evictions in the city last less than 60 seconds in court</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VPLC hasn’t done a lot of promotion on the walk-in events yet, but “we want to get it out there for folks to be able to use,” Storey said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program could be scalable and a long-term goal is to see about setting it up in other Virginia localities that have high eviction rates. Storey expects his organization will more heavily promote the website and pop-up events in the months ahead and will have coordinated with local libraries in other areas about partnerships by then as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We also provided a manual for librarians to be able to help people use this tool as well,” Storey said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city of Richmond is also expected to spearhead a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/19/could-this-right-to-counsel-program-for-evictions-become-a-statewide-model/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">right-to-counsel pilot program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> next year. With $500,000 earmarked in the latest city budget, the program is not yet off the ground. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, some state lawmakers have hoped to help find ways to resolve things without needing to go to court. Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, carried legislation to extend a waiting period for landlords to serve eviction notices from five to 14 days. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In current law, </span><a href="https://www.evictiondefensecenter.org/steps-eviction-process" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tenants usually have five days to respond to their notice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — putting them at about 10 days after missed payments before the next phase of the eviction process may occur. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price’s </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB598" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> passed Virginia’s legislature this year before it was </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+amd+HB598AG" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Gov. Glenn Youngkin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, Youngkin said he considered the bill “unnecessary” because current law allows tenants a right to pay amounts due before a court date. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Annika Schunn, a paralegal with VPLC explained that delaying eviction proceedings under Price’s two-week proposal could help prevent a court process altogether in some cases. This is because </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/ces/publications/length-pay-period.htm#:~:text=In%20February%202023%2C%20biweekly%20was,establishments%20paying%20employees%20each%20week." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">43% of employers pay every two weeks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since VPLC launched their drop-in times at public libraries this summer, more tenants have dropped by earlier in the month, closer to when they’d have received their eviction notices, Schunn said. </span></p>

<p>That includes $100 million in funding for a program to incentivize affordable housing production and streamlining loan application processes to expedite building more housing.</p>
<p>Some of those proposals — such as a cap on rent increases from corporate landlords — call for Congressional action, while others are rules and grants that can be done without legislative approval. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development will also be finalizing a rule to allow different kinds of housing, such as duplexes and triplexes, to be built under the agency’s manufacturing and safety standards.</p>
<p>The Biden administration and the Harris campaign are making their housing policy case to the American people as Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump compete for voters’ trust on economic issues. An August Financial Times/Michigan Ross poll<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/11/harris-trump-biden-economy-poll-election.html" target="_blank"> shows</a> that Harris is slightly ahead of Trump when it comes to who voters trust more on the economy, by one percentage point. Although that is a very small advantage, it is a change from July, when 35% of voters approved of President Joe Biden’s job on the economy compared to 41% for Trump.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Plans would cut red tape, but housing stock is still low</h4>

	
<p>The administration’s plans to address supply and soaring prices also include repurposing federal land in Nevada and <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/07/16/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-major-new-actions-to-lower-housing-costs-by-limiting-rent-increases-and-building-more-homes/" target="_blank">a cap on rent increases</a> from corporate landlords, which would require Congressional action. Housing and homelessness experts say many of these changes are positive, particularly zoning changes, while others argue that a few of these actions are insufficient for the crisis at hand.</p>
<p>On Friday, Vice President Kamala Harris <a href="https://nevadacurrent.com/2024/08/16/harris-unveils-plan-to-curb-price-gouging-boost-child-tax-credit-tackle-rent-hikes/" target="_blank">announced</a> her plans for boosting housing affordability if she wins the presidency. Harris’ plans are similar to some of the Biden administration’s approaches to housing policy, with an emphasis on stopping corporate landlords from driving up rents and knocking down local zoning barriers to building affordable housing. She also announced a policy to provide up to $25,000 in payment assistance for first-time homebuyers on the condition that they paid rent on time for two years.</p>
<p>“We will take down barriers and cut red tape, including at the state and local levels, and by the end of my first term, we will end America’s housing shortage by building 3 million new homes and rentals that are affordable for the middle class,” Harris said at a campaign event in Raleigh, North Carolina on Friday.</p>
<p>Indivar Dutta-Gupta,who focuses on policy research and seminars at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy, applauded developments to make it easier and less costly to build affordable housing through the Pathways to Removing Obstacles to Housing program, which provides funding for communities getting rid of barriers <a href="https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/comm_planning/pro_housing" target="_blank">such as</a> “outdated” zoning policies and a “lack of neighborhood amenities.”</p>
<p>“It’s very difficult for a builder to just kind of copy and paste their plans from one community to another. Secondly, we’re not just talking about requirements for special permitting and land use that are tedious,” he said. “They’re time consuming and that dramatically increases the cost of housing, so if you can knock down a process that takes 12 months to six months, that can make a big difference for housing affordability.”</p>
<p>Kenneth Chilton, professor at the department of public administration at Tennessee State University, said there are certainly homes being built — just not enough affordable ones between $100,000 and $300,000 in the area he lives in Nashville. Wages have also not caught up to those prices, he added.</p>
<p>“The market has catered to the more affluent households, so there are new houses being built, but they’re million dollar-plus houses for people who can afford or are willing to put themselves in a financial burden to afford a million dollar house,” he said. “… It’s becoming harder and harder to afford the discretionary income needed to save up for down payment.”</p>
<p>The Biden administration and Congress has also focused more on corporate landlords of late, who are influencing the housing market. Dutta-Gupta and Chilton said that even in situations where they make up a smaller percentage of landlords, their practices influence other landlords and drive up rents. Chilton, who has studied how firms that can quickly snatch up all kinds of properties can influence regional housing markets, said it’s hard for the average homeowner to compete.</p>
<p>“You have a lot more corporations and investors who are buying up housing,” he said. “Some of those are institutional, but there’s been recent reports that even smaller local landlords are kind of adopting the same business practices of one-year leases with built-in cost of living adjustments. They’re operating like corporate landlords.”</p>
<p>He said that none of the Biden administration proposals he saw accounted for potential homebuyers, who have to apply for loans, failing to compete with groups and investors making all-cash purchases without inspections. Democratic lawmakers have <a href="https://fox59.com/news/national-world/corporations-want-you-to-rent-not-own-can-lawmakers-stop-them/" target="_blank">introduced legislation</a> in Congress to limit corporate landlords’ power, but it has not passed.</p>
<p>Dutta-Gupta said the Biden administration’s recent efforts are putting “meaningful dollar amounts” into the quest for affordable housing through grant opportunities, even though they are probably below the demand. He said he’s also heartened to see that the U.S. Department of Transportation is making sure its discretionary infrastructure grants give preference to communities with more “pro-housing policies,” to give localities more incentives to favor affordable housing. But he said the administration has to make sure it effectively communicates this through outreach.</p>
<p>“There’s going to have to be a meaningful effort to explain to the communities that there’s a new preference and this is how those communities can potentially fall into that category of the preference,” he said. “You don’t want to just let them know there’s a preference and then no change in behavior happens.”</p>
<p>Although Trump has talked about <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fact-checking-donald-trumps-new-jersey-press-conference/story?id=112877566" target="_blank">mortgage rates</a> during his campaign, he hasn’t provided a lot of detail on housing policies. The Federal Reserve’s federal funds rate has an influence on mortgage rates and Trump has <a href="https://www.ualrpublicradio.org/npr-news/2024-08-18/should-a-president-have-total-control-over-the-fed-harris-and-trump-disagree" target="_blank">said</a> the president should “have at least a say” in Fed policy. The Republican Party’s 2024 <a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/2024-republican-party-platform" target="_blank">platform</a> also includes a section on housing affordability, which mentions tax incentives to “promote homeownership,” allowing for new home construction on some federal lands, and reducing regulations that “raise housing costs.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The challenge of keeping people housed</h4>

	
<p>Given the challenges to building the supply of more affordable housing, the National Alliance to End Homelessness would like to see broader policy approaches to prevent more people from becoming homeless. Homelessness reached a record high in 2023.</p>
<p>Although the Biden administration has taken steps to expand housing access for groups particularly vulnerable to homelessness, such as veterans and survivors of intimate partner violence, Steve Berg, chief policy officer at the National Alliance to End Homelessness, would like to see more of a universal approach, such as housing vouchers that meet the scale of the need. He said targeted emergency rental assistance combined with eviction moratoriums in places where homelessness is particularly high and rising quickly would also be effective at reaching the people who need it most.</p>
<p>“The eviction moratorium combined with subsidies for landlords to help when people got behind on their rent were very effective interventions,” Berg said of earlier pandemic policies to keep people housed.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Why political leaders are focused on housing</h4>

	
<p>The Federal Reserve has signaled it is close to cutting key interest rates as inflation has slowed and the housing market has begun <a href="https://missouriindependent.com/briefs/u-s-home-prices-hit-a-record-high-as-sales-fell-heres-how-housing-experts-explain-the-trends/" target="_blank">to cool</a> in response to high mortgage rates. The Fed started to raise interest rates in 2022 and hiked them 11 times until late 2023, putting pressure on the housing market during a time of high demand for housing and a shortage of affordable homes.</p>
<p>In May, U.S. rent growth was <a href="https://www.corelogic.com/intelligence/blogs/us-single-family-rent-index-july-2024/" target="_blank">up 3.2%</a> from a year ago, which was the biggest gain there has been in more than a year, according to CoreLogic’s single family rent data. A lack of housing affordability is also closely tied to homelessness. From 2019 to 2023, the number of people who had to go to emergency shelters for the first time rose more than <a href="https://endhomelessness.org/homelessness-in-america/homelessness-statistics/state-of-homelessness/" target="_blank">23%</a>, a 2024 report from the National Alliance to End Homelessness shows.</p>
<p>“The Federal Reserve primarily slows the economy by making construction of residential housing, and generally taking out loans, more costly. People are certainly experiencing the higher cost of housing right now due to the higher interest rates, so the timing [of the policies] may be fortuitous,” Dutta-Gupta said.</p>

Charlotte Rene Woods / Virginia Mercury</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the sense of what makes a place a home can be strong, Jana Hobbs knows how fragile the ability to remain in a home can be. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From a transient childhood to a portion of her younger adulthood spent unhoused and on drugs, to coping with mental health issues, Hobbs has had to overcome obstacles to create the sense of home she has now with her longtime partner, their grandson and puppy in an apartment on Richmond’s North Side. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hobbs says she and her neighbors could be one medical emergency, family crisis or lapse in employment away from being at risk of losing their housing. It’s part of why she’s “fired up” about ways local and state governments can help people and has started getting involved with the advocacy group New Virginia Majority. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She applauds the city for tucking $500,000 into its latest budget for </span><a href="https://www.rva.gov/sites/default/files/2024-06/FY%202025%20Adopted%20Annual%20Fiscal%20Plan%20-%20Web%20Version%20V1_3.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a right-to-counsel (RTC) pilot program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — which would provide a lawyer for a tenant facing eviction if they could not afford one — and she hopes it can become permanent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There&#8217;s a right to counsel for criminal proceedings, so why shouldn’t we have it for civil cases?” she asked. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond council member Andreas Addison proposed the program after sitting in on fast-paced eviction cases in Richmond.  According to an</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> RVA Eviction Lab report through Virginia Commonwealth University, </span><a href="https://rampages.us/rvaevictionlab/wp-content/uploads/sites/33937/2021/11/Eviction-Legal-Counsel-and-the-Courthouse-1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">40% of evictions in the city last less than 60 seconds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in court and Richmond&#8217;s <a href="https://news.vcu.edu/article/2023/03/rva-eviction-lab-shines-a-spotlight-on-virginias-high-eviction-rate#:~:text=The%20lab's%20research%20shows%20that,second%2Dhighest%20in%20the%20nation." target="_blank">eviction rate</a> is the second highest in the nation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you see a posting of an eviction notice on your door, you&#8217;re given pretty much two options — either pay what&#8217;s owed or leave,” Addison said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But he thinks the “third option” — connecting with legal counsel — could help resolve matters out of court, or at least ensure residents going through court are represented by professionals with deeper understandings of the law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, Addison said that he saw someone he’d known from high school while watching evictions in court. She had set up a separate savings account specifically for her rent payments, which she’d been withholding over maintenance issues. Addison said she’d presented the judge with receipts of correspondence about fixing her apartment to “take her landlord to task” on the matter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was like, ‘wow, why is this the way to resolve that problem?’” he said. “My former classmate had read up on what to do and how to handle things, but that’s not what everyone can do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hobbs concurs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re not lawyers,” she said of some renters. “People aren’t always going to be able to represent themselves.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With legal counsel, Addison believes residents can also become more aware of existing city resources they can tap into like utility bill assistance, or be able to resolve missed payments with their landlords outside of court. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unfortunately there are many people in our city that are living paycheck to paycheck,” Addison said. “We need to understand, you know, what&#8217;s really going on.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Funding earmarked for next year</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond&#8217;s program can be a testing ground for applying in other Virginia localities or exploring a statewide program. John Pollock from the National Coalition for Right to Counsel worked with Addison on Richmond’s pilot. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The pilot does not create a right itself,” Pollock said. “What it will do is expand representation with the hopes of gathering data on how impactful that representation is, which would then allow for a push for an actual right.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, the city will need to set up the program and funding is earmarked for next year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokesperson for Richmond’s mayor said that the city would tap a yet-to-be-determined nonprofit organization that could provide the legal counsel rather than hiring or reallocating lawyers in city hall. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s not going to be in-house,” the spokesperson said. “We’re supporting a nonprofit that’s going to provide these services.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar work has already been tested nearby. Equal Justice Works, a Washington D.C.-based nonprofit, partnered with local nonprofits where 7 in 10 cases saw success for tenants, according to a </span><a href="https://www.equaljusticeworks.org/news/an-evaluation-of-the-housing-justice-program-and-its-achievements/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2022 report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Richmond’s city-sponsored RTC pilot will be new, 17 localities nationwide have adopted right to counsel for tenants facing eviction, including Cleveland, Ohio; Baltimore, Maryland; and Louisville, Kentucky. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In New York City, which launched the first program six years ago, </span><a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/hra/downloads/pdf/services/civiljustice/OCJ_UA_Annual_Report_2023.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">84% of households represented in court were able to remain in their homes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Now, a bill is pending in New York’s legislature to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S2721" target="_blank">take the program statewide</a> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">by creating the Office of Civil Representation in New York, responsible for sorting out the staffing of lawyers. Sen. Rachel May, the bill’s patron, says there’s no guarantee it will pass.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A bill will kind of pioneer in New York City, and then when we try to move it to the whole state, it can be harder,” May said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, Del. Mike Jones, D-Richmond, said the state’s appropriations committee would have to examine the fiscal impact if the legislature were to pursue some form of statewide RTC program. Jones was previously a member of Richmond’s city council. As Richmond’s own pilot gets off the ground, it can be something for state lawmakers to observe, he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hobbs is curious to see how the pilot plays out and housing policy is top of mind amid Richmond’s city council and mayoral elections this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, Addison said that making sure there is public outreach about the pilot once it’s up and running in Richmond will be crucial. Though he’d hoped for more funding initially, he’s eager to see how things go. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, he said, “I think this is a good step in the right direction.”</span></p>

(J.D. Pooley/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we age, we face a myriad of new challenges. For a growing sector of older Americans, housing instability and homelessness is a daunting challenge they must now navigate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reality across Virginia – and the nation – is that the number of seniors experiencing homelessness is on the rise. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, </span><a href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/ahar/2023-ahar-part-1-pit-estimates-of-homelessness-in-the-us.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Point in Time homelessness counts from the summer of 2023, the most recent statewide data, found that more than 1,500 adults who are over 55 experience homelessness in the commonwealth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New data from some of the state’s most populous regions underscore the rise in seniors facing homelessness. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The largest share of single adults experiencing homelessness in the metropolitan D.C. area, including Northern Virginia, was above the age of 65, according to information from that region’s 2024 Point in Time count. In Fairfax County specifically, there was a 6.5% increase in people over 55 experiencing homelessness.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2024 Point in Time count in Hampton Roads found that 27% of people experiencing homelessness in that region were 55 or older. </span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="P3GdC6l3z9"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/26/newest-anti-homeless-project-builds-on-strong-efforts-statewide/">Newest anti-homelessness project builds on strong efforts statewide</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Newest anti-homelessness project builds on strong efforts statewide&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/26/newest-anti-homeless-project-builds-on-strong-efforts-statewide/embed/#?secret=d621DS7a0o#?secret=P3GdC6l3z9" data-secret="P3GdC6l3z9" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Richmond region, data from local Point in Time counts show that the number of adults 55 and older who are served by regional homeless service providers increased from 29% in 2018 to 40% in 2024. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These trend lines are all moving in the same direction and accelerating, which should create a shared  sense of urgency to address the growing number of older adults experiencing homelessness. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, agencies focused on older adults and homeless services organizations that serve seniors have a deep understanding of the needs of older adults and the solutions to meet those needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Older adults face unique challenges, including a greater need for medical care, mobility issues, transportation needs, and higher rates of disability than other groups. Additionally, older adults are less likely to work or generate income. They’re often on a fixed income, so as prices for housing and food rise, they may be less able to adapt as quickly as the market changes and are therefore more likely to face financial hardships or to be pushed into poverty and homelessness. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partnerships between homeless service providers and agencies focused on older adults have proven highly effective to ensure that existing resources are aligned to best support the needs of older adults. As part of these partnerships, groups work closely to share best practices and connect seniors to resources. For example, emergency shelters are adapting to provide more accessible space and deepen partnerships with healthcare providers to offer additional services for seniors in shelters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homeless service providers are also working with area agencies on aging in Virginia, like Senior Connections, to partner with Medicaid to meet the supportive and healthcare needs of seniors experiencing homelessness. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although we maximize the resources we have, the reality remains that those resources are not enough. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are three tangible ways that all Virginians can help and support older adults experiencing homelessness: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, you can create care kits for older adults. Distributed at emergency shelters and elsewhere, these care kits provide some basic necessities, including soap, toothpaste and toothbrush and deodorant. For older adults, add lotions and wipes. You can contact local shelters in your region about creating and donating care kits.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Second, you could support emergency shelters with donations or by volunteering so that shelter staff can focus on working with seniors by helping them connect to resources and find stable, safe homes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Third, Virginians can advocate at the General Assembly and within their locality for more  affordable housing that includes universal design, which ensures accessibility and makes it easier for someone to age in place. Ultimately, we need more homes that all seniors can live in and afford. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All our neighbors should be able to age with dignity and respect. It’s critical that we support older adults facing homelessness and work to prevent homelessness in the first place. </span></p>

Mobile home residents face few protections in the face of a booming housing market that can make trailer park land attractive to developers. (Project: HOMES)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manufactured homes, mobile homes, trailers — whatever they’re referred to as, this type of housing has offered tenants an affordable option to become homeowners. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But they haven’t offered as much stability. That’s where Virginia lawmakers have passed some laws to help neighbors around the state have a little more peace of mind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, should a mobile home park be sold for redevelopment, a new law will require some financial assistance to help residents relocate and another new law strengthens protections for residents’ leases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mobile-home-specific proposals are among a suite of housing laws that will take effect next month — ranging from rental protections, extensions of pilot programs and the establishment of workgroups to study potential future laws. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘A misnomer to call them mobile’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From loopholes in renter protections to the ease of displacement by the selling of parks, mobile home owners don’t always have the long-term residency in an area that being a typical homeowner may yield. Many states typically </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/04/15/sitting-on-a-time-bomb-mobile-home-residents-at-risk-in-red-hot-housing-market/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">don’t have laws specifically for mobile home residents</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but Virginia has had some targeted legislation in recent years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s the several mobile home parks in his district that Del. Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax, had in mind when he carried a bill to require park owners to provide $5,000 to cover relocation costs when they sell their park for redevelopment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2024, it can </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/home-improvement/moving-services/cost-to-move-mobile-home/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cost between $5,000 and $15,000 to move a mobile home</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> depending on the size and distance traveled. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can be even costlier for longer-standing homes that may be more fragile to move. Krizek said some residents in his district have told him their estimates are closer to the $10,000 and $12,000 range.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s really a misnomer to call them mobile,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tram Nguyen with New Virginia Majority also noted the challenges of moving mobile homes as well. Additionally, cost of living is higher in Northern Virginia where several existing mobile home parks represent dwindling affordable housing options. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I feel like this General Assembly was a bit of a mixed bag,” Nguyen said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Krizek can attest to that. His bill originally included other protections such as extending the notice period for potential sales and granted local governments a first right of refusal to potentially purchase parks. Between moving through committees and chambers and earning Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s signature, the bill lost other components but retained the relocation expenses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Krizek would rather preserve existing mobile home parks, he hopes that his bill can help people when that’s not possible due to park sales. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s where he points to a $5 million dollar increase in the state budget toward the Manufactured Home Revolving Loan Fund — which helps nonprofit organizations and resident associations purchase parks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His wasn’t the only bill specifically catered to mobile home residents.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield, and Del. Karrie Delaney, D-Fairfax, made Improvements to the </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodepopularnames/manufactured-home-lot-rental-act/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manufactured Home Lot Rental Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that increased protections such as granting a “right of redemption” to tenants who may face eviction for unpaid rent. The </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title55.1/chapter12/section55.1-1245/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">forthcoming law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> clarifies the reasons a person can be evicted, to include unpaid rent, and outlines the process both parties can follow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you own the home, but you rent the dirt, that is where (this law) applies to you,” said Daniel Rezai, a lawyer with the Virginia Poverty Law Center. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another component of the bill concerns rights for lease renewals. The law gives the same protections that renters of apartments or other homes have. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We made sure that we&#8217;re providing the same kind of protections to tenants in these communities as we do to other residential rental properties,” Hashmi said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, tenants won’t have to worry about automatic renewals of leases if they don’t want them — resulting in potentially breaking a lease and the charges associated with that — should they inform park owners that they wish to leave. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Other new laws</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A handful of other housing laws will take effect next month covering other types of residencies or situations residents can find themselves in. </span></p>
<p><b>House Bill 73 </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">— This will require courts to automatically expunge eviction records for cases that have been dismissed after 30 days.</span></p>
<p><b>House Bill 764</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — This bill will give domestic violence or sexual abuse victims the right to terminate a lease agreement early should they have a permanent protective order and need to move residences for their safety. </span></p>
<p><b>House Bill 86 </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">— This bill mandates that during eviction cases, landlords notify tenants of any increases to any money that is requested. </span></p>
<p><b>House Bill 477 and Senate Bill 50</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – These bills extend Virginia’s eviction diversion pilot program for another year. </span></p>
<p><b>House Bill 368 and Senate Bill 538</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — These increase the maximum fine that localities can impose on repeated violations of the Uniform Statewide Building Code. </span></p>
<p><b>House Bill 1203</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — This bill increases tax credit amounts available to landlords who rent to Housing Choice Voucher holders. There is also an earmark for use in rural regions of Virginia. </span></p>
<p><b>House Bill 478</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Senate Bill 49 — These allow localities to set up Community Revitalization Funds, which can be used to prevent neighborhood deterioration, such as revamping blighted structures for continued use. </span></p>
<p><b>Senate Bill 489</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — This bill establishes a workgroup that can analyze the possibility and options for creating a Virginia Residential Development Infrastructure fund. </span></p>
<p><b>House Bill 368 and Senate Bill 195 </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">— These bills establish an advisory group to explore changes to Virginia’s Uniform Statewide Building Code. The specific goal concerns permitting the use of single-exit stairways in multi-family residential buildings that are under six stories tall. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Future goals</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though several bills were able to pass during this year’s legislative session and are soon to become law, housing advocates and lawmakers stress there is still more work to do. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the Virginia Housing Alliance, some key priorities failed to gain traction this year and they hope to see the proposals resurface with better luck next year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield, and Hashmi plan to try again on their proposal dubbed “5,000 Families.” Despite their proposal, it did not make it into the final budget. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“5000 Families was really trying to create a pool of funds so that if a family with school-aged kids came into a housing crisis during the school year they can access those funds to keep their housing stable and stay in the same school,” Coyner explained. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She explained that she hopes to continue drawing the connections between how stable housing can affect children’s ability to excel in school. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is not just a housing intervention, but this is a really important education intervention,” added Isabel McLain, VHA’s policy director. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While an earlier version of Krizek’s mobile home bill had included a first right-of-refusal component when it comes to mobile home parks up for sale, a<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB1398#:~:text=SUMMARY%20AS%20PASSED%20HOUSE%3A%20(all%20summaries)&amp;text=The%20bill%20authorizes%20localities%20to,not%20less%20than%2015%20years." target="_blank"> bill</a> from Del. Elizabeth Bennett-Parker, D-Alexandria, would have allowed localities to apply this concept to preserve subsidized housing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The failed legislation would have required property owners to give localities a chance to match offers to buy certain multifamily rental buildings that might be aging out of affordable housing designations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically, these sorts of properties were developed with the use of low-income housing tax credits, which expire after a set number of years. (Another <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB597" target="_blank">bill</a> from Sen. Jeremy McPike, D-Prince William, would have also allowed all Virginia localities to take advantage of these credits if they wished to do so when approving developments). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We see it as a way to extend our public investments in affordable housing,” McLain said. “We’ve put a lot of state and federal taxpayer dollars into affordable housing and we don’t want those investments to just come to an end.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An African-American woman’s quest to buy a pricey condo near the Virginia Beach Oceanfront – impeded by the white homeowner’s refusal because of her race – is just the latest example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bias Raven Baxter faced, detailed in a recent article in</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/31/realestate/race-home-buying-raven-baxter.html?searchResultPosition=1" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York Times</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, was only unusual in this way:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jane Walker, 84, candidly told her agent why she didn’t want Baxter, a molecular biologist and</span><a href="https://x.com/ravenscimaven/status/1791680744055595443" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">social media maven</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a quarter-million online followers, to buy the condo. Housing rights officials say discriminatory homeowners and landlords frequently use subtle methods or mask the real reasons why they don’t want people to move in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Virginia Beach transaction, however, the unspoken part was said out loud: Walker didn’t want to sell to a Black person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The incident got tons of publicity because Baxter </span><a href="https://x.com/ravenscimaven/status/1796521068024447244" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote about it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on X (formerly Twitter), where she has more than 165,000 followers. She also has her own website,</span><a href="https://thesciencemaven.com/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Raven the Science Maven</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think that because we’ve come so far in history, we think that things can’t happen anymore,” Baxter, 30, told me this week. “And we forget racism isn’t something that we just leave in the past. It’s something that can pop up at any time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed. Progress isn’t always linear. We often move forward in fits and starts. Or even fall backward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, unless you’re the person directly affected by such bias, it’s very easy to dismiss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baxter seems somewhat taken aback by all that’s happened since she went public with her housing story. “I’ve kind of been overwhelmed [by] how deep of an issue this is,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She declined to answer some of my questions, including whether she’ll still buy the condo. However, an official with 757 Realty, the company assisting her, told me the closing is scheduled in August.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baxter also has filed discrimination claims with the Virginia Fair Housing Office and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, The Times reported.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baxter was born and raised in Buffalo. She works remotely for a New York City hospital and lives in Northern Virginia with her partner, Ronald Gamble Jr., 35, a theoretical astrophysicist. Baxter wanted to own property outright, and Gamble encouraged her to find a house near the beach, a longtime dream of hers, The Times said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She viewed the Virginia Beach condo online and liked what she saw. It has three bedrooms, three bathrooms, and a marble fireplace. It’s a stone’s throw from a country club golf course, and it’s a quick walk to the beach and Atlantic Ocean.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baxter contacted a listing agent, did a virtual tour and agreed to the $749,000 asking price. She made a down payment. She and Gamble saw the condo in person May 17. That’s the same day when the owner’s agent, Susan Pender of Berkshire Hathaway RW Towne Realty, introduced them to Walker, the seller.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">757 Realty provided me a chronology of events. That narrative said shortly after Baxter and Gamble left the condo May 17, Walker told her agent – Pender – that she didn’t want to sell to Baxter because of her race. Pender relayed that information to the folks at 757 Realty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One disagreement between buyer and seller was a decades-old air-conditioning system that needed to be upgraded. It’s unclear if that affected the seller’s attitude and demeanor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neither Pender nor her boss returned my messages. No one answered when I rang the doorbell at that condo this week, which is on the</span><a href="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/virginia-beach-departments-docs/planning/Boards-Commissions/Historic-Preservation-Commission/Historical-Register-List_2021.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Beach Historical Register</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s telling, however, that none of the principals denied the biased statement occurred.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discrimination in housing in the United States is illegal for home sellers and their real estate agents under the Fair Housing Act of 1968 and the Civil Rights Act of 1866. Yet racial bias remains an issue, along with discrimination based on skin color, national origin, religion, disability and other protected classes covered by federal law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve had other complaints of direct use of racial slurs,” Brenda Castañeda, deputy director for advocacy for </span><a href="https://homeofva.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HOME of Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, told me. “I haven’t seen one this blatant or open.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her nonprofit organization assists residents who believe they have faced housing discrimination. It also sends in testers of different races to check if people are being given the same information, or whether some folks are steered elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baxter’s story is similar to the claims </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/realestate/wendell-pierce-harlem-apartment-racism.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">of actor Wendell Pierce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who says his rental application for a Harlem apartment was rejected by a white landlord. “Racism and bigots are real,” </span><a href="https://x.com/WendellPierce/status/1797805253787611141" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">he said on X this week.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “There are those who will do anything to destroy life’s journey for Black folks.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Fair Housing Alliance said in its most recent report covering specific trends that</span><a href="https://nationalfairhousing.org/resource/2023-fair-housing-trends-report/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 33,000 fair housing complaints were recorded in 2022</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the most in a single year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tally might only be a fraction of the actual total, the Washington-based coalition said, because “most incidents of housing discrimination go undetected or unreported.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The organization continued: “Housing providers may lie about the availability of housing units or the monthly rent for apartments, steering Blacks, Latinos, Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders, and Native Americans to rent or buy homes only in neighborhoods of color.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another problem is the disparate treatment appraisers dole out as property owners place their homes on the market. I’ve written before about how African-American home sellers are often given lower appraisals, only to</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/08/23/blacks-others-shouldnt-have-to-obliterate-their-presence-to-receive-fair-home-value/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">receive more expensive ones</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when they obliterate any hint a Black family lives there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Robertson IV, spokesman for the Virginia Department of Professional and Occupational Regulation, told me the state’s Fair Housing Office has received 318 complaints this fiscal year, which ends June 30. Nearly 25% were race-based.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most penalties for breaking the law, though, are civil ones, Castañeda said. Rarely does anyone face jail time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That should change. Without the threat of going behind bars, there’s little to compel racist property owners to do the right thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The whole situation has been a whirlwind for Baxter, who thought buying the condo would be routine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The only color that should matter in a real estate transaction is green,” she told me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even in 2024, that’s not always the case. </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new </span><a href="https://homeofva.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Racial-Disparities-in-Home-Values-May-2024.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">highlights how neighborhoods in Richmond have lost portions of their Black residents over the past decade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond Councilwoman Ellen Robertson, who represents the sixth district, commissioned the report from Housing Opportunities Made Equal (HOME). It shows how Richmond’s home values correlate with the racial composition of neighborhoods; houses in areas with 30% or more Black residents are worth 17% less on average than houses where Black residents make up 30% or less of the neighborhood. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This report demonstrates that housing is not a level playing field for Black and white Richmonders,” said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thomas Okuda Fitzpatrick, HOME’s director. “Too often in Richmond and across our region, housing is not a symbol of the American dream, but a driver of inequality.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the report, the average home appraises for around $436,000 in majority white neighborhoods, in juxtaposition to $256,000 where people of color are the majority of residents. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But some Black-owned homes have never had equitable assessments in the first place due to the nation’s history of racist housing policies. In the 1930s, appraisers lined Black-populated neighborhoods nationwide in red and deemed them “hazardous” areas for home loans. The effects can still be present today, the report shows, because each past appraisal became the basis for future appraisals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, the report notes human bias as another factor for disparity in home appraisals. This is when appraisers overlook comparable homes with different racial demographics or allow personal prejudice to prevent them from making objective consideration of a home’s attributes. This is something the report said is “exacerbated by a notable lack of diversity in the appraisal workforce.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report used metro-area research from the Brookings Institute as well as city tax assessment data and American Community Survey data. Meanwhile, Virginia Community Voice conducted 50 interviews with homeowners in Black-majority neighborhoods for anecdotal insights. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regina Leftwich said that she didn’t believe she could get a fair price if she were to sell her home. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would definitely have an intermediary to do those negotiations,” she said. “ Because I’m a single woman and because I’m an African American, people don’t think that I am knowledgeable as to what I have and that I’m just ready to give it up, to give it away.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Mary Bryant believed the gradual improvements she’s made on her home over the years could contribute to getting a good deal should she sell her home. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can’t own a home and not go through some kind of improvement,” Bryant said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was among the majority of surveyed residents who believed they could sell their home for more than they paid for it and that the profit margin would be acceptable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the report noted that there’s an opportunity for public outreach to raise awareness about “systemic, rather than individualized, nature of bias with respect to home values and neighborhood demographics.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many interviewees expressed concern over rising property taxes, the changing demographics in their neighborhoods and “constant harassment to sell their homes for unreasonable low prices.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, a concern for renters is that landlords will continue to raise rents to capitalize on higher property values.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To combat the inequities, the report suggests some actions that Richmond could take. Proposals include zoning changes that could allow for more housing stock and affordability, maintaining a repayment plan with tax-delinquent homeowners, as well as supporting fair housing education and investigations to prevent discrimination. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robertson said in a statement that the report is “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">an urgent reminder of what we must do to retain long-time residents and ensure fair housing values that give all Richmonders equal opportunities to build and sustain a financial legacy for their families.”</span></p>

(Wyatt Gordon)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Garage-turned-apartments, carriage houses, in-law suites — all are accessory dwelling units (ADUs). Whatever they’re called, ADUs are seen by some as a fix to affordable housing options or a way to meet the needs of specific families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the versatile form of housing isn’t always encouraged by locals or officials and little regulatory guidance exists for their approval around the state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the continuation of proposals to frame such guidance during Virginia’s most recent legislative session, a workgroup in the state’s Housing Commission is fine-tuning ideas for how to get a law on the books in the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was never supposed to get out of committee, is what I was told. And somehow [it] got out of committee to get bipartisan support,” said Sen. Saddam Salim, D-Fairfax, a freshman delegate carrying a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB304" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would have required local zoning ordinances for ADUs, which had been unsuccessful in a previous session. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salim’s bill</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">cleared the Senate with bipartisan votes before failing in a House committee. That same committee also stopped a similar </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB900#:~:text=The%20bill%20prohibits%20the%20locality,septic%20capacity%20for%20the%20ADU." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">measure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Del. Kannan Srinivasan, D-Loudoun. But rather than be defeated totally, they were “continued to 2025.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, Salim is optimistic that after workshopping from the Housing Commission, a future version of the bill can go on to become law. The trick will be balancing local government authority with state-level guidelines for ADUs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her own district — which encompasses rural and urban areas with different residential needs — workgroup chair Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield, sees the challenge if state law were to more rigidly regulate ADUs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s why she believes there’s some consensus building on taking a guideline approach that localities could implement. Salim is eager to see what comes of the workgroup. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think there&#8217;s going to be some consensus on ‘what does local authority look like?’ when the bill comes back,” Salim said. “I’m super excited about that.” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Why do ADUs matter?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ADUs may serve different purposes for Virginia communities’ differing needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sometimes folks build them to have a rental income, to age in place, to help someone recovering from an injury or illness or to house multiple generations on the same property,&#8221; said former Charlottesville delegate  Sally Hudson, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/03/08/can-adus-ease-the-housing-crisis/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">who’d carried a previous version of the bill.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hudson had seen inspiration for the legislation in her district, as demand for housing had increased in the Charlottesville area. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Likewise, Salim noted how job growth in his Northern Virginia district has contributed to a higher need for housing that isn’t always being met through construction of new homes and apartments. Allowing for ADUs could at least help, he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is not going to solve the housing crisis that we have,” Salim said. “This is going to sort of ease some of the issues that we already have right now.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ADUs aren’t a one-size-fits-all approach to increasing housing stock or affordability. But they offer flexibility for families or communities who may want them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some places, they’re allowed to be constructed by-right, or without seeking local permits in residentially-zoned areas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rockingham County, for example, allows this. About 90 ADUs were built in the county over the past seven years, allowing housing for a range of people, from farm workers to students and tourists, who can rent them when needed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local infrastructure has made their construction a little easier in Rockingham where many properties are on private wells and use septic tanks, but constructing ADUs in other places may require expanding sewage lines and utility setups. It’s considerations like these that are a part of why some people may oppose ADUs, or wish for local authority over how to regulate them. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">So, what’s next?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the short term, the workgroup is planning to explore how localities could allow for ADUs within their comprehensive plans without fully requiring them to develop local zoning ordinances for them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comprehensive plans are </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title15.2/chapter22/article3/#:~:text=The%20comprehensive%20plan%20shall%20be,order%2C%20convenience%2C%20prosperity%20and%20general" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">guiding documents for localities’ urban planning that the state requires they update every few years</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coyner, the ADU workgroup’s chair, said she hopes to “ensure that localities couldn&#8217;t stick their head in the sand and not address the need for accessory dwelling units” and also “allow them to have the flexibility based on the differences and nuances in localities.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The full Housing Commission is set to meet on July 15, where the Virginia Department of Housing and Community Development is expected to present data. Coyner anticipates the ADU work group will meet again later in July to utilize that data in its next steps. </span></p>

Almost 5 million new housing units, mostly single-family homes, have been added nationwide since 2020, according to new data. Texas is a leader with about 806,000 new homes. (David J. Phillip/The Associated Press)</p><p><em>Read more <a href="https://stateline.org/category/housing-shortage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stateline coverage</a> of how communities across the country are trying to create more affordable housing. </em></p>
<p>The United States has added almost 5 million housing units since 2020, most heavily in the South and most of them single-family homes, making a housing shortage look conquerable in much of the nation. Of those, Virginia added 99,435 housing units from 2020 to 2023, a 3% increase.</p>
<p>Still, even more homes need to be built — especially single-family homes, experts say — and continuing high interest rates are hurting potential homebuyers.</p>
<p>Almost half of the housing increase from April 2020 to July 2023 came in six states: Texas, Florida, California, North Carolina, Georgia and Tennessee, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau estimates to be released Thursday. That mirrors <a href="https://stateline.org/2024/04/03/swing-states-see-newcomers-as-americans-move-from-blue-to-red-counties/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">America’s post-pandemic moving patterns</a> to plentiful suburban housing in Texas and Florida, but also California’s <a href="https://stateline.org/2023/04/27/with-few-rentals-available-states-push-local-officials-to-allow-more-housing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">persistent push</a> for more apartments in resistant areas across the state.</p>
<p>Housing experts caution that the supply has still not caught up with demand even after another good year for home construction in 2023. Last year produced the most housing units since 2007. “One Good Year Does Not Solve America’s Housing Shortage” was the title of a <a href="https://cre.moodysanalytics.com/insights/cre-news/one-good-year-does-not-solve-americas-housing-shortage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moody’s Analytics report</a> in January, which found single-family homes in particular remain in short supply.</p>
<p>Moody’s estimated a shortfall of about 1.2 million single-family homes and 800,000 other units, noting that home sales had slowed since reaching all-time-high prices in 2022 as interest rates climbed and made purchases even more unaffordable.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" title="“Anxiety over squatters, fueled by TikTok, inspires a wave of legislation” — Stateline" src="https://stateline.org/2024/04/26/anxiety-over-squatters-fueled-by-tiktok-inspires-a-wave-of-legislation/embed/#?secret=AyoF2qH1z0#?secret=n9cSt1OAkp" width="500" height="440" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-scripts" data-secret="n9cSt1OAkp" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>The National Association of Realtors, <a href="https://www.realtor.com/research/us-housing-supply-gap-feb-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a February report</a>, offered a higher housing shortage estimate of about 2.5 million units, mostly single-family homes.</p>
<p>Most of the new housing units in recent years have been single-family homes, according to a <a href="https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/historical_data/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">separate U.S. Census Bureau construction survey</a> through the end of 2023. Production of new single-family homes reached more than 1 million annually in 2022 and 2023 for the first time since the housing bubble burst in 2007, according to the survey.</p>
<p>Apartment construction is also at historic levels, with 438,500 units built last year, the highest level since 1987. The number of apartments under construction at the end of the year, about 981,000, was an all-time high since the survey began in 1969.</p>
<p>New housing should continue to arrive at a strong pace for several years because so much construction has already started, said Daniel McCue, a senior research associate at Harvard University’s Joint Center for Housing Studies.</p>
<p>“New construction can really only slow overheated rental rates, but it’s really hard-pressed to bring down rents or make things more affordable for people at the bottom,” McCue said. “Our focus is not on the overall shortage of housing units, but on the specific shortage of affordable and available homes for low- and moderate-income people.”</p>
<p>The housing unit data released Thursday, which tracks changes through the middle of 2023, shows continued increases across the country, with about 1.6 million new units annually for the past two years.</p>

<p>Increases were concentrated in the West and South, with half the 4.8 million new units since 2020 in a handful of states: Texas (about 806,000), Florida (586,500), California (371,000), North Carolina (270,500), Georgia (200,000) and Tennessee (164,000).</p>
<p>Percentage increases were highest in fast-growing Western states: Utah (up 9% since 2020), Idaho (up 8%) and Texas (up 7%). Five states had 6% growth in housing units: South Carolina, South Dakota, Florida, Colorado and North Carolina.</p>
<p>Arizona, Georgia and Nevada — all of which are key swing states in this year’s presidential election — were not far behind, with 5% growth in housing units.</p>

<p>The housing shortage has become a major political talking point, even as states <a href="https://stateline.org/2023/03/20/governors-push-faster-construction-to-meet-housing-needs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scramble</a> to get more units built and people housed.</p>
<p>Even with Utah’s nation-leading growth in housing units for the decade, for example, Republican Gov. Spencer Cox called high housing prices “the single largest threat to our future prosperity” in his <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tR5Hr9gLrXcJ7bVQm5K-vFiamJYP0Pv7/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">State of the State address</a> this year.</p>
<p>“Housing attainability is a crisis in Utah and every state in this country,” Cox said, announcing a plan to build 35,000 small “starter” single-family homes in the next five years.</p>
<p>The Federal National Mortgage Association, known as Fannie Mae, <a href="https://www.fanniemae.com/media/50731/display" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported last year</a> that the typical homebuyer paid 35% of their income in mortgage payments in October, the highest since at least 2000.</p>
<p>A Utah-based think tank, the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute at the University of Utah, <a href="https://d36oiwf74r1rap.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/State-Of-Housing-Sep2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a report last year</a> said the pandemic years brought a boom-and bust-cycle to the state’s housing construction. New permits increased 26% in 2021, only to drop 21% the next year as interest rates climbed. The new U.S. Census Bureau figures show new units in the state peaking at 38,500 in 2022 and falling back to about 30,000 in 2023.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" title="“If you can buy a ‘mansion,’ you can pay a tax for affordable housing, these states say” — Stateline" src="https://stateline.org/2024/02/08/if-you-can-buy-a-mansion-you-can-pay-a-tax-for-affordable-housing-these-states-say/embed/#?secret=s1URTdpRIa#?secret=jaVtRHZakv" width="500" height="482" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-scripts" data-secret="jaVtRHZakv" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>All states saw some housing growth, according to the Stateline analysis and census data, but it was slowest in some states affected by poverty or low population growth. There was only a 1% increase in housing units since 2020 in Rhode Island, Illinois, West Virginia, Connecticut, Alaska and New Jersey.</p>
<p>Alaska Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy also mentioned housing affordability as one of the biggest challenges facing the state this year in his <a href="https://gov.alaska.gov/governor-dunleavy-delivers-6th-state-of-the-state-address-focusing-on-opportunities-for-alaska-present-and-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">State of the State address</a>. Dunleavy proposed a state-funded down payment assistance program for first-time homebuyers, and lumber grading changes designed to make homebuilding materials more affordable.</p>
<p>New Jersey Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy mentioned in <a href="https://www.nj.gov/governor/news/news/562024/approved/20240109b.shtml#:~:text=And%20my%20fellow%20New%20Jerseyans,that%20is%20stronger%20and%20fairer." target="_blank" rel="noopener">his State of the State address</a> the state’s low housing stock at a time when tens of thousands of New Yorkers are seeking suburban housing there.</p>
<p>“If our population grows while our housing stock remains steady, homeownership will be a luxury reserved only for those at the top. That is untenable,” Murphy said.</p>

Four years later, a controversial TikTok has ignited the issue of squatting, and some lawmakers want to crack down on the practice. Damian Dovarganes/The Associated Press</p><p>Across various news channels and outlets, a visceral fear of some property owners — that an unwanted guest could move into their vacant home, refuse to leave, and then claim ownership — has been a trending story.</p>
<p>These squatter horror stories have reached a fever pitch in the past month after a migrant TikTok influencer, Venezuelan national Leonel Moreno, encouraged people to squat in homes across the United States. Moreno was <a href="https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/crime/2024/03/29/venezuelan-tiktoker-who-advocated-squatters-rights-arrested-by-ice-in-gahanna-for-illegal-us-entry/73150721007/" target="_blank">arrested</a> in Ohio in late March by federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers.</p>
<p>So far, lawmakers in at least 10 states have floated legislation this year that would address squatting by revoking tenancy rights, making it easier for police to remove squatters or making squatting a criminal offense. Several have quickly enacted new laws.</p>
<p>The bills, typically sponsored by Republicans but often garnering bipartisan support, come at a time of heightened housing anxiety: The shortage of housing is worse than ever, with <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/12/24/1221480443/most-homes-for-sale-in-2023-were-not-affordable-for-a-typical-u-s-household" target="_blank">affordability</a> at a new low. Meanwhile, migrant encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border reached a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/02/15/migrant-encounters-at-the-us-mexico-border-hit-a-record-high-at-the-end-of-2023/" target="_blank">new monthly high</a> in December, and nearly 80% of Americans <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/02/15/how-americans-view-the-situation-at-the-u-s-mexico-border-its-causes-and-consequences/" target="_blank">think that</a> situation is either a “major problem” or a “crisis.”</p>
<p>Oklahoma state Rep. Ross Ford, whose <a href="https://oklahomavoice.com/briefs/house-advances-legislation-that-allows-oklahoma-law-enforcement-to-boot-squatters-upon-request/" target="_blank">legislation</a> advanced days after Moreno posted his TikTok video, said he began thinking about the issue several years ago after hearing of incidences in rural areas of the state.</p>
<p>But Ford, a Republican, also told Stateline the recent wave of bills across the country is likely in response to Moreno’s video.</p>
<p>“For me, I heard complaints about squatting from property owners … accounts of individuals scouring newspapers for death notices in search of a place to occupy,” said Ford. “But when that came out, I think it really blew this whole issue up for lawmakers in other states.”</p>
<p>For the most part, squatting — when someone <a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/squatter" target="_blank">moves into</a> a vacant building or onto uninhabited land — is considered a civil matter, so police officers aren’t empowered to remove someone at an owner’s request. Homeowners can file eviction notices through the courts to remove an unwanted squatter, a process that can take weeks or months.</p>
<p>So far, <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2024/621" target="_blank">Florida</a> and <a href="https://www.wvlegislature.gov/Bill_Status/Bills_history.cfm?input=4940&amp;year=2024&amp;sessiontype=RS&amp;btype=bill" target="_blank">West Virginia</a> have enacted laws that classify squatting as a criminal act. Florida’s law creates a process for sheriffs to remove squatters. Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp this week <a href="https://www.11alive.com/article/news/state/georgia-squatter-reform-act-signed-into-law/85-41269949-975f-426f-bc3c-efd26ce4b8be" target="_blank">signed</a> a similar bill into law.</p>
<p>Several other states — including <a href="https://alison.legislature.state.al.us/files/pdfdocs/SearchableInstruments/2024RS/HB182-int.pdf" target="_blank">Alabama</a>, <a href="https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/bill-search/2024/S725" target="_blank">New Jersey</a>, <a href="https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/135/hb478" target="_blank">Ohio</a>, <a href="https://www.repscheuren.com/News/33947/Latest-News/Scheuren-Proposes-Homeowner-Protection-and-Squatter-Eviction-Act-" target="_blank">Pennsylvania</a> and <a href="https://www.scstatehouse.gov/sess125_2023-2024/bills/5375.htm" target="_blank">South Carolina</a> — have pending legislation. The anti-squatter fervor also has spread to Capitol Hill, where a <a href="https://meuser.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/meuser.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/SHIELD%20Act%20Text.pdf" target="_blank">U.S. House bill</a> would make squatting a deportable offense.</p>
<p>Proponents of these bills have <a href="https://www.flgov.com/2024/03/27/governor-desantis-signs-legislation-to-end-the-squatters-scam-in-florida/" target="_blank">singled out</a> migrants and immigrants in the country without authorization as squatters, frequently referring to Moreno’s video but otherwise presenting scant data to show that it is a widespread problem.</p>
<p>“After video evidence of their plan to take over homes emerged, we’re ensuring Floridians are protected from this egregious and brazen scheme,” said Florida Republican Attorney General Ashley Moody in a news release when that state’s bill became law. She criticized President Joe Biden’s border policy in the same release.</p>
<p>In Oklahoma, Ford’s <a href="http://www.oklegislature.gov/BillInfo.aspx?Bill=sb1994&amp;Session=2400" target="_blank">bill</a> would allow county sheriffs to immediately remove an alleged squatter from private property.</p>
<p>“When this happens in Oklahoma, the process to get an unwanted person off your property gets bogged down in civil courts for evictions and it may be months to get that person out of your house,” said Ford. “I’m hoping we can make this process of removal quicker and cheaper for the landowner.”</p>
<p>The Oklahoma House approved the bill earlier this month; it is now being considered in the Senate.</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Manufactured crisis’?</h4>

	</h4>
<p>But Eric Dunn, director of litigation at the National Housing Law Project, which advocates for tenants’ rights, called the anti-squatting bills a “manufactured crisis” that exhibits the power of the landlord lobby in U.S. statehouses.</p>
<p>“This TikTok video gave some landlords cause to say, ‘We have a squatting crisis,’ without any data or evidence, or cause for there to be legislation to address a matter that’s already handled by an eviction court,” Dunn said. “It’s indicative of how well organized and connected landlords are in political circles, and how effective they are in getting lawmakers to act on their behalf.”</p>
<p>Kris, a transgender woman from Florida, said in an interview with Stateline that her parents kicked her out of their home in 2022. She found a community of squatters online and has been on the road ever since. Recent news coverage has been reckless and could embolden a property owner to hurt someone, said Kris, who asked that her last name not be used out of concern for her safety.</p>
<p>Traveling through states — including Tennessee and Texas — on her way to the Southwest, Kris said she usually holes up in vacant buildings, never a home that appears occupied, for up to three months at a time. She doesn’t feel like she’s a threat.</p>
<p>“I’m reading stuff on some sites saying the homeowners need to protect their homes and that squatters are just violent vagrants that need to be dealt with,” she said. “It creates a dangerous environment, where a majority of us who are only trying to find shelter in abandoned buildings are now enemies of paranoid homeowners.”</p>
<p>In most states, Republicans are leading the charge on anti-squatting legislation, but in at least one state, New York, Democrats are at the forefront.</p>
<p>New York Democratic state Sen. Jessica Scarcella-Spanton, who represents Staten Island and southern Brooklyn, acknowledged there is little data to support claims that squatting is on the rise, or even that it happens that often.</p>
<p>But Scarcella-Spanton told Stateline that “once is enough” and that there needs to be a quicker way to remove squatters.</p>
<p>Her proposal, which made it into the state’s 2025 budget signed by Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul, spells out clearly that squatters don’t have <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/tenants_rights.pdf" target="_blank">tenants’ legal rights</a> related to evictions. Proponents say that will make it easier for police to remove squatters from properties.</p>
<p>“Some people will make the argument that this is a very rare occurrence. But I think if it happens once or twice, it’s unacceptable,” Scarcella-Spanton said. “It’s always good to have data when we’re trying to push legislation, but most importantly, I think that just seeing the cases that we’ve seen over the last couple of months in the news is reason enough to move forward with legislation.”</p>
<p>Some landlords and property owners in blue states are hoping their lawmakers join the anti-squatting movement.</p>
<p>In California, Cynthia Chidester’s run-in with a squatter at her 95-year-old mother’s home led to a <a href="https://www.pacermonitor.com/public/case/51828974/The_Bank_of_New_York_Mellon_v_Chidester_et_al" target="_blank">prolonged legal battle</a> that required a domestic violence order to get the squatter evicted in April.</p>
<p>In an interview, Chidester said she wants lawmakers to take the issue more seriously, including passing laws to expedite the eviction process for squatters or unwelcome guests.</p>
<p>Alexandra Alvarado, director of education and marketing at the American Apartment Owners Association, an industry group, told Stateline that squatting has been a “nightmare situation” for landlords and property owners since the pandemic, when many offices emptied and vacation rentals sat vacant.</p>
<p>The removal process needs to be “more efficient,” with housing courts backlogged since the pandemic, she said.</p>
<p>“In our industry, squatting has always been an issue. I think what’s changed is the media’s attention to it,” said Alvarado. “We think there’s been a rise in squatting. It’s difficult to show because we don’t have the numbers, and a lot of these cases aren’t handled much differently than a standard eviction case.”</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Eviction protections</h4>

	</h4>
<p>But Dunn, of the National Housing Law Project, worries the recent bills could lead to a rollback of eviction protections. Landlords spanning 10 states and 34 cities filed nearly 1.1 million eviction cases in 2023, a year-to-year increase of more than 100,000, and 500,000 more than in 2021, according to Eviction Lab, a Princeton University research group that tracks evictions.</p>
<p>“It’s not like tenants have great protections in a majority of states as it is,” Dunn said. “It behooves tenants to pay attention to state and local governments when bills like these are proposed, and push back, or they’ll see their rights eroded by a thousand cuts.”</p>
<p>Marc Roark, a law professor at the University of Tulsa who studies squatters and homelessness, described the anti-squatter bills as “low-hanging fruit for political points. It’s a way for legislators to say, ‘Look, I’m doing something to protect your property,’ instead of any substantive housing policy.”</p>
<p>Roark and other housing experts have found that squatters rarely gain ownership of a property. In most states, the period of occupancy required to claim ownership ranges from five to 20 years.</p>
<p>However, Amy Starecheski, a cultural anthropologist at Columbia University who has documented the stories of squatters in New York City, noted that some who take shelter in derelict and abandoned buildings eventually do end up owning them.</p>
<p>“So many people are in need of basic shelter and there are people who are squatting intentionally to challenge private property as a legal and cultural institution,” Starecheski said.</p>
<p>“This might be a moment when people freaking out about squatting are actually freaking out about access to housing, and who gets to own a home and who doesn’t get to own a home.”</p>

<p>HERNDON, Va. — Juan Ramirez, watching his dog play in Chandon Park here in suburban Virginia on a Saturday morning, tries to imagine the massive office buildings next to the park becoming apartments and townhouses.</p>
<p>“I guess it’s inevitable. People don’t use offices as much now. I hope it’s affordable. Maybe it’ll bring more young people to town, more taxes for parks,” said Ramirez, 38, who grew up in the area and returned recently to take a restaurant management job after living in Minnesota and Ohio.</p>
<p>Cities and suburbs around the country are struggling with vacant office space as remote work becomes an established post-pandemic reality. States are stepping in with tax breaks and zoning changes to help replace the unwanted cubicle farms with much-needed housing. In suburbs such as Herndon, the answer might be tearing down an office complex and replacing it with a residential building. In more urban environments it might mean renovating and retrofitting office buildings to create apartments.</p>

<p>“Office vacancy has climbed to a 30-year high and at the same time there’s a housing shortage. So naturally the question is, ‘Why can we not convert all these vacant office buildings into housing?’” said Jessica Morin, research director for CBRE, a commercial real estate firm. CBRE research shows converting offices to other uses, mostly housing, is set to peak this year at more than 20 million square feet, up from 6.3 million in 2021.</p>
<p>Some places that started conversions before the pandemic are leading the way: New York state and New York City changed their laws during a 1990s downturn to allow more office-to-apartment conversions in Manhattan, although now there’s a state vs. city standoff on zoning rules to convert newer offices.</p>
<p>Ohio, where interest in city living grew when Cleveland spruced up its downtown for the 2016 Republican convention, now has three cities — Cleveland, Cincinnati and Columbus — in the top 15 list for office conversions to housing, according to CBRE.</p>
<p>Nationwide, 119 office conversion projects, including for residential and other use, are under construction or were completed this year, the most since CBRE began tracking them in 2016. Those projects could add about 44,000 new housing units when completed.</p>
<p>Since 2016, projects representing 125 million square feet of offices have or are slated to be converted to other uses, usually to housing but sometimes to warehouses or laboratories. But despite the recent increase, that represents only about 2% of all U.S. office space.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" title="“Desperate for affordable housing, some cities sweeten tax breaks for developers” — Stateline" src="https://stateline.org/2024/02/06/desperate-for-affordable-housing-some-cities-sweeten-tax-breaks-for-developers/embed/#?secret=5pLPwKWcf1#?secret=ImCP9U6w59" width="500" height="509" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-scripts" data-secret="ImCP9U6w59" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>Impediments to making apartments out of offices include the still-high value of office buildings in some downtown areas in cities such as San Francisco, and the cost of demolishing or refitting old office buildings with plumbing for individual kitchens and bathrooms. Many office buildings also lack windows with natural light, which apartment-dwellers often demand.</p>
<p>That’s why state incentives have played a large part, as well as streamlined zoning that makes project costs more predictable for developers. Some states are further along than others. A new California law allows residential “building by right” in office and other commercial zones, meaning developers don’t have to petition for a zoning change. <a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=1042&amp;Year=2023&amp;Initiative=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington state</a> passed a law last year requiring cities to ease zoning requirements for housing in existing commercial buildings. And an <a href="https://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2024/04/12/hobbs-signs-housing-bill-more-in-the-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arizona bill</a> signed into law this month will allow larger cities to convert more commercial buildings into housing without zoning changes.</p>
<p>Predictable zoning rules are important to developers who don’t want to get bogged down in negotiations and refusals that could sink a project.</p>
<p>“Developers just urge their states and localities to be really transparent, streamline the process, make the unknowns limited, because it’s the unknowns that drive risks,” said Julie Whelan, a vice president at CBRE. “Otherwise, they’re going to go look at the next pasture.”</p>
<h4 class="editorialSubhed">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Incentive programs</h4>

	</h4>
<p>In addition to the Ohio cities, Chicago; Dallas/Fort Worth; Houston; Hartford and Fairfield County in Connecticut; the Kansas City metro area; Louisville, Kentucky; Minneapolis/St. Paul; Pittsburgh; Milwaukee; New Jersey; and Washington, D.C., are on CBRE’s top 15 list for rate of office space converted to apartments.</p>
<p>Ohio has two incentive programs for office conversion to housing. A 2020 program for <a href="https://development.ohio.gov/business/state-incentives/transformational-mixed-use-development-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“transformational”</a> projects that could spur further development helped convert four floors of offices to apartments under construction at Playhouse Square in Cleveland. A historic building preservation incentive <a href="https://www.heritageohio.org/programs/historic-tax-credits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in place since 2007</a> helped partly convert Carew Tower in Cincinnati to apartments, said Mason Waldvogel, a spokesperson for the Ohio Department of Development.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" title="“The US needs homes. But first, it needs the workers to build them.” — Stateline" src="https://stateline.org/2024/01/24/the-us-needs-homes-but-first-it-needs-the-workers-to-build-them/embed/#?secret=QW6Vj4syLv#?secret=Gmziq9zVBF" width="500" height="432" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-scripts" data-secret="Gmziq9zVBF" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>Missouri is hoping to replicate that success in St. Louis, where about a quarter of the commercial space, including offices, is vacant. That includes the massive 44-story One AT&amp;T Building downtown, with almost 1.5 million square feet, that sold for $3.6 million this month, compared with $205 million in 2006.</p>
<p>Missouri state Sen. Steven Roberts, a Democrat who represents the downtown St. Louis area, said a bill he’s sponsoring has bipartisan support from suburban Republicans, and is aimed at creating downtown areas in St. Louis and elsewhere where people can live, shop and eat as well as work. The bill was <a href="https://www.senate.mo.gov/24info/BTS_Web/Actions.aspx?SessionType=R&amp;BillID=23" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted out of committee in February</a> and is awaiting consideration by the full Senate.</p>
<p>The bill would create a state tax credit for up to 30% of the cost of converting office space to housing, retail or other uses.</p>
<p>“It’s a creative workaround to make downtown more vibrant and successful. We want to get more restaurants, more stores, more nightlife — and the way to do that is to get more people living there,” said Roberts. “It’s an issue for downtown and also for the whole state.”</p>
<p>Other states have enacted laws to encourage more conversion of offices to housing, according to a <a href="https://www.minneapolisfed.org/article/2023/states-reform-regulations-to-support-more-housing-production" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank report</a> last year. Laws passed by <a href="https://www.natlawreview.com/article/florida-live-local-act-provides-incentives-to-build-affordable-and-workforce-housing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Florida</a> and <a href="https://leg.mt.gov/bills/2023/billpdf/SB0245.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Montana</a> in 2023 allow new and converted multifamily housing in commercial areas, and laws in <a href="https://marketurbanism.com/2023/06/26/rhode-islands-housing-process-package/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rhode Island</a> and <a href="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2023/proposals/ab268" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wisconsin</a> support conversion of existing commercial and office buildings.</p>
<p>A Colorado bill now in committee would provide tax credits for commercial conversion to housing starting in 2026, supporting Denver’s plans to transition its office-oriented Central Business District to a “Central Neighborhood District.” Denver identified 16 commercial buildings as prime candidates for housing.</p>
<h4 class="editorialSubhed">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Zoning changes</h4>

	</h4>
<p>Starting in the mid-1990s, a combination of state and city laws <a href="https://cbcny.org/sites/default/files/media/files/CBCREPORT_421-G_12122022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helped transform</a> lower Manhattan’s business district with more apartments, a process that accelerated after 9/11. A proposal by Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul to expand the program to newer buildings <a href="https://therealdeal.com/new-york/2023/09/01/the-daily-dirt-breaks-down-nycs-office-conversion-options/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">failed to pass the legislature</a> as part of a <a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/politics/2023/11/hochul-abandon-required-construction-mandates-ambitious-housing-plan/392350/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broader measure</a> that included requirements for suburban and upstate communities to build more housing. Negotiations are continuing with lawmakers to make the change for New York City this year.</p>
<p>New York City also has begun working on its own rules to allow office-to-housing conversions citywide for buildings built before 1990, said Casey Berkovitz, spokesperson for the Department of City Planning. The state could do it faster and could also create tax incentives that the city cannot create on its own, and that’s also part of current negotiations with the state legislature, Berkovitz said.</p>

<p>“When you have a 20% office vacancy rate and a 1.4% rental apartment vacancy rate, it makes a lot of sense to substitute one for the other,” Berkovitz said. “We don’t want our own regulations standing in the way of that if it makes financial sense.”</p>
<p>In Herndon, Virginia, town officials last month approved a zoning change that would clear the way for demolition of the Worldgate Drive offices and the construction of a combination of rental apartments, townhouses and “two over two” units with accessory living areas an owner can rent out or share with family members. All apartments would be market rate without subsidized affordable units, Ken Wire, an attorney for the developer, Boston Properties, said at last month’s hearing on the zoning change.</p>
<p>“We believe that by providing more housing in the area, we are adding to the overall supply, which thereby reduces price pressures in the market,” Wire said.</p>

<p>Virginia considered two state Senate bills this session that would have created incentives to convert offices to apartments but neither has passed, said Allison Brown, policy associate for the nonprofit Virginia Housing Alliance. One would have created a <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB512" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state income tax credit</a> for office-to-residential conversion, and <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB430" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another</a> would have allowed more residential building in commercial areas if they included affordable housing.</p>
<p>The Worldgate Drive housing plan may spur Herndon to change its zoning rules to allow similar projects without zoning changes, said Elizabeth Gilleran, the town’s director of community development.</p>
<p>Herndon wants to “retain its sense of community and historic small-town feel” but also keep a strong commercial tax base that has helped support the town’s tax coffers when home values inevitably rise and fall, Gilleran said. The town recently approved conversion of a small office park and a hotel to homes. But offices and other commercial buildings will remain a key component of the town’s suburban building mix as density grows with a recent new commuter rail stop that opened in 2022.</p>
<p>“The town doesn’t wish to become a bedroom community,” Gilleran said.</p>

(Roger Chesley/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frank Hruska, executive director of Habitat for Humanity for South Hampton Roads, faces persistent problems trying to build modest homes for low- and middle-income families. Inflation has boosted the cost of housing construction. Plus, vacant, usable land has become more expensive over the years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are in a perfect storm right now,” Hruska told me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I interviewed him after his Habitat chapter announced it was postponing</span><a href="https://www.shrhabitat.org/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the application process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because it hadn’t been able to acquire land for the 2025-26 building season. Applications had been scheduled to open May 1.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said vacant lots in his region were selling for $30,000 to $35,000 in 2018. Yet they averaged $75,000 last year, Hruska said, even though the lots were about the same size and sat in school divisions with the same reputation for quality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hruska’s challenge isn’t unique. Other Habitat</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2024/03/18/peninsulas-habitat-for-humanity-cant-take-applications-for-first-time-in-39-years/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">affiliates in Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have also postponed the application process, some for the first time in decades. Studies and statements by the</span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/summary/Rpt559Sum-1.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">General Assembly’s watchdog agency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.gao.gov/blog/affordable-housing-crisis-grows-while-efforts-increase-supply-fall-short" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the federal government</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and others speak of the longstanding problem to secure affordable housing, especially by Americans who aren’t rich.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Land prices increased 60% from 2012-2019, and the cost of homes more than doubled from 1998 to 2021,” reported the U.S. Government Accountability Office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just last week,</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/04/10/dc-regional-housing-targets/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The Washington Post reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the D.C. metropolitan area has fallen way behind in meeting a 2019 goal of building 320,000 units over the next decade to handle that region’s growth. “Fairfax County, the most populous jurisdiction in the region,” The Post said, “is on pace to build only 36 percent of its target.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One obvious factor: Elected leaders there set the goal before the devastating COVID-19 pandemic occurred and shredded the economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inflation, lack of developable land and the desire by builders to erect expensive houses to recoup their investments are factors in the dearth of affordable housing, both in Virginia and nationwide. Incentives for developers to build multifamily units aren’t always enough to propel construction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even if they decided to be benevolent, to take a modest fee for themselves … their costs to build homes are really high,” said Erica Sims, president of Richmond-based</span><a href="https://www.hdadvisors.net/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">HDAdvisors, a consulting firm specializing in affordable housing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Builders also want to tap into water and sewer lines to help keep costs low, Sims told me. If developers have to install roads and sewer themselves, they might decline those projects.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s Joint Legislative and Audit Review Commission – the aforementioned Assembly watchdog agency – notes what many housing and poverty advocates say: Families are “cost burdened” when they spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing expenses. Such a predicament means it’s difficult for households to pay for other necessities, and it increases the likelihood of eviction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Approximately 29 percent of Virginia households (905,000) were housing cost burdened in 2019, and nearly half of these households spent more than 50 percent of their income on housing,” JLARC said in a 2021 report.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That means many families are just one job layoff, medical emergency or major car repair away from losing a roof over their heads. It’s a stressful way to live.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Renting a home can help families avoid the upfront costs of homebuying, JLARC noted, but the commonwealth “has a shortage of at least 200,000 affordable rental units for extremely and very low-income households.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the possible solutions to this lack of affordable housing?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It requires a heavy investment at the state and federal levels,” Sims said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Cities have land, and they should set some aside for affordable housing,” said Hruska. Localities that bar homes on smaller lots, he added, could alter zoning regulations to permit them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(In August, </span><a href="https://dhcd.virginia.gov/governor-youngkin-announces-over-52-million-affordable-and-special-needs-housing-loans" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced $52 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in affordable and special needs housing loans for dozens of projects.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Home ownership is important. It tends to make individuals more concerned about their neighborhoods because they have a stake in their success. A home is usually the largest monetary investment a family owns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want working-class families to have the American Dream, and that way we have better neighborhoods and better citizens,” said Hruska, the local Habitat official.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look no further than Andrew and Linda Layne, who moved into their Chesapeake Habitat home in 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew Layne, 59, didn’t know I was going to drop in last week to his one-story home with three bedrooms, 1½ bathrooms and roughly 1,100 square feet. Yet he was wearing a red T-shirt from the housing nonprofit when I stopped by.</span></p>

(Roger Chesley/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s quite an endorsement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s the first house I’ve ever owned,” he told me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The house rose on a former vacant lot.  A green front lawn now greets visitors. Solar panels adorn the roof.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He and his wife earlier lived in a Virginia Beach townhouse. Layne sought out Habitat after suffering a serious accident while working as a longshoreman in 2012. “I almost died,” he said, adding that he received disability payments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Laynes contributed hundreds of hours of “sweat equity” to the organization, including at the site of their home. The city’s redevelopment and housing authority helped fund the construction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It makes me a very proud person,” he said, while showing me room-by-room through the home and their cozy backyard. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The family’s pit bull and chocolate husky barked at and sniffed me before deciding I was harmless. They then returned to their usual perches in the living room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Habitat is awesome,” said 54-year-old Linda Layne, who recently started a cleaning job at the year-old Rivers Casino in Portsmouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nonprofit’s good works, though, can only go so far to reduce the affordable housing shortage. Roughly 3,700 families have bought homes through Habitat affiliates since the late 1970s, a state Habitat official told me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many more Virginians, though, want to experience the same level of belonging expressed by the Laynes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s one of pride in having a home of your own. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a roof over your head doesn’t solve everything — but it can be a critical start. It’s definitely better than the alternative.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2022/RD636/PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A state report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> says Virginia — compared to other states — does a strong job fighting homelessness. For the 2021-22 fiscal year, for example, “the rate of homelessness per 10,000 on average in Virginia is 7, and remains the fourth-lowest including all 50 states and territories,” according to the report compiled by the Virginia Department of Housing and Community Development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can do even better, though.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pockets of homelessness are</span><a href="https://www.wavy.com/news/local-news/virginia-beach/new-waterfront-homeless-camp-sets-up-on-london-bridge-creek/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">noticeable statewide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, from </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/05/29/homelessness-northern-virginia-fairfax/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">makeshift tent communities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/20/helping-panhandlers-involves-more-than-just-easing-bans-on-begging/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">panhandlers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to people queuing up</span><a href="https://rescuemission.net/meals/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">for free meals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> doled out by</span><a href="https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/news/ways-you-can-help-fight-hunger-and-homelessness-fairfax-county" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">ministries</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Efforts by the latter are laudable, but they don’t help people thrive or radically alter their living conditions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Roanoke, Dawn Sandoval is the executive director of The Least of These Ministries. The nonprofit has transformed a former motel into Suites by TLOT, making it more than just a temporary shelter for the homeless. Officials opened 12 renovated units on Feb. 15, and they’re completing work on the remaining six units.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We currently serve the unsheltered population and have discovered that many of those experiencing homelessness are on a fixed income,” Sandoval told me by email. Soaring inflation makes rental homes unaffordable for them, Sandoval said, and many are also “wading through lengthy wait lists for Section 8 and HUD-VASH vouchers.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The acronym stands for the U.S. Housing and Urban Development-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing program.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.theleastoftheseministry.org/suites-by-tlot.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ministry’s website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> notes that people pay an affordable rental rate at the renovated motel. Each room has a full-size bed, private bathroom, refrigerator and other amenities. TLOT also plans to shuttle residents to downtown Roanoke several days a week to help them get to work and take advantage of other essential services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a much larger and comprehensive scale,</span><a href="https://www.virginiasupportivehousing.org/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Supportive Housing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> connects the formerly homeless with secure housing. The nonprofit organization, founded in 1988, opened its first housing complex in 1992. VSH now operates 11 housing communities in Richmond, Charlottesville, Norfolk, Virginia Beach, Portsmouth and Chesapeake totaling 711 apartments, the agency said.</span></p>

(Roger Chesley/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group seeks to end homelessness by providing permanent housing and supportive services, including counseling, case management and connecting folks to primary healthcare. People struggling with substance abuse or mental health problems, thus, aren’t just told to figure things out on their own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It uses a model called “Housing First,” which prioritizes housing individuals as soon as possible, and then provides services to help maintain stability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allison Bogdanovic, VSH’s executive director, told me that in 2023, the organization assisted nearly 1,700 people living in its apartments as well as those who used the organization’s service programs. It had revenues of $16.4 million last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She proudly noted, by email, that 94% of its residents remain in stable, permanent housing. That means people are protected from the threats of violence, extreme weather conditions and more, all of which they might have experienced had they been on the streets. The average length of stay in VSH housing is six years, Bogdanovic added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We remain committed to ending homelessness in our existing footprint and are evaluating the feasibility of expanding into smaller communities,” she told me. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I learned about VSH when it opened the 60-unit</span><a href="https://www.virginiasupportivehousing.org/regions/hampton-roads/gosnold-apartments/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Gosnold Apartments in 2006 in Norfolk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the group’s first foray into Hampton Roads. The $6 million development is in a former RC Cola bottling warehouse. Within the next year, the nonprofit plans a major renovation-expansion there to 100 units.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_38189" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:150px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Joel_Chambers-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-38189" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Joel_Chambers-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Joel Chambers was formerly homeless and now lives at Gosnold Apartments in Norfolk.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joel Chambers has called Gosnold home since 2019. The 39-year-old Baltimore native, who suffers from multiple sclerosis and uses a wheelchair, had spent several months on the streets of the Virginia Beach Oceanfront after bouncing around jobs and serving a brief stint in jail.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Was he worried for his safety while homeless? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s a bond in that community,” Chambers told me. “You look out for me, we’ll look out for you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting connected to a home at the housing complex, though, has been a godsend. Housing advocates directed him to the vacancy. A federal voucher helps pay the rent.“Gosnold makes you feel as though it’s not all over,” Chambers said. “I have a bit of a sense of legitimacy, humanity, even.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He works from home for AbbVie pharmaceuticals as an ambassador resource specialist. “I love on people,” Chambers explained. He contacts patients who use the company’s medications, makes sure they have enough supplies and prescriptions and generally provides a kind ear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Living at Gosnold means he doesn’t have to worry about where he’ll find long-term shelter. “I can use time and energy on myself,” he said, including getting to physical therapy. “It’s a calming effect.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Efforts like the renovated motel in Roanoke and Virginia Supportive Housing’s projects help fight homelessness. They transform lives and keep people safe. They’re worthy of publicity and support.</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a case involving a flea infestation of an Alexandria rental, the Virginia Court of Appeals ruled Tuesday that lease agreements can’t override state law requiring that landlords keep their properties “in a fit and habitable condition.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the Virginia Residential Landlord Tenant Act, tenants must “take an active role in keeping the dwelling unit free from pests by prompt notifying the landlord of any infestations,” wrote Judge Doris Henderson Causey in </span><a href="https://www.vacourts.gov/opinions/opncavwp/1687224.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a unanimous decision by a three-judge panel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, she concluded, the law makes it clear that “it is ultimately the landlord’s duty to keep the premises habitable.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuesday’s ruling stems from a conflict over a lease for a single-family home in Alexandria that Mikeya Vance rented from landlord Christopher Parrish in September 2021. According to court records, Vance moved into the property Oct. 15, 2021 and immediately observed fleas in her bed. She then left the property Oct. 25 and notified Parrish of the infestation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The account of events provided by the appeals court outlines a string of extermination attempts undertaken by both Vance and Parrish. Vance first asked to end her lease Nov. 17, but Parrish refused. On Jan. 5, 2022, she filed a complaint against her landlord in Fairfax County General District Court seeking to terminate her lease and recover the rent she had paid during the infestation. While the district court ruled against her, the county circuit court later ruled in her favor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In appealing that decision, Parrish argued that Vance was responsible for dealing with the infestation, since the lease the two had signed stated the tenant would have the responsibility of “controlling and eliminating household pests including but not limited to fleas, ticks, bed bugs, roaches, silverfish, ants, crickets, and rodents during occupancy” and would be on the hook for “costs of the elimination of all such pests and vermin.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vance in turn contended that Virginia’s Residential Landlord Tenant Act requires landlords to keep properties habitable and forbids that responsibility from being transferred to tenants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The appeals court agreed. “When a lease provision purports to waive [a] tenant’s rights or remedies required by law, the law controls and the lease provision is unenforceable,” Causey wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the duties of a landlord that can’t be waived are the duty to “keep the premises in a fit and habitable condition,” she concluded. The presence of fleas, she found, “certainly can render the premises uninhabitable” because of the diseases they can carry.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Here, the lease agreement between Parrish and Vance attempted to shift the burden to deal with insect infestations to Vance,” Causey wrote. “However, the lease could not do so because Vance did not waive the warranty of habitability by signing the lease agreement.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The appeals court also rejected another argument by Parrish that the circuit court hadn’t had sufficient evidence to determine the fleas had been there prior to Vance moving in. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a hearing on the case this past September, Vance’s attorney, Karen Leiser, argued that the circuit court hadn’t been unreasonable in its ruling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If the tenant had somehow brought the fleas with her or had caused an infestation in some way, it is possible that that burden would shift to her to remediate the problem, but that is not what the trial court found,” Leiser told the appeals court. “The trial court found that the fleas must have already been there, and therefore it was the landlord’s obligation under the statute to remedy that problem.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Causey concluded that even though Parrish “asserts that Vance caused the flea infestation, the circuit court was entitled to credit” other testimony “that the flea activity had been ongoing for months, even before Vance took possession of the property.”</span></p>

(Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While many of the costs that have contributed to inflation over the past three years have begun to moderate, there is one that hasn’t: housing. Over the past year, housing and related costs account for two-thirds of the </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2023/consumer-prices-for-shelter-up-7-9-percent-from-january-2022-to-january-2023.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the core Consumer Price Index. Pick up any newspaper or follow news feeds online and you are certain to see reporting on the housing crisis that we are facing in most of our communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/americas-rental-housing-2024" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> issued last month by the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University found that the extended period of rising rents during the pandemic has put unaffordability at all-time highs for renters. For the first time, the percentage of renters paying more than 30% of their income for housing reached 50%. Virginia trails close behind the national trend, with over 48% of renters facing a moderate or severe housing cost burden. The impacts are being felt across the board: homelessness is rising; seniors have few affordable choices as they downsize and need more services; and young households face high rents in new “luxury” apartment communities.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the repercussions extend to mental health and educational outcomes for children residing in unstable housing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homebuyers are encountering similar challenges. </span><a href="https://vhc.virginia.gov/2023%20VHC%20Annual%20Report-1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the Virginia Housing Commission last year pointed to limited home inventory and rising interest rates as major contributors to rising homebuyer barriers. Twenty years ago, 60,000 homes per year were being built in the state. Today that number is closer to 40,000 –and the homes that are being built are more expensive with very few new “starter” homes coming onto the market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a time when affordable housing is in the spotlight, there are often overlooked and frequently misunderstood resources that are also seeing rapid rent increases: manufactured home parks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manufactured homes, including those located in parks, represent one of the largest components of unassisted affordable housing in the nation. In Virginia, mobile home parks provide some of the most deeply affordable housing in many of our communities. But these parks are increasingly at risk as many long-time, traditional park owners are aging and looking to sell as they retire. At the same time, large, national real estate investors are increasingly interested in purchasing these previously ignored assets. When parks are purchased, rents rise and frequently tenants also become responsible for water and sewer payments as well as other fees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2020, Virginia’s Department of Housing and Community Development has received </span><a href="https://dhcd.virginia.gov/mh" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">146 notices </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">of Intent to Sell or Purchase Offer from park owners, indicating how active this market has become.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Park residents face challenges that typical apartment renters do not. If they own their mobile home, as many do, they have little choice but to pay higher lot rentals and absorb utility bill transfers since they are unable to move their homes. The term “mobile” is a misnomer; these homes are mobile only to the extent that they are transported to their initial location. After that, the cost and impracticality of moving them means that they stay put. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislation is pending in the General Assembly that offers some relief. Del. Paul Krizek’s </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB1397" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 1397</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offers local governments, tenants and nonprofit organizations the opportunity to purchase parks when sales are pending to preserve affordability and improve living conditions. There is evidence that this approach can work.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three years ago, the Richmond nonprofit project:HOMES acquired a 50-lot manufactured home community in Chesterfield County. With support from the county, Virginia Housing and other foundations, project:HOMES improved the park&#8217;s infrastructure, including roads, drainage, sewage and lighting. To date, they&#8217;ve replaced eight old, deteriorated homes with new, energy-efficient ones while keeping costs affordable. They plan to raise more funds to provide new replacement units for each household on the waiting list. In the meantime, they&#8217;ve repaired existing units for residents. Additionally, project:HOMES constructed a new community center, which hosts offices, a multipurpose space, and a playground. The center serves as a hub for community events, meetings and resource coordination programs, such as bilingual classes on financial literacy, health, and ESL. They&#8217;ve also built a cul-de-sac turnaround, improving safety for children by allowing the school bus to pick them up within the community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Charlottesville, the local Habitat for Humanity affiliate purchased a 351-lot mobile home community and is making good on its commitment to provide permanent, affordable homes to those residents – the largest Habitat sponsored project in the nation. In Manassas, Catholics for Housing purchased a 58-home park with failing infrastructure. It has corrected the unsafe conditions that threatened to close the community and preserved this affordable community in a high-cost region. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delegate Krizek’s bill, paired with its associated budget amendment, deserves immediate support and action. These measures are crucial for enabling more success stories like the ones described above. We can bolster our determination to address Virginia’s housing crisis through active engagement with local organizations who are directly addressing housing issues or advocating for affordable housing initiatives.</span></p>

(Wyatt Gordon for the Virginia Mercury)</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>By Thailon Wilson / Capital News Service</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">State lawmakers did not advance legislation this session that aimed to slow rising rent prices, although affordable housing remains a big concern for constituents.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Two proposed bills would have allowed localities to adopt anti-rent gouging provisions, prevent landlords from increasing rent without at least two-month notice, and set an annual allowance between <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+amd+HB721AHC" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241%2Bamd%2BHB721AHC&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1707856531399000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2SlX7P5N7kBKPoOlEGXx8S">7% and 15%</a> for rent increases.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, introduced <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB366" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241%2Bsum%2BSB366&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1707856531399000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0Nztv6xxLuytaahySEuapR">Senate Bill 366</a>, which is dead after it was defeated in committee.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Del. Nadarius Clark, D-Suffolk, introduced <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB721" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241%2Bsum%2BHB721&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1707856531399000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2q9VV169QTTtur8LQPmGtG">House Bill 721</a>, which was continued to 2025. Committee members raised concerns over potential problems and wanted to see some research, possibly from the Virginia Housing Commission. One member suggested a possible pilot program.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This was the third year that Clark <a href="https://www.richmondsunlight.com/legislator/neclark/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.richmondsunlight.com/legislator/neclark/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1707856531399000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0hDRg5AW9NRmmd69B-M6iE">attempted</a> to pass some type of rent stabilization bill. The others were tabled or passed by indefinitely. The fact that the bill was not struck down shows growing support, Clark said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It does show that the General Assembly is ready to have conversations,” Clark said. “I’m happy that the chair of that committee and the members of that committee is willing to work with me throughout this year to bring stakeholders together, to bring work groups together.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Clark represents constituents in the Hampton Roads area where 53.5% of residents spend 30% or more of their income on rent, according to a Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies <a href="https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/arh-2024-cost-burden-share" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/arh-2024-cost-burden-share&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1707856531399000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2OsXjAf-RTYqnvdX0RNwNQ">report</a>. In the Richmond and Charlottesville areas, 52% of renters spend 30% of their income on rent.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That is on par with and in some cases greater than percentages in major metropolitan areas around the country, according to the report.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This year, we’re focused on rent gouging because we see throughout our commonwealth that rent has been going up in certain places 20, 30, 40, 50% and even higher in some places,” Clark said. “We see that these are predatory tactics that some developers and landowners and leasing people are using.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Clark’s bill advanced from the Counties, Cities and Towns Committee on a bipartisan vote. It was then referred to the Courts of Justice Civil subcommittee.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There was testimony in support of and against the bill, which boiled down to renters versus property owners and managers. Virginia constituents have shared stories of how their rent jumped 33% and even higher in certain cases, according to Gustavo Espinosa with the Legal Aid Justice Center.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Espinosa translated for several speakers who offered testimony. One South Richmond renter asked lawmakers for help and to limit rent increases because “our salaries aren’t going up so much.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The rent increase has been too much,” said María Lopez, another renter. “We have families and our salary is not enough to pay for everything.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lopez said it is unjust that landlords can raise rent so much.</p>
<p dir="ltr">People in opposition to the bill testified that it was well intentioned but would ultimately be ineffective. The state already has a housing supply issue and the bill would exacerbate it, speakers said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Marla Posey, a member of the Virginia Apartment Management Association, has worked in states with rent control and said the bill could decrease housing supply and quality. She thinks the legislation would harm people instead of help them.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Here in Virginia, we need policy to support adding new housing opportunities … to be able to house more Virignians, not enacting policy that will halt housing development,” Posey said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Rent control also stymies other business development such as grocery stores, she said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bill is not a rent-control measure, Clark said. Allowed rent increases would be evaluated annually. A locality could create a board to also hear arguments for higher increases.</p>
<p dir="ltr">New properties would be exempt from any local ordinance for the first 15 years of ownership, Clark said. The original proposal set the exemption at 10 years but was <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+amd+HB721AHC" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241%2Bamd%2BHB721AHC&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1707856531400000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1lqlnFB8UF56SypxlyBrC-">amended</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If the current system was working, the state would not be short 200,000 affordable units and Richmond rents would not top those in New York City, Clark said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We clearly have a problem and the formula that we&#8217;re using now doesn&#8217;t work,” Clark said. “This will give localities the power and the option … to enact this ordinance … to help people improve their lives.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Real estate” or “construction” groups held the <a href="https://www.vpap.org/money/donors-sector/?year=2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.vpap.org/money/donors-sector/?year%3D2022&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1707856531400000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0_EJk-azUYU81o7ZO7mS3Q">No. 3 spot</a> for campaign donations, when ranked by industry, according to a Virginia Public Access Project analysis. Donations from organizations that fall under that industry totaled $31.6 million from 2022 to 2023.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Affordable housing was among the top three issues Democratic voters want to see the governor and lawmakers tackle, according to a recent <a href="https://cnu.edu/wasoncenter/surveys/archive/2024-01-24.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cnu.edu/wasoncenter/surveys/archive/2024-01-24.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1707856531400000&amp;usg=AOvVaw135bOlw35CbbP71tPRMqtw">survey</a> from the Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are a number of other housing reform bills in the General Assembly, several with a <a href="https://www.richmondsunlight.com/bills/tags/tenants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.richmondsunlight.com/bills/tags/tenants/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1707856531400000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0eWASaak7KGKE1RQGEjI3L">focus</a> on tenant rights.</p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Virginia’s General Assembly is considering legislation that would limit some of the authority local governments have to regulate short-term rentals like those offered through Airbnb and Vrbo.</p>
<p>Proposed by Sen. Lamont Bagby, D-Richmond, <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb544" target="_blank">the bill</a> wouldn’t overturn short-term rental requirements already imposed by localities but would prevent them from introducing certain new ones.</p>
<p>The bill states that no local ordinance enacted after Dec. 31, 2023, can require a special exception, special use or conditional use permit for a property owner to operate a short-term rental at their primary residence.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="MVaUP1wbuS"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/19/virginia-municipalities-crack-down-on-short-term-rentals/">Virginia municipalities crack down on short-term rentals</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia municipalities crack down on short-term rentals&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/19/virginia-municipalities-crack-down-on-short-term-rentals/embed/#?secret=4LeGBG8yve#?secret=MVaUP1wbuS" data-secret="MVaUP1wbuS" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>It is one of a handful currently being considered by the General Assembly that relate to short-term rentals. <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb695" target="_blank">A proposal by Del. Lee Ware</a>, R-Powhatan, would create a state registry for all short-term rentals. And <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb304" target="_blank">a measure</a> proposed by Sen. Saddam Azlan Salim, D-Fairfax, would mandate that local governments allow accessory dwelling units, or ADUs, which are sometimes used for short-term rentals, without a special use permit in single-family residential zoning districts.</p>
<p>Airbnb has made headlines in recent years for refusing to send localities <a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/cities-and-counties-across-virginia-say-airbnb-is-breaking-the-law/article_1ff87137-d84f-57aa-9815-64ff06ea73a9.html" target="_blank">basic tax information</a> even as it has continued to pay them taxes. In 2022, Virginia enacted a law requiring rental intermediaries like Airbnb to submit addresses and receipts of each rental to the locality where it sits. Local governments contend that Airbnb has been flouting Virginia law for more than a year by refusing to send them that tax information, making it impossible to know if the company is paying too much or too little in tax.</p>
<p>At the same time, <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/19/virginia-municipalities-crack-down-on-short-term-rentals/">an increasing number of local governments</a>, concerned about the impact of short-term rentals on already limited housing stock, have begun passing ordinances to regulate such businesses more strictly. Richmond, for example, last September <a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/airbnb-strict-restrictions-richmond-homeowners/article_5d49b62e-5be2-11ee-9121-cf023541f9f7.html" target="_blank">approved 12 regulations for short-term rentals in</a> the city, addressing issues such as parking, signage, owner occupancy, and room and renter limits.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Regulating rentals at primary residences</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Bagby’s bill would make it so localities couldn’t require new special exceptions, special use permits (SUPs) and conditional use permits (CUPs) for short-term rentals involving a homeowner’s primary residence. These permits are often required for uses that could potentially negatively impact surrounding properties and therefore must be approved by a locality.</p>
<p>However, he told the Senate Local Government Committee Monday, the proposal would “not limit the ability of local government to use the CUP or SUP process for properties whose primary use is short term, such as vacation homes or an investment property.”</p>
<p>Bagby did not return requests for comment on the legislation, which is moving swiftly through the Senate.</p>
<p>While his proposal has gotten support from Airbnb, Virginia Realtors and members of the tech industry, it is being opposed by the Virginia Association of Counties, the Virginia Municipal League, Fairfax County, Virginia Beach, the city of Hampton, the town of Cape Charles and the North Virginia Beach Civic League.</p>
<p>“What our members like about the existing statute is it allows them to craft a short-term rental ordinance with input from their community,” said Joe Lerch, the Virginia Association of Counties’ director of local government policy. “Our concerns in opposition are related to the fact that it’s dictating what a local ordinance shall have.”</p>
<p>Andrew Cohen of the North Virginia Beach Civic League, which represents the city’s North End neighborhood, said his organization worked with city officials to create ordinances that worked for their locality.</p>
<p>“We’re not taking a position opposing [short-term rentals] outright,” Cohen said. “Our legislative agenda, very clearly, is we don’t want the state to preempt the ability of localities like Virginia Beach to make their own ordinances, do their own zoning, land use, and determine where STRs are an appropriate use.”</p>
<p>Cohen worries Bagby’s bill could lead to housing and rental price increases. Some <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/the-economic-costs-and-benefits-of-airbnb-no-reason-for-local-policymakers-to-let-airbnb-bypass-tax-or-regulatory-obligations/" target="_blank">economists warn</a> that what’s been dubbed <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/garybarker/2020/02/21/the-airbnb-effect-on-housing-and-rent/?sh=670c1ec12226" target="_blank">“the Airbnb effect”</a> may drive up housing prices to the extent that community members can no longer afford to live in their neighborhoods.</p>
<p>“If they were allowed to proliferate without limitation, then it would hollow out the neighborhood and there would be fewer and fewer resident owners and more people who are just weekly renters,” Cohen said. “It would very much undermine the nature of our neighborhood, and it would be done for the benefit of investors and realtors who now do that as their business.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">State registry</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Ware’s bill would direct the Virginia Department of Taxation to create a statewide registry of short-term rentals. Significantly, it would also require any rental intermediary that isn’t reporting property addresses and gross receipts to the local government each month as state law requires to submit certain information to the state registry &#8212; a provision that appears to narrowly target Airbnb.</p>
<p>“What these accommodation intermediaries are supposed to do is report locations of these places that are offered for short-term rentals and remit taxes,” said Ware. “This outlier has been remitting taxes, but not offering any other confirmatory information.”</p>
<p>In a House Finance subcommittee meeting Tuesday, Ware said Airbnb represents 60% of Virginia’s short-term rentals.</p>
<p><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/cities-and-counties-across-virginia-say-airbnb-is-breaking-the-law/article_1ff87137-d84f-57aa-9815-64ff06ea73a9.html" target="_blank">Airbnb has argued</a> that requiring it to provide addresses and receipts for rentals violates the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p>“We’re not asking for anything that violates anybody’s Fourth Amendment protections,” Ware said. “We’re just asking them to follow the Virginia law on this.”</p>
<p>But Ron Jordan, a lobbyist for Airbnb, vociferously objected to the bill, saying its supporters had put forward a “raft of misstatements and mischaracterizations.”</p>
<p>“There’s federal case law and federal statutes that supersede some of the requirements in this statute, and Airbnb believes it is in compliance,” he said. For those who disagree, he added, “That’s why we have courts, ladies and gentlemen, to make those determinations and clarify what the laws really mean.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Accessory dwelling units</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Salim, who represents part of Northern Virginia, says his accessory dwelling unit bill is an effort to create affordable housing. Sometimes referred to as “granny flats” or “in-law suites,” accessory dwelling units are either standalone or attached secondary housing units that sit on a single-family residential lot. While they can be popular for short-term rentals, Salim said his legislation arose from his constituents’ desire to accommodate family members in the expensive suburbs of Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>“If you wanted your kids to come back to town, you wanted your parents or grandparents to come live with you, those are some of the things that could be done right now,” Salim said. The bill would “allow you to either bring your parents in or even your grandparents back to the area, instead of living somewhere else where the cost is going to be significantly higher.”</p>
        <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/donate/?oa_referrer=midstorybox" style="text-decoration:none;">
        <div class="donateContainer">

            </div>
        </div>
        </a>
        
<p>However, his proposal has also gotten pushback from many of the groups opposing Babgy’s legislation because it too would supersede local authority by forbidding local governments from banning the units in single-family residential neighborhoods.</p>
<p>The current version of the bill would allow localities to charge up to $250 for permitting and would let them impose certain conditions, such as requiring units to include dedicated parking, mandating that rental terms be no fewer than 30 consecutive days, and limiting square footage to 1,500 square feet, among other possible allowed constraints. The proposal is also moving quickly through the Senate.</p>
<p>While some housing advocates say accessory dwelling units could help ease housing pressures, they’re still an expensive proposition. <a href="https://www.angi.com/articles/how-much-do-adu-costs.htm" target="_blank">One estimate</a> puts the cost of building a new standalone ADU at somewhere between $60,000 and $225,000, while <a href="https://www.angi.com/articles/garage-conversions-add-valuable-living-space.htm" target="_blank">converting a garage</a> into an ADU can cost $6,000 to $26,000.</p>
<p>“We have a lot of folks whose kids have gone to college and they’re adults, and they’re trapped in 3,000-square-foot homes out in the outer suburbs, because if they sell it, there’s nowhere to go,” said Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Richmond, during debate on the bill Monday. “It is not as if we legalize this, we would have a flood of people living in ADUs. That’s just not the reality. This is a small piece of the puzzle.”</p>
<p>Lerch said Virginia’s counties don’t oppose ADUs, just Salim’s legislation.</p>
<p>“Our stance is there’s really not a one-size-fits-all in terms of how an accessory dwelling unit ordinance should be written,” said Lerch. “These things are really expensive to build, so even though you might have an ordinance that allows them by-right, you have to do firewall separation.”</p>
<p>Lerch mentioned there are ways to make ADUs less costly, noting that Washington, D.C., recently created a $2.5 million pilot program to help support their creation.</p>
<p>“Make this a way for people to make income that helps them stay in place without them doing away with the rental market at the local level,” Lerch said.</p>

(Michael Dwyer/Associated Press)</p><p>The United States needs an estimated 7 million more homes to house everyone who needs shelter. But to build all those homes, experts say, America would need many more construction workers.</p>
<p>“The biggest challenge that the construction industry is facing, to put it tongue in cheek, is that people don’t want their babies to grow up to be construction workers,” said Brian Turmail, vice president of public affairs and strategic initiatives at the Associated General Contractors of America, an industry group that’s been calling for more workforce development.</p>
<p>For decades, Turmail said, many educators and policymakers have been encouraging students to go to a four-year college, leading to a shortage of skilled tradespeople such as electricians and plumbers. Most of the tradespeople he knows, Turmail added, got into the business because of a personal contact.</p>
<p>And now, following both the Great Recession of 2008 and the construction cutbacks of the COVID-19 pandemic, more workers are <a href="https://www.nccer.org/newsroom/the-greater-impact-of-the-construction-labor-shortage-examined/" target="_blank">leaving</a> the industry than entering it, according to the National Center for Construction Education and Research.</p>
<p>“If there are fewer workers available, construction takes longer,” said Lily Roberts, managing director for inclusive growth at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank based in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>The construction industry says it is experiencing a workforce shortage and has been since well before the pandemic. Employment isn’t growing fast enough, said Erika Walter, director of media relations for Associated Builders and Contractors, a national <a href="https://www.abc.org/News-Media/News-Releases/construction-workforce-shortage-tops-half-a-million-in-2023-says-abc" target="_blank">industry group</a>.</p>
<p>An analysis released earlier this month by the Associated Builders and Contractors found that at the end of November there were about 459,000 job openings in the industry. The 5.4% job opening rate was the highest since 2000.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="jzBKdqmoVT"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/23/a-historic-housing-construction-boom-may-finally-moderate-rent-hikes/">A historic housing construction boom may finally moderate rent hikes</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;A historic housing construction boom may finally moderate rent hikes&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/23/a-historic-housing-construction-boom-may-finally-moderate-rent-hikes/embed/#?secret=R59BhJmHlQ#?secret=jzBKdqmoVT" data-secret="jzBKdqmoVT" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>Several states have taken steps in recent years to boost their construction workforces. They’re funding apprenticeships, investing in community college programs and offering grants to benefit specific industries, all in hopes of building a domestic pipeline of skilled construction workers. In Montana, nearly 3,000 apprentices are now working through a state <a href="https://dli.mt.gov/data-dashboards/montana-registered-apprenticeship-program" target="_blank">program</a> that links students to industry sponsors.</p>
<p>“The big surprise in 2023 for me was that all of a sudden these governors did more than just pump money into the labor shortage problem,” said Karl Eckhart, vice president of intergovernmental affairs for the National Association of Home Builders. “We need to expedite this process so we can at least get shovels under the ground.”</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The problem</h4>

	</h4>
<p>The U.S. construction industry lost nearly 30% of its workforce during the Great Recession of 2008, and had barely recovered before the COVID-19 pandemic hit it again, as outlined by a <a href="https://www.haas.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/Howard_Wang_Zhang_Housing-Supply-and-Construction-Labor-Dayin-Zhang.pdf?ref=thebuildersdaily.com" target="_blank">study</a> shared last spring by economists at the University of Utah and the University of Wisconsin-Madison.</p>
<p>The authors attributed much of the shortage, however, to the federal Secure Communities immigration crackdown of the Obama administration.</p>
<p>“If a shortage of lower-skilled labor makes it more difficult to find workers to finish framing a house, this will also reduce demand for electricians and plumbers required at the subsequent stage of construction,” the authors wrote.</p>
<p>But another issue is that the industry’s labor force is headed toward retirement. More than 1 in 5 construction workers <a href="https://www.sbcacomponents.com/media/construction-labor-age-gap-continues-to-grow" target="_blank">are 55 and older</a>, and much of the workforce will be retiring in the coming decade, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
<p>For now, though, roughly 68% of construction firms say their job applicants lack the skills they need, according to an Associated General Contractors <a href="https://www.agc.org/sites/default/files/users/user21902/2023%20Workforce%20Survey%20Release.pdf" target="_blank">survey</a> last year.</p>
<p>“We’ve invested hundreds of millions into workforce training, because not only do we need homes, but the average age of an electrician in America is around 50 years old,” said Eckhart, of the National Association of Home Builders. “If you’re, you know, Gen X or younger, your guidance counselor never said, ‘Hey, you should become an electrician.’ Now the industry has lost that potential pool of talent.”</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Building a workforce</h4>

	</h4>
<p>Among the challenges, experts and studies say, is that the construction industry isn’t doing enough to recruit different types of people.</p>

<p>According to a 2022 U.S. Department of Labor <a href="https://www.apprenticeship.gov/sites/default/files/aca-interim-report-may-2022.pdf" target="_blank">report</a>, many apprentice programs for construction and trade-based skills often have sponsors who do not recruit or hire individuals from underrepresented groups — and may not even be aware of how to recruit members of those groups.</p>
<div class=" newsroomBlockQuoteContainer "></div>
<p>“In the construction industry, a generally untapped group of potential employees is women, including women of color,” Roberts, of the Center for American Progress, said.</p>
<p>Women and people of color are underrepresented in the construction industry and especially in the higher-paid, higher-skilled trades, according to the federal <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/building-future-advancing-equal-employment-opportunity-construction-industry" target="_blank">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a>.</p>
<p>Rose Khattar, director of economic analysis for inclusive economy at the Center for American Progress, said some jurisdictions have taken steps to expand the diversity of their workforce through training.</p>
<p>And in recent months, several states have touted new investments in trades education.</p>
<p>In November alone, for example, New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-announces-fourth-round-office-strategic-workforce-development-grant-awards" target="_blank">announced</a> that more than $12 million in grant money would be invested into training roughly 2,000 workers in various fields, including programs for welding, machine maintenance and construction work.</p>
<p>Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine announced that 35 Ohio high school programs would receive almost $200 million in <a href="https://governor.ohio.gov/media/news-and-media/governor-dewine-lt-governor-husted-announce-career-tech-construction-grant-awards-new-equipment-funding-opportunity" target="_blank">grant money</a> to expand training facilities in areas including the electrical trades, welding and carpentry.</p>
<p>And Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, a Democrat, signed an <a href="https://governor.maryland.gov/news/press/pages/governor-moore-signs-workforce-development-executive-order-for-state-public-works-projects.aspx" target="_blank">executive order</a> requiring officials overseeing state construction projects of more than $5 million to consider using contractors participating in registered apprenticeship programs.</p>
<p>“I think the stigma of the construction industry is that you’re going into building trades because you couldn’t do anything else,” said Shelly Bell, vice president of workforce development at Florida’s Tallahassee Community College, which has a trades education curriculum tied to a larger, state-sponsored program.</p>
<p>There’s plenty of need, she pointed out, and long-term job security given the country’s housing shortage. “We want our students to see a career in construction that includes upward mobility and professional fulfillment,” she said.</p>
<p>Policymakers should take heed of ongoing workforce needs for another reason as well, Eckhart said.</p>
<p>“If you’re not investing in training skilled workers, that only hurts the consumer,” he said. “Less-skilled workers means homes that won’t be stable and functional, and you can’t afford to make shortcuts when it comes to building homes.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">building code</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Board of Housing and Community Development has been told to remove a quarter of the rules that protect homes and businesses against fires, bad weather and shoddy workmanship. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Board only last summer completed its triennial </span><a href="https://www.dhcd.virginia.gov/sites/default/files/Docx/bhcd/book-6-final.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">update</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the Virginia building code, so you’d think they would have removed any unnecessary provisions already. But that’s not the point. The point is that the Axe of Freedom must fall wherever regulations gather in big bunches, and the building code is, by definition, a bunch of regulations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wasting no time, the board plans to </span><a href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/ViewMeeting.cfm?MeetingID=39309" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">meet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on January 26 to kick off what it is calling “the reduction cycle.” Virginians will have a chance to comment, although in keeping with what I’ve found to be board practice, only the comments the board likes will count. And as the governor appoints the board members, successful opinions will be those that confirm Youngkin’s vision. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From that perspective, the building code is shot full of nanny state rubbish. It dictates things like safe wiring and roofs that don’t fly off in a storm and plumbing that actually works. The governor no doubt believes we can safely trust these kinds of things to profit-maximizing corporations without state inspectors second-guessing their work. (I assume the requirement for inspections also falls to the Axe. There is nothing more nanny-state than inspections.)</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Houses can be built to use much less energy. Why aren’t they?&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/19/houses-can-be-built-to-use-much-less-energy-why-arent-they/embed/#?secret=R2Ywn7NUOG#?secret=ojBtF9Q9TE" data-secret="ojBtF9Q9TE" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if the government does away with standards, won’t builders cut corners? Yes, of course they will. That is the whole point, because then they can make more money. And making money is the ultimate conservative value, second only to owning the libs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the people who wind up living in unsafe, flimsy firetraps, I expect the administration thinks it’s about time those snowflakes took personal responsibility for the quality of their homes. If they can’t correct hidden defects before a house erupts in flames or grows black mold or the basement floods, that’s on them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing advocates worry the administration might especially target energy efficiency requirements, though Lord knows the board already </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/10/19/houses-can-be-built-to-use-much-less-energy-why-arent-they/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">watered those down</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> plenty, and illegally so. But things can always get worse, and Youngkin seems committed to ensuring they do. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Indeed, that would make a great tagline for Youngkin’s 25% initiative. “Glenn Youngkin: Making Virginia Government One-Quarter Worse.” Feel free to use it, governor, with my compliments.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyway, excising the energy efficiency section of the housing code could be a retro move to appeal to old folks’ nostalgic yearning for the days when houses were so drafty you could feel a breeze with the windows closed. Maybe you never thought we’d let new homes get built that were like those of my childhood, where the kitchen pipes froze when the temperature plunged unless you put a hot water bottle in the cupboard under the sink and left the faucet dripping. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But here we are. Will the board also remove the bans on lead paint and asbestos insulation?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The building code may be the first place to look for regulations to cut, but reaching his 25% goal will require Youngkin to take the Axe of Freedom to regulations wherever they lurk. And they lurk all over the place. Virginia’s </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/admincode/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">administrative code</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> contains 24 titles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One colleague suggests simply removing every fourth word from every section of every title, which would have the virtue of wreaking havoc with the entire Deep State bureaucracy at once. And it would keep lawyers busy! Though not everyone would appreciate that feature (and sure enough, my colleague is a lawyer).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another easy option might be to just remove a quarter of the titles indiscriminately</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Chopping off the last 6 of the 24 would eliminate the following: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">     • P</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ublic safety (creating an interesting experiment in anarchy) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">     • P</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ublic utilities and telecommunications (turning the management of these critical functions over to the private sector, but what could go wrong?) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">     • S</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ecurities and retail franchising (as I have only a dim idea of what those are all about, it’s okay by me, but I expect these things have their defenders) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">     • S</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ocial services (this could be dicey when combined with the anarchy thing) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">     • T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">axation (a popular title to jettison, with the added benefit of making the rest of government unworkable) and </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">     • T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ransportation and motor vehicles (which would either allow everyone to speed to their heart’s content, or mean no one would do road repair; we’d just have to see how that went)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will object that I’m proposing a totally mindless approach to regulatory reform. On the contrary, I’m just trying to help implement the governor’s regulatory reform agenda using the same level of care and foresight he did. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let the Axe of Freedom fall!</span></p>

(Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homeownership is a key factor in building wealth and achieving the American dream but it has never been accessible to all Americans. Recent reports of racial disparities in mortgage loan lending at Navy Federal Credit Union – the largest credit union in America, based in Virginia – demonstrate the persistent challenges people of color face in the quest to buy homes and create financial legacies for their families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This present-day disparity, </span><a href="https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/how-local-differences-race-and-place-affect-mortgage-lending#:~:text=Black%20applicants%20were%20between%201.8,white%20applicants%20across%20neighborhood%20types." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pervasive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> within lending institutions and neighborhoods nationwide, reflects America’s historically inequitable economic systems and social practices, which intentionally excluded Black people and others of color from some of the most basic but most critical aspects of American liberty and progress.</span></p>

    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Racial disparities in home lending</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/14/business/navy-federal-credit-union-black-applicants-invs/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNN analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that Navy Federal approved over 75% of conventional mortgage loan applications by white borrowers, but approved less than 50% of Black borrowers seeking the same loan. It was “the widest disparity in mortgage approval rates between White and Black borrowers of any major lender,” CNN reported. The deep disparity persists</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “even when more than a dozen different variables – including income, debt-to-income ratio, property value, down payment percentage, and neighborhood characteristics – were the same.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Navy Federal denied that its lending practices are discriminatory against Black borrowers, with the credit union’s spokesperson telling CNN its analysis excluded factors like “credit score, available cash deposits and relationship history with lender.” Yet they wouldn’t provide data about those factors to CNN, and, as the media outlet noted, “most of the Navy Federal applications that were denied are listed as being rejected for reasons other than ‘credit history.’” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This news touched off strong responses from fair lending advocacy groups and civil rights organizations and prompted a </span><a href="https://bencrump.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/231217-Oliver-et-al-v-NFCU-Complaint.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">class action lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filed in Virginia’s Eastern District Court Dec. 17, on behalf of Black applicants who had been denied home loans, despite their high incomes and stellar credit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edward Barnes of Portsmouth told 13 News Now that Navy Federal inexplicably denied his mortgage refinance loan last October, a shock to the credit union’s customer of 34 years. Using the same information on his application, Barnes was approved for a loan with another lender two months later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re in 2023. They should be past this. Stuff like this shouldn’t be happening,&#8221; Barnes said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He is right; it seems reasonable to expect this type of discrimination to become less potent as the years go by and the country progresses. Unfortunately, in many aspects of homeownership access and wealth building, America has, shamefully, regressed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022, the Black homeownership rate was 45%, according to the National Association of Real Estate Brokers’s 2023 “State of Housing in Black America” </span><a href="https://www.nareb.com/site-files/uploads/2023/11/SHIBA-Report-2023.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Even though the percentage of Black homeowners has slowly increased since the passage of the 1968 Fair Housing Act, the gap in homeownership rates between Blacks and Whites is larger than it was more than half a century ago,” the report stated. Covertly biased mortgage lending practices help widen the <a href="https://homeofva.org/research-policy/exhibits/credit-inequality/exhibit/" target="_blank">gap</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://dmz1.dhcd.virginia.gov/HB854/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB854 Statewide Housing Study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a January 2022 report </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">commissioned by the Virginia General Assembly, found that 48% of Black households in the commonwealth owned homes, compared to 73% of white households. “The history of </span><a href="https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=5/39.1/-94.58&amp;text=intro" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">redlining</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and race-based federal mortgage programs, </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/15/us/racist-deeds-covenants/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">deed restrictions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> based on race, </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-foreclosures-race/racial-predatory-loans-fueled-u-s-housing-crisis-study-idUSTRE6930K520101004" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">predatory lending programs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2021/08/09/when-it-comes-to-the-racial-wealth-gap-home-appraisals-are-part-of-the-problem/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">discriminatory property appraisals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> contribute to many inequities that the Commonwealth must continue to address,” wrote the study’s authors, Virginia Housing and the Department of Housing and Community Development.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Blacks, others shouldn’t have to obliterate their presence to receive fair home value&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/08/23/blacks-others-shouldnt-have-to-obliterate-their-presence-to-receive-fair-home-value/embed/#?secret=U2EeEmNUwR#?secret=zSnnt7fMhi" data-secret="zSnnt7fMhi" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several federal agencies oversee financial institutions’ compliance with fair lending laws. The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Credit Union Administration monitors Navy Federal’s and other institutions’ “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">financial performance, risk management practices, payment systems, and compliance with laws and regulations,” NCUA’s Ben Hardaway told me in an email. They don’t handle lending or other consumer financial protection-related matters and instead pass on any complaints they receive about these issues from the public to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Since 2019, Hardaway said, the NCUA has referred 2,405 complaints involving Navy Federal to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the same timeframe, the Bureau’s Consumer Complaint Database shows 691 complaints about Navy Federal, concerning either applying for a mortgage loan or a refinance loan (like Barnes’) or problems with an existing mortgage. Of those, 50 came from Virginia; several of them mention Navy Federal’s suspected </span><a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/search/detail/5653655" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">violation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the Fair Housing Act as the basis of the complaint. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last year referred five fair lending matters to the Department of Justice, it said in its annual </span><a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_fair-lending-report_2023-06.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Congress, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">involving discrimination on the basis of race and national origin in mortgage lending (redlining).”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I believe this represents a snapshot of a wider problem; how many would-be Virginia borrowers, denied loans by Navy Federal or other banks, didn’t file a report with the Bureau?</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Equitable solutions</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 10 years since founding <a href="https://www.tealhousecompany.com/tealvilleusa" target="_blank">Teal House Company</a>, a real estate firm servicing central Virginia and Rhode Island, Damon Harris said he has “often” encountered Black people whose mortgage loan applications have been rejected, seemingly without good reason.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s tricky because no one is ‘denied’ for a mortgage; technically [lenders] can&#8217;t say ‘no.’ They can say ‘not right now because of these factors.’ So it&#8217;s hard to nail down those factors, but these classic problems – redlining, the wealth gap, wage inequality – still play a part today.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His company also offers real estate strategy and homebuyer education classes, as well as pathways to responsible home-selling and community development. In addition to the challenges of finding fair lending, Harris said people of color face barriers like wage inequality and disproportionate student loan debt in their quest for homeownership. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And, we have a dire affordable housing shortage in the country and this state, which makes it harder for everyone to find safe, decent homes. Housing is a right and many people are being blocked from that right now.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Education, self-advocacy and dogged persistence are keys to navigating these issues, Harris, a native of Petersburg, Va., said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone needs a buying strategy. You can&#8217;t just wake up Monday and say, let me go buy a house Wednesday. Start the process 12 months in advance, or as soon as you can. Determine what you need and what you want in a home, and how much you can afford.” Would-be buyers can also partner with companies like Harris’, state agencies and housing nonprofits to boost their home buying knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Especially if you&#8217;re a first-time buyer, a partner can explain things you don’t know so you&#8217;re prepared when you talk with a lender. They can also help you find a lender”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you apply for a home loan and are denied, lending institutions “have to send paperwork that explains why,” Harris said. “They are supposed to tell you the specific reason for the rejection; hold them accountable for that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most importantly, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Believe and don&#8217;t be discouraged. It’s a process that can take time but if you keep at it, you will get there.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homeownership may be, to riff off Harlem Renaissance poet Langston Hughes, a dream deferred. A deferred dream, though, is better than no dream at all and gives us an aspiration to focus on as we work to make homeownership not only a bright vision for some, but a waking reality for all. </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In between the sprawling lawns of Loudoun County and the riverside lofts of Alexandria lie clusters of struggling, predominantly non-white neighborhoods that are increasingly left out of the success and prosperity experienced by Northern Virginia as a whole, recent research notes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, conditions in some of those neighborhoods — called “islands of disadvantage” — have been in decline for years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a new </span><a href="https://novahealthfdn.org/resources/lost-opportunities-persistence-of-disadvantaged-neighborhoods-in-northern-virginia" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Center on Society and Health at Virginia Commonwealth University, poverty, rates of people without health insurance, educational attainment, job opportunities and overcrowding all worsened in those neighborhoods between 2013 and 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, the report notes the economic progress seen in some areas was also accompanied by gentrification and displacement of people of color. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What is otherwise a healthy and wealthy area is also home to areas of concentrated disadvantage,” said Dr. Steven Woolf, lead author of the VCU report. “This is not something that is widely known, that people are living in deep poverty just a short distance away from the McMansions and golf courses.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_37105" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:811px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Islands_of_poverty.png" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-37105 size-full" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Islands_of_poverty.png" alt="" width="811" height="693" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Islands_of_poverty.png 811w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Islands_of_poverty-300x256.png 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Islands_of_poverty-768x656.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 811px) 100vw, 811px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A map showing Northern Virginia&#8217;s &#8220;islands of disadvantage.&#8221; These neighborhoods rank in the bottom decile &#8212; or have the worst possible outcome &#8212; in at least one socioeconomic indicator like poverty rate, education, and overcrowded housing. (Courtesy of the Northern Virginia Health Foundation and the VCU Center on Society and Health)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report, “Lost Opportunities: The Persistence of Disadvantaged Neighborhoods in Northern Virginia,” compares census data from 2009-13 and 2017-21 for Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun and Prince William counties and the city of Alexandria to understand the social and economic changes the region has experienced over time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report, commissioned by the Northern Virginia Health Foundation, builds upon previous research led by Woolf that showed the disproportionate amount of non-white residents that make up struggling neighborhoods experience </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/07/03/report-race-ethnicity-and-address-biggest-predictors-of-premature-death-in-nova/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">substantially higher rates of premature death</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> compared to Northern Virginia as a whole. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest research found that between 2009-13 and 2017-21, 92% of Northern Virginia census tracts saw an increase in median income, 73% had a rise in residents with a bachelor’s degree and 59% experienced gains in the proportion of adults with a high school diploma. Poverty and uninsured rates decreased in 52% and 78% of the region’s census tracts, respectively. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, some “islands of disadvantage” experienced opposite trends during those time periods. One section of Bailey’s Crossroads in Fairfax County saw median household income decrease by about $10,000, child poverty rates nearly double to 63% and the overall poverty rate climb to 30%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In one census tract in the Bull Run area of Prince William County where the Hispanic population increased by 53% while the white population fell by 38%, median household income increased by only $2,140, the poverty rate increased by 60% and overcrowded housing increased by 187%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some struggling neighborhoods saw a slight increase in median household income, Woolf said those gains have not risen proportionately to keep up with the cost of inflation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s not enough to keep people out of poverty,” Woolf said. “We live in a time with rising health care costs, rising costs for child care and inflation that’s causing increased prices for food and other necessities.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, economic progress in some areas was accompanied by increases in the size of the white population, suggesting gentrification and displacement of people of color may have also been underway. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers pointed as one example to the Courthouse area of Arlington County, where median household income increased from $87,233 to $132,603 and the poverty rate plummeted from 19% to 5%. However, at the same time the share of the population that was white grew from 48% to 68%, while those of the Black and Asian populations declined by 42% and 72%, respectively. Similar displacement trends were also seen in Old Town Alexandria, areas of Annandale and the historically Black neighborhood of Green Valley/Nauck.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report said it is unclear if the relief programs instituted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, like economic assistance and eviction moratoriums, accounted for some of the progress seen in certain areas, like increases in median income — or if that progress was only temporary. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some might argue that economically struggling Northern Virginia residents should move away from an area where the cost of living is so high, Woolf said it&#8217;s not that simple. Not only is moving unaffordable for many of these families, Woolf said, but “economists and others have shown that regions thrive when there is diversity and when there is equity and opportunity across the population.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So systematically displacing low-income families and people of color from a region is not a healthy strategy for trying to give an opportunity for everyone to thrive,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving forward, Woolf said policymakers need to invest more into marginalized communities and commit resources to improve their living conditions and health. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fairfax County Board of Supervisors Chair Jeff McKay said the county’s </span><a href="https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/topics/one-fairfax" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One Fairfax Policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which was passed in 2016 with the intent of combating racial and social disparities seen in some neighborhoods, aims to address many of the problems identified in the study.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whether it be through building more affordable housing units, creating more public transit options, or fully funding our school budget, we are constantly working towards breaking cycles of poverty and expanding our resident’s access to basic needs,” McKay said in an email. </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>An unprecedented surge in the nationwide construction of new housing — mostly apartments — may finally be making a dent in fast-rising rents that have been making life harder for tenants.</p>
<p>More than 1.65 million housing units were under construction last year, the highest annual number since federal record-keeping started in 1969. This year, the number was even higher — almost 1.7 million in September.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the typical annual rent increase nationally fell to zero in June for the first time since the pandemic began, after peaking at 17.8% in 2021, according to <a href="https://www.apartmentlist.com/research/national-rent-data" target="_blank">Apartment List</a>, a rent information aggregator and research firm. In September, rents fell 1.2%.</p>
<p>Vacancy rates are rising, said Alexander Hermann, a research associate at the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University.</p>
<p>“You’ve had this huge rush to build apartments in the last couple of years, and projects are bigger and bigger. It’s more common now to be building 50 or more units,” he said. “You can start to see where new supply is coming online, you see starker and stronger rent decreases.”</p>
<p>Federal statistics, which don’t track active construction below the regional level, show that construction hasn’t been higher in the Northeast since 1987 or in the Midwest since 2005, and it’s at all-time highs in both the West and South. A growing share of the country’s housing construction is in the South, up from 40% in 2017 to 46% in 2022.</p>

<p>In some places, rents are falling back a little, but they’re still plenty high compared with just a few years ago. In Texas, Austin has seen rents drop more than 6% for the fiscal year ending in September to $1,734 for a two-bedroom — but that’s still up almost 20% from 2020, according to Apartment List.</p>
<p>Austin’s rent decreases are the most in the Sun Belt, according to Apartment List, while its surrounding metro area is issuing more housing permits than any other large metro — “signaling the important role construction plays in managing long-term affordability.”</p>
<p>Travis County, which includes Austin, increased its housing units by more than a third between 2012 and 2022, creating 169,700 new units in that time as its population swelled by almost 230,000, according to a Stateline analysis of census estimates.</p>
<p>Among the arrivals to Austin in the past decade is K.N., a single father who asked to be identified only by his initials because he doesn’t want his children’s schoolmates to hear about his problems. K.N., a tech programmer who moved from San Francisco a decade ago, said his increasingly high rent may force him to move.</p>
<p>The landlord for his two-bedroom townhouse has asked for annual $100 rent increases in recent years, and just asked for another $200, K.N. said, upping his monthly housing costs with utilities to around $2,500.</p>
<p>“It would reduce my disposable income to basically zero, and that’s not wise with all the extras kids need in school,” K.N. said. “I’d have to pinch pennies to the point that it would cause anxiety. Being housing poor is something I’m trying to avoid.”</p>
<p>Despite a good income, K.N. said, he might have to move farther from his children’s school, which now is within walking distance. He moved to Texas in the first place partly to save money on rent in hopes of buying a house. But he says he sees apartment construction everywhere in Austin.</p>

<p>His observations match reality: Last year, Austin built 24 million square feet of apartment buildings alongside 8.7 million square feet of single-family housing, according to <a href="https://data.austintexas.gov/stories/s/New-Residential-Development-in-Austin/wq6n-itt3/" target="_blank">city records</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a similar story nationally, with nearly 1 million apartments under construction as of September. By comparison, there were 914,500 apartments under construction in 2022 and 736,900 in 2021.</p>
<p>The number of single-family homes being built is also high, though the pace has slowed in the past two years. There were about 694,000 homes under construction in September, down from about 736,000 at the end of 2022 and 750,500 at the end of 2021. The last time construction was so high was in 2006, when about 748,000 single-family homes were under construction during the housing bubble before the Great Recession.</p>
<p>The new supply is already having an effect.</p>
<p>Rents dropped in 71 of the nation’s 100 largest cities in the year ending in September. That eclipses the most recent large decrease, in June 2020, when 65 cities had year-over-year declines, according to Apartment List. In early 2022, rents were rising year over year in all 100 cities.</p>
<p>Apartment List said in an October report that construction is one reason vacancies are rising, combined with a decline in remote work as more companies call employees back to the office, which has led to fewer renters in “Zoom towns” in states such as Arizona, Idaho and Nevada.</p>

<p>Other areas with big recent drops in rents are also mostly in the South and West, where construction is at all-time highs. The Austin metro area dropped 6%; Portland, Oregon, dropped 5%; and Atlanta, Las Vegas, Orlando, Phoenix, Salt Lake City and San Francisco all dropped by 4% in the past year as of September.</p>
<p>Some of those areas are, like Austin, just beginning to see modest drops in average rents but remain much pricier than just a few years ago. The Miami metro area, for instance, has had the nation’s biggest jump in rents since 2020, at 40%. Orlando, Florida, rose 32% over the same time, according to Apartment List.</p>
<p>In the past six months, rents dwindled just 1% in each city.</p>
<p>“Recent gains in housing supply have helped to slow rental prices and housing costs, although I would be cautious about calling rent decreases of 1% very significant,” said Randy Deshazo, director of economic development and research at the South Florida Regional Planning Council. Soaring prices are particularly painful in the region, he said, because affordability, in terms of housing costs compared with income, <a href="https://thecapitolist.com/miami-homeowners-devote-81-percent-of-income-to-housing-property-taxes/#:~:text=The%20report%2C%20based%20on%20data,Broward%2C%20and%20Palm%20Beach%20counties." target="_blank">is the worst in the country</a>.</p>

<p>In some parts of the Northeast and Midwest, where the construction boom hasn’t been quite as robust, rents have continued to rise in the past six months as of September. Rents were up by 7% in Providence, Rhode Island, for example. During the same period, the increase was 5% in Boston, New York City and Hartford, Connecticut.</p>
<p>Estimates of the nation’s housing shortage, which many experts blame for high rents, vary. <a href="https://www.fanniemae.com/media/45106/display" target="_blank">Fannie Mae</a> last year estimated that there were 4.4 million too few units in large metro areas, and <a href="https://www.realtor.com/research/us-housing-supply-gap-march-2023/#:~:text=The%20gap%20between%20single%2Dfamily%20home%20constructions%20and%20household%20formations%20grew%20to%206.5%20million%20homes%20between%202012%20and%202022.%20However%2C%20including%20multi%2Dfamily%20home%20construction%20reduces%20this%20gap%20to%202.3%20million%20homes." target="_blank">Realtor.com</a> this year pegged the shortage at 2.3 million units. About 1.4 million units were finished in 2022, the most since 2007, and another nearly 947,000 were finished in 2023 through August, according to a U.S. Census Bureau construction <a href="https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/historical_data/index.html" target="_blank">survey</a>.</p>
<p>Permits issued from mid-2022 to August 2023 point to likely large increases in housing in Utah, Idaho, Florida, Texas, South Dakota, North Carolina, the District of Columbia, South Carolina, Arizona, Tennessee, Georgia and Colorado.</p>
<p>Those states could all see housing stock grow by about 2% above census estimates for mid-2022, the latest available, according to a Stateline analysis.</p>
<p>Nationwide, the number of permits issued in 2023 is down compared with a peak in late 2021 and early 2022, even as the numbers remain high in some states. That’s one reason most analysts expect some kind of slowdown from the recent torrid pace of building, said Hermann, of Harvard’s Joint Center for Housing Studies.</p>
<p>South Dakota’s building permits have fallen back from a 48% surge in 2020 followed by a 24.8% increase in 2022. This year they dropped 37% in the second quarter.</p>
<p>Even so, South Dakota had one of the highest rates of new building permits between mid-2022 and August 2023 — more than 2% of its existing units, or almost 9,000 new housing units, if they all get built.</p>
<p>The initial pandemic boom was “likely induced by more work-from-home options and increased demand for space and land, of which South Dakota has an abundance,” said Aaron Scholl, an assistant economics professor at Northern State University in Aberdeen, South Dakota, who worked on <a href="https://www.dakotainstitute.org/research_analysis/housing-demand-remains-strong-despite-increased-borrowing-costs/" target="_blank">a Dakota Institute report on real estate in September. </a></p>
<p>The recent decline likely points to stagnation in the state’s housing market and eventually its whole economy, Scholl said.</p>
<p>“Building permits are often a leading indicator for not only housing market demand, but the overall economic landscape,” Scholl said. “As the housing market cools, I’d expect the economy to do so as well.”</p>

The city erected the signs in several retail areas. (Roger Chesley/The Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alexandria’s City Council recently voted</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/10/14/alexandria-repeal-panhandling-law/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to repeal some restrictions on panhandling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, noting the regulations violated federal court rulings involving free speech.</span><a href="https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/local/virginia/townhall-held-to-address-panhandling-concerns-in-prince-william-fairfax-counties/65-407e3da3-0a30-4c73-825f-7940a925028c" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Other localities around Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have taken</span><a href="https://www.dailypress.com/2017/10/11/panhandling-is-protected/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">similar actions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the past decade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The unanimous council vote in Alexandria, a city of 155,000, evinces compassion for people often struggling to find food, shelter – and a dose of humanity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bigger issue, though, is this: What are communities doing to transform panhandlers’ lives so they achieve stability – and won’t shuffle along streets with a proverbial tin cup? Also, do we actually </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">harm</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> supplicants when donating spare bills?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I get the impression, based on news reports, the official response is mixed. Some officeholders wish beggars would just disappear and leave residents alone. Others actively direct panhandlers – who are often homeless – to services ranging from mental health counseling to job seeking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We try to encourage people not to give” to panhandlers but donate instead “to one of the many organizations that serve the homeless,” Mary Riley, community programs administrator in Chesapeake’s Human Services Department, told me. Signs around the city, for example, urge people to “contribute to the solution” by donating to local charities and directing the homeless population to a housing crisis hotline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few years ago, Chesapeake opened a</span><a href="https://www.cityofchesapeake.net/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=183" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">resource center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where homeless individuals can take showers, wash their clothes, get a meal and receive help landing a job. Some 25 to 30 people visit the center each day, Riley said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fairfax County goes even further: It runs a program called</span><a href="https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/publicworks/operation-stream-shield" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“Operation Stream Shield”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in which homeless persons are paid to pick up litter, landscape and remove invasive plants in waterways. It started as a pilot project in 2019 and now includes nonprofit organizations that partner with the county.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The locality copied the idea from a program that began in 2015 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, called</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2017/03/22/give-panhandlers-a-new-task/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s A Better Way.”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> That city wanted to reduce panhandling, remove litter and provide dignity through work. (The city has since overhauled the program using a “a holistic approach to do case management and other supportive services,” Heidi Shultz, Albuquerque homeless program division manager, told me this week.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several communities around the country – including</span><a href="https://whyy.org/articles/new-philly-work-program-offers-alternative-to-panhandling/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Philadelphia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.oklahoman.com/story/news/local/2022/08/06/okc-program-helps-panhandlers-homlessness-jobs-housing/65388965007/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Oklahoma City</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – have adopted components of Albuquerque’s original model, tailoring it to their own circumstances and goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Philadelphia, for example, the program uses a lottery to select who “won” the chance to work that day. The lucky few earn $50 for a half-day’s work cleaning up streets around the City of Brotherly Love.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pat Herrity is Springfield’s longtime representative on the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors. He said ending panhandling is a public safety issue, too. People begging on roadways put themselves and motorists at risk – the latter as they slow down while being generous. They could get rear-ended.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve all seen close calls,” Herrity told me Wednesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The county’s clean-up program last year collected 270 tons of litter and 373 bags of invasive plants, he said. Some 30 participants garnered full-time employment, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s impressive. Maybe even life-changing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re like me, you probably go through a range of emotions when encountering panhandlers: Many look vulnerable, especially elderly women and adults who bring children with them. They pull at our heartstrings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or they may be on a never-ending grift, taking advantage of our sympathy – and naiveté. Some may look intimidating. “I’ve had businesses tell me that employees have left to go panhandle” because it’s more lucrative, Herrity said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Riley, from Chesapeake, calls some beggars “professionals” who raise a lot of money but aren’t homeless. That’s not always the case, however.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is giving a couple of bucks, or even a couple of Lincolns, so bad? Or does such generosity do more harm than good, allowing people to use the cash for drugs or alcohol?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I remember a column I wrote for</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2017/03/22/give-panhandlers-a-new-task/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginian-Pilot in 2017</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in which I’d interviewed a frequent panhandler who was begging along an interstate exit in Virginia Beach. He was well known to local police.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="aBevXkuMsl"><p><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2017/03/22/give-panhandlers-a-new-task/" target="_blank">Give panhandlers a new task</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Give panhandlers a new task&#8221; &#8212; The Virginian-Pilot" src="https://www.pilotonline.com/2017/03/22/give-panhandlers-a-new-task/embed/#?secret=cS3P0EslGb#?secret=aBevXkuMsl" data-secret="aBevXkuMsl" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same day the column ran, a guy called me claiming to know the panhandler and his family. He said the panhandler was playing on the goodwill of people, had a home to live in and wasn’t destitute.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My takeaway? We simply don’t know all the circumstances when we encounter folks begging for help – and looking like they need it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why the responses in places like Chesapeake and Fairfax County are laudable. Some people will always try to get over. Others, though, would jump at a chance to put away their tin cups. </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every three years, a nationwide group of building safety professionals known as the </span><a href="https://www.iccsafe.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">International Code Council</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (ICC) publishes updated model building codes that form the basis for most U.S. state and local building codes. ICC codes address essential features like structural integrity, fire safety, plumbing and energy use. As technologies improve, so do the model codes. A home built to the 2021 </span><a href="https://codes.iccsafe.org/content/IECC2021P1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">International Energy Conservation Code</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (IECC), for example, uses </span><a href="https://www.energycodes.gov/determinations" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">9.38% less energy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than one built to the 2018 model code, which was itself a </span><a href="https://www.energycodes.gov/sites/default/files/2021-07/2018IECC_CE_Residential.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">significant improvement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the 2015 model code, etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most home buyers take these things for granted. We don’t know the ins and outs of building technologies or codes, and we don’t want to. It is the job of ICC professionals to set modern standards, and the job of state and local government to ensure builders meet them. Right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Except it doesn’t always work that way. Some states and localities do adopt each new iteration of the model codes as a matter of course; Maryland is one such state. Across the river in Virginia, however, important energy efficiency elements of the residential building code are stuck all the way back in 2009, because the builder-dominated board in charge of Virginia’s building code refuses to adopt more rigorous standards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This intransigence has cost Virginia residents millions of dollars over the years in higher energy bills, especially for heating and cooling. A July 2021 analysis by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory </span><a href="https://www.energycodes.gov/sites/default/files/2021-07/VirginiaResidentialCostEffectiveness_2021_0.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">showed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that adopting the 2021 IECC would save Virginians $2.5 billion over 30 years, the typical mortgage term. Their analysis assumed mortgages included the added cost of meeting the </span><a href="https://newbuildings.org/key-takeaways-from-recent-iecc-code-development-hearings/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">updated requirements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, so the $2.5 billion is pure savings, reflected in yearly cash flow savings averaging $250 per homeowner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Faced with high utility bills, owners of existing homes sometimes spring for expensive retrofits to upgrade heating and cooling systems, install new windows and add insulation. These investments often pay off in lower utility bills, but it costs more to retrofit than to build it right the first time. There are also limits to how much energy can be saved through retrofits. It can be very difficult, for example, to add insulation to the walls of an existing home. The right time to make a house weather-proof and energy efficient is during design and construction.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Builders resist meeting the highest efficiency standards for one simple reason: it costs more to build high-efficiency homes, cutting into profits. </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/02/08/affordable-housing-concerns-tank-energy-efficiency-proposal/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Builders insist</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> they are just trying to keep home prices down, but that rings hollow. Anyone who has gone house-shopping knows the price of a home is determined by supply and demand, not building cost. Builders will charge whatever they can get.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/01/27/general-assembly-should-require-building-code-updates/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Builders also say</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> home buyers don’t ask for efficient homes, but that claim is also suspect. Unlike granite counters and high-end finishes, energy upgrades are frequently invisible to buyers, so they don’t know to ask for them or how to evaluate any claims a builder makes about them. Let’s face it, most of us wouldn’t know an </span><a href="https://www.energystar.gov/saveathome/seal_insulate/identify_problems_you_want_fix/diy_checks_inspections/insulation_r_values#:~:text=R%2DValue%20is%20a%20measure,and%20locations%20in%20the%20home." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">R-value</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if a batt of insulation fell on our heads. Nor should we have to know. This is why we have building codes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, protecting consumers from drafty homes and high utility bills is not a priority of the building industry and its allies that control Virginia’s code adoption process. For years the Board of Housing and Community Development (BHCD) has refused to adopt the full model efficiency code, leaving old exceptions in place. Standards for wall insulation and air leakage (the measure of how drafty a home feels) haven’t been updated since 2009.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cost to residents mounts with each failed opportunity. Most people don’t buy new homes, after all. They buy (or rent) existing homes built according to previous building codes. BHCD’s repeated failures to raise standards condemns residents to decades of poorer-quality homes. Lower-income Virginians, in particular, end up </span><a href="https://www.energy.gov/scep/slsc/low-income-community-energy-solutions#:~:text=Energy%20burden%20is%20defined%20as,which%20is%20estimated%20at%203%25." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">energy burdened</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by living in homes that are unnecessarily expensive to heat and cool.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The General Assembly knows this is a problem. Virginia law has long required BHCD to adopt standards consistent with model codes such as the IECC. Faced with the board’s continuing intransigence, in 2021 legislators passed a new</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+ful+CHAP0425+pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> directing BHCD to “consider adopting Building Code standards that are at least as stringent as those contained in [each] new version of the IECC.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Consider” looks like a loophole you could drive a truck through, but the new law goes on to add a specific requirement that the BHCD “shall assess the public health, safety, and welfare benefits of adopting standards that are at least as stringent as those contained in the IECC, including potential energy savings and air quality benefits over time compared to the cost of initial construction.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">that</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sounds like a slam-dunk for adoption of the IECC standards, given the studies confirming that building to the higher standards benefits occupants and the public with </span><a href="https://smartenergy.illinois.edu/indoor-air-quality/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">better air quality</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and with utility bill savings over time that far exceed what it costs a builder to meet those standards. Legislators and advocates who worked to pass the legislation reasonably expected BHCD to adopt the 2021 IECC in its entirety, if not go beyond it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That did not happen. During the slow process of updating Virginia’s residential building code over the ensuing months, BHCD never took the new law seriously. It never conducted the required analysis, and there is no indication it even “considered” adopting the full 2021 IECC standards, in spite of in-depth comments from experts and testimony from the public.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The building code update BHCD </span><a href="https://register.dls.virginia.gov/details.aspx?id=10597" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in December of 2022 and approved in its </span><a href="https://www.dhcd.virginia.gov/sites/default/files/Docx/bhcd/book-6-final.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">final form</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on August 28 of this year neither removed past weakening amendments nor adopted more stringent standards.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"> Indeed, BHCD even decided this year to roll some commercial efficiency standards back to 2006 levels! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps this sad state of affairs should not surprise us too much, given who our governors  – past and present  – have appointed to </span><a href="https://www.dhcd.virginia.gov/board-housing-and-community-development-bhcd#:~:text=The%20Board%20of%20Housing%20and,executive%20director%20of%20the%20Virginia" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the board</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. By my count, 8 of the 11 appointed members</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"> represent home builders; another member works for a mortgage company. The foxes are in charge of the hen house. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those appointments were not a matter of luck. Public </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/candidates/180223/donors_sector_totals/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">records</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> show construction and real estate companies gave almost $13 million to Glenn Youngkin’s 2021 campaign for governor, the second largest industry donor to his campaign. Four years previously, the industry donated “only” $2.5 million to the campaign of Youngkin’s Democratic predecessor, Ralph Northam. In both cases, the board appointments that followed heavily favored the home building industry, with the result that Virginia’s residential building codes seem to be permanently stuck in the past.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia leaders pride themselves on being pro-business, but that doesn’t have to mean being anti-consumer. The commonwealth as a whole would benefit from a housing stock that is more weather-resilient and healthier for occupants, that saves energy, and that reduces residents’ utility bills.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is that really too much to ask?</span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>By Sam Brown / Capital News Service</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Several Virginia municipalities have recently drafted or passed ordinances to regulate short-term rentals.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Scrutiny of short-term rentals mirrors a nationwide trend. Companies like Airbnb and Vrbo have become popular lodging options for tourists, as well as people in need of temporary housing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Municipalities have pushed back against the rental options for reasons that include parking issues, noise complaints, trash and septic tank use volume. Supervisors have also cited concern over loss of hospitality tax revenue, as well as limiting available housing inventory.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Approximately 30 localities throughout the U.S. have regulated short-term rentals, according to a Business Insider <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/cities-fighting-airbnbs-with-regulations-for-short-term-rentals-2022-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.businessinsider.com/cities-fighting-airbnbs-with-regulations-for-short-term-rentals-2022-5&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1697736179817000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1i9sXeF6B3OxcHoqifL14j">report</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Most Virginia short-term rentals are found in more populous areas and tourist destinations, according to a Capital News Service analysis of the market research site AirDNA.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Louisa County</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The Louisa County Board of Supervisors earlier this month passed <a href="https://www.louisacounty.gov/3224/18321/Short-Term-Rental-Ordinance" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.louisacounty.gov/3224/18321/Short-Term-Rental-Ordinance&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1698179703396000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3E2AAvU-ZI8i99OF_IEVZX">changes </a>to the short-term rental ordinance, which will take effect Jan. 1, 2024.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There is now a more formal process in place for an owner to provide their contact information to the county and an HOA, if applicable. An owner must provide renters with copies of noise ordinance and solid waste policies. They must also provide the definition of special occasion and gatherings, to determine if an event would require a conditional use permit.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The county staff had <a href="https://louisacova.portal.civicclerk.com/event/76/files" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://louisacova.portal.civicclerk.com/event/76/files&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1698179703396000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2smiNVBemiq1EkS3F_fzDo">recommendations</a> that if passed would have taken effect in 2025. Those included requiring rental owners to provide documentation of septic system inspections and repairs, provide contact information, and offer one parking space per bedroom.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Citizens told county supervisors they are concerned about the septic tank failures caused by over-occupied rentals. Some of the proposed occupancy restrictions hoped to limit the impact on septic systems and prevent failures.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Rentals became a hot topic in Louisa due to Lake Anna tourism. There are fewer short-term rentals than in a city like Richmond or Alexandria, but the rentals are entire homes, and a majority larger than three bedrooms, according to AirDNA data.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Short-term rentals spiked in Louisa in recent years, with peak occupancy in the warmer months. There are currently 500 such rentals, according to a county spokesperson.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some residents are worried about the water quality due to septic failures.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We need to be inspecting these septic systems and particularly the ones where they are being overloaded in rentals,” said Phillip Winston, a Mineral resident who spoke at the meeting.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality <a href="https://www.deq.virginia.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/15423/637915769872530000" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.deq.virginia.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/15423/637915769872530000&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1698179703396000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3xhf9kynYqknJSmWnliyXs">added</a> Lake Anna to the state’s impaired, or “<a href="https://www.cbf.org/blogs/save-the-bay/2022/08/lake-anna-added-to-virginia-dirty-waters-list.html#:~:text=This%20summer%2C%20the%20Virginia%20Department,due%20to%20harmful%20algal%20blooms." target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cbf.org/blogs/save-the-bay/2022/08/lake-anna-added-to-virginia-dirty-waters-list.html%23:~:text%3DThis%2520summer%252C%2520the%2520Virginia%2520Department,due%2520to%2520harmful%2520algal%2520blooms.&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1698179703396000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3AAa4lg3dTCBe2Z7miZbY9">dirty</a>” waters list last year, due to algae blooms. Parts of the lake have been closed multiple times due to the blooms.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Lake Anna Civic Association recommended that occupancy be limited to two guests per bedroom to reduce the risk of septic tank damage, according to its <a href="https://www.lakeannavirginia.org/page-18219" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.lakeannavirginia.org/page-18219&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1698179703396000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2b800VTckZB8Jdhb83Va8q">website</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some zoning districts in the county are agricultural. Short-term rentals in these zoned districts are protected from most local regulation, per an <a href="https://www.oag.state.va.us/files/Opinions/2023/22-036-Beasley-issued.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.oag.state.va.us/files/Opinions/2023/22-036-Beasley-issued.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1698179703396000&amp;usg=AOvVaw21K_eeWFdn2yEnBQUTqZ3s">opinion</a> issued earlier this year by the state attorney general&#8217;s office.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Richmond</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">There are over 1,000 listed units in Richmond as of September, an increase of 76% in a three-year period, according to AirDNA data. However, the majority of the units in Virginia are not operated legally, according to a <a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-07-25/short-term-rental-airbnb-vrbo-adu-sup-str" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-07-25/short-term-rental-airbnb-vrbo-adu-sup-str&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1697736179817000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1bejOa8IrFFWlqgCu-GtE4">VPM review</a> of city permits in June.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Richmond City Council recently passed a long-debated ordinance that put several new regulations on short-term rentals, including reducing the number of rentals allowed on a lot in residential zoned areas.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Other <a href="https://richmondva.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6298765&amp;GUID=3EC00050-F614-4217-9BF1-71EF982B494D&amp;Options=ID%7CText%7C&amp;Search=short-term+rentals" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://richmondva.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID%3D6298765%26GUID%3D3EC00050-F614-4217-9BF1-71EF982B494D%26Options%3DID%257CText%257C%26Search%3Dshort-term%2Brentals&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1697736179817000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2dnqAYT77F2e755YURYc5q">ordinance</a> changes now require the rental to be located at the host&#8217;s primary residence in all residential-zoned districts and limit the maximum occupancy of a rental from 10 to eight people.</p>
<p dir="ltr">City leaders also extended the length of a short-term rental certificate to 730 days and voted to allow homeowners to build an accessory dwelling unit, within parameters, without a permit. These are smaller units like an in-law suite or carriage house.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The changes will <a href="https://richmondva.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6298765&amp;GUID=3EC00050-F614-4217-9BF1-71EF982B494D&amp;Options=ID%7CText%7C&amp;Search=short-term+rentals" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://richmondva.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID%3D6298765%26GUID%3D3EC00050-F614-4217-9BF1-71EF982B494D%26Options%3DID%257CText%257C%26Search%3Dshort-term%2Brentals&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1697736179817000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2dnqAYT77F2e755YURYc5q">help</a> create a “convenient, attractive, and harmonious community” by limiting the number of transient visitors in residential neighborhoods, according to city planners.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Only homeowners can offer short-term rentals, something that 1st District City Councilmember Andreas Addison said there is confusion about.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He heard from several renters upset that they would be unable to generate money from renting out their apartments.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“You cannot rent out your rented apartment,” Addison said. It could be cause for eviction.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Richmond increased regulations because of disturbances to residents, such as parking, trash and late-night noise, according to Addison.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Short-term rentals I do see as a potential cause of nuisance because if you are not an owner of that house, and you’re renting it out, you don’t really care about the neighborhood,” Addison said. “You&#8217;re just there for the money.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Caroline McDonald is a physical therapy student who plans to use Airbnb during the four months she is temporarily placed at a Richmond hospital. She used Airbnb because of the ease of the rental process, which is a monthly payment with an advance deposit.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Someone still lives there, but I’m just detached from their house,” McDonald said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Most rentals will primarily come from pre-existing additions, because of the costs of building a unit solely for a short-term rental, according to Addison.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I feel like a lot of the concerns and objections being raised and elevated have a place of legitimacy, but I also think they may be a little excessive,” Addison said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tourism was a metric the council heavily considered when passing the ordinance.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We can&#8217;t expect people that are going to come to visit the James River with a kayak and a bike to stay in a hotel,” Addison said.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Hampton</h4>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even as the housing market in Virginia has slowed, prices remain high statewide, researchers told the Virginia Housing Commission Tuesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The theme is slow yet competitive,” said Ryan Price, chief economist for Virginia Realtors. “A lot of things are driving that, primarily the increase in interest rates, which has deterred both buyers and would-be sellers, but also our inventory, the lack of inventory that we have out there.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While new home construction in Virginia has continued to grow in 2022, building still lags levels seen in the state historically, said Hamilton Lombard, a demographer for the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service at the University of Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the financial crisis of the late 2000s, “we were around 60,000 new homes annually,” he said. “We’re below 40,000 right now. … If you go back before that and look at the averages we had in the ’90s and ’80s, we were building about 50,000 new homes every year.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Declines, however, aren’t even across Virginia. Data presented to the commission shows new home construction is down significantly in Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads compared to a decade ago and continues to be low in the coalfields region of Southwest Virginia. In contrast, Richmond and smaller metropolitan areas in places like Halifax and Danville have seen upticks in activity. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_36058" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:918px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Home-construc-trends.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-36058" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Home-construc-trends.jpg" alt="" width="918" height="631" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Home-construc-trends.jpg 918w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Home-construc-trends-300x206.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Home-construc-trends-768x528.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 918px) 100vw, 918px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Virginia home construction trends. (Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Richmond has really been the one big standout area when you look at Virginia,” said Lombard. “It’s built a large number of homes in recent years. The numbers we have for 2022 are the highest we had in any of our records my office has collected going back to the 1980s.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, high interest rates are discouraging not only buyers but sellers. While the average interest rate on mortgages held by existing Virginia homeowners is 3.8%, the average interest rate for new mortgages is 6.4%, said Price, making many reluctant to move.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The incentive to lose that 4%, 3%, 2.5% rate and get a 7% rate — there is no incentive unless you’re forced to move,” he said. “That spread is really deterring a lot of homeowners to list their homes.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, home sales have slowed. Between January and June of this year, sales statewide were down 24% compared to the same period last year. Data presented to the commission showed market activity declining in 90% of Virginia’s counties and cities, with the sharpest slowdowns seen in Spotsylvania, Franklin, Bedford and Rockingham counties and the city of Newport News. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simultaneously, Virginia home prices are trending upward in the majority of jurisdictions. Since 2018, Price found they have risen 36%, from an average statewide price of $285,000 in 2018 to $389,000 now. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_36059" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1270px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Housing-prices.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-36059 size-full" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Housing-prices.jpg" alt="" width="1270" height="721" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Housing-prices.jpg 1270w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Housing-prices-300x170.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Housing-prices-1024x581.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Housing-prices-768x436.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1270px) 100vw, 1270px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  (Virginia REALTORS)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some regions, the uptick in remote work spurred by the pandemic appears to be exacerbating price hikes as higher-paid workers move from larger metropolitan areas to smaller ones where wages are lower. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we’ve seen in metro Richmond is that if you’re coming from the West Coast and making West Coast wages or you’re coming from Northern Virginia and D.C. making those wages, you’re coming into this region, folks who live here and are living with our wages are being beat out every time when they’re going for a purchase,” said commission member Laura Lafayette, who is also CEO of the Richmond Association of Realtors. “And they’re also being squeezed on the rents, because folks making D.C. wages can afford more rent.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While many of the trends Virginia is experiencing are playing out nationwide, Virginia home construction is lagging that of neighboring Tennessee and North Carolina. Lombard said Tennessee is building about a third more housing units than Virginia, while North Carolina is building double. Both have also seen far higher job growth than Virginia since January 2020, with Virginia adding 56,800 jobs, Tennessee 172,900 and North Carolina 284,500, according to Price. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“North Carolina is kicking Virginia’s butt as far as job growth,” said Del. Danny Marshall, R-Danville, Tuesday. “And one of the main reasons they’re doing that, as we hear all the time, is North Carolina’s march to a zero tax rate for corporate. So they are going away from us. Tennessee’s the same situation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More affordable housing elsewhere may be a key driver of population losses from Virginia to more southern states, said Price.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They’re building more housing in these states,” he said. “So the fact there are homes available, there are good jobs there, it is attracting a lot of folks away from Virginia. We also have good jobs here, but our housing is more expensive, particularly in the job centers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked by Del. David Bulova, D-Fairfax, if there was anything the state could do policywise to ease some of the housing pressures, Price said many solutions have emerged from local governments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The places that have started to move the needle particularly on the supply side are really making strides at the local level moreso than the state level with respect to zoning changes — whether it be loosening up the zoning in some places, whether it be concentrating a lot of the new housing in specific corridors that are near transit, that are near job centers, whether it be making the process to densify in some cases easier, making the permit process easier,” he said. “But I also think there could be ways to incentivize local governments to do this type of work at the state level.”</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After several years of attention-grabbing reports on high eviction rates in Virginia, the state has begun collecting data on the number and location of evictions that occur over the course of a year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The effort, which is being carried out by the Virginia courts that issue writs of eviction — the legal documents that authorize a local sheriff to evict someone — follows legislation that passed during the last General Assembly session. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We hear a lot about an eviction tsunami and an eviction crisis, and it’s hard to get an idea of what the real scope of that is,” Del. Marcus Simon, D-Fairfax, told a House subcommittee this January. “This is just a data collection process we’re trying to get started here so that we can get our arms around how big of a problem, how big of an issue this is in the commonwealth.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since July 1, sheriffs have been required to return executed writs to the court that issued them so the state can systematically track evictions. Brandy Singleton, a senior attorney in the Supreme Court of Virginia’s Office of the Executive Secretary, told a Virginia Housing Commission work group Monday that the court system has also updated its case management system to capture that information.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What that will allow us to do is then run an annual report to see statewide how many of these are actually being executed and returned to the clerk’s office, and then that data in turn can be broken down by locality or a variety of other variables,” said Singleton.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation requiring the data collection, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb1836" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 1836</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1089" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 1089</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, was supported by the Virginia Apartment Management Association and the Apartment and Office Building Association. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The measures passed both chambers with bipartisan support. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2018, researchers with </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/04/07/upshot/millions-of-eviction-records-a-sweeping-new-look-at-housing-in-america.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Princeton University’s Eviction Lab ranked five Virginia cities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — Richmond, Hampton, Newport News, Norfolk and Chesapeake — among the top 10 municipalities with the highest eviction rates in the nation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislators and policymakers scrambled for solutions. In 2019, the General Assembly passed </span><a href="https://www.apnews.com/3ace98069238435c9a8980c72d90eaca" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than half a dozen reforms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> intended to drive down eviction rates, including new requirements for written leases, longer periods for tenants to pay rent and fees to avoid eviction and the creation of an eviction diversion pilot. </span><a href="https://scholarship.richmond.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1555&amp;context=pilr" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other more tenant-friendly reforms followed in 2020 and 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

(Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the end of the year, the federal government could be offering new homebuyers an innovative deal to build equity in their investments twice as fast. If the Low-Income First-Time Homebuyers (LIFT) Act is passed as part of an anticipated bipartisan housing bill later this year, a new program under the Department of Housing and Urban Development could offer first-time, first-generation homeowners a 20-year mortgage for roughly the same monthly payment as a typical 30-year loan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the legislation could extend a hand up to communities that have been excluded from building wealth through homeownership for decades, the proposal, if implemented, may be hindered by the biggest barrier to new homebuyers: a lack of supply.</span></p>

Mark Warner and Tim Kaine </span><a href="https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2023/7/warner-colleagues-introduce-legislation-to-help-first-time-first-generation-homebuyers-narrow-the-wealth-gap" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">revived</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the LIFT Act — first introduced in 2021 — as part of a federal push to empower “individuals traditionally underrepresented in the housing market to grow equity twice as fast.” Targeting first-time, first-generation homebuyers who earn 120% of their area median income or less, the bill is specifically designed to help narrow the United States’ gigantic </span><a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/featured-stories/racial-differences-economic-security-racial-wealth-gap" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">racial wealth gap</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Although much of modern America likes to pretend we live in a race-neutral, merit-based society far removed from the impacts of slavery and segregation, the impacts of centuries of prejudicial policies can still be seen in the drastic differences in Black and white household wealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, white Americans hold </span><a href="https://www.rand.org/blog/rand-review/2023/05/what-would-it-take-to-close-americas-black-white-wealth-gap.html#:~:text=White%20Americans%20hold%20ten%20times,wealth%20inequality%20did%20not%20exist." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ten times</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more wealth than Black Americans and are 28 times more likely to become millionaires. As of this May, the median Black household in the U.S. had </span><a href="https://www.rand.org/blog/rand-review/2023/05/what-would-it-take-to-close-americas-black-white-wealth-gap.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">just $24,000</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in savings, equity and investments compared to the $189,000 in wealth of the median white household.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a recent Richmond roundtable on wealth-building, Warner highlighted Virginia&#8217;s increasingly diverse population, noting that at least 35% of Virginians are people of color. “If everybody isn’t getting that fair shot, then the enterprise we call Virginia isn’t going to do as well. It’s not only morally right but from a business standpoint it’s the right thing to make sure people get access to capital and access to housing.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If passed, the LIFT Act would allow HUD to subsidize the mortgages of those who qualify to functionally make their 30-year loans into just 20-year repayment plans. That means after ten years, a LIFT Act homebuyer would build up twice as much equity in their investment compared with a typical homebuyer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the LIFT Act, Sen. Warner also put forward the renewal and expansion of the federal </span><a href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/lihtc.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low-Income Housing Tax Credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the </span><a href="https://www.cdfifund.gov/programs-training/programs/new-markets-tax-credit" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Market Tax Credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as additional items the bipartisan housing bill could pursue to help ease America’s </span><a href="https://housingmatters.urban.org/research-summary/addressing-americas-affordable-housing-crisis" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">housing affordability crisis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Such proposals were music to the ears of Greta Harris, president and CEO of the </span><a href="https://www.betterhousingcoalition.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Better Housing Coalition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the last three years the cost of delivering a unit of housing has almost doubled here in the Richmond market, so it’s getting tougher to deliver and the need is growing,” she said at the roundtable. “A comprehensive package of housing strategies would be really helpful. That becomes the launching pad for education and for economic growth.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Supply shortage</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such rising costs of construction and </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/05/business/single-family-zoning-laws/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">local land use limits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on where and how much housing can be built could, however, hinder the LIFT Act’s ability to reduce the racial wealth gap, should the proposal receive Congressional approval later this year. Innovative federal financing programs can only prove fruitful if homebuyers have enough supply to purchase.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Why are Virginia counties regulating starter homes out of existence?&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/01/18/why-are-virginia-counties-regulating-starter-homes-out-of-existence/embed/#?secret=8vpjj9u2FH#?secret=ZXMxvo3wNO" data-secret="ZXMxvo3wNO" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dire shortage of housing units has been the main reason local purchase assistance programs have </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/04/11/fighting-over-348-units-whats-next-for-arlingtons-pro-housing-push/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">failed in Arlington</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for example. What good is a subsidized loan to a homebuyer if there are no houses in their price range to buy?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We hear the laments of young buyers that they are buying later,” said </span><a href="https://www.sothebysrealty.com/eng/associate/180-a-df23013011071037081/daphne-macdougall" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daphne MacDougall</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a broker associate and realtor at the Steele Group in Richmond. “We don’t have enough houses in lower price points because we just don’t have enough houses. It’s supply and demand, so people in higher price points are going after homes that would normally sell at a lower price point because homes in general are still hard to find.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such struggles are not unique to the commonwealth, according to Mike Urban, the managing director of homeownership at Virginia Housing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The trends you are seeing in Virginia are similar to the national trends,” he said via a phone interview. “Listings are down, home prices are up, and interest rates have risen. Those are three of the biggest barriers currently.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although his agency offers Virginians </span><a href="https://www.virginiahousing.com/en/homebuyers/closing-cost-assistance-grant" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">closing cost assistance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, free </span><a href="https://www.virginiahousing.com/en/homebuyers/homebuyer-education" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">homebuyer education</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.virginiahousing.com/en/homebuyers/down-payment-assistance-grant" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">down payment assistance grants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “obviously we can’t do anything about the lack of inventory,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/16/president-biden-announces-new-actions-to-ease-the-burden-of-housing-costs/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">analysis of the crisis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> released by the White House last year laid out how America’s supply shortfall of 1.5 million missing homes has been years in the making. “Fewer new homes were built in the decade following the Great Recession than in any decade since the 1960s — constraining housing supply and failing to keep pace with demand and household formation,” stated the briefing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite some </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/11/21/governor-glenn-youngkin-yimby-in-chief/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pro-housing rumblings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin in recent years, the commonwealth is still not adding enough new homes to keep up with population growth, let alone enough units to ease the pressure on the </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/landing-2021-affordable-housing-in-virginia.asp" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">29%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Virginians who are housing cost burdened, meaning they spend more than 30% of their income on shelter. However, the state could take some practical steps to prime the well of housing production, according to Andrew Clark of the Home Builders Association of Virginia.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="0kaDX5UjlD"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/11/21/governor-glenn-youngkin-yimby-in-chief/">Governor Glenn Youngkin, YIMBY-in-chief?</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have inadvertently and sometimes advertently capped production,” he said. “A lot of it is localities with </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/01/18/why-are-virginia-counties-regulating-starter-homes-out-of-existence/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">zoning set up to minimize the number of lots and homes that can be built</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but it’s not just the localities. The [U.S. Army] Corps of Engineers has had the same budget at the state level for probably a decade. Complexity of development is going up and demand is going up, but you don’t have more state capacity to make it happen. If we’re telling agencies they have review authority, we ought to give them the resources they need to actually make it happen.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Bipartisan bill</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As chair of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown will have the final say on whether Warner’s LIFT Act will be included in the bipartisan housing bill anticipated later this year. Alongside Kaine’s </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/06/07/proposed-federal-housing-law-could-reinforce-protections-for-veterans-and-voucher-holders/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fair Housing Improvement Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the LIFT Act is similarly in limbo as to whether it will make the cut. Warner, however, is hopeful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am very optimistic that we are going to take a bite on the housing issue this year,” he said. “This is an area where we have got to do more. We’ve been talking about it for a long time. We’ve got to put this on the table.”</span></p>

(Christie Marra)</p><p><em><strong>By Christie Marra</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claudia Guerrero Barrera enjoys her role as community engagement specialist for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia-based housing nonprofit </span><a href="https://www.projecthomes.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">project:HOMES</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, spending afternoons sitting around a kitchen table, drinking coffee, and chatting with women in the Bermuda Estates neighborhood of Chesterfield. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They discuss their relief at having persuaded the county to place a school bus to stop in their newly paved cul-de-sac, so the children no longer have to wait on a busy strip of Route 1. They nibble on homemade treats, sharing plans for parties they’ll have at the community center once it is finished.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less than two years ago, Claudia had never heard of Bermuda Estates Mobile Home </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Park, and the Bermuda Estates residents she now shares easy chatter with were at that time </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fearful of being forced out of their homes. The owner, J&amp;J Equities, LLC, was selling the park, and the prospective buyer planned to redevelop the land and build townhomes. This meant the nearly 40 families living at Bermuda Estates would be displaced, their homes, meticulously tended rose gardens and memories plowed under to make way for new homes that would not be affordable to them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like most mobile home park residents across Virginia, the majority of families at Bermuda Estates earn less than 60% of the area median income, which is less than $60,000 per year for a family of four. But a rare collaboration changed the course of events at Bermuda Estates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chesterfield County government and project:HOMES worked together to chill the developer’s desire to buy the park; the county emphasized the cost of repairing the homes to bring them into code compliance and the non-profit offered significantly more than the private investor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to donors’ interest in the future of Bermuda Estates, and the willingness of their lender to provide acquisition financing despite the significant improvements the park </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">needed, project:HOMES purchased Bermuda Estates in September 2020. As Madeline Petrie, project:HOMES’ Director of Mission Advancement, noted, “Purchasing a (mobile home) park wasn’t in our strategic plan, but it fits into our mission: Improving lives by improving homes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Project:HOMES’ approach to improving the lives of Bermuda Estates families has been </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">slower and more resident-centered than the approach often taken by the for-profit companies </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that have been eagerly </span><a href="https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/mobile-home-park/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">buying up mobile home parks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Virginia and across the nation. Instead of immediately developing a plan to raise lot rent and shifting the cost of all utilities onto the residents, project:HOMES engaged a consultant to help them ascertain the residents’ needs and priorities and, most importantly, to build trust. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We went into this knowing we weren’t going to raise lot rent orchange any rules until we built trust with the residents,” explained Lee Householder, Executive </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Director of project:HOMES. Part of that trust-building included making sure all residents could </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">access their leases and park rules easily, so these were provided to each resident in English and Spanish. And project:HOMES hired Guerrero Barrera as their bilingual community engagement specialist. “We feel safer because we know if we have any issues, we just go to Claudia,” one resident said.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_35917" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:150px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_2750-rotated.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-35917" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_2750-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Claudia Guerrero Barrera project:HOMES&#8217; bilingual community engagement specialist, stands in the neighborhood&#8217;s newly-repaved cul-de-sac. (Christie Marra)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building trust also required repairing a park that had suffered decades of neglect. “I </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">administered repairs to over half of the homes in the park with funds that had been granted </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and donated specifically for that purpose,” Zack Miller, project:HOMES Director of Housing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Innovation, said. Miller is also overseeing the infrastructure repairs, which began shortly after </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">project:HOMES purchased the park with addressing the uneven roads, failing sewer system and dangerously overgrown trees. “You have a patchwork of improvements made over the decades, about which there may or may not be records,” Miller said. For example, “Dominion had no information about the lights in the park. The previous owner had been getting free power for decades.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Installing additional street lights is on the list of improvements project:HOMES plans to make, along with installing fencing between the park and neighboring Skateland roller rink, building a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">covered bus stop for the children, expanding and renovating the community center and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">creating a playground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The benefits of nonprofit ownership to Bermuda Estates and its residents haven’t gone </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">unnoticed by Dan Cohen, Director of Community Enhancement for Chesterfield County. Cohen supported project:HOMES’ acquisition of the park by ramping up pressure on the prior owner about his multiple code violations and helping provide Community Development Block Grant funding, which flows from the federal government, for the purchase. “Bermuda Estates is a model,” Cohen said. “You have an owner who sees more than profits, who has compassion for the folks who live there and who wants to make a difference, to keep improving the park.”Cohen would like to see more nonprofits purchase parks in Chesterfield.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent legislative efforts to incentivize mobile home park owners to sell to nonprofits </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">failed to reach the governor’s desk during the last General Assembly session. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1578" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 1578</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, introduced by Delegate Paul Krizek, and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB922" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 922</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, introduced by Senator Ghazala Hashmi, would have provided a tax credit to owners who sold their mobile home parks to housing nonprofits such as project:HOMES. Although both bills died in their respective subcommittees, there was talk of creating a new grant fund for nonprofit acquisition of parks in the budget. But with little likelihood of fattening up the amendments enacted through the “skinny” budget on April 12, it’s unlikely that such a fund will be established this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until these or similar measures are put into place, Bermuda Estates may be the only </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nonprofit-owned mobile home park in central Virginia, joining East End Mobile Home Park in Manassas (</span><a href="https://www.insidenova.com/news/prince_william/local/manassas/sale-completed-of-east-%20end-mobile-home-park-saving-park-from-closure/article_e1d6f920-f71a-11e7-9585-%20cb13f3736d3b.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">purchased</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Catholics for Housing in 2018,) and Southwood Mobile Home Park in Albemarle (</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/realestate/in-an-old-mobile-home-park-%20in-charlottesville-the-residents-get-a-say-in-the-redevelopment/2019/06/05/b3396420-8569-%2011e9-a491-25df61c78dc4_story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bought</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Habitat for Humanity in 2007) as the only nonprofit-owned parks in Virginia. And the ownership of Bermuda Estates may yet change, as project:HOMES is openly interested in selling the park to its residents once they have finished stabilizing it. But the residents do not seem interested in a change that would take the nonprofit out of the park.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “God bless project:HOMES,” said long-time resident Bonnie Newton, who was the first to purchase a new, energy efficient home built by project:HOMES, financed with a low-interest loan from Habitat for Humanity and sold to Newton for well below market rate, thanks to a subsidy obtained through grants and donations. “God Bless them and bless the people that’s helping them.”</span></p>

The 64-year-old nursing home aide always paid on time — even at the height of the pandemic.</p>
<p>But in 2022, Redrick’s landlord moved to evict her from the three-bedroom apartment she shared with her granddaughter and infant great-grandson. The landlord wanted to sell the building, Redrick said, and thought it would show better if it were vacant.</p>
<p>Redrick initially planned to fight the eviction, knowing she wouldn’t find another three-bedroom apartment she could afford.</p>
<p>“But I just gave up,” she said. “I didn’t want to fight anymore.”</p>
<p>Redrick has since moved to a smaller apartment — and begun fighting for something else. This year, housing advocates in New York state mounted a fierce campaign in support of a once-obscure policy called “just cause eviction,” which requires that landlords provide a valid reason — a just cause — such as unpaid rent or property damage, for removing tenants. Such policies aim to increase housing stability and prevent arbitrary, retaliatory or discriminatory evictions.</p>
<p>Since 2019, California, Oregon and Washington have all adopted “just” or “good” cause policies, while Colorado, Connecticut, Maryland and New York considered them. More than 20 cities — including Baltimore, Boston, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. — also have adopted some form of just cause protections, often over the objections of landlords.</p>
<p>Landlord and real estate groups argue that the policies would make it more difficult to remove problem tenants and adapt to changing business conditions, and could make the housing shortage worse by pushing some to stop offering rentals altogether.</p>
<p>Just cause protections likely will be tested as tenants lose pandemic-era welfare benefits and housing costs continue to increase. While evictions fell sharply during the COVID-19 pandemic, they have since returned to or exceeded normal levels in many places, according to Princeton University’s Eviction Lab, which tracks filings in 10 states and more than 30 cities.</p>
<p>Researchers at the lab <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2116169119#:~:text=Between%202000%20and%202018%2C%2069.7,1B" target="_blank">estimate</a> that landlords filed an average of 3.6 million eviction cases each year between 2000 and 2018.</p>
<p>“That’s a huge number of households facing the possibility of losing their homes and all the disadvantages and risks that go along with that,” said Peter Hepburn, the assistant director of the Eviction Lab and an assistant professor of sociology at Rutgers University-Newark. “The fact that … we’ve returned to the status quo on evictions is deeply disappointing and cause for serious concern.”</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A long-standing protection</h4>

	</h4>
<p>Just cause policies have existed since at least 1974, when New Jersey introduced new rules around evictions as part of its response to a statewide housing shortage. Several states also observe long-standing just cause eviction laws that apply only to tenants of mobile home parks.</p>
<p>But just cause policies became more widespread after 2007 and the onset of the Great Recession, as new construction crashed across the country and rents skyrocketed in many urban centers. The tenants’ rights movement also grew rapidly during the 2010s, fueled in part by concerns about gentrification and displacement.</p>
<p>Against that backdrop, New Hampshire adopted a just cause policy in 2015, followed by Alameda and San Jose, California, Boston and Washington, D.C. The COVID-19 pandemic sparked another flurry of legislation: At least 19 cities or states have proposed just cause legislation since 2020, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition and local media reports.</p>
<p>“During the pandemic, we saw how critical consistent housing is to the health and safety of our residents,” said Maryland state Del. Jheanelle Wilkins, a Democrat, who has repeatedly sponsored just cause legislation.</p>
<p>While those statewide bills stalled, Baltimore passed a just cause policy in 2021. Washington state and a string of cities in New York and California also adopted similar measures during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Just cause policies vary widely by jurisdiction, but commonly allow landlords to evict tenants or decline to renew leases for a list of predetermined reasons. Those include circumstances such as failure to pay rent, property damage, disorderly conduct, criminal activity and lease violations, as well as the landlord’s desire to live in the unit or take it off the market.</p>

<p>Some just cause laws also include rent-stabilization measures that regulate by how much landlords can raise rents each year. Advocates argue such policies, which have been adopted in California and Oregon and proposed in New York, prevent tenants from experiencing de facto evictions if their rents are abruptly raised to unaffordable levels.</p>
<p>Evaluating the success of these policies is difficult, in part because they vary so considerably by jurisdiction. Different places also experience different trends and types of evictions according to their local policy landscape and housing markets, said Tim Thomas, the research director at the University of California, Berkeley’s Urban Displacement Project. That can make it challenging to isolate the effects of specific factors that contribute to eviction.</p>
<p>Importantly, because nonpayment of rent is always considered a “just cause,” the just cause policies, by design, only protect a minority of tenants.</p>
<p>“It’s kind of a complicated mess — I liken it to the gun debate,” Thomas said. “You have people on both sides who feel very strongly, and there’s not a lot of research to back up some of that intensity.”</p>
<p>Preliminary research does suggest that forms of just cause legislation decrease evictions, Thomas said — albeit by small numbers. A 2019 study published in the Journal of Public &amp; International Affairs, a peer-reviewed graduate student journal, found that four California cities with just cause protections experienced slightly fewer evictions than similar cities without them.</p>

<p>More recently, a 2022 research brief published by the Urban Displacement Project found that just cause protections appeared to help one of every 100 extremely low-income households remain in gentrifying neighborhoods when they otherwise would have been pushed out.</p>
<p>Housing advocates argue that those impacts, while small, are powerful in combination with other tenant protections, such as right-to-counsel laws, legal defense funds and bans on source-of-income discrimination.</p>
<p>They also add up across a population of thousands or millions of tenants. Violet Lavatai, the executive director of the Tenants Union of Washington State, said she believes just cause has kept “hundreds” of Washington tenants in their homes since it passed two years ago.</p>
<p>The law is not perfect, Lavatai acknowledged. Some landlords, she said, have devised “new, creative ways” to get rid of people they don’t want — such as moving tenants to month-to-month leases, which are not as tightly regulated.</p>
<p>But through the union’s tenant rights hotline, which renters can call with housing and eviction questions, Lavatai has coached “countless” renters on the law’s protections, she said.</p>
<p>“We’ve heard it all: ‘I don’t like the way your voice sounds, you annoyed me, you didn’t water the plants correctly — now you have to go,’” she said. “We have a lot of landlords out there who don’t operate like that. But there are also bad characters who don’t really care about their tenants.”</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Landlords ‘strongly’ oppose regulations</h4>

	</h4>
<p>As just cause eviction policies have spread, however, they’ve also faced what Maryland Del. Wilkins calls a “strong, well-financed opposition.” Major landlord and real estate industry groups allege that eviction protections make it more expensive and time-consuming to remove problem tenants.</p>
<p>Critics also argue that rent stabilization measures, like those in effect in California and Oregon, make it more difficult for landlords to respond to changing business conditions and could prompt some to pull out of the market altogether.</p>
<p>In 2022, Vermont Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican, vetoed a Burlington just cause provision over concerns it would exacerbate the state’s housing shortage. Later that year, council members in St. Paul, Minnesota, also weakened a 5-month-old rent stabilization measure after the city saw a steep drop in new construction.</p>

	</div>
	</div>

	
<div class=" newsroomBlockQuoteContainer ">
<div class="newsroomBlockQuoteAuthorContainer">
<p>For Chris Athineos, the owner of six small apartment buildings in Brooklyn, New York, and an outspoken critic of rent regulations, such harms are a growing cause of concern. New York City has long required a “just cause” for evictions in rent-controlled apartments, but statewide legislation first proposed in 2019 would extend those protections to all tenants and impose a cap on annual rent increases.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Athineos and his parents, who bought their first building in the 1960s, enjoy an unusually close relationship with their renters, he said: They’ve attended tenants’ weddings and funerals and celebrated holidays together.</p>
<p>But as just cause legislation gained momentum in New York, Athineos sold two of his properties and made plans to raise rents across his remaining portfolio. His business already has been squeezed, he said, by an increase in insurance prices and a slate of recent, costly city housing regulations.</p>
<p>“It’s like a ‘use it or lose it’ situation — if I don’t take that rent increase now, I can’t make up for it down the road if I need to,” he said. “They want to cap rents, but no one is capping our expenses.”</p>
<p>New York did not pass its just cause eviction bill this session — much to Athineos’ relief and Charlene Redrick’s disappointment.</p>
<p>While legislative leaders fought to include the measure in state budget negotiations, and later to pass it as part of a last-minute package of housing reforms, they ultimately failed to reach an agreement with Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat who favors other ways to address the housing crisis.</p>
<p>Similar just cause bills also died in Colorado and Connecticut last session.</p>
<p>State lawmakers and housing advocates have vowed to redouble their efforts next year. But in Buffalo, Redrick said she worries about the tenants who face eviction in the interim: She sees a lot of homeless people sleeping in the laundromat or hanging out in the street near her new apartment.</p>
<p>“Seeing people be evicted and homeless, I’m still hoping there’s something we can do to affect what is happening,” Redrick said. “I’m afraid for other people to go through what I went through. That’s my main focus.”</p>

(Wyatt Gordon/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the four and a half years that Shiri Yadlin worked as a housing coordinator for a D.C.-based church, she heard from her formerly incarcerated clients again and again about an abundance of barriers to securing permanent housing. After she began her current job as a senior program manager for the </span><a href="https://www.csh.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corporation for Supportive Housing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, she decided to conduct a landscape assessment of the issue that resulted in some shocking findings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Someone who has been incarcerated is ten times more likely to be homeless, and if you’ve been incarcerated more than once your chances double to be homeless,” she said. “It’s harder and harder to get out of homelessness, the more experience you have with incarceration.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Susceptible to insecurity</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, where the incarceration rate exceeds the national average (which is already </span><a href="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/profiles/US.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the highest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the world), </span><a href="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/profiles/VA.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">749 out of every 100,000 people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are currently locked up in a jail, prison, immigrant detention or juvenile justice center. That translates to over 64,000 Virginians who will be susceptible to housing insecurity when they are released, not to mention the tens of thousands of others who have already served their time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a lot of people we are talking about here,” Yadlin added. “It’s not just a small subset of our population.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the ideological cradle of </span><a href="https://virginiahistory.org/learn/civil-rights-movement-virginia/massive-resistance#:~:text=Senator%20Byrd%20promoted%20the%20%22Southern,prevent%20integration%20of%20the%20schools." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Massive Resistance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there is an unsurprising racial dynamic at play as well. Black Virginians are </span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/virginia-news/who-is-incarcerated-in-virginias-prisons/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over four times more likely</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be incarcerated than whites.  For juveniles, that figure is even higher, according to Yadlin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The system that has the most disparity is </span><a href="https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/CalAIM/Justice-Involved-Initiative/Pages/home.aspx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">justice-involved</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> youths,” said Yadlin. “Black children in the commonwealth are eight times more likely to have justice involvement than anyone else.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Barrier barometer</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Yadlin had heard that background checks can present a huge barrier to housing for formerly incarcerated individuals, she wanted to understand exactly how that process alienates and excludes people. To do that, she and her team </span><a href="https://www.csh.org/supportive-housing-101/data/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">analyzed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the tenant selection plans for 123 properties across the commonwealth built using </span><a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-low-income-housing-tax-credit-and-how-does-it-work" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low-Income Housing Tax Credits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as such buildings have a higher likelihood of serving her target population.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After examining which convictions management companies screened for, how far they look back into individuals’ records for transgressions and the processes they use to select or deny potential tenants, Yadlin’s team found a plethora of problems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While nearly every property screened potential tenants for violent offenses, a third of them also disqualified applicants for petty offenses such as loitering or trespassing that are </span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/cities-try-to-arrest-their-way-out-of-homeless-problems" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">often associated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with periods of homelessness. All properties denied potential tenants for drug distribution, but half of them also dismissed applicants for simple possession.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Background check companies are supposed to calculate the lookback period on any felony or misdemeanor from the date which the crime was committed. However, all too frequently such firms count from the date a person was released from serving their sentence, making a long lookback period more punitive. 15 tenant selection plans had no lookback period for offenses but eight of them featured incredibly long lookback periods for both felonies and misdemeanors. Even more concerning: nine percent of all properties screened for arrests which imply no guilt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to the application process, two of the biggest barriers result from properties not disclosing why a potential tenant was turned away and not offering an appeals process. A third of the sites Yadlin surveyed engaged in both practices. Increasing transparency in the application process could be an easy fix, if property owners and managers prove willing to implement it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the problem is complex, the list of solutions proposed by the Corporation for Supportive Housing is straightforward: remove public nuisance and non-violent offenses from the screening process; offer notices of denial and an appeals process; and undertake a nuanced individual assessment, rather than throwing applicants out at the first red flag.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just over half of the properties surveyed bothered to consider the circumstances around specific applicants’ cases. Without individual assessments, a teenager who had the cops called on them while experiencing a mental health crisis decades ago can appear just as suspect as an adult who committed robbery last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/pdredge/pdr-edge-frm-asst-sec-051722.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">science</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also bears out the wisdom behind not punishing people for offenses long past, according to Yadlin. “Any impact of a criminal record on your performance as a tenant disappears after five years for a felony and after two years for a misdemeanor,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such findings are in alignment with </span><a href="https://www.dpor.virginia.gov/Suggestions" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">guidance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for landlords issued by Virginia Housing last year, which was designed to encourage more access for formerly incarcerated folks. Where the commonwealth has issued non-binding guidance, other jurisdictions have legislated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both New Jersey and Montgomery County, Maryland have </span><a href="https://www.njoag.gov/about/divisions-and-offices/division-on-civil-rights-home/fcha/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">passed</span></a> <a href="https://www.npr.org/local/305/2021/04/21/989466043/law-bans-montgomery-county-landlords-from-rejecting-people-convicted-of-minor-crimes" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">laws</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to prevent landlords from denying people housing for petty offenses. Since both bills are relatively recent, advocates like Yadlin don’t yet have enough data to determine their efficacy, but they are hopeful.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Let the funding flow</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the founder and director of </span><a href="https://www.where-we-help.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where We Help</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Richmond-based supportive housing organization, Aisha Bullard has witnessed the struggles of individuals leaving incarceration from all sides. With just 70 short-term transitional housing beds and 32 long-term units that they lease out, Bullard and her team have helped over 3,100 people in D.C. and the commonwealth since she began her business in 2005.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where more corporate landlords can be unforgiving, she has seen many mom and pop property owners offer folks second chances. Our housing system has a history of treating formerly incarcerated folks harshly, but marginalized people and good samaritans have forged their own networks that can be hard to capture in a survey, according to Bullard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People who have been justice-involved or who have had mental health issues, they have networks they are navigating that are more informal,” she said. “There are committed people trying to help this subset of the population by any means necessary, but I just don’t think enough of the money is headed to them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many affordable housing providers in the nation do not rent units to people with any kind of criminal background, no matter their stated missions of “housing for all.” Even public housing — designed to serve as the shelter of last resort in the United States — will </span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2004/11/18/no-second-chance/people-criminal-records-denied-access-public-housing" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">often turn away</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> potential tenants with convictions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To this day, the Department of Housing and Urban Development </span><a href="https://nextcity.org/urbanist-news/hud-new-orleans-public-housing-convictions-prison-discrimination#:~:text=HUD%20Excludes%20People%20With%20Convictions,Local%20Solutions%20Can%20Help." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">allows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> public housing authorities broad leeway to discriminate against justice-involved individuals. That doesn’t sit right with Bullard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“HUD caused problems for decades [by] saying people with convictions couldn’t live in their units,” she said. “Serious money needs to be put in place to help those populations that were disparately impacted in the past. When you’re scoring people for [Low-Income Housing Tax] credits, you need to give some extra points for helping this population. It’s the economics that need to change in order for help to flow down to this group of people, and I haven&#8217;t heard a lot of the big affordable housing providers talk about it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over her nearly 20 years in the transitional and supportive housing industry, some of Bullard’s best tenants have been those who have committed the most serious crimes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It makes sense that the person who was in prison for 25 years doesn’t want to go back and do that again,” she said. “If people do commit a new crime, it’s a crime out of poverty, for lack of opportunity. If communities were more accepting of folks who have served their time, then our recidivism rate would go down.”

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More funding for supportive housing should not only build more units in her opinion. Those individuals being freshly released also need skills training for simple everyday problems they haven’t dealt with in a long time or ever before, like when a toilet overflows or the dryer malfunctions. Despite all the barriers in their way, the majority of formerly incarcerated folks make it in the real world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you ask where justice-involved people live, some live in beautiful homes in Chesterfield with a gorgeous backyard,” said Bullard. “Plenty of justice-involved people are just model citizens buying homes and living their lives like everyone else.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But with enforcement spotty and education lacking, the </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/01/05/has-virginia-done-enough-to-end-housing-discrimination/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">realities of the housing market</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> haven’t kept up with the letter of the law. The </span><a href="https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/kaine-peters-and-schiff-introduce-bill-to-protect-veterans-and-low-income-families-from-housing-discrimination" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fair Housing Improvement Act of 2023</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — a bill introduced in April by Sen. Kaine and California Reps. Scott Peters and Adam Schiff — could help hinder ongoing discrimination by enshrining protections for veterans and voucher holders at the federal level.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Data on discrimination</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just </span><a href="https://www.nmhc.org/research-insight/analysis-and-guidance/source-of-income-laws-by-state-county-and-city/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">20 states</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in America currently prohibit housing discrimination on the basis of one’s source of income. Data surrounding protections for people serving in the military or with veteran status is not as robust; however, at a minimum Virginia and </span><a href="https://lawatlas.org/datasets/state-fair-housing-protections-1498143743" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">eight other states</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have banned prejudicial treatment of servicemembers and their dependents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite such anti-discrimination laws, the national total of fair housing complaints still increased to over </span><a href="https://nationalfairhousing.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2022-Fair-Housing-Trends-Report.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">31,000</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2021, the latest year for which data is available. Furthermore, complaints based on source of income discrimination also rose over 2020 figures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In advance of a coming report on the matter, </span><a href="https://homeofva.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing Opportunities Made Equal of Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been conducting testing across Eastern, Central and Southwest Virginia. Staffers called and pretended to want to rent housing using vouchers from 13 providers across Hampton Roads,19 providers around Greater Richmond, and seven providers in the Roanoke region. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although source of funds protections are actually quite broad, this first round of testing focused exclusively on vouchers. The goal of HOME of Virginia’s efforts was to determine if landlords are calculating potential tenants’ income accurately and treating voucher holders the same as other applicants. The results were both disheartening and promising.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There was a good deal of confusion over how to calculate income and a lot of mistakes and people needing to talk to their manager to get it right,” said Brenda Castaneda, HOME of Virginia’s legal director. “There were some landlords still saying they don’t take vouchers, but the more common trend was landlords not knowing what they needed to do to take vouchers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The region with the fewest cases of illegal denials of applicants was Southwest Virginia, where the </span><a href="https://rkehousing.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roanoke Redevelopment and Housing Authority</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conducted an intensive training program in 2021 with local landlords to inform them of their responsibilities. Such progress indicates one potential solution to ending discrimination against veterans and voucher holders, according to Castaneda.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ignorance still results in a lot of discrimination against voucher holders, so there needs to be more education and guidance for housing providers as to how to apply the law,” she said.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/RepAdamSchiff/status/1650990153769295873" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/RepAdamSchiff/status/1650990153769295873</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The power of protections</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a former fair housing lawyer, Kaine understands the importance of education in reducing discrimination in the rental market. Although the protections contained in his Fair Housing Improvement Act of 2023 would be groundbreaking in dozens of states across America, adding a federal layer of protection could also help underscore the policy changes made here in the commonwealth over the last few years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The attention that we could get on this by making this national law would be part of educating prospective tenants as well as landlords,” he said in a phone interview. “It’s not like every landlord follows in intricate detail the actions of the General Assembly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overlapping layers of protections can be especially impactful for people of color, who represent a disproportionate share of voucher holders. Although decades of education and enforcement have made it clear to most landlords that explicit racial discrimination is illegal, denying applicants based on their source of income can sometimes serve as a proxy method to deny Black and Latino people seeking housing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Reinforcing these anti-discrimination policies at the federal level is fantastic because it adds an additional layer of gravitas,” said </span><a href="https://www.newvirginiamajority.org/tram_nguyen" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tram Nguyen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a co-executive director of New Virginia Majority, a statewide group that lobbies on behalf of marginalized peoples. “Every tool in our toolbox is important to make sure families can stay in their homes, and this bill would mean that no matter what zip code you live in here in Virginia or across the country, you enjoy those same protections.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because housing discrimination law </span><a href="https://nextcity.org/urbanist-news/these-lawsuits-could-turn-the-tide-on-section-8-discrimination" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">relies upon tenants filing complaints</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, if an applicant isn’t aware of her rights after being denied housing on a wrongful basis, no enforcement can take place. Since the pandemic struck shortly after the General Assembly enacted protections for veterans and voucher holders, policy analysts have had a hard time gauging the impact of the new anti-discrimination laws in such an unusual housing market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Each transaction is an opportunity to educate people and build a case record, but for so long we didn’t have as many new transactions when we had everyone in lockdown,” said Melissa Bondi, the state and local policy director for </span><a href="https://www.enterprisecommunity.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enterprise Community Partners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “There is a decrease in rejections when landlords know that these protections are in place and that is even better than enforcement because then things are going smoothly without the system having to do anything to correct it.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A federal fix?</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown — the chairman of the </span><a href="https://www.banking.senate.gov/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — is working to assemble a bipartisan housing reform bill to present sometime later this summer. Although this iteration of Kaine’s bill doesn’t have a Republican co-sponsor yet, he is still searching for a GOP lawmaker from a state with protections for veterans and voucher holders to join him as a patron.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even without a conservative co-sponsor, Kaine is hopeful he can get the The Fair Housing Improvement Act of 2023 included as one of the provisions of Brown’s larger housing reform bill. Constituents across the commonwealth who have shared their struggles in accessing safe and affordable shelter have made this bill one of Kaine’s top priorities, according to the senator.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For years, housing was a top ten issue, not a top five issue, but now housing is a top three issue wherever I go in Virginia,” he said.</span></p>

(Marco Sanchez/  The Piedmont Environmental Council)</p><p><strong><i>By Anand Colaco, Nathaniel Doty, Nadia Gallimore, Naad Kundu and Shea Miller Novello</i></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the state of the American dream when people can no longer afford the very home they own? For residents of many Charlottesville neighborhoods, gentrification and rising property values have dimmed the bright vision of homeownership.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charlottesville must expand its current property tax relief program to shield marginalized and low-income communities from displacement, preserve the city&#8217;s distinct character and prevent the erosion of its cultural fabric. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charlottesville’s housing history – from </span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/video/raisedrazed-bg0gek/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vinegar Hill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><a href="https://www.cvillepedia.org/Fifeville_and_Tonsler_Neighborhoods_Historic_District" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fifeville</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – is fraught with racial  discrimination, making it imperative to protect the area’s low-income communities and communities of color. Increased housing prices and property taxes are in the process of writing yet another dark chapter, pricing out families from their homes. According to a 2020 </span><a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/711015" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stanford University study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, gentrification like that currently seen in Charlottesville disproportionately affects minority communities, “in ways that exacerbate neighborhood inequality by race and class.” A progressive tax relief program would mitigate these effects by preventing the displacement of longstanding homeowners. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite its darker history, Charlottesville also has a great diversity and cultural identity that ought to be celebrated and preserved. Approximately 54% of the residents in Charlottesville that would qualify for the newly implemented tax relief policy are Black. While some argue that gentrification of historically Black neighborhoods would desegregate the area, it in fact only decreases diversity in Charlottesville as a whole by pushing Black residents out of town. New businesses and developments catering to incoming residents at the expense of the existing community cement this cultural loss. By simply extending our tax laws to cover more of our neighbors, we can keep low-income and minority families living in their homes and preserve Charlottesville’s important and unique identity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While gentrification brings investment into communities in the form of tax dollars and new businesses, it also brings instability to neighborhoods. More investment may increase home values, but at the cost of rapidly rising property taxes that those on a fixed income may not be able to pay. Ultimately, efforts to &#8216;revitalize’ neighborhoods can do more harm than good for longtime residents. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only does expanding the current tax relief program protect the most vulnerable members of our community, but it also makes good financial sense, too. In a report written by the Charlottesville Low-Income Housing Coalition they note that, “In 2019, some 43 percent of Black, 40 percent of Hispanic, and 32 percent of Asian households spent more than 30 percent of their incomes on housing, compared with 25 percent of white households.” This policy promotes economic stability by encouraging homeownership, enabling our neighbors to save and spend money in the local area, and creating the type of generational wealth that ensures a sustainable future for the city. The alternative, forcing people out of Charlottesville, will only harm our economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not often do you hear college students discussing the finer points of tax policy, but Charlottesville and the state of Virginia are important to us and require us to look far and wide for solutions. Tax reform is not a silver bullet to fix the displacement crisis in our community, but it is one of a suite of tools the city ought to consider. Charlottesville residents can raise the issues of gentrification and displacement during city council work sessions and advocate for the expansion of the current elderly and disabled property tax relief to everyone who falls within the income range. The issue may be multifaceted and complex, but one thing is clear: our community must stand united to stop the displacement of our neighbors and ensure a sustainable future for our city.</span></p>

Despite all of the problems, her toddler still calls her apartment provided by the Richmond Redevelopment and Housing Authority home, and Fredericka believes more folks around town could benefit from such stability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think they should build more [public housing],” she said. “There needs to be more affordable housing out here. The jobs are not paying enough for people to pay market rate rent. Where are they going to go?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tension between an unsafe status quo and concerns about what comes next are not unique to Gilpin Court. Whether it’s funding for </span><a href="https://www.wdbj7.com/2023/02/22/virginia-receives-public-housing-funding-address-ongoing-affordable-housing-crisis/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">maintenance backlogs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Roanoke, total </span><a href="https://patch.com/virginia/oldtownalexandria/samuel-madden-redevelopment-gets-alexandria-city-council-approval" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">teardowns and replacements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Alexandria, or </span><a href="https://www.wavy.com/news/local-news/hud-awards-5m-in-grants-to-newport-news-for-public-housing-projects/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">revitalization initiatives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Norfolk and Newport News, if public housing is to remain a backstop against homelessness, then things must change. But how?</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">&#8216;We can no longer stay with the status quo&#8217;</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the </span><a href="https://architecturerichmond.com/2016/01/29/neighborhood-profile-gilpin-court/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">all-white</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> leadership of the Richmond-Petersburg Turnpike Authority demolished the heart of Jackson Ward in 1958 to build what is today Interstate 95, Gilpin Court was known as </span><a href="https://www.styleweekly.com/richmond/the-lost-neighborhood/Content?oid=1363378" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apostle Town</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the saintly street names which filled the area. Encircled by highways and Shockoe Valley, Virginia’s largest public housing complex and the </span><a href="https://richmondmagazine.com/news/news/q-a-steven-nesmith/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">oldest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between Miami and New Hampshire was designed to isolate rather than integrate its residents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following only partial efforts toward modernization made back in the 1980s, Gilpin is also in a deplorable state of disrepair. The last structural assessment conducted determined 98% of the public housing complex’s 781 units to be “physically obsolete,” according to RRHA’s new CEO, Steven Nesmith. With 98 buildings spread across 38 acres, the maintenance backlog for Gilpin is millions more than the City of Richmond could ever reconcile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why Nesmith re-issued a </span><a href="https://clpha.org/jobs/2023/request-qualifications-2023-13-gilpin-court-co-developer" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">request for qualifications</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (RFQ) to redevelop Gilpin in February. The original proposal released last October under the former interim CEO outlined a </span><a href="https://richmondfreepress.com/news/2022/oct/20/gilpin-court-community-undergo-major-change/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$300 to $400 million dollar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> redevelopment project on the site. The withdrawal was the result of Nesmith’s desire not to pursue </span><a href="https://www.hud.gov/RAD" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rental assistance demonstration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> funding in favor of leveraging bond financing “to do something bigger and more transformational,” he said in a recent phone interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the RFQ just closed in April, RRHA anticipates picking redevelopment partners in just a couple months. Although Nesmith can’t share details on the proposals until a decision has been made, he did hint that “the quality of those that have submitted is satisfying.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A dream redeveloped</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Growing up in public housing in a family on welfare, Nesmith rose through the ranks of the affordable housing industry to become a </span><a href="https://archives.hud.gov/news/2003/pr03-071.cfm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">deputy secretary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the Department of Housing and Urban Development during the second Bush administration and understands the importance of quality communities for people in poverty. That’s why his vision for Richmond’s “Big Six” public housing courts and their roughly </span><a href="https://richmondmagazine.com/news/features/creighton-history/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">9,100 residents</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is anything but modest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Nesmith doesn’t want to expand public housing in Virginia’s capital, he has agreed to a one-for-one replacement of units — long a </span><a href="https://richmondmagazine.com/news/my-take-one-for-one/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">major fight</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between residents and RRHA’s leadership.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the neighborhood that comes after Gilpin, Nesmith envisions women- and minority-owned businesses, a resident reinvestment fund, grocery stores, a community health clinic, a job training center, and a mixture of multi-family rental units and single-family homeownership options for current public housing residents. Additionally, the whole mixed-use, mixed-income redevelopment will be done to meet Mayor Levar Stoney’s goal of an additional </span><a href="https://www.nbc12.com/2023/03/14/mayor-stoney-city-council-set-address-affordable-housing-crisis-richmond/#:~:text=Mayor%20Levar%20Stoney.-,As%20part%20of%20his%20State%20of%20the%20City%20address%20earlier,low%2Dincome%20residents%20by%202030." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1,000</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> new affordable rental units each year and in concert with Richmond’s </span><a href="https://www.rrha.com/redevelopment/jackson-ward/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackson Ward Community Plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to stitch Apostle Town back together with its southern neighbor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Gilpin’s residents are as well taken care of as those who moved out of the </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/2022-08-04/creighton-court-demolition-met-with-mixed-feelings" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">now demolished</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://richmondmagazine.com/news/features/creighton-court/" target="_blank"> Creighton Court</a> and into the mixed-income </span><a href="https://www.cnu.org/what-we-do/build-great-places/church-hill-north%E2%80%94armstrong-renaissance" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Armstrong Renaissance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> community next door, then LaFonda Page — a former public housing resident and current organizer for the </span><a href="https://www.justice4all.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legal Aid Justice Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — believes the redevelopment will be welcomed by residents with open arms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think most of them want to get up out [of] there,” she said. “People deserve better. They don’t want to stay there. The older ones might want to come back, but most of the younger ones don’t want to. I don’t care about no damn new appliances. I wouldn’t want to be back there either.”</span></p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Maryland the role model</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That RRHA has opted to demolish and redevelop Richmond’s public housing courts comes as no surprise to Paul Williams, executive director of the </span><a href="https://www.publicenterprise.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Center for Public Enterprise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a nonprofit think-tank working to grow the public sector.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is what every public housing authority in the country is doing,” he said. “The national political trajectory has forced public housing authorities into a position where this is the only option to meet the needs of residents. Until Congress appropriates the funds that public housing requires and needs, conversions are the only viable tool in housing authority directors’ pocket to give residents the quality housing they deserve.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Congress slashed funding for </span><a href="https://www.savesection9.org/about" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Section 9</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> housing projects like Richmond’s Big Six in the 1990s, </span><a href="https://www.hud.gov/topics/housing_choice_voucher_program_section_8" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Section 8 housing choice vouchers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have been the main model for public housing authorities to move residents out of dilapidated dwellings and into higher quality units. That’s how RRHA relocated the 200 seniors living in </span><a href="https://www.rrha.com/redevelopment/fay-towers/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fay Towers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Gilpin Court to three new affordable apartment buildings in Highland Park and Jackson Ward several years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One community breaking the mold is Montgomery County, Maryland. Local officials there established a revolving </span><a href="https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/DHCA/housing/multifamily/affordable_housing_opportunity_fund.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Affordable Housing Opportunity Fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to begin expanding the county’s public housing stock. Since the program allows developers to use their own financial resources to fund construction, no HUD grants or federal subsidies are necessary to complete innovative projects, such as constructing affordable housing atop </span><a href="https://www.fox5dc.com/news/montgomery-county-considers-using-public-building-projects-to-solve-affordable-housing-crisis" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">public buildings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like </span><a href="https://apps.montgomerycountymd.gov/BASISCAPITAL/Common/Project.aspx?ID=P451502" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fire stations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.mymcmedia.org/council-wants-affordable-housing-near-libraries-rec-centers/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">libraries and recreation centers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right now, housing authorities are constrained in what they can build by the lack of money from Congress,” explained Williams. “What makes Montgomery County’s approach so attractive is that it allows public housing authorities to build and maintain more affordable publicly-owned housing than they are able to with their current allotment of subsidies.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, no Virginia localities use such a model to improve and increase their public housing stock. Nesmith hopes the establishment of the </span><a href="https://www.rrha.com/redevelopment/rdc/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond Development Corporation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this February could have a similarly transformative impact by leveraging private sector bonds and lending.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A similar entity in Norfolk has created </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/12/21/why-is-a-norfolk-community-development-entity-investing-everywhere-but-norfolk/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more questions than affordable housing answers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by lending everywhere but the city it’s supposed to serve, but Nesmith guarantees the new RDC will be “Virginia focused only, especially the Richmond region.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Williams doesn’t knock housing authorities for getting creative to care for their residents given the tremendous deferred maintenance backlog and the paltry financial support from elected officials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If they want other options, they have to come in the form of money, which housing authorities don’t have,” he said. “Congress could give it to them. State governments could give it to them, but almost no state budget in the country gives housing authorities the money they need to do things in a better way.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beloved by economists and </span><a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/does-georgism-work-is-land-really" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Georgists</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, land value taxes in their purest form assess how much property owners pay based on the “unimproved” value of their land rather than the value of what, if anything, is built upon it. While our current tax system punishes property owners for putting their parcels to higher use and disincentivizes development, a land value tax is designed to encourage growth in city centers while lowering the tax burden on the average homeowner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If land value taxes are a practical, pro-growth policy, then why hasn’t a single Virginia locality made the switch?</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Richmond the role model?</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Virginia’s current code, only the Cities of Fairfax, Poquoson, Richmond and Roanoke are allowed to enact a land value tax. Although none of the four has even come close to passing the required local ordinance to make it the law of the land, Richmond is the most recent jurisdiction to ask for the authority.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, then-Sen. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, shepherded </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+SB725" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB 725</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through the General Assembly at the behest of the City Council she represented, in order to authorize the city to “impose a tax rate on improvements to real property that is different than the City&#8217;s tax rate on the land upon which the improvements are located.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With such wonky wording, it’s no surprise the change went largely unnoticed by all except 1st District representative Andreas Addison, who had requested McClellan carry the bill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Since we are a landlocked city, we have to be smart about how we use our land,” Addison said on a recent call. “We’ve been leaning on market demand for home values to get more revenue, but a land value tax would put the focus on new development and growth and not on the backs of our current residents. We can’t just zone for the growth we want, we need to tax for it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Addison, Dominion Energy’s recently announced </span><a href="https://richmond.com/business/local/dominion-energy-plans-clean-energy-park-with-ev-charging-stations-at-vacant-lot-in-richmond/article_3afe1737-821a-5d89-ae8a-218755853dba.html#tncms-source=login" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">electric vehicle parking lot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a perfect example of why Virginia’s capital needs a land value tax. The corporation’s initial redevelopment plans for the parcel envisioned a </span><a href="https://www.ceramiassociates.com/project/dominion-energy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">second tower</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> identical to the freshly finished skyscraper the City of Richmond assesses at a value of more than $307 million. The planned parking lot with EV chargers won’t be worth much more than the $10 million value of the land and will net the city just a fraction of the tax revenue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s zoned for a use that is worth a lot more than parking EVs,” Addison said. “That land is a waste of an opportunity that should have been more hotels or housing. A land value tax could put some pressure on people sitting on valuable downtown land to finally develop it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until Richmond is done with its </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/one-year-after-adoption-of-city-master-plan-richmond-prepares-for-zoning-code-overhaul-new/article_f43f0ac8-5ec6-5838-9060-791a14082909.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">zoning code overhaul</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> next year, introducing a land value tax wouldn’t make much sense, admitted Addison, although he is advocating for an </span><a href="https://myemail.constantcontact.com/First-District-Newsletter---September-2022.html?soid=1127221356581&amp;aid=vbMvdO7lkz0" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ongoing study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the proposal to be fast-tracked. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, the city taxes the combined value of the land and any built structures at $1.20 on every $100 of value. Addison said that a preliminary analysis by the </span><a href="https://schalkenbach.org/resource-justice/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Center for Property Tax Reform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, however, found that taxing the land at two dollars and the built structures at just two cents would minimally lower taxes on homeowners and quadruple the cost of sitting on vacant land and asphalt parking lots in the city.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Pay on the parcel</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Charlottesville, where a sea of surface lots encircles the city’s downtown, a similar analysis found that most homeowners would get a break under a land value tax while city center parking lots would pay more. Following the passage of an updated </span><a href="https://www.cvilletomorrow.org/city-council-just-passed-a-wildly-controversial-future-land-use-map-that-proposes-major-increases-in-allowable-housing-density-across-charlottesville/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Future Land Use Map</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://cvilleplanstogether.com/affordable-housing-plan/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Affordable Housing Plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a land value tax was intended to be another tool to help realize Charlottesville’s grand visions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We only have 10 square miles of land in the city, so the question is, how can we make the best use of that?” said </span><a href="https://www.arch.virginia.edu/people/lyle-solla-yates" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lyle-Solla Yates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, vice chair of the Charlottesville Planning Commission. “Right now our current tax structure encourages people financially to leave their land as parking lots, even though its value has gone up tremendously in recent years. We could develop this land better, if Richmond would only allow us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such sentiments should come as no surprise from the home of Thomas Jefferson, who famously </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_value_tax_in_the_United_States" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">asserted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the importance of land taxes to the sovereignty and prosperity of our young nation. Land value taxes were standard in the commonwealth up until the 1920s when personal income taxes supplanted them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To this day, Virginia’s localities are still legally required to assess land and buildings separately. Built structures make up 70% of tax assessment in Charlottesville and Richmond, while land value represents the other 30% of how much property owners pay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re in a good position to do this programmatically,” said Solla-Yates. “The challenge is just making it legal.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Nationwide movement</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is not alone in chronically undervaluing its land. Some cities across America such as Philadelphia assess land to be as little as 20% of a parcel’s value. The push to lower taxes on buildings in favor of the parcels beneath them is similarly widespread.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.governing.com/archive/gov-land-tax.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pennsylvania</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allows land value taxes statewide, and an experiment with the policy in </span><a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2019/3/6/non-glamorous-gains-the-pennsylvania-land-tax-experiment#:~:text=Allentown's%20outcomes%20are%20notable%20by,had%20their%20tax%20liability%20reduced." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allentown</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> saw 90% of homes’ tax liability lessened. </span><a href="https://a24.asmdc.org/press-releases/20230201-bill-study-benefits-more-equitable-taxation-property-introduced" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">California</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> just started studying the proposal. </span><a href="https://nextcity.org/urbanist-news/housing-in-brief-detroit-may-initiate-a-land-value-tax" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Detroit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> could have a land value tax by the end of the year. </span><a href="https://www.minnpost.com/community-voices/2022/12/metro-transit-office-explores-possibilities-of-land-value-tax-districts/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minnesota</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> may set one up in specific districts. Even the country of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_Denmark" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Denmark</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> relies upon land value taxes. Capturing the land value around stations is how </span><a href="https://www.lincolninst.edu/sites/default/files/pubfiles/2198_1524_LP2011_ch12_Transit_Value_Capture_0.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Japan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> finances its extensive train and public transit systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the dawn of the internet, some economists believed the </span><a href="https://www.thomaslfriedman.com/the-world-is-flat-3-0/#" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">world would become flat, </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">meaning land and location would become irrelevant. Although remote work has recently become more common, wealth is still overwhelmingly concentrated in urban centers where creatives gather and intellectual cross-pollination leads to innovation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“America’s total land value lies between 2.2 and 3.5 trillion dollars,” said Lars Doucet, author of “</span><a href="http://bbeyseanwedding.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Land is a Big Deal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” “70% of that value derives from the United States’ urban areas, but we are kind of squandering it. Undervalued millions of dollars of property are stuck as parking lots in the center of our cities where there could be thousands of residents and businesses.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the pandemic sent home prices soaring without homeowners having to make any improvements to their property, land values have become an increasingly costly part of any home’s valuation. A land value tax could ironically reverse that trend by pushing the demand for development out of the suburbs and back toward city centers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a better actual tax policy and conveniently gives a tax break to homeowners,” Doucet said. “A land value tax shifts the tax base to incentivize density in inner cities and provides tax relief to people in medium-built areas. It’s not that when your home value goes up your taxes would automatically go up, like now.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the biggest hurdle to implementing land value taxes is making such wonky proposals digestible to the average voter. Policies don’t pass state legislatures or city councils simply because intellectuals believe in them, but it may be a start.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can get almost any economist from left to right to either enthusiastically or begrudgingly admit that it’s the perfect tax,” said Doucet. “It’s one of the few things where you can get Paul Krugman, Karl Marx, and Milton Friedman to agree.”</span></p>

(Samantha Willis/The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having devoted the latter part of his life to preserving Pocahontas Island in Petersburg, </span><a href="https://www.jmwilkersonsince1874.com/obituary/richard-stewart" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richard A. Stewart</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the island’s honorary mayor, is gone, dead at age 79. In the wake of the stalwart community historian’s death, though, the island lives on, primed for its second wind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it did during his lifetime, Stewart’s presence looms large on Pocahontas Island, a community of some 70 acres bordered on three sides by the Appomattox River, just over the bridge from mainland Petersburg. The</span><a href="https://www.nps.gov/articles/pocaisla.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> island’s roots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reach back to 1732, when enslaved people were first brought there to work in tobacco warehouses; by 1800, over 300 free Black people lived and worked there, making it one of the largest communities of its kind in America. Stewart owned and operated the island’s Black history museum, founded in 2006. The two-story yellow clapboard house trimmed in brown today is stuffed to the gills with artifacts he collected during his lifetime, including old-fashioned agricultural tools, 19th-century horseshoes, photographs and art, a Ku Klux Klan robe and a set of shackles likely used in the restraint of enslaved people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stewart’s funeral was observed at Petersburg’s Tabernacle Baptist Church on April 22. The day before, a balmy Friday afternoon, a “Sorry, we’re closed” sign hung above the green chalkboard where Stewart had previously scrawled the museum’s tour hours. It felt like he had just stepped away and would be back any minute, eager to educate anyone who’d listen about Pocahontas Island’s history. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That history is evident in more than just the museum. The island is home to the </span><a href="https://preservationvirginia.org/saving-petersburgs-jarratt-house/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jarratt House</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, built in 1820 and at one time a stop on the Underground Railroad; Stewart and other island residents led the push for the house to be preserved, rightly recognizing it as a portal to freedom for Blacks fleeing bondage in the Petersburg area before the Civil War.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stewart also </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nucCygfhj_c" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">consistently spoke</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the area’s days as a manufacturing and railroad hub, and as a haven for free Black tradespeople, artisans and farmers in antebellum Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stewart’s neighbor Dorothy Kelley, who has lived on the island for over 50 years with her husband and his family — who were born and raised there — said the museum was one of several buildings Stewart owned on the island. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And he made sure that grass stayed cut, too,” she said. “I don’t know what’s going to happen with the museum now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What happens next?” is a fair question to ask, both about the museum and about the island itself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, the number of residents living on Pocahontas Island has steadily shrunk down to about 100 people, Kelley said. Several of the homes there are dilapidated and in need of repair; some stand vacant. There are no employment prospects on the island, and nearby Petersburg faces a </span><a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LAUCN517300000000003A" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">10.5% annual unemployment rate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of the younger people are gone; we don’t have as many children around,” said Kelley, 76, but spry and chatty as she led me around the island on an impromptu tour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She showed me the community’s tiny chapel, which had to be rebuilt after a </span><a href="https://www.weather.gov/akq/severe_Aug061993" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tornado tore through the island</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in August 1993, damaging or destroying 80% of the homes there. She introduced me to Mrs. Mary Bragg Cox, 98, the daughter of a man who, before Stewart took up Pocahontas Island’s banner, advocated for the paving of the neighborhood’s streets and the laying of its sidewalks. Cox later donated land to create a park in her father’s honor, up the street from her home. She nodded in agreement as Kelley told me what she sees as the solution to sustaining the island for the next generation: “What we need is for families, for people to come back here, help us build this place up again.”</span></p>

(Samantha Willis/The Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter Marlo Green.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, Green broke ground on the first in a series of homes she’s developing on the island, slated to be priced right for area families looking to settle down. A certified public accountant and first-time developer who works at Virginia State University, Green has lived in Petersburg since 2016 and believes the homes will simultaneously bring more people to Pocahontas and help local Black families build wealth through homeownership.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her vision is to “help close the wealth gap locally and bring more resources to the island,” she said as she showed me the first home of the project, which she will live in when it is completed in another few months; as we spoke, workers were nailing on its siding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Green began the effort by purchasing an acre plot from the city and plans to buy more soon. Before she started, she introduced herself to her future neighbors on the island, including Kelley, who said she feels “completely positive” about the undertaking. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another neighbor took a little more convincing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the first people I met was Mr. Stewart. He was kind of skeptical because he had seen a lot of people come to the island with a lot of hopes and dreams, but nothing had been done,” Green said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One such dream was the much-hyped </span><a href="https://wilder.vcu.edu/media/wilder/murp-studio-plans/ursp762/pdfs/s14/S14_JGriffiths_Pocahontas_Island.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pocahontas Island Neighborhood Pla</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">n, a complex set of social, economic and aesthetic goals for the island with suggested strategies on how to meet them prepared by the Wilder School of Government at Virginia Commonwealth University in 2014. Residents participated in the creation of that and other plans but have yet to see much of it brought to reality, Green explained. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite his initial caution, Green said, Stewart came to support her vision for revitalizing the island and was working to help her realize it before his death.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Green’s project unfolds, other recent developments are reasons to hope Pocahontas Island and the surrounding area will soon see better days. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced the “Partnership for Petersburg,” </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/08/26/innovative-partnership-for-petersburg-shouldnt-be-judged-by-politics/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a set of 42 initiatives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> designed to boost the economic and social outlook of the city that is no stranger to struggle. Though some correctly pointed out that most of these initiatives were already underway thanks to General Assembly action or federal funds, a bipartisan group of state and local leaders welcomed the fresh attention Youngkin’s plan placed on Petersburg. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Business </span><a href="https://www.virginiabusiness.com/article/economic-healing/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year that work had begun to make Petersburg</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “a pharmaceutical manufacturing hub and ingredient reserve, bringing economic investment, jobs and ancillary investment to the long-distressed area.” A </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/04/17/petersburg-maternal-hub-opening-reignites-discussion-over-commercial-doula-benefits/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">maternal and infant health center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> opened in Petersburg a few weeks ago, offering support to expecting and new parents as well as early childhood education opportunities. Multiple efforts are underway to </span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/local-news/the-tri-cities/a-petersburg-man-is-bringing-together-his-community-through-teaching-kids-a-unique-skill/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fight food insecurity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the area and </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2022-11-23/new-youth-urban-farm-helps-heal-petersburg-community" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">teach kids how to grow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their food. Green is also creating a nonprofit to support the future renovation of homes in need on the island.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It will mean so much to have our elders age in place more comfortably,” said Green, who grew up in public housing in Henrico County. “I saw firsthand how neighborhoods like Church Hill and Jackson Ward [in Richmond] will gentrify and push out the residents that have been there all along. That’s the polar opposite of what we’re trying to do here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March 2023, Arlington County became the first jurisdiction in the Washington, D.C. area to abandon low density zoning, which enabled parts of Arlington to develop largely as single-family homes.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arlington’s newly-adopted </span><a href="https://arlington.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=2&amp;clip_id=4218&amp;meta_id=217430" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Missing Middle Housing Plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allows six-plexes to be built on all but the smallest residential lots in areas that now range from 50-90% single family homes. </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/tag/missing-middle-housing-plan/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The April 11 column by Wyatt Gordon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> downplays the significance of the change, noting that the plan &#8220;allows at most 348 missing middle units to be constructed per year in a county which needs an additional </span><a href="https://northernvirginiamag.com/culture/news/2022/06/22/affordable-housing-arlington/#:~:text=Created%20in%202015%2C%20Venezia%20says,now%20there%20are%20about%2014%2C000." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">8,800</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> affordable homes&#8221; by 2040.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mercury’s readers deserve the full story. Since 1979, with the advent of Metrorail along two major corridors in our 26-square mile county, Arlington has pursued aggressive residential development.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The pace has not slackened, according to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the county&#8217;s planning, housing and development staff, who shared this in a </span><a href="https://arlingtonva.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2020/07/MMHS_ResearchCompendium_Bulletin2_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 bulletin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the Missing Middle housing study: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;From 2010 through the end of 2019, Arlington produced approximately 11,370 housing units (net of demolitions), or an average of 1,137 housing units a year.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While this makes sense given our proximity to D.C., successive generations of leaders have let &#8220;more density&#8221; reign supreme over most of our Comprehensive Plan goals (which include flood control, carbon neutrality by 2050, a 40% tree canopy, traffic management and public transit), as well as fiscal responsibility. Commercial development, including Amazon HQ2, is robust. The County Board relies on a &#8220;</span><a href="https://www.nar.realtor/on-common-ground/zoning-for-dollars" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoning for Dollars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; scheme where it wrests ever higher yields per acre of land while eschewing needed infrastructure to serve new residents. This is exemplified by  the Missing Middle effort, undertaken as county revenues are hurt by our catastrophic </span><a href="https://twitter.com/asfvirginia/status/1642872933923139588" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">22% commercial vacancy rate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">double</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> what it was just 12 years ago. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, readers should know the area median income (AMI) for a household of three people in Arlington was $128,100 last year. Arlington indeed needs 9,000 housing units, but</span><a href="https://www.arlingtonva.us/files/sharedassets/public/housing/documents/affordable-housing/2022-ahmp-if-final.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for households earning 50% of AMI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ($64,000/year). In the same report, the County noted on page 7  that we had a surplus of 1,600 units for households earning 80% of AMI ($96,000/year). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">George Mason University researcher Emily Hamilton told Mr. Gordon that the Missing Middle plan &#8220;could make moderate income purchasing feasible in all parts of the county.&#8221; But &#8220;moderate income&#8221; is generally 80% of AMI. The County’s own </span><a href="https://www.arlingtonva.us/files/sharedassets/public/housing/documents/missing-middle/mmhs_consultantanalysis_2022-04-28.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Missing Middle analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> projected the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">cheapest </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">new unit in a six-plex would cost $600,000 for a 2-bedroom condo far from Metro. This price is far MORE than similar-sized units today. Analysis by our group, Arlingtonians for Our Sustainable Future, shows that a typical 3-person household needs $193,000 per year to qualify for this new missing middle  condo, or 151% of AMI, blowing Ms. Hamilton&#8217;s claim of “moderate” income home ownership out of the water. In fact, the qualifying incomes for all missing middle units astronomically exceed AMI </span><a href="https://www.healthierarlington.org/?module=demographicdata&amp;controller=index&amp;action=index&amp;id=2878&amp;sectionId=" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">for African-American, Latino</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ($67,000 and $87,000, respectively) and </span><a href="https://www.point2homes.com/US/Neighborhood/VA/Arlington-Demographics.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">senior Arlingtonians</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ($88,000).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Worse yet, Arlington&#8217;s Missing Middle plan has zero committed affordable options or displacement mitigations, as offered in other U.S. jurisdictions such as Portland, Oregon. Tax assessments will rise due to higher potential yield (investors are promoting </span><a href="https://www.asf-virginia.org/_files/ugd/a48bae_043f2d0ee51a4dd69bd56bd58f602e1a.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">35% returns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arlington&#8217;s historically Black neighborhoods are already largely zoned for &#8220;missing middle&#8221; housing types; this has increased displacement, voluntary relocation and gentrification. Green Valley, the largest of these neighborhoods, went from being 60% Black in 2000 to 23% in 2020. The County and its supporters have never explained how expanding the same zoning will yield different results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These dynamics will continue to gentrify our diverse populations and workforce. ASF strongly opposes the County&#8217;s decision to replace &#8220;exclusionary zoning&#8221; with outright &#8220;</span><a href="https://sites.utexas.edu/gentrificationproject/understanding-gentrification-and-displacement/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">exclusionary displacement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221;   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ms. Hamilton&#8217;s and Mr. Gordon&#8217;s claims are further undermined by the 2019 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Census ACS 1-year microdata estimates for housing by tenure in Arlington, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">showing that 80% of 2- to 9-unit buildings in Arlington are rentals; other analysis suggests our market likely will favor 3-unit townhomes priced over $1 million (which allows lot subdivision and fee simple ownership). One local realtor of 12-years </span><a href="https://www.asf-virginia.org/_files/ugd/a48bae_b877953448624d96b48c12b9dec67114.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">projects</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that we will &#8220;see perfectly good 1930s-1960s homes being torn down, causing a rapid conversion of whole neighborhoods.&#8221;Annual caps imposed by the Board will last only five years, a blip for developers seeking high returns on investment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ASF has other major concerns about the new zoning:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The County has planned no new infrastructure for the increased population (schools, parks, police stations, transit, stormwater).</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elevated land acquisition prices will complicate true affordable housing needs.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing state law seemingly thwarts new tree planting requirements (while incentivizing more tear downs that devastate the tree canopy.)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arlington’s Missing Middle plan sounds like a dream only if you ignore facts.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arlingtonians for Our Sustainable Future is a non-partisan educational and advocacy group founded in 2019 to address the overdevelopment and unprecedented flooding of that year. ASF seeks planning approaches that balance growth and sustainability.  </span></em></p>

The Arlington Way”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — a reference to the consensus-driven decision-making which typifies county government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the hyperbole of the debate surrounding Arlington’s missing middle proposal, casual observers might be forgiven for assuming bulldozers now stand at the ready to demolish detached homes in favor of multi-story monstrosities. In reality, the new plan allows at most 348 missing middle units to be constructed per year in a county which needs an additional </span><a href="https://northernvirginiamag.com/culture/news/2022/06/22/affordable-housing-arlington/#:~:text=Created%20in%202015%2C%20Venezia%20says,now%20there%20are%20about%2014%2C000." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">8,800</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> affordable homes by 2040.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the missing middle plan won’t unlock the building boom that supporters hoped for and opponents feared, what’s next for Arlington’s pro-housing policy push?</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Caps on construction</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/03/22/arlington-missing-middle-vote-zoning/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">headlines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> heralded the end of single-family zoning in Arlington, the policy passed won’t result in drastic changes to the county’s housing supply. Come July 1, property owners can apply to build duplexes, fourplexes and sixplexes on parcels currently zoned for just single-family structures. Although such a change sounds transformational, a coterie of caveats included in the proposal means a maximum of 348 units can be built for the next five years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This debate got so much attention relative to the small amount of change this plan allows,” said Emily Hamilton, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Institute, a George Mason University market research center.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the first five years, Arlington will cap the number of single-family lots that can be converted to missing middle homes at 58, meaning if all of those parcels allow sixplexes, then the county could see at most 348 new housing units thanks to the change. Since all of those lots won’t be large enough or close enough to public transit to accommodate six units, the final tally will surely be lower.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/ebwhamilton/status/1640151738228387845" target="_blank">http://twitter.com/ebwhamilton/status/1640151738228387845</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the 58 lot per year cap expires in 2028, Hamilton is hopeful that Arlington’s missing middle plan will produce more new homes than similar reforms have in </span><a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2022/05/25/how-oregon-is-bringing-missing-middle-housing-to-the-state/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Portland, Oregon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://streets.mn/2022/08/24/how-minneapolis-could-become-a-missing-middle-housing-factory/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minneapolis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The reason behind her optimism is the area’s abundance of McMansions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have some fricking huge single-family houses getting built,” Hamilton said. “The idea [of missing middle] is that you can build the same size box that you can for a new single-family house but you can break it up into more units. Relative to other localities that have adopted missing middle reforms, Arlington allows huge new single-family houses, so that means it&#8217;s more feasible to split that big box into multiple units compared to cities that have smaller size limits.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where Hamilton proves less hopeful is on the plan’s </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/10/22/could-removing-parking-requirements-revitalize-virginias-cities/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">parking requirements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In transit-rich parts of Arlington, builders must provide half a parking spot per unit. In less accessible areas, each unit must include one full parking spot. Every square foot required to house a car is one less square foot that could be used to house people, making missing middle construction less likely to be financially feasible compared to building a single-family home on the same lot.</span></p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Ending exclusionary zoning</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the details (and expected impact) of Arlington’s missing middle plan are surprisingly modest, supporters view its passage last month as the first chink in the armor of exclusionary zoning which has dominated the county’s approach to housing for the better part of the last century.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Maybe a lot of people won&#8217;t use this missing middle housing because, yes, it will still be expensive and, yes, there will not be much of it built, but this is a moment,” said Jane Green, president and co-founder of the </span><a href="https://www.yimbysofnova.org/home" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">YIMBYs of Northern Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “This is a big zoning change that affects all of the county at a fundamental level. We&#8217;ve been operating under this regime that multi-family housing can stay in this one corridor and that single-family can&#8217;t be touched. It&#8217;s more than a zoning code; it&#8217;s a mindset of where certain people should be allowed to live.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such broad pro-people, pro-growth language is one of the reasons support for missing middle expanded beyond the typically whiter, more affluent and renter-heavy </span><a href="https://ggwash.org/view/88994/virginia-is-for-yimbys-the-pro-housing-movement-spreading-across-the-commonwealth" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes In My Backyard” crowd</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to include groups ranging from the NAACP and the Alliance for Housing Solutions, to the Sierra Club and Virginians Organized for Interfaith Community Engagement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supporters like Green hope the unanimous vote in favor is a sign that elected leaders are becoming less beholden to the homeowner-dominated civic associations that opposed the plan. As homeowners comprise less than half the county and those who attend public meetings are even fewer, the opposition was never a representative bunch in her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For the other side, it was never about the homes,” she said. “It’s about the control. The missing middle fight became about the idea of who the county listens to. A lot of people who function in the civic association and homeowner universe think their voices are the only ones that matter. I love renting, and I don&#8217;t ever want to own, so to me this vote sent the message that multifamily buildings are good, density is good and more people are good.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Momentum for more housing?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the wake of their missing middle win, pro-housing advocates aren’t holding back on their wish list of additional fixes the county’s board of supervisors could make to boost affordability and the overall supply of new homes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2024 </span><a href="https://www.arlingtonva.us/Government/Programs/Budget-Finance/FY-2024-Proposed-Budget" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposed budget</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for Arlington’s </span><a href="https://www.arlingtonva.us/Government/Programs/Housing/Development/Affordable-Housing-Investment-Fund" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Affordable Housing Investment Fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would nearly halve this year’s funding. The pro-growth coalition wants to see that sum fully restored and then some. Plans to </span><a href="https://www.arlingtonva.us/Government/Projects/Plans-Studies/Land-Use/Plan-Langston-Boulevard" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rezone Langston Boulevard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from one or two story auto-centric strip malls into dense, walkable communities are also in the works, with a final proposal planned for release between July and September. The missing middle reform also opens up the possibility that Habitat for Humanity and/or a </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/09/29/virginia-now-has-a-statewide-community-land-trust-can-it-help-solve-the-housing-crisis/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">community land trust</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> could finally prove feasible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If county board member Katie Cristol has anything to say about it, The Arlington Way of gradual, technocratic progress may not be dead after all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We just legalized a form of housing that could make moderate income purchasing feasible in all parts of the county,” she said. “First we had to make these homes legal, and now we can think about how to improve our programs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cristol hopes an ongoing </span><a href="https://www.arlingtonva.us/Government/Programs/Housing/Housing-Arlington/Homeownership-Study" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">homeownership study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will show how the missing middle plan could support county </span><a href="https://www.arlingtonva.us/Government/Programs/Housing/Get-Help/Home-Ownership/MIPAP" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">housing</span></a> <a href="https://www.arlingtonva.us/Government/Programs/Housing/Housing-Arlington/County-Employee-Housing" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">programs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that have been underutilized for years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The reason [purchase assistance] and Live Where You Work grants haven’t historically worked is not a lack of interest,” she said. “The reason is that if you earn less than 80% area median income to qualify, then you typically don’t have the capital to buy anything, which says more about how expensive our housing stock has become. Missing middle could render new units feasible that fall into that price range.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only thing that could prevent further progress is a potential backlash. With two open seats on the board of supervisors, a candidate who is running against the recent reforms could claim one or both of those spots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, elected officials from </span><a href="https://www.alxnow.com/2023/03/23/what-does-arlingtons-missing-middle-vote-mean-for-alexandria/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alexandria</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><a href="https://www.fcnp.com/2023/03/13/arlington-approaching-final-vote-on-missing-middle-housing/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falls Church</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have been watching Arlington’s unanimous passage of its missing middle plan with envy. While one candidate for state senate has already </span><a href="https://twitter.com/IbraheemSamirah/status/1639264117142724609" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">called on</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Loudon County to legalize fourplexes and sixplexes along Metro’s Silver Line, many other electeds have been asking for advice to push similar changes in their localities, according to Cristol. No matter where they are located, she encourages them to look into </span><a href="https://www.aarp.org/livable-communities/housing/info-2020/missing-middle-housing.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">re-legalizing missing middle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> housing in their communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This took, by some measures, eight years and by any measure, at least three in terms of socializing the idea, [generating] community engagement and forming the general parameters of the policy,” she said. “Even if our vote does nothing more than make a few people in Tidewater think this may be a fit for their region and reference this in a long-range plan, that would not put them in a dissimilar place from where we started.”</span></p>

That, in turn, could cause home prices to rise as low inventory remains a problem. (Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Home prices are cooling off and mortgage rates fell last week, but the fallout from recent bank closures could continue to make it hard for some Americans to buy homes, economists say. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mortgage rates fell to 6.32% for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, Freddie Mac data </span><a href="http://freddiemac.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/mortgage-rates-decrease-third-consecutive-week" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">released last</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Thursday shows. Last fall, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage climbed to 7.08% — the first time in </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-mortgage-rates-hit-7-08-highest-in-more-than-20-years-11666879204" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">20 years</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that rates rose above 7%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower mortgage rates appear to have given home sales a boost in January and February, due to “pent-up buyer demand,” said Selma Hepp, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">chief economist </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">at CoreLogic, which provides property, financial and business intelligence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, the </span><a href="https://www.corelogic.com/intelligence/us-corelogic-sp-case-shiller-index-gain-slows-to-pre-pandemic-low-up-by-3-8-year-over-year-in-january/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CoreLogic S&amp;P Case-Shiller Index</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showed a 3.8% year-over-year rise in home prices in January falling from a 5.6% bump in December. There have been nine straight months of slowing annual home price growth, and this is the lowest annual increase since before the winter of 2019, according to Hepp’s </span><a href="https://www.corelogic.com/intelligence/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But regional banks, which saw depositors leave for bigger banks after the </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/regulators-end-week-they-started-tamping-down-fears-rescuing-bank" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">collapse of Silicon Valley Bank</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last month, are now tightening credit. The result, according to a </span><a href="https://www.fanniemae.com/newsroom/fannie-mae-news/banking-system-instability-may-prove-catalyst-recession" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report from Fannie Mae</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, could be fewer residential construction loans and jumbo mortgages, as many originate from small and mid-sized banks. Less supply will keep prices high, and all of that will likely affect spring home-buying, Hepp said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If we had more inventory, we wouldn&#8217;t have the rate of appreciation that we had during the pandemic, and and the rate wouldn&#8217;t impact people to the extent that it does because home prices wouldn&#8217;t be as high,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hepp is also watching the Federal Reserve’s action on interest rates. Many </span><a href="https://www.bankrate.com/banking/federal-reserve/when-will-the-fed-stop-raising-rates/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">economists</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> believe the Fed could stop raising rates after one more cycle. That would be good for mortgage rates, but not every buyer will benefit, Hepp said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s two sides of this coin,” she said. “One is that we may see a more favorable mortgage rate during the spring home-buying season and into summer, but on the flip side, there may be some concern around the lack of mortgage lending. The mortgage lending that does end up occurring would be to very prime borrowers that have very strong credit, large down payments and things like that.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, said he is concerned about how commercial lending would be affected by the banking crisis. </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/adigaskell/2023/03/05/how-remote-work-has-affected-real-estate-values/?sh=9bf81b912290" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commercial real estate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has already been affected by the pandemic and continuing remote work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Where someone wants to buy an office space or someone has a restaurant and they need to refinance their building, all this commercial real estate will come under stress just because it will be much more difficult to obtain those loans, and community banks are trying to conserve as much cash as possible, not lend that out,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that doesn’t mean that commercial real estate couldn’t end up affecting home-buying all the same, Yun added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Weakness in commercial real estate could hinder job growth. Job creation indirectly impacts home-buying in a sense that there is a [lesser] job creation, and that means it&#8217;s creating fewer potential home-buyers down the line,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hepp said that the Fed may not be particularly concerned with the housing market right now, since it is rebalancing, with the possibility of “maybe over-shooting on a downside.” But credit availability will likely remain a concern, and there are things the Fed could do to address it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To whatever extent that there is liquidity in the market or there may not end up being liquidity in the market, I think that&#8217;s the point at which the Federal Reserve may end up utilizing some of the tools that they did at the onset of the pandemic,” she said. “In particular, I&#8217;m thinking about mortgage-backed securities.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the beginning of the pandemic, the Federal Reserve made large purchases of </span><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/fed-response-to-covid19/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mortgage-backed securities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and took several other steps to keep the flow of credit going. Any policies that would improve the inventory and affordability of housing would also be helpful to the housing market right now, she said.</span></p>

(Wyatt Gordon)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether carriage houses, in-law suites, English basements or granny flats, what all accessory dwelling units (ADUs) have in common – the reason their backers love them and why few folks think of them as a possible solution to the housing crisis – is that they blend in with the neighborhood. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bill patroned by Del. Sally Hudson, D-Charlottesville, this year would have expanded permission to build such supplemental housing across the commonwealth, but the proposal was killed on a party-line vote in a Republican-controlled House subcommittee last month. If ADUs are as unobtrusive as their supporters say, then why won’t Virginia legislators make it easier to build them?</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">An ADU for who?</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As defined according to Hudson’s </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb2100#:~:text=Establishes%20authority%20and%20requirements%20for,%2C%20bathroom%2C%20and%20kitchen%20space." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 2100</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an ADU is “an independent dwelling unit on a single-family dwelling lot with its own living, bathroom and kitchen space. An ADU may be within or attached to a single-family dwelling or in a detached structure on a lot containing a single-family dwelling.” In short, no matter what form it takes, adding an ADU to a single-family parcel enables two households to live on a lot that would otherwise be home to just one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doubling housing density without significantly altering the neighborhood character can prove especially appealing in cities like Charlottesville, where demand is plentiful and vacant lots are not. As retirees, tech professionals and folks affiliated with the University of Virginia have poured into town over the last few decades, the housing supply has remained stagnant. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unable to find a place to call home in Charlottesville, ever more people who work in the city are forced to live further out, causing congestion and long commutes. With an abundance of garages, barns and carriage houses in the region, relatively quick upgrades to ADUs could yield big results for Hudson’s district.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you’re looking for ways to put more </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/07/23/how-to-bring-the-missing-middle-to-virginia-housing-development/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">missing middle housing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into really hot housing markets like ours, ADUs can be a great option,” she said. “Sometimes folks build them to have a rental income stream, to age in place, to help someone recovering from an injury or illness, or to house multiple generations on the same property.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it had passed, Hudson’s proposal would have set consistent standards for ADUs across the commonwealth on everything from setbacks to owner occupancy requirements, ending the current </span><a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2021/RD629/PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">patchwork of rules and regulations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that often make ADUs technically legal but practically unfeasible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While critics often decry the Dillon Rule for hindering localities’ ability to tailor public policy to their needs, in this instance Hudson hoped to use its power to streamline ADUs standards and make it easier to build the additional housing her constituents require.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is an example where local authority is sometimes used to stop homeowners and businesses from constructing ADUs which are good for their bottom line as well as our housing supply,” she said. “These are units that the building industry would love to be able to build for homeowners if the regulations would get out of the way of the people who want them.”</span></p>

(Wyatt Gordon)</p></figure>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Localities lean no</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nothing is currently stopping localities in Virginia from streamlining ADU standards and adopting a more permissive approach to supplemental dwellings. In light of such existing authority, many of the commonwealth’s cities and counties viewed Hudson’s bill as a state-level overstep that would diminish their discretion over land use rules and regulations. That’s why Joe Lerch, director of local government policy for the </span><a href="https://www.vaco.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Association of Counties</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, opposed the proposal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Many counties exercise their authority to allow for the inclusion of ADUs within their zoning ordinances,” Lerch wrote in an email. “In doing so, they determine the context of where ADUs can be reasonably accommodated to meet the needs of residents and homeowners. A one-size-fits-all mandate to authorize an ADU wherever a single-family dwelling exists excludes input from citizens and communities on how ADUs can fit within existing and proposed residential developments.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other groups, like the Coalition for Smarter Growth, support ADUs in principle but had concerns that a statewide override of localities’ permitting processes could inadvertently cause more sprawl.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s important that affordable places to live are located closer to existing services, public transit and jobs,” said Stewart Schwartz, the Coalition’s executive director. “More and more people who live farther out choke our transportation systems with car drivers, and that means a greater loss of farms and forests as well as more greenhouse gas emissions. There is an awful lot of demand to live in walkable, urban neighborhoods, but often there aren’t any options. ADUs are a good option.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given more time and stronger stakeholder engagement, such concerns may have easily been assuaged. The vast majority of suburban sprawl comes from the expansion of single-family home subdivisions, not the infill construction which typifies ADUs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Based on the work that I have done I think I would be aware of a lot of new greenfield ADUs being built, but I just haven’t heard of that happening,” said Emily Hamilton, a researcher with the Mercatus Institute, an economic markets research center at George Mason University. “For ADUs to lead to more sprawl than the status quo they would have to be changing developers’ calculations on subdivisions, and that seems highly unlikely to me.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">“Not nearly enough housing”</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to the opposition, Hudson ultimately proposed a </span><a href="https://committees.lis.virginia.gov/forconsiderationsubs.aspx?ses=231&amp;bil=HB2100&amp;hou=H" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">substitute version of HB 2100</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that watered down the bill to include no requirements on localities. Instead, the proposal would have formed a state-level advisory panel to merely offer guidance on how to encourage the development of ADUs across the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even in California, where a slew of bills have made it easier for homeowners to build </span><a href="https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Light-Touch-Density-Compiled-FINAL-1.12.2022.pdf?x91208" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tens of thousands of new ADUs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in recent years, attic apartments and carriage houses are not significant solutions to the housing crisis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s not nearly enough housing to meet the need,” explained Hamilton. “ADUs are simply a smart first step that give homeowners more rights to put their homes to a slightly more marginally intensive use when it makes sense to them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hudson had hoped that her calls to reduce regulations on homeowners and builders might garner her ADU bill bipartisan support, especially given Gov. Youngkin’s </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/11/21/governor-glenn-youngkin-yimby-in-chief/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent remarks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> railing against localities’ exclusionary land use rules.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Bills like this are a direct response to the governor’s call for some cross-partisan work on housing affordability,” Hudson said. “Anybody who is listening to Virginians knows that cost of living tops the list of things keeping people up at night, and housing is the biggest slice of anybody’s paycheck. This is a very practical thing we can do to put more units on properties where the owners want them.”</span></p>

The commonwealth’s housing crisis can seem like something of an onion: each layer peels back to reveal one smellier than the next — and too much time peering into it could leave you in tears.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Virginia’s worsening woes surrounding high housing costs have recently garnered the </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/11/21/governor-glenn-youngkin-yimby-in-chief/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">attention</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of state leaders from the Governor’s Mansion to the General Assembly. A whole </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/11/21/governor-glenn-youngkin-yimby-in-chief/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">host of bills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> proposed this session offer ideas on how to make housing more affordable, but the state and local governments could already be sitting on one solution: public lands.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Public land for public servants</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this month Del. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico introduced a resolution requesting that the Department of Housing and Community Development “study ways to increase affordable housing options for public servants on publicly owned property.” Although </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HJ490" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HJ 490</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was ultimately laid on the table (lawmaker lingo for “killed”) last week, its contents will be conveyed to  the state&#8217;s Housing Commission for consideration via a letter suggesting agency action on a suite of proposals delegates and senators have put forward this session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the statewide stats on the housing crisis are concerning, VanValkenburg introduced his study bill because of issues facing his own constituents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Henrico is ahead of the game on this issue, but we have an affordability problem in that folks who work at Short Pump can’t afford to live near there,” he said. “We’re increasingly seeing public servants in western Henrico moving out to Hanover, Goochland, and Powhatan.  Eventually those folks stop teaching, policing, and fire fighting in Henrico because the commute is a killer. Once someone has been in your county for a while they have built up skills, knowledge and relationships that we don&#8217;t want to lose.”</span></p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/scvanvalkenburg/status/1620084088907636737" target="_blank">http://twitter.com/scvanvalkenburg/status/1620084088907636737</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With issues like zoning often becoming a lightning rod, VanValkenburg hoped using publicly-owned lands to build housing for public servants would be low-hanging fruit. Had the bill not died in the House, the plan was for DHCD to spend the next year working with localities across the commonwealth to create plans for workforce housing for teachers, first responders, and other civil servants. With such plans in place, the thinking was localities might have then felt more comfortable diving into the issue of affordable housing more broadly.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">From classrooms to bedrooms</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other side of Richmond, Chesterfield County has already begun a series of projects to reimagine abandoned public buildings for better use. Last October, in collaboration with the </span><a href="https://maggiewalkerclt.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maggie Walker Community Land Trust</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the county broke ground on Ettrick Landing, a 10-unit, single-family subdivision on the site of the former Dupuy Elementary School. At first, a community group called the Concerned Citizens of Ettrick (CCE) was worried about what would replace the area’s old school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When they realized the school was so dilapidated it was beyond salvageable use, [CCE] went from saying, ‘Not over my dead body, no way,’ to &#8216;Tell me more about a community land trust. Who will be able to afford the homes?’ and ‘What will this future neighborhood look like?’” explained Nicholas Feucht, Chesterfield’s real estate development and housing coordinator. “It took three years from community engagement to the groundbreaking due to the pandemic, but almost 100 people came out to show their support.”</span></p>

(Chesterfield County)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/09/29/virginia-now-has-a-statewide-community-land-trust-can-it-help-solve-the-housing-crisis/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">land trust</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the 10 homes being built on the site will all be permanently affordable. Ranging from one to two stories and 1,500 to 1,800 square feet, the houses are all expected “to be sold for $150,000 to $180,000 — a price point that is affordable to households earning between approximately $35,000 and $75,000 per year, or up to 80% of area median household income,” </span><a href="https://www.chesterfield.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=3153" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the county.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Infrastructure like roads and water are going in place now, and the county anticipates </span><a href="https://www.projecthomes.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Project Homes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will have the first half of the homes completed this summer with the remaining units finished later this year. The community engagement for an </span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/local-news/chesterfield-county/chesterfield-county-proposes-new-use-for-old-matoaca-elementary/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">adaptive reuse project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the much better-maintained Matoaca Elementary School kicked off late last year as well, with an eye towards assisting older residents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The single fastest growing demographic in our county is singles over 65,” Feucht said.  “We’re trying to think about how people can age in place without the burden of home repair and lawn maintenance. We don’t have a ton of surplus public property in Chesterfield, but this is a great model of how we can work with a nonprofit to build something that can serve residents not just now but in the future.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Housing for whomst?</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although neither project in Chesterfield will specifically target public servants, both demonstrate the way in which publicly-owned lands can be repurposed to be affordable housing. By explaining to communities why new housing is needed and allowing additional density, local governments can have a surprising amount of influence over the outcome of proposed affordable developments. Localities also have a vested interest in ensuring their employees are part of the communities they work within.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is a particular need for public employees to live where they serve,” said Kathryn Howell, associate professor at  Virginia Commonwealth University and co-director of the </span><a href="https://rampages.us/rvaevictionlab/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RVA Eviction Lab</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “If the city worker in charge of transportation doesn’t live in the city, then they may not have the same interests as city residents. If they’re driving in from the suburbs, then they may not want to drive over the </span><a href="https://twitter.com/BossRVA/status/1618029925151428609" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">speed humps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> residents want installed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Affordable housing for public servants is often branded “</span><a href="https://housingforwardva.org/news/fwd-177-what-is-workforce-housing/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">workforce housing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” a label that can sometimes be helpful in reducing community concerns around new development. By specifically calling out the most popular public workers like teachers and first responders as the direct beneficiaries, opposition to affordable housing is frequently harder to maintain. As public employees range from executives of economic development to dump truck drivers, the term may function better as branding than a cohesive category of people seeking shelter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What do we mean when we say ‘public servants?&#8217; Teachers, firefighters, police officers — the valiant professions?” asked Howell. “Many officials almost never want to talk about other low-wage government workers. Down below 60% [Area Median Income], it’s really difficult to provide housing. There is a sales pitch that happens for workforce housing, but all housing is workforce housing because almost everyone works.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given that many people want a specific type of home – an apartment near lots of retail and restaurants, or a suburban rancher with a two-car garage – anticipating, let alone building, the kinds of homes that public servants want may prove challenging. The more expansive solution to keeping public servants in the communities they serve is to increase Virginia’s housing supply across the board, according to Howell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Workforce housing can be dealt with by adding supply because it lowers prices across the board,” she said. “If you don’t have enough housing that’s affordable in Fredericksburg, for example, then the people teaching there will just move further out. Ultimately it keeps bumping people out which makes sprawl worse.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A future of ever-further commutes for public servants is just the fate Del. VanValkenburg aimed to help his constituents avoid when he introduced his study. Although his bill died this year, he’s hopeful that the growing consensus about the causes behind Virginia’s housing crisis will undergird his push for progress going forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve seen what happens in states that are not proactive on this and have to dig themselves out of a hole,” he said. “We don’t want to get there because then you’re addressing not just a lack of housing but also increased homelessness and the need for more social services. We are in a moment where people in both parties recognize that housing is an issue to solve.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the demand for housing pushing up prices to crisis levels, one would assume elected officials across the commonwealth would be doing everything in their power to produce more homes, but some counties are actually making it harder to build affordably.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A cluster conundrum</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The high price of land and the extensive barriers to building new housing in Richmond and its surrounding counties have pushed the demand for homes to the outer edges of Central Virginia’s sprawl. With its easy access to Interstate 64 and prime location between Virginia’s current and former capital cities, New Kent County has quickly become the second fastest-growing locality in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The announcement last year of plans for a </span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/virginia-news/autozone-to-invest-185-2-million-for-new-kent-warehouse-distribution-center-352-new-jobs/#:~:text=The%20company%20will%20construct%20an,operation%2C%20creating%20352%20new%20jobs." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$185 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> AutoZone distribution center were largely seen as a coup for the often-overlooked county. To accommodate the coming 350 warehouse jobs, not to mention New Kent’s </span><a href="https://www.dailypress.com/tidewater-review/va-tr-census-data-0922-20210917-achotmrasjbkjkgz547va6n3hu-story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">25%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> population growth over the last decade, one might expect local leaders to make it easier to add residents. Instead, last summer its board of supervisors actually decreased the allowed density of new development. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because New Kent’s population grew more than 10% over the last decade, state code requires at least 40% of the locality’s land to allow </span><a href="https://www.planning.org/pas/reports/report135/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cluster subdivisions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a development classification that unlocks permits for denser housing like townhomes in exchange for builders preserving more of the site’s total acreage for greenspace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Designed to marry land conservation and affordability, cluster subdivisions centralize development to just one part of the parcel to preserve more farmland or forest and simultaneously lower the cost of the roads and water infrastructure that homebuilders spread across units. Under such plans, developers can build denser homes on just half of the project’s land and preserve the rest as greenspace instead of turning an entire site into single-family homes with large yards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whereas New Kent once allowed developers to set aside 50% of a site and build on the other half, last summer the county increased the</span><a href="https://www.co.new-kent.va.us/ArchiveCenter/ViewFile/Item/6265" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> land conservation requirement to 80%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. New Kent Board of Supervisors member Patricia Paige, who proposed the ordinance, did not return emails and calls requesting comment on this column. While it sounds like a win for livability to preserve more greenspace, the reality is that developers often can’t cover their costs if they are only allowed to build homes on 20 acres of a 100-acre parcel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’re essentially finding a loophole to legally comply with the state code requirement but in a fashion where the cluster subdivision provision just won’t be used,” said Danna Markland, CEO of the Home Building Association of Richmond. “The more homes you have on a particular project, the more you can spread the cost of that development across all of the homes. They raised the open space set aside so high that it’s unworkable.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The poison pills of planning</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Residential zoning that only allows single-family detached structures may garner the most attention for its </span><a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/11840548/the-racist-history-of-single-family-home-zoning" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">intentionally</span></a> <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2021/06/17/exclusionary-zoning-its-effect-on-racial-discrimination-in-the-housing-market/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">exclusionary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> nature, but it is far from the only land use regulation that localities deploy to keep out new neighbors. Setback requirements, lot coverage guidelines, minimum lot sizes and even inclusionary zoning standards can all be manipulated to make new development nigh but impossible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Often poison pills can look like plausible planning demands,” said Nolan Gray, </span><a href="https://islandpress.org/books/arbitrary-lines" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">author</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of  “Arbitrary Lines: How Zoning Broke the American City and How to Fix It,” in a phone interview. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These rules are presented as heavily studied technical measures to improve the ordinance, but often they’re arbitrary standards designed to make housing more expensive to specific types of people.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Kent’s goal of increasing the amount of preserved land contained within each cluster subdivision sounds reasonable if not laudable, but closer inspection of the code’s implications for sprawl reveal the 80% set aside’s disingenuous nature, according to Markland.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By decreasing the density in new development, New Kent is contradicting its effort to preserve rural space,” she said. “If this were truly about preserving the county’s rural character, then they would designate specific areas for higher density so that the farmland and countryside can remain undisturbed.”</span></p>
<p>With land a limited resource, each anti-density policy localities institute increases the amount of land needed to produce a single housing unit and thus raises the price on Virginians seeking long-term shelter.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can’t produce more land,” said Joh Gehlbach, the vice president of government affairs for the Richmond Association of Realtors. “By restricting the number of homes we build on limited land, we ultimately restrict the number of homes we can add to supply. When population growth is factored into the equation, we end up with demand outstripping supply, which results in more expensive housing.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">State standards?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/day-2-for-youngkin-more-tax-cuts-no-additional-housing-subsidies-focus-on-jobs/article_c1d3d309-fadc-5543-aaad-6db5ecb17afa.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">address</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the General Assembly last summer, Governor Youngkin laid the blame for the commonwealth’s skyrocketing housing costs on “unnecessary regulation, overburdensome and inefficient local governments, restrictive zoning policies and an ideology of fighting tooth and nail against any new development.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although some prominent members of his own party disagreed with the governor’s diagnosis, others like Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield, spotted an opportunity to innovate. Having worked as a land use lawyer for more than two decades, she has seen excessive land use regulations limit communities’ ability to add new housing, retail and services time after time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s important we still have zoning at the local level because we don’t know everything at the state level,” she </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/11/21/governor-glenn-youngkin-yimby-in-chief/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Mercury in November. “But the state can come in, set guardrails and reframe what local governments are using as the tools in their toolbox to make local land use decisions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The advantages of a statewide set of land use regulations could be manifold: Smaller builders could more easily work in multiple jurisdictions, planning knowledge would be more transferable across the commonwealth and localities would be unable to block all new development carte blanche.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Establishing statewide standards doesn’t mean taking away local control,” explained Gray. “But when you have guardrails around land use planning, it disallows local governments from creating rules that are completely unworkable.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the fanfare (and controversy) around Gov. Youngkin’s </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2022/november/name-942691-en.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make Virginia Home</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> plan, so far none of the administration’s bills this session would limit localities’ control over land use. Perhaps the package’s most important proposal is </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+ful+HJ507" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HJ 507</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Del. Danny Marshall, R-Danville.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The resolution directs the Virginia Housing Commission to study how revisions to the state code could “streamline and enhance predictability in local development review processes and alleviate the effects of local policies or ordinances that contribute to increased housing costs and constrain the supply of affordable and workforce housing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The potential passage and results of Marshall’s study bill can’t come soon enough for pro-development housing advocates like Markland.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The ‘restrict our growth’ mentality among boards of supervisors is not unique to New Kent,” she said. “Counties’ practice of using exclusionary zoning to raise housing costs and deter development is much more the rule than it is the exception in Virginia.”</span></p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘There aren’t enough homes’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a speech at the </span><a href="https://www.vaghc.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Governor’s Housing Conference</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Friday, Youngkin promised to introduce a legislative package before the upcoming General Assembly session to reduce regulations and promote housing production. Although further details won’t be debuted until December, the fact that both progressive Democrats and right-wing Republicans view the housing affordability crisis in a similar light is proof that pro-development politics do not follow neat ideological lines. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also a sign of how painful high housing costs are for voters of all parties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results of a </span><a href="https://dmz1.dhcd.virginia.gov/HB854/executive-summary.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published this summer show just how broken the housing market has become across the commonwealth. In 2004, Virginia issued 63,215 new residential building permits. In recent years the state has barely built half as many homes per year despite adding over 1.1 million residents during that same period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There aren’t enough homes,” said Youngkin. “There aren’t enough units today. Full stop.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last decade, more than two-thirds of building permits have been issued for single-family homes. With the average price for such a structure in Virginia at $355,000 as of last year (an increase of 30% over 2016), this most expensive form of housing is increasingly out of reach for many middle-class households.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Renters face similar, if not more severe, struggles. Four in five renters in Virginia earn under 50% of their region’s area median income. The Department of Housing and Community Development and Virginia Housing, the state’s housing authority, estimate there’s a shortage of 200,000 affordable rental units across the commonwealth, meaning low earners have few options when rents rise rapidly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Richmond region, the </span><a href="https://www.nbc12.com/2022/03/10/whats-behind-rapid-rise-rent-richmond/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">average rent is 21% higher</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than it was in 2021. In Hampton Roads, </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/business/vp-bz-real-estate-forecast-0311-20220309-ar4hj2g3snhbjkwc4dclwfuayu-story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rents have risen on average 11.2%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the last year, with an additional 12% rise predicted for the coming year. In the first quarter of this year alone, </span><a href="https://virginiarealtors.org/2022/05/16/where-rents-are-rising-fastest/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rents increased 13% in Northern Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  Even areas outside of the Urban Crescent like the city of </span><a href="https://www.nbc29.com/2022/02/10/rent-increases-reduce-affordable-housing-options/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roanoke have faced a 15% jump</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the average rent over 2021 as people flock to cities for better job opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If housing can’t be made more affordable, the governor fears fewer folks will choose to live and locate their businesses in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We must align housing development with economic growth,” he said. “If you want a workforce, we have to have some place for them to live. We need to unleash housing development plans just like we are unleashing economic development plans.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Regulatory reduction</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his closing remarks, Youngkin attributed the dearth of housing units to three factors: regulatory burdens that restrict the supply of buildable land, permitting complications that delay and prevent development and restrictive land use controls that limit property owners’ rights to build.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get out of Virginia’s housing hole, the governor offered three solutions he plans to put before the General Assembly in January. First, he wants to set deadlines for localities to approve land use and zoning reviews. Second, he wants the state to perform a review of land use and zoning laws with an eye toward increasing efficiency and transparency. Third, he wants to create a searchable database of residential-zoned, government-owned land on which developers could potentially build.</span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What would happen if a locality doesn’t approve or deny a project by the deadline? In California, municipalities that don’t comply with state housing policy are subjected to a “builder’s remedy” whereby local zoning power is removed. Such a </span><a href="https://therealdeal.com/la/2022/10/13/santa-monicas-failed-housing-plan-sparks-building-bonanza/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">situation in Santa Monica</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this year may allow that city’s housing supply to jump 7%. Youngkin’s policy shop plans to present its own proposal next month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where the governor’s pro-development push could run off the rails is on wetland and stream credits. In his speech, he promised to streamline permitting, “operationalize” Virginia’s existing wetland and stream replacement fund and release additional credits — all without lowering the quality of Virginia’s wetland and stream mitigation efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previous waves of growth have gobbled up farms, forests and wetlands across the commonwealth in favor of far-flung, car-dependent suburbs.  A 2020 American Farmland Trust </span><a href="https://farmlandinfo.org/publications/farms-under-threat-the-state-of-americas-farmland/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> calculated that “more than 31 million acres of U.S. agricultural land have been irrevocably lost to urban expansion since 1982 and an additional 175 acres of farm and ranchland are lost every hour to make way for housing and other industries.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the administration’s pro-housing proposals end up looking like a mandate for more sprawl, environmental advocates may try to tank Youngkin’s plans in the General Assembly. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">YIMBY versus NIMBY</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor’s pro-development legislative package may face a rocky road in the General Assembly. After Youngkin </span><a href="https://reason.com/2022/08/19/glenn-youngkin-says-nimby-regulations-are-making-virginia-an-impossibly-expensive-place-to-live/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lambasted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “overburdensome and inefficient local governments, restrictive zoning policies and an ideology of fighting tooth and nail against any new development” in a speech before the state’s joint money committee in August, senior members of his own party fired back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That is not how I would characterize it,” </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/day-2-for-youngkin-more-tax-cuts-no-additional-housing-subsidies-focus-on-jobs/article_c1d3d309-fadc-5543-aaad-6db5ecb17afa.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">remarked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate Minority Leader Tommy Norment, R-James City. “The people on city councils and boards of supervisors have the closest connection to the people they represent and the citizens they serve.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such intra-party tension comes as no surprise to </span><a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/author/addison-del-mastro/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addison del Mastro</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an Arlington-based contributor to the conservative publication The Bulwark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are two ways conservatives think about development,” he said. “Pro-business and property rights is a very natural fit for conservatives, but some of them view zoning as a property right itself to ensure that neighborhoods don’t change and can keep out apartments housing ‘those people.’ I hear both arguments even from the same people. One actually aligns with traditional conservative thinking on markets, and the other is an attitude you learn by osmosis if you’re an affluent suburbanite.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Guardrails on government</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With more than two decades of working on land use law under her belt, Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield, understands the costs of development delays and broadly supports the governor’s desire to reduce regulation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s important we still have zoning at the local level because we don’t know everything at the state level,” she said. “But the state can come in, set guardrails and reframe what local governments are using as the tools in their toolbox to make local land use decisions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When contemplating how the commonwealth could end </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2021/06/17/exclusionary-zoning-its-effect-on-racial-discrimination-in-the-housing-market/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">exclusionary zoning</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Coyner points to how lawmakers dealt with proffers — the fees localities are allowed to charge homebuilders to offset the costs of their developments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We created this state system where localities could broadly define proffers and raise the cost of housing to keep certain people out,” she said. “When the state clawed back proffers discretion from the localities, it was an effort to more closely align the intent of proffers to the original legislation.”</span></p>

	</div>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other issue at play is a lack of communication, according to Coyner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have really failed to educate the average citizen and business owner,” she said. “Grocery stores don’t just show up because you want them. They draw a circle and look and see if that area meets their demographics. If we start letting people do their own analysis, they’ll realize local leaders are not just putting more houses in to irritate me but they&#8217;re building houses here so we can have more services.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the initial support of lawmakers like Del. Coyner, the governor’s proposals to increase housing production will likely face an uphill battle. Beyond seeking the simultaneous support of a Democratic Senate and a Republican House, Youngkin will have to contend with the political power of Virginia’s cities and counties, which are always loath to lose any ounce of land use authority.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his signature optimistic fashion, the governor believes he can find the right balance and get his bills passed: “We in fact have to respect landowners&#8217; rights and we have to make sure the zoning and permitting processes are set up to be pro-development,” he said. “We can do both. This is not an ‘or.’ It’s an ‘and.’ Oftentimes we find ourselves arguing and forgetting that we can do both.”</span></p>

<p>The latest Consumer Price Index numbers, which are used to measure inflation, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/inflation-cpi-consumer-price-index-fell-in-october-77/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">came out Thursday morning and showed a notable easing</a>.

Powell said that although the Fed is aware of the data, it still looks at the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) to understand how it should respond to inflation because it’s important for the Fed to understand rent for all tenants, not just new leases. But he added that rent should start to come down eventually.</p>
<p>“One thing is that I think right now, if you look at the pattern of that series of the new leases, it’s very pro-cyclical. So rents went up much more than the CPI and PCE rents did and now they’re coming down faster,” he said. “The new leases are telling you there will come a point at which rent inflation will start to come down but that point is well out from where we are now.”</p>
<p>Economists spoke to States Newsroom about what factors are affecting the health of the housing market right now.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Month-over-month data from </span><a href="https://www.rent.com/research/average-rent-price-report/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rent.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for September, the latest month available, shows rent prices are finally starting to moderate. Year-over-year rent increases were up 8.8% in September compared to a 12.3% increase in August. In the states Rent.com looked at, median month-over-month rent fell in more than 60% of markets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John O’Trakoun, senior policy economist in the research department of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, said it’s possible that the moderation in rent prices is a good sign for the economy but added that it could take more than a year for the private data to show up in lagging economic indicators.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think it is kind of encouraging. Hopefully, in like 18 months or so, we&#8217;ll start to see this inflection point in the asking rent to flow through into the CPI and PCE [</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personal Consumption Expenditures] </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">shelter components. But in the meantime, we&#8217;ve got to keep the pressure going on inflation and slow down demand in order to better match with supply constraints,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thomas LaSalvia, senior economist at Moody’s Analytics, said that although he sees rent growth falling, he doesn’t expect to see a big change in rental prices unless there is a lot more stress in the labor market. The latest jobs </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t01.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showed that in October, the unemployment rate rose by 0.2% and the percentage of people working or actively looking for work hadn’t changed significantly from 62.2% in September to 62.3% in October.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LaSalvia and Lu Chen, senior economist at Moody’s Analytics, said that in terms of housing affordability, on an average basis, they don’t see the rent burden “continually growing.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Inflation creating the wrong incentives for builders </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">O’Trakoun said inflation is still exacerbating problems with the housing supply, including a lack of starter homes. He said that if inflation goes down, it could stop affecting construction costs, which in turn hurts the housing supply. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_22861" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1920px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_5587-2-scaled.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-22861" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_5587-2-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1208" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_5587-2-scaled.jpg 1920w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_5587-2-300x189.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_5587-2-1024x644.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_5587-2-768x483.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_5587-2-1536x966.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_5587-2-2048x1288.jpg 2048w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_5587-2-696x438.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_5587-2-1068x672.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_5587-2-668x420.jpg 668w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  New residential construction in Richmond. (Sarah Vogelsong/ Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Part of that is because the cost of construction has gone up and finding construction workers and compensating them has gone up. I think it&#8217;s partly the choice of builders who are like, ‘Well look, it&#8217;s so expensive to build this, I&#8217;m going to build those properties that offer a higher return per square foot,’ and that&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve seen this kind of reallocation,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">O’Trakoun added that construction costs should level off once the Fed gets inflation under control.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seasonally adjusted rate of privately-owned </span><a href="https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">housing starts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in September was 1,439,000, compared to 1,566,000 housing starts in August. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics/research-reports/highlights-from-the-profile-of-home-buyers-and-sellers" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the National Association of Realtors, first-time home buyers made up 26% of the market in the year that ended July 22, a drop from 34% during the same period the previous year. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Pandemic darling’ markets are cooling down</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier in the pandemic, people from higher-income areas moved to cities with lower housing prices and caused those prices to soar, but Moody’s Analytics economists say those areas are finally beginning to cool down. They said to watch out for rental prices moderating in places like Miami, Orlando, Raleigh, Salt Lake City, Tampa and Jacksonville, as well as metropolitan areas in the Southeast, Southwest and Mountain West in general. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of these markets went from rent growth in the market of 4% or 5% quarter over quarter — sometimes more than that — down to below average, and I think we’re getting to a point where that’s the emerging interesting story, is the deceleration in those pandemic period darlings. … They&#8217;ve lost the momentum of that in-migration of those higher-income households,” LaSalvia said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chen said these “pandemic darling” markets are experiencing a correction in rental market prices now that fewer people are moving to these areas.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Mortgage rates helping home buyers?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The past few years of low interest rates, low inventory and investor speculation have been a boon to home sellers but priced many home buyers out of the market and helped push rental prices higher. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_32839" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_8280-scaled.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-32839" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_8280-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_8280-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_8280-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_8280-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_8280-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_8280-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_8280-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A house for sale in Richmond.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But with mortgage rates near their highest levels in </span><a href="https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/analysis/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">20 years</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, markets are starting to adjust.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Investor housing p</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">urchases appear to have plateaued just under the record high levels we saw in the third quarter of 2021,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">O’Trakoun said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He doesn’t expect investors to completely leave the market, however, noting that some may take advantage of less competition, and that will keep home prices from falling as rapidly as they otherwise might. The change could also affect the rental market, he said, as some investors will convert the homes they buy into rentals to take advantage of strong demand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that because of high mortgage rates, some markets could see increases. &#8220;That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important for the Fed right now not to bank on just one reading of the month-over-month listing of rents coming down and declaring victory on inflation too soon,”  he said.</span></p>

(Nate Cline / Virginia Mercury)</p><p>The Department of Housing and Urban Development has opened up millions of dollars in funding for groups serving unhoused people in rural areas — an unprecedented move by the agency, say housing advocates.</p>
<p>People living in cars, parks and on the street at night, which the agency labels unsheltered homelessness, have increased across the nation, particularly in urban areas on the West Coast, but rural areas across the country are also being affected, a department spokesperson said.<b> </b></p>
<p>Continuums of Care, the planning bodies that address homelessness within specific regions, have until Oct. 20 to apply for a portion of $54.5 million targeted at rural homelessness. HUD could not provide an estimate for how many organizations would benefit from this funding but said that 127 of them are eligible to apply.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/sites/default/files/pdf/2020-AHAR-Part-1.pdf" target="_blank">According to</a> the department’s January 2021 report to Congress, 2020 was the first year since it began collecting this data in 2005 that there were more unsheltered unhoused people than people living in shelters. The report also noted that “largely rural [Continuums of Care] had the largest percentage of people experiencing homelessness in unsheltered locations” at 44%, compared to 39% in Continuums of Care that include major cities. From 2019 to 2020, there was an 8.3% increase in unsheltered homelessness in largely rural Continuums of Care.</p>
<p>Steve Berg, vice president for programs and policy at the National Alliance to End Homelessness, said the housing challenges are different in rural areas. Berg said the issue in rural areas is not always a lack of housing, as it is in urban areas, but a lack of safe housing.</p>
<p>“In rural areas, there&#8217;s housing and a lot of it is vacant or it&#8217;s run down. It&#8217;s not kept up well, so it&#8217;s substandard housing. If that goes on for too long, then people just can&#8217;t live there safely.”</p>
<p>Berg added that the systems in place for addressing homelessness in rural areas also operate differently from those in urban areas.</p>
<p>“There aren&#8217;t homeless programs in a lot of rural areas. A county that&#8217;s mostly rural might get a little bit of federal homelessness money, but it&#8217;s not enough to really run a program or people&#8217;s salaries,” he said. “So in a big city, you&#8217;ve got a whole sort of system of homeless programs that are dealing with different aspects of the problem and are overseen usually by a centralized agency that makes decisions about how the funding will be doled out and who will go to work. None of that really exists in a lot of rural areas.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Service deserts</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Adrienne Bush, executive director for the Homeless and Housing Coalition of Kentucky, said that understanding how many unhoused people are in rural areas is challenging because of “service deserts” where there aren’t shelters or housing programs available to count the number of unhoused people.</p>
<p>Bush said that there is a need for more resources for outreach as well, which looks different in rural areas. For example, it could require going to a state park and walking up and down river beds rather than going to an encampment under an overpass.</p>
<p>In 2020, the states with the highest percentages of unsheltered unhoused people overall were Nevada, Oregon, California, Hawaii and Arkansas. Maine, New York, Nebraska, Massachusetts and North Dakota had the lowest rates, <a href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/sites/default/files/pdf/2020-AHAR-Part-1.pdf" target="_blank">according to</a> the 2021 HUD report. HUD also has $267.5 million in funds available to address the unsheltered homeless population in non-rural areas. The report also found that largely rural Continuums of Care that had the highest percentages of unsheltered unhoused people were in West Tennessee, including the city of Jackson; Lake County, California; and seven counties in Florida: Hamilton, Columbia, Suwanee, Lafayette, Hardee, Highlands and Hendry.</p>
<p>The HUD funding will begin to address the challenges advocates describe.</p>
<p>Brenda Gray, executive director of Heartland Coalition for the Homeless in Florida, whose coverage area includes Hendry, Hardee and Highlands counties, said that some of the challenges of preventing homelessness in the area include a lack of affordable housing.</p>
<p>Gray said she hopes that at least a few of the six counties the Heartland Coalition serves will be selected for projects. One possible project she’s looked at would be a pilot project in Hendry County for 12 or 13 <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/02/06/1077791467/tiny-homes-big-dreams-how-some-activists-are-reimagining-shelter-for-the-homeles" target="_blank">tiny houses</a> on a third of an acre of land.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;re a small Continuum of Care and what we really need funds for is a housing specialist. My clients that we serve right now — we try to assist them as much as we can in locating housing,” Gray said. “But without a housing locator or a housing specialist, there&#8217;s not too much we can do. So what we ask them to do is to find housing and then we will help you get into that place financially, providing you will qualify. So housing specialists and outreach is the most important in my point of view. Because we’ve got a case manager trying to do everything.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Housing first policy</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Bush said that she sees the HUD funding as an opportunity for areas that can’t supplement federal dollars with money from their local general fund and tax base like Louisville and Lexington can.</p>
<p>“Some of these smaller communities, say Hopkinsville, Kentucky, don&#8217;t have that luxury, and so whatever money for homeless services they have, it&#8217;s going to be coming from the federal government and dependent on whether there is a local organization that has the capacity to apply for and deliver high-quality services with federal funds,” she said. “The state is not supplementing anything from its general fund towards homeless assistance and that is unfortunately true for a lot of southern states.”</p>
<p>She added that one of the things she likes about the funding opportunity is that it incentivizes projects that have partnerships with housing providers.</p>
<p>“The idea here is to increase the [housing] stock and streamline the process from people experiencing homelessness to actually get into the housing,” Bush said.</p>
<p>HUD says that one of its policy priorities for the funding is a “housing first” approach. The department says that Continuums of Care should “engage landlords and property owners to identify an inventory of housing available for rapid rehousing and permanent supportive housing participants, remove barriers to entry, and adopt service delivery methods that respond to the preferences and needs of the individual or family presenting for assistance.” It also requires that Continuums of Care describe their current strategy for recruiting landlords and how they would use data to change their recruitment strategy.</p>
<p>Leeanne Sacino, executive director of the Florida Coalition to End Homelessness, said in an email that many rural communities struggle to provide services because of staffing issues caused by low pay. Sacino added that many rural communities in the state don’t even have shelters.</p>
<p>She said that the HUD funding provides for services like short-term emergency stays in hotels, emergency food and clothing, prevention of homelessness for those who are behind on paying rent, and things that will help build agencies&#8217; and organizations’ capacity, such as employee education, that aren’t usually available to Continuums of Care.</p>
<p>While the HUD funding represents a step toward addressing rural homelessness in the U.S., Berg said that the department needs a lot more funding from Congress to truly address homelessness throughout the country: “They have programs that are well designed to get good results, but they&#8217;re just never funded enough to really go to scale.”</p>
<p>For upcoming federal appropriations, the National Alliance to End Homelessness is <a href="https://endhomelessness.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/July2022_FY2023Priorities.pdf" target="_blank">advocating for</a> $3.6 billion in funding for HUD’s Homeless Assistance Grants and $32.1 billion for the Tenant Based Rental Assistance account.</p>

</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Given the decades-long decline in new housing construction and the resultant skyrocketing of rents and home prices across the commonwealth, the need for more homes has become a consensus position in Virginia. However, even those who support increasing housing construction have </span><a href="https://commonedge.org/the-architectural-pandemic-of-the-stick-frame-over-podium-building/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">mixed</span></a> <a href="https://commonedge.org/in-praise-of-5-over-1-buildings/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">feelings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> about the dominant design of the times: 5-over-1 buildings — so named for the number of wood-framed residential floors over the concrete, often retail-filled ground floor.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Such massive, boxy apartment buildings are all too often the only type of structures developers are interested in erecting due to the demands of the state’s building codes. A proposal to alter such standards heard before a Department of Housing and Community Development building code stakeholder committee last month may soon offer alternatives.  If a rule to allow new construction to have a single staircase up to six stories is approved, then smaller buildings that better foster community among residents could begin popping up in cities and towns across the commonwealth.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Older than building codes</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After the approval of a </span><a href="https://www.cvilletomorrow.org/articles/five-years-later-charlottesville-has-a-new-comprehensive-plan/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">new comprehensive plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> for Charlottesville, Planning Commission chair Lyle Solla-Yates realized much of the plan’s ideas for equitable infill and missing middle housing weren’t allowed under the statewide building codes. That’s why he petitioned the DHCD technical subcommittee in charge of the codes to authorize single staircase buildings up to six stories late last year. The proposal has been under review ever since. Should DHCD’s stakeholders board come to a consensus in favor of the change, the building codes could be amended as soon as the start of the next calendar year.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Allowing double the number of stories to be served by just a single staircase is actually incredibly common. Although the United States and Canada lowered the height limit for such construction to three stories nearly a century ago, the rest of the world never allowed fears of fires to hinder such housing. Indeed, much of the iconic architecture of </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-16/the-history-of-paris-s-chambres-de-bonne?srnd=storythread-QH14LDDWX2Q601" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Paris</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-13/the-story-behind-berlin-s-iconic-home-design?srnd=storythread-QH14LDDWX2Q601" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Berlin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-04-07/the-design-history-of-tokyo-s-public-housing?srnd=storythread-QH14LDDWX2Q601" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">beyond</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> would today be illegal to build had other countries adopted similar standards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The decision on whether two internal staircases are needed for buildings over three floors or whether one internal staircase and an external fire escape suffices may come down to the judgment of the </span><a href="https://www.vafire.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Virginia Department of Fire Programs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Efforts to present fire experts with the facts on single staircase structures are already underway giving advocates hope that fire officials’ support can be secured before DHCD comes to a final decision later this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Andrew Clark, vice president of government affairs for the Home Builders Association of Virginia, is confident that all parties can come to a consensus. “It’s important we hear the fire professionals out, but this is not a new concept that hasn’t been explored anywhere else,” he said. “Other cities, states and countries already do this, and it’s not like they value fire safety any less. We need practical building codes that allow builders and architects to put needed designs onto the ground. There’s a way we can do this to address everyone’s concerns.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Modern American building codes mandate double-loaded staircases if a building exceeds three stories, inevitably leading developers to build the big, bland 5-over-1s.  Such construction also demands a lot of land — something in short supply in Virginia’s older cities where the housing crisis is at its most acute.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Charlottesville is older than zoning or building codes so our city was not laid out for double-loaded staircases,” explained Solla-Yates.  “Good stuff is not allowed under the state code so good stuff doesn’t get built. Instead of letting land owners do small parcel development, we only allow wealthy people to amass many parcels and build one giant set of apartments.  We’re forcing that type of sudden, shocking change to our city blocks.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Community through compactness</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When developers can’t buy up enough parcels to make a double-loaded staircase structure financially feasible, they often have to abandon their plans for the site and leave the lot empty instead of building something smaller.  If DHCD approves the six-story single staircase code change, many of those narrow potential infill sites in older cities like Richmond, Alexandria and Norfolk could become viable again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This has the potential to unlock some really challenging sites in cities and built out areas that are trying to figure out how to do infill right,” said Clark.  “Removing one staircase can really change the equation on what housing can be provided more affordably.  Once you start opening up square footage from the staircases and corridors that eat up so much space you can create more of a communal feel for new buildings.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instead of the long, dark corridors demanded by double-loaded staircases, single staircase buildings create community through their compactness. “In a double-loaded building you may never know your neighbors,” said Michael Eliason, architect and founder of </span><a href="https://www.larchlab.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Larch Lab</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.  “In a single staircase structure with four units per floor and six stories, that is 24 units total. Humans can know 40 people, so these buildings are really at a scale that you can feasibly know all of your neighbors.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides single staircase buildings’ social benefits, such construction also offers architectural advantages. When there is no cavernous hallway going straight through the middle of the building apartments can stretch from one side of the building to the other, enabling cross ventilation and sunlight on both sides of the unit. In America where we force most multi-family development onto busy corridors, single staircase buildings also allow residents a reprieve from street noise if they can simply walk to the other side of their apartment to escape the ruckus and pollution of heavy traffic.</span></p>

(Lyle Solla-Yates)</p></figure>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Changing the equation</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The final big benefit of single staircase construction is the flexibility of the floorplans and the potential for cost savings.  “In a double-loaded corridor building if you have a three-bedroom unit it takes up the real estate of two to three units, so they become prohibitively expensive,” Eliason said.  “Single staircase buildings offer a mix of units and a diversity of unit sizes, creating housing for various forms of living so that people have choices besides a single-family house or a one-bedroom unit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Given that a second staircase eats up about 400 square feet per floor, over six stories a second staircase can waste around 2,400 square feet across the entire building. If no second staircase is required by the building codes, that space can be turned into additional housing units, shared spaces for residents like music practice rooms, or it could just not be built at all saving developers (and future tenants) construction costs ranging from $465,000 in </span><a href="https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/Richmond_VA/overview" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Richmond</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to </span><a href="https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/Alexandria_VA/overview" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">$852,000</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in Alexandria.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Increased living space and lower construction costs translate to more affordable rents without any state subsidy required — exactly the outcome Solla-Yates and others in Charlottesville are hoping their new comp plan will produce. It’s incredibly rare for affordable housing advocates to attack their issue via the building codes, but it’s an approach that Clark hopes to see more of going forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Land use, </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/10/22/could-removing-parking-requirements-revitalize-virginias-cities/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">parking minimums</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, and zoning are all important, but there is this whole building code process that is overlooked because it’s super technical that is also increasing the upfront costs of development,” he said. “Every single year there is stuff that gets proposed and adopted in the building code that adds costs onto new housing, but you don’t get a lot of affordable housing advocates that get involved, so things can sometimes inadvertently compound costs and make denser development impossible.”</span></p>

(Jim Morrison/ For the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hampton Roads Ventures, the controversial subsidiary of Norfolk&#8217;s housing authority, will try to add a Norfolk project in the next application for tax credits used to finance projects in distressed areas.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The corporation came under fire from some City Council members after a <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/12/21/why-is-a-norfolk-community-development-entity-investing-everywhere-but-norfolk/" target="_blank">Virginia Mercury series</a> revealed it had won $360 million of New Markets Tax Credits from 2003 through 2021, but invested only a fraction of that in Norfolk. Instead, HRV has funded projects worth hundreds of millions of dollars as far afield as Texas, Nebraska, and Idaho. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The promise came after meetings between city officials and representatives of the housing authority and fact-finding by City Attorney Bernard Pishko, who raised questions about HRV&#8217;s practices and requested its financial files. In email exchanges with Pishko and others, Delphine Carnes, the lawyer for the Norfolk Redevelopment and Housing Authority and Hampton Roads Ventures, stops short of definitively agreeing to include Norfolk projects in the next application, due in early 2023. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As previously discussed, we will work</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to include one or two eligible Norfolk projects in HRV’s pipeline for the next NMTC application,&#8221; she wrote in an email to Pishko on Jan. 19. In a later email, she detailed a process where the Department of Economic Development would vet potential projects and submit them to the for-profit subsidiary of the NRHA for consideration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A public meeting between City Council and representatives of the housing authority is scheduled for the May 10 work session. In preparation for the meeting, Pishko and the city&#8217;s head of economic development, Jared Chalk, have traded emails with Carnes and met at least twice. Last September, HRV won a $50 million allocation of tax credits, one of </span><a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0340" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">100 community development entities </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">(CDEs) earning awards from the U.S. Treasury Department&#8217;s Community Development and Financial Institutions Fund. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The email by Carnes was one of several dozen files surrendered by the city in response to public records requests by the Mercury for exchanges between the NRHA and the city from December through March 24.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The records provide a fuller picture of the finances of Hampton Roads Ventures and the funds available to the housing authority, the subsidiary&#8217;s expenses, and chronicle the attempt by Carnes to explain why the community development entity has not invested in Norfolk.  They include 10 years of audits, a spreadsheet of earnings from fees over a decade, and a list of salaries and benefits paid to HRV&#8217;s four (now three) employees. Norfolk charged $118 to retrieve the material. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HRV, the files show, had about $10 million in &#8220;retained earnings&#8221; at the end of 2020. Operating expenses have been roughly $1 million annually in recent years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March, a Virginia Mercury reporter received an email from an agent in the Inspector General’s Office of the Department of Housing and Urban Development seeking information about HRV. The reporter declined, referring the agent to published stories and available documents. The agent did not answer an email in late April asking whether the investigation is moving forward.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">&#8216;HRV cannot focus on Norfolk transactions at this point&#8217;</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the $250 million Hampton Roads Ventures had invested by the end of 2019, the last year federal records are complete, only $35.2 million was in Norfolk. No projects have been funded in Norfolk since 2008. Since then, HRV has moved to focus on rural investments that it says are more likely to win allocations during the annual competition for funds. About 20 percent of allocations go to rural projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a January email, Carnes brushed aside an initial request that HRV pursue only projects in the city. &#8220;HRV cannot focus on Norfolk transactions at this point based on its agreements with the CDFI Fund. Reversing that course would mean that HRV is in violation of its agreement with the U.S. Treasury,&#8221; she wrote. &#8220;HRV has been a rural CDE for years, and the CDFI Fund does not favor changes in strategy. HRV does not have a sufficient urban track record at this point to justify an award using this strategy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the reasons for that, she added, was HRV’s fault. Projects in Norfolk, notably the Attucks Theatre refinancing and the investment in a boat hotel near East Beach, had compliance problems and would not be permitted under the current rules. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She supplied Pishko with a spreadsheet showing an annual average of $456,000 in upfront fees and $723,000 in management fees HRV has collected over the past 10 years. The average income from all fees over that decade was $1.4 million annually. Net income in recent years has been about $500,000. But relatively little of that has been transferred to NRHA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why HRV has sat on what grew to $10 million in reserves by January is not clear. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The 2020 operating expenses are over $1,000,000,&#8221; Pishko wrote. &#8220;Is there any industry benchmark, is this high or low or in between? The 2020 salaries and benefits are $495,268. Please provide a breakdown of who was paid what salary and an explanation of benefit cost. Has consideration been given to whether HRV can be operated for less by using NRHA employees?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a response, Carnes reported that Jennifer Donohue, HRV&#8217;s chief executive officer, earns $191,533 in salary and benefits. The two other HRV employees, the compliance officer and administrative assistant, earn $84,447 and $81,629 in salaries and benefits. John Kownack, the former executive director of NRHA, earned $90,287 before he left HRV in November. The rest of the expenses for salary and benefits went towards parking, payroll administration, taxes, and workman’s compensation. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HRV also committed in 2016 to paying a $75,000 annual premium for 10 years for a cash surrender life insurance policy in the name of a &#8220;key employee&#8221; that appears to be Donohue, according to audits obtained through a different records request. HRV has a </span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/professionals/010616/split-dollar-life-insurance-how-it-works.asp" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">split dollar agreement with the employee.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Five years after the premiums are fully funded in the amount of $750,000, the outstanding principal and interest of 2 percent annually is due from the employee. Such arrangements permit a corporation to fill the void if the employee perishes. They can also serve as a low-interest loan or an additional retirement plan for the employee. It&#8217;s not clear exactly how the HRV insurance policy is structured.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carnes dismissed the idea of using NRHA employees, as they were in the past, adding “that has not proven helpful.” HRV reimbursed NRHA more than $1.3 million for work by the housing authority’s staff between 2006 and 2020. “The NMTC program is very complex and requires extensive financial knowledge and training,” she said. “Using NRHA employees is no longer a viable consideration.” </span></p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">An atypical CDE </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies like Hampton Roads Ventures are called community development entities. They may be offshoots of banks, nonprofits, public agencies or other financial institutions. They apply for new markets tax credits from the U.S. Treasury Department and, if they prevail in the highly competitive process, they match projects and investors who earn a 39 percent tax break over seven years. The Treasury Department says for every dollar invested in the program it spurs $8 in private investment on average.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deals are complicated, generally offering lower interest rates and fees to developers. The program targets distressed and severely distressed neighborhoods with high poverty rates that otherwise would not attract investment. In a simple example, the borrower — a developer or business — would get a $10 million investment in a project at a cost of about $7.2 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hampton Roads Ventures appears to be a rarity, a private, for-profit CDE created by a public body. St. Louis, with a population of 300,000 compared to Norfolk’s 240,000, had $1.4 billion in New Markets Tax Credits projects through 2019, the last year compiled in a federal database. The city’s nonprofit community development entity, </span><a href="https://www.stlouis-mo.gov/government/departments/sldc/about-SLDC.cfm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the St. Louis Development Corporation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has won </span><a href="https://www.stlouis-mo.gov/government/departments/sldc/news/sldc-to-receive-40-million-in-federal-new-markets-tax-credits.cfm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$493 million in allocations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, all invested in the city, creating more than 6,800 jobs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike HRV, the St. Louis Development Corporation puts out a request for proposals after earning an allocation, holds public monthly board meetings and subjects itself to  public documents requests (as a nonprofit, its tax returns are public).  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Donald Musacchio, the chair of NRHA’s board of commissioners, and Ronald Jackson, NRHA&#8217;s executive director, refused requests for interviews through Carnes.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Treasury Department rules for New Markets Tax Credits, the 39 percent tax break is spread over seven years. Carnes, in another email to Pishko, said that means HRV must maintain operating reserves &#8220;equal to one year worth of operating expenses, which is $1,322,355.&#8221; She also said HRV needed another reserve in case a project fails and the credits are &#8220;recaptured&#8221; by the Treasury Department. That amounts to $5 million, she wrote.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not all CDEs operated by public agencies, however, maintain reserves for possible project defaults. Some parent companies make the guarantee. And some New Markets Tax Credits consultants handle compliance and guarantee their services against any default or recapture of the credits by the Treasury Department. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carnes told Pishko that HRV was founded to create a revenue stream for NRHA because HUD funding had declined. But the objective of the program is to spur private investment in neighborhoods like the 16 severely distressed census tracts in Norfolk. The Treasury Department says every dollar invested in a New Markets Tax Credits project attracts an additional $8 of private investment. By focusing exclusively on projects outside the city, Norfolk does not reap that benefit.</span></p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">&#8216;Not something that has ever been part of HRV’s strategy&#8217;</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HRV was formed in 2003. But through 2021, only $1.3 million flowed into the housing authority, all since 2016. In a January email, Pishko also asked why HRV had not contributed more funding to NRHA. Carnes said NRHA had been “prudent” in seeking distributions. &#8220;The objective is not for NRHA to spend all the HRV available funds at one time,&#8221; she added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HRV did transfer $970,000 to NRHA after The Virginia Mercury filed a records request on March 8 with the housing authority seeking any distribution of funds since the stories were published. NRHA responded two days later with a letter from Ronald Jackson, the executive director, dated March 9, requesting that HRV transfer the money to the authority. HRV completed the transaction the next day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $970,000 is the largest single contribution HRV has made to NRHA and raises the total since 2016 to $2.3 million. Before 2016, it is not clear that HRV, which began in 2003, contributed any funding beyond reimbursing NRHA for staff working on HRV projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a March 14 email to Chalk, Carnes outlined what she called a process for Norfolk projects to be considered by HRV. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the memo, she outlined the proposed process, which relies on the city to do the original vetting:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city&#8217;s Department of Economic Development would coordinate submissions. Developers would first go through the city, not HRV, and submit the proposed project, budget, source of      funds and the community impact, including the number of jobs. The city staff would then do the preliminary investigation into whether the project was a good candidate.</span></span></span></li>
<li>The city would then submit the project to HRV for review and confirmation that it fits within what she called HRV&#8217;s approved asset classes: manufacturing, medical facilities, and retail projects including a grocery store or other “food” component.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city’s inquiry began on Dec. 22 when Pishko emailed Carnes. &#8220;Delphine, we have read Jim Morrison’s article regarding HRV providing their new market tax credits to investors developing outside of Norfolk and need to know why they were not provided to developers in Norfolk. Please advise,&#8221; he wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the main issues,” Carnes wrote back, “is that developers must have a commercial building with no housing at all or very little housing in order to qualify for new markets tax credits. Most Norfolk transactions we have been made aware of over the years are transactions where there are apartments and an ancillary commercial or retail use,&#8221; she replied, in part.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That description from Carnes, who markets herself as </span><a href="http://www.delphinecarneslaw.com/2017/04/01/bringing-capital-to-underserved-communities/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an expert</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in New Markets Tax Credits,</span><a href="https://www.housingonline.com/Documents/Developing_For_Sale_and_Rental_Housing_Using_NMTCsa.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is inaccurate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to</span><a href="https://www.cdfifund.gov/sites/cdfi/files/documents/2020-introduction-to-the-nmtc-program_-final.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the CDFI Fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and other experts. Mixed-use developments with rental housing are permissible if 20 percent of the income is from commercial or retail. Using tax credits to </span><a href="https://housingpartnership.net/growing-homeownership-with-new-markets-tax-credits" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">invest in for-sale affordable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> housing</span><a href="https://smithnmtc.com/our-work/projects-map/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has become more widespread </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in recent years with nonprofits in </span><a href="https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/group-chosen-to-administer-15-million-st-louis-housing-fund/article_8752f780-7c21-5411-a4b8-762932b9dd8f.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">St. Louis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.enterprisecommunity.org/news/collaboration-boost-affordable-homeownership-atlanta" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Atlanta</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Indianapolis, </span><a href="https://smithnmtc.com/neighborhood-housing-services-of-baltimore-receives-6m-allocation-to-rehab-27-homes/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baltimore</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a couple of dozen other cities responding to the affordable housing crisis using the program.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In St. Louis, $18.3 million in New Markets Tax Credits helped Habitat for Humanity </span><a href="https://smithnmtc.com/our-work/case-studies/habitat-for-humanity-st-louis/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">build more than 100 for-sale affordable homes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the majority of them in the city&#8217;s highly distressed Jeff-Vander-Lou neighborhood, doubling the percentage of homeownership. Crime dropped by half within two years.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked by email in a series of questions if she wanted to explain her replies, Carnes wrote, &#8220;I simply do not have time.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The one question she did answer was about housing. Investing in housing, she wrote, was not a current strategy of the housing authority&#8217;s for-profit subsidiary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In response to your question regarding residential rental housing and for-sale housing, the answer is yes, those activities are eligible for NMTC financing if structured properly. HRV financed a couple of mixed-use projects including affordable rental housing many years ago and has chosen to focus on other asset classes since then. Mixed-use projects can be very challenging from a structuring and ongoing compliance standpoint, and those projects are often much better candidates for LIHTC financing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Regarding for-sale housing, yes it is feasible and I am aware that some CDEs invest in that type of project,&#8221; she wrote. &#8220;It is simply not something that has ever been part of HRV’s strategy.&#8221;</span></p>

(Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>A state senator says he’ll introduce legislation that would allow tenants to make essential repairs if their landlords won’t and then deduct the cost from their monthly rent.</p>
<p>“Too often the landlord has all the power and none is given to the tenant,” said Sen. Bill Stanley, R-Franklin. “What we’re seeing, especially in lower rent housing, is that those landlords base their profits on having large amounts of tenants, and in doing so, they fail to do the most basic repairs.”</p>
<p>Advocates say many tenants already wrongly assume such laws are already on the books, leading them to withhold rent payments if the heat goes out or a roof starts leaking, which can then lead to their eviction. Instead, current Virginia law requires tenants to file paperwork in their local district court and begin paying their rent into an escrow account. Tenants can only file such an assertion if they are current on their rent.</p>
<p>Christie Marra, a lawyer with the Virginia Poverty Law Center, says most tenants don’t understand that process and that, even if they do, she and other tenant advocates argue the current system unfairly requires people to continue paying for a defective product, which, in the case of a low income tenant without heat in the dead of winter, is not practical if they also have to arrange for alternative housing.</p>
<p>Stanley says he’s filed two legislative proposals addressing the issue. One would allow tenants to make repairs landlords refuse to and deduct the cost from their rent. A second would allow tenants to raise a landlord’s failure to make repair as a defense in an eviction case — a law that exists in about 40 other states, according to Marra.</p>
<p>Landlords oppose the legislation, arguing the existing system is sufficient and that a “repair and deduct” approach would bog them down with frivolous maintenance-based defenses to late rent payments.</p>
<p>That said, the director of the Virginia Apartment Management Association, Patrick McCloud, says the organization is pursuing compromise legislation that would entitle tenants facing emergency maintenance requests that have gone unheeded to an expedited hearing before a judge.</p>
<p>“We all recognize that there is a certain segment in society that can be preyed upon by less than reputable people and we want to take care of that scenario without harming everyone else who’s doing it correctly,” he said.</p>
<p>It’s one of several tenants-rights issues that lawmakers will debate this year after a Princeton University study <a href="https://cura.vcu.edu/ongoing-projects/rva-eviction-lab/" target="_blank">found the state’s cities</a> have some of the highest eviction rates in the country. Lawmakers passed a package of legislation addressing evictions last year, including additional funding for legal aid lawyers and the eventual creation of an eviction diversion program.</p>
<p>This year, Gov. Ralph Northam introduced a budget that would fund the diversion program established last year and establishes a prevention program that would provide rental assistance before court proceedings are initiated.</p>
<p>Del. Jeff Bourne, D-Richmond, filed <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+HB1420" target="_blank">legislation</a> that would cap late fees landlords can charge tenants at 5 percent.</p>
<p>Three of the proposals require landlords to give tenants more information at various points in their tenancy.</p>
<p>Del. Jeion Ward, D-Hampton, has filed <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+HB393S" target="_blank">legislation</a> to draft a “Tenant Bill of Rights” that would use plain language to explain the provisions of the state’s rental housing laws and require a landlord to furnish every prospective tenant with a copy along with the lease agreement.</p>
<p>Dels. Mark Levine, D-Alexandria, and Del. Alfonso Lopez, D-Arlington, and Sen. Barbara Favola, D-Arlington, are <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+HB329" target="_blank">proposing</a> requiring all landlords to include contact information for legal services programs on any termination notices delivered to their tenants. Current law only requires public housing authorities to notify their tenants about legal services that may be available to them.</p>
<p>And Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, and Del. Kelly Convirs-Fowler, D-Virginia Beach, want to <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+HB858S" target="_blank">require</a> landlords to warn tenants before they sign a lease if the land is located in a special flood hazard area. The legislation, endorsed by the Virginia Housing Commission, would also apply to residential real estate transactions.</p>
