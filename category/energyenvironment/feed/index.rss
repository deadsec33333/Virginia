Dozens of media outlets republished our stories, too, which helped us reach new readers inside and outside the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, our readers were especially hungry to learn more about blue catfish and the invasive species&#8217; culinary potential, the state&#8217;s most stately trees and why preserving them is vital, a local school board that made history as the first in the nation to re-name schools after Confederate figures and another that sued a special needs student&#8217;s parent for $600,000. Here&#8217;s a recap of those stories and our other most-read reports and commentary of 2024.</span></p>

However citizens of the commonwealth view Shenandoah County School Board’s recent decision, Virginia appears to be the first in the nation to restore Confederate school names, after years of vigorous community engagement, a controversial renaming process, and a change in board priorities related to race, diversity and inclusion. <strong><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/20/virginia-school-board-restores-confederate-names/">Read more.</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>From the story:</strong> Of the roughly 2 million Virginians who’d been enrolled in Medicaid before the COVID-19 pandemic, over 480,000 of them have been disenrolled as of this August. Typically eligibility determinations are made annually, but they’d been on pause nationwide amid the pandemic due to federal policy. That’s changed over the past year in what’s colloquially referred to as “Medicaid Unwinding” as provisions of federal law have expired. <em><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/nearly-500000-virginians-in-medicaid-have-been-disenrolled/"><strong>Read more.</strong></a></em></p>

Last Monday, Youngkin awarded a $250,000 grant to Sea Farms, a family-owned and -operated aquaculture and seafood processing business with operations in Gloucester and Mathews counties, that among other uses will pay for a blast freezer that will increase the amount of blue catfish the company can buy and sell. </span><em><strong><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/05/blue-catfish-are-invasive-in-virginia-the-state-is-paying-to-get-more-of-them-on-peoples-tables/">Read more.</a></strong></em></p>

Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), a fusion power company founded in 2018 in Cambridge, Mass., unveiled plans to build the groundbreaking facility on a 100-acre site at James River Industrial Park in Chesterfield County. The plant, expected to generate 400 megawatts of electricity — enough to power 150,000 homes — could be operational by the early 2030s. </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/18/virginia-to-host-worlds-first-fusion-power-plant/"><b>Read more.</b></a></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>From the column:</strong> Data centers are making the transition (to zero-carbon energy sources) harder, but so is local resistance to building solar. General Assembly members mostly understand the connection, leading to a lively debate in last year’s legislative session over whether to override some local permit denials for solar projects – and if so, how to ensure the localities still have some say. Though none of the legislative proposals moved forward last year, the topic has become a central one for the recently revamped Commission on Electric Utility Regulation (CEUR). </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/03/data-centers-approved-solar-farms-rejected-what-is-going-on-in-rural-virginia/"><b>Read more.</b></a></p>

(Gerville/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a truth universally acknowledged: a politician in possession of elected office must be in want of large economic development projects.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such is the power of this compulsion that it is proof against all reason. Certainly, it has been proof against everything critics of the data center buildout have said so far: that Virginia is catapulting itself into a costly energy crisis that will raise utility bills for residents; that the public shows no love for this industry; and that the benefits to be gained (mostly in the form of construction jobs) will continue only as long as new projects follow one another in perpetuity until the landscape is consumed by concrete and transmission wires. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To the credit of the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC), however, it has tried to sound the alarm. JLARC’s </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt598-2.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “Data Centers in Virginia,” released December 9, describes the challenges facing the state as a result of the massive, ongoing buildout of this resource-intensive industry. Many of JLARC’s conclusions seem way too sanguine to me, especially around risks to regional water supplies and air pollution from diesel generators, and the policy options it offers don’t always hit the mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But on the threat to Virginia’s energy supply, JLARC is blunt: Building enough infrastructure to provide electricity for even just half the data centers projected for development across the state will be difficult, requiring far more generating facilities than are under development today. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the current policy of allowing completely unconstrained data center growth – indeed, subsidizing it as we do now with tax exemptions to the tune of nearly a billion dollars per year – JLARC notes we are headed for a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/09/legislative-report-development-of-data-centers-could-triple-energy-demands-if-unconstrained/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tripling of the state’s electricity usage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over just the next decade and a half.  Meeting that much demand, says the report, would be “very difficult to achieve,” even if the state jettisoned the carbon emission limits imposed by the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA).</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those of you unfamiliar with the vocabulary of bureaucrats, “very difficult to achieve” is a term of art that translates roughly as, “This is nuts.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It might have been better if JLARC had employed the vernacular, because as it is, Virginia’s elected leaders will probably take “very difficult” to be a sort of heroic challenge, like beating the Russians to the moon, when what JLARC means is more like achieving lasting peace in the Middle East. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One problem is cost. The law of supply and demand dictates that a massive increase in energy demand that isn’t matched by an equally massive increase in energy supply will lead to higher prices for all customers. Yet new energy projects cost money, and under traditional ratemaking principles that also means higher rates for everyone. The result is that it will be impossible to protect residents from higher utility bills, unless changes are made to the way costs get allocated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Figuring out how to protect residents and other non-data center customers is currently a focus of the State Corporation Commission, which held a technical conference on data centers on December 16</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Judging by what the experts it convened had to say, the SCC has its work cut out for it.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if ordinary residents could be protected, the bigger problem is that increasing the supply of energy to keep up with soaring data center demand will not be easy, fast or cheap. JLARC warns that providing enough low-cost energy requires that gas plants, solar facilities, battery projects and transmission lines all be built at a pace Virginia has never achieved before, along with onshore wind farms that have never found takers here (though that may be </span><a href="https://virginiabusiness.com/big-tech-company-to-buy-power-from-va-s-first-onshore-wind-farm/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">changing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), offshore wind projects that currently lack a pathway to development, and starting ten years from now, new nuclear plants in the form of small modular reactors (SMRs) that haven’t yet achieved commercial viability.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="bC6aPdPSgo"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/02/data-centers-and-virginias-special-kind-of-denialism/">Data centers and Virginia’s special kind of denialism</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Data centers and Virginia’s special kind of denialism&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/02/data-centers-and-virginias-special-kind-of-denialism/embed/#?secret=nvV1Z3JuQf#?secret=bC6aPdPSgo" data-secret="bC6aPdPSgo" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the new generation and transmission will have to overcome local opposition. On the gas side, Dominion Energy’s plans for a new plant in Chesterfield County face </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/30/chesterfield-community-convenes-peoples-hearing-absent-a-county-held-one/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fierce resistance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the local community, which argues it has been burdened by fossil fuel pollution for too many years already. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clean energy also struggles at the local level. Industry representatives told members of the Commission on Electric Utility Regulation (CEUR) on December 17 that more than 30 localities have effectively banned utility solar projects within their borders. Legislators are loath to override local government authority over permitting, even when counties that welcome data centers </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/03/data-centers-approved-solar-farms-rejected-what-is-going-on-in-rural-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">turn down</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the solar facilities needed to power them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And of course, these generation projects involve willing landowners. When it comes to transmission lines that are forced on property owners through eminent domain – many of which will be needed only to carry power to data centers – the public backlash may be brutal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given so much local resistance to new generation and transmission, the fact that so many legislators nonetheless remain wedded to the data center buildout testifies to the ability of the human mind to compartmentalize. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For legislators who care about climate, JLARC has more bad news: Fully half the new data center growth coming to Virginia is slated to occur in the territories of rural electric cooperatives, which are largely unaffected by VCEA limits. In addition, very large customers of Dominion and APCo have their own VCEA loophole: if they meet certain requirements, they can leave their utility to buy power from competitive service providers. Thus, if Virginia is serious about decarbonization, it will have to tighten, not loosen, the VCEA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report comes with some caveats. JLARC used a team of consultants to model approaches to meeting the supply gaps, and a lot of assumptions go into the </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/presentations/JLARC%20Virginia%20Data%20Center%20Study_FINAL_12-09-2024.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">consultant’s report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> without a lot of details. The consultant group says it chose its mix of resources with a view to least cost, but it acknowledges that different assumptions would change the results. It may not have accounted for the fact that renewable energy and storage prices continue to drop; meanwhile, fossil gas</span><a href="https://rmi.org/the-myth-of-stable-and-affordable-natural-gas-prices/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> prices are so volatile </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that the one certain  thing you can say about any price forecast is that it will be wrong. Moreover, it appears the effects of re-entering the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative were not modeled; nor were the social costs of carbon, both of which favor zero-emission sources over fossil fuel plants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where there are details, some beg to be questioned. Both the consultants and JLARC take for granted that a shortage of generation in Virginia can be made up by importing electricity from other states. An easy way out, sure, but it works only if other states are producing a surplus. Unless tech companies are required to secure their own carbon-free energy supply, there is no way to guarantee imports will be available. Contrary to one of JLARC’s suggestions, then, retail choice should not be curtailed. The better move is to expand shopping options for large customers, so long as the electricity they buy is zero-carbon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even more suspect is the idea that, in order to comply with the VCEA, all gas plants will convert to burning green hydrogen in 2045. The report might as well say, “and then a miracle occurs.” A miracle would be more likely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However unserious, hydrogen as a placeholder for any hoped-for technology that isn’t available today demonstrates the fundamental problem confronting Virginia’s damn-the-torpedoes approach to data centers. A refusal to put constraints on the buildout means taking a leap into the unknown and hoping something will happen to save us from the consequences of our profligacy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And sure, maybe it will work out. Legislators tend to be optimists, and they are already betting on bright, shiny objects like SMRs, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/18/virginia-to-host-worlds-first-fusion-power-plant/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fusion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and anything else not close enough for its costs and drawbacks to be fully evident. (Not that I’m immune, but personally I’m betting on </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/10/geothermal-energy-is-having-a-moment-could-it-power-virginias-data-centers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advanced geothermal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is not just bright and shiny but </span><a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/geothermal/was-2024-a-breakout-year-for-next-generation-geothermal-energy?utm_campaign=canary&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_PBgowoMiLVuB0gJvnCX8OnYRhNoz2UvuX652kq3S-jmEBgONlCzBP1Jp9a7hRErUG07g0KbCHTMz-ugwvauV_vGzK4ueJwmL6XDS0ZYvLfxlEzsA&amp;_hsmi=339495518&amp;utm_source=newsletter" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">already here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.) And hey, for all we know, artificial intelligence, the technology most culpable for today’s energy crisis, might even produce some unexpected new energy source.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or it might not. Given that most of the data center buildout will happen in just</span><a href="https://baxtel.com/news/will-2025-be-the-year-of-the-data-center-here-are-three-promising-facts-from-the-virginia-market" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the next five years</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we might need an actual miracle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the flip side, maybe new technology will reduce the energy demand of data centers by </span><a href="https://cse.umn.edu/college/news/researchers-develop-state-art-device-make-artificial-intelligence-more-energy" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">orders of magnitude</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That would be a fantastic outcome from the standpoint of climate, water and energy — though it would end the construction gravy train in Virginia and leave a wasteland of empty concrete warehouses and stranded energy infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Either way, the unconstrained buildout of data centers has handed Virginia leaders a problem that is, in the parlance of JLARC, “very difficult” indeed.</span></p>

(Scott Yates for the Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Virginia’s booming data center industry is driving unprecedented energy demands, straining the state’s natural gas infrastructure and prompting calls for new pipelines. A Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC) report warns that expanding pipeline capacity may be necessary to meet the surge, bringing with it additional logistical and environmental challenges.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some efforts to expand pipeline capacity are already underway. In October, Williams Companies filed an </span><a href="https://elibrary.ferc.gov/eLibrary/filelist?accession_number=20241029-5076&amp;optimized=false" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">application </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for its Southeast Supply Enhancement Project (SSEP), which would add about 55 miles of pipeline — mostly in Southwest Virginia — to the existing 10,000-mile Transco Pipeline stretching from Texas to New York.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This follows the company’s </span><a href="https://elibrary.ferc.gov/eLibrary/filelist?accession_number=20231116-3071" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">approval </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">last year for its Commonwealth Energy Connector Project in Southside, designed to link in Greensville County with the Columbia Gas Virginia Reliability Project. That initiative, now under </span><a href="https://www.whro.org/environment/2024-07-19/construction-begins-on-pipeline-expansion-in-hampton-roads#" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">construction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, will deliver natural gas to the Hampton Roads region, addressing growing energy needs in that part of the state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Southgate extension project, an effort to extend the Mountain Valley Pipeline from Pittsylvania County into North Carolina, began consultations with the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality this year for permit reviews.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October, Balico, the Herndon-based developer previously associated with the canceled Atlantic Coast Pipeline, proposed a massive data center campus with 84 buildings and an on-site natural gas plant for power. However, strong community </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/11/04/data-center-proposal-in-pittsylvania-withdrawn-for-now/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">opposition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> forced the company to scale back its plans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mike Atchie, director of community and project outreach for Williams Companies, emphasized the importance of the  SSEP, which seeks to expand natural gas infrastructure across Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It ensures that infrastructure exists to support the rapid economic and population growth in the southeast,” Atchie said, adding that it also meets the region&#8217;s growing demand for stable and reliable energy to heat homes and power essential services.”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent pipeline developments have drawn sharp criticism from environmental groups, who warn about the potential impact on waterways the projects may need to cross and the continued reliance on carbon-emitting fossil fuels. Scientists link these emissions to worsening climate change, including more frequent and intense storms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Basically, we&#8217;re looking at two co-located projects,” said Jessica Sims, a field coordinator for Appalachian Voices. “You have two projects, co-located in Pennsylvania County, approximately [that] could be built at the same time.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The Southeast Supply Enhancement Project</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Williams Company plans to add about 55 miles of pipeline in Virginia and North Carolina through a series of loops —  parallel pipes designed to increase carrying capacity along existing lines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, the Eden Loop would include about 30.8 miles of 42 inch-diameter pipeline running from Pittsylvania County into Rockingham County, NC. The loop also includes two 33,000-horsepower electric-powered compressor stations, in addition to others in North Carolina.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=41587" rel="attachment wp-att-41587"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41587" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/SSEP-project.jpg" alt="" width="1055" height="818" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/SSEP-project.jpg 1055w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/SSEP-project-300x233.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/SSEP-project-1024x794.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/SSEP-project-768x595.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1055px) 100vw, 1055px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Williams has requested approval for the project by February 2026, with an in-service date set for Nov. 1, 2027. Among the gas recipients are the City of Danville and Southwest Virginia Gas, which would take 1,500 and 5,000 dekatherms, respectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Without new capacity, there is a risk of repeating past shortages and power outages,” Atchie said. “The expansion taps into established pipeline corridors to minimize environmental and landowner impacts and will be built and maintained using Williams’ industry-leading safety standards, including 24/7 monitoring and rigorous maintenance.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Southgate extension</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SSEP pipeline is planned to follow a similar route  to the 31-mile Southgate Extension project, which Mountain Valley Pipeline announced last </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/02/mountain-valley-proposes-shrinking-southgate-extension/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it would be reviving.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, the company has engaged with federal and state regulatory agencies, including the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), to discuss the permits required for the project’s revised scope, spokesperson Shawn Day said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Sims of Appalachian Voices raised concerns during a State Water Control Board meeting last month about Virginia code provisions that allow the DEQ to waive the requirement for a Section 401 permit under the federal Clean Water Act if the pipeline is below 36 inches. </span></p>

(Scott P. Yates for the Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The revised plans reduced the Southgate pipeline from 75 to 31 miles, eliminating the need for a  controversial compressor station, but increased the pipeline diameter from 24 and 16 inches to 30 inches, still under the threshold allowing the DEQ to waive the need for a water permit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The cumulative impacts from two major construction projects is one reason to give South gain more scrutiny than last time,” Sims told the board, pointing to its proximity to the SSEP project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked by the Mercury if the DEQ would waive any permits for the Southgate Extension project, DEQ spokesman John Giese said the agency has not received formal plans. “Southgate/Equitrans has informed [the] DEQ of their intent to move forward on a project and has discussed their general layout and timing of design,” Giese said. “However, no formal plans or permit application(s) have been submitted to [the] DEQ for review.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project is aiming to be operational by 2028, “to provide PSNC Energy and Duke Energy with an affordable, reliable and resilient natural gas supply to meet residential and business demand and generate electricity,” MVP Southgate spokesman Day said, adding the project &#8220;will secure all necessary permits and authorizations.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Balico’s data center</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The JLARC report highlighted natural gas as the most viable option for onsite power generation, a necessity for many large-scale projects in Southwest Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of the current technologies available, only natural gas appears viable for on-site generation, and it can be deployed only close to pipeline infrastructure that has sufficient capacity to serve generation needs,” the report stated.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_41586" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1313px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=41586" rel="attachment wp-att-41586"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-41586" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Balico-data-center.jpg" alt="" width="1313" height="854" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Balico-data-center.jpg 1313w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Balico-data-center-300x195.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Balico-data-center-1024x666.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Balico-data-center-768x500.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1313px) 100vw, 1313px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A engineering plan for the data center campus and onsite power generation source. (Courtesy of Pittsylvania County)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Pittsylvania County, Balico initially proposed a 2,300-acre data center campus with a 3,500-megawatt natural gas plant, but withdrew the plan after significant community pushback. In November, the company submitted a scaled down </span><a href="https://www.pittsylvaniacountyva.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/5911/638678889658570000" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">application</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a project requiring “more than 760 acres” and </span><a href="https://www.pittsylvaniacountyva.gov/government/departments/upcoming-zoning-special-use-permit-applications/-folder-407" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rezoning</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> land for “private electric power generation,” with a letter of intent from Mountain Valley Pipeline owner, EQT, “for the supply of a sufficient volume of natural gas to fuel the power plant proposed for the campus.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal is expected to be reviewed next year. Nearby, the town of Hurt passed a </span><a href="https://www.chathamstartribune.com/news/local/article_df6b1e6c-b26d-11ef-9744-4f2fedf60454.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">resolution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> supporting the project, agreeing to provide 2 million gallons of water per day through the construction of  a new water plant. Community opposition to the original proposal had largely centered on the water demands of the project.</span></p>

(Photo courtesy of the Chesapeake Bay Program)</p><p>A new bill in the U.S. Senate aims to combat illegal fishing practices and trade of endangered species worldwide, according to U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy.</p>
<p>The Louisiana Republican is sponsoring the proposal with with Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va. The Protecting Global Fisheries Act would expand the U.S. government’s authority to create and enforce maritime law alongside other nations, with their efforts centered on illegal and unregulated fishing practices.</p>
<p>The bill would also extend powers to the president to sanction people and vessels from other countries that violate these international agreements or participate in the sale, movement or purchase of endangered species.</p>
<p>“Illegal fishing practices abroad threaten Louisiana. Seafood production is a driver of our economy and way of life,” Cassidy said in a news release.</p>
<p>The bill will prevent “unfair competition” from countries such as China and “can preserve jobs, protect our local economies, strengthen national security, and safeguard marine habitats,” the senator added.</p>
<p>Illegal fishing practices the bill aims to curb include fishing without proper licensing, failure to report catches or falsifying reports, use of prohibited fishing gear and unpermitted transfer of fish to cargo vessels.</p>
<p>Louisiana has a long standing history with the fishing industry, generating around $2.4 billion a year, according to numbers Cassidy cited. Louisiana is well-known for its shrimp, crab, crawfish and oyster fisheries but also brings in between 600 million and 900 million <a href="https://lailluminator.com/2024/10/31/fish-spills/" target="_blank">menhaden</a> a year. Also known as pogies, menhaden are used to make fertilizer and animal feed. Their offshore harvests generate $25 million in state tax revenue annually and employ around 2,000 people.</p>
<p>The Cassidy-Kaine bill is also being pitched as a defense for the state’s shrimping industry, which has <a href="https://lailluminator.com/2023/06/02/louisiana-shrimpers-say-theyve-been-stranded-while-lawmakers-tread-water/" target="_blank">suffered</a> in recent years from onslaught of imported seafood flooding the market and tanking prices of local catch.</p>

(Courtesy of Commonwealth Fusion Systems)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia could soon make history as the home of the world’s first nuclear fusion power plant, state officials and private sector leaders announced Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), a fusion power company founded in 2018 in Cambridge, Mass., unveiled plans to build the groundbreaking facility on a 100-acre site at James River Industrial Park in Chesterfield County. The plant, expected to generate 400 megawatts of electricity — enough to power 150,000 homes — could be operational by the early 2030s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Commonwealth Fusion Systems plans on building the world’s first grid scale commercial fusion power plant in the world, full stop, and it’s going to be right here in the commonwealth of Virginia,” Gov. Glenn Youngkin said at a presentation of the undertaking at Richmond’s Patrick Henry Building.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike traditional nuclear power plants that rely on fission, fusion replicates the energy-producing process of the sun, offering a cleaner and more sustainable power source. The project, which would occupy about 25 acres of the site, signals Virginia’s growing role in shaping future energy solutions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The announcement comes as Virginia’s energy needs are surging, driven by the rapid growth of data centers that power big tech operations. These facilities consume enormous amounts of  electricity and water to process and cool computer systems.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A report from the nonpartisan Joint Legislative Audit Review Commission (JLARC) released last week found that energy demand from data centers could triple from about 10,000 megawatts today to about 30,000 megawatts by 2040 if infrastructure, like new transmission lines, were already available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s two largest utilities, Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power Company, are already exploring small modular nuclear reactors to meet rising  energy demands, with Dominion also investing in offshore wind, solar and natural gas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fusion power offers another path to clean energy, avoiding emissions that scientists link to  climate change and its increasingly intense and frequent storms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fusion technology works by combining hydrogen isotopes — deuterium extracted from water and tritium from lithium — under extreme heat and pressure, using powerful magnets to fuse the elements. The process generates heat, which boils water to create steam that spins a turbine, producing electricity. The byproduct is helium.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our customers’ growing needs for reliable, carbon-free power benefits from as diverse a menu of power generation options as possible, and in that spirit, we are delighted to assist CFS in their efforts,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">said Dominion Energy Virginia President Edward H. Baine, in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CFS selected the Chesterfield site after conducting a global search. The company will lease the land from Dominion Energy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To secure the project, Virginia offered $1 million from the Virginia Energy Clean Energy Innovation Bank, $1 million from Chesterfield County, and a sales and use tax exemption for the plant’s equipment. The company has also received U.S. Department of Energy funding. Youngkin said the project would bring “billions” in economic development and create “hundreds” of jobs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CFS is currently building its </span><a href="https://cfs.energy/technology/sparc" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SPARC demonstration plant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Massachusetts, a project that will pave the way for the ARC technology planned for Chesterfield. While the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California achieved a major milestone in 2022 by demonstrating fusion using lasers, CFS employs a different approach. Their technology relies on a donut-shaped device called a tokamak to confine and fuse molecules.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_41547" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2000px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/cfs-arc-powerplant-2000px/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-41547" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/CFS-ARC-powerplant-2000px.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/CFS-ARC-powerplant-2000px.jpg 2000w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/CFS-ARC-powerplant-2000px-300x169.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/CFS-ARC-powerplant-2000px-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/CFS-ARC-powerplant-2000px-768x432.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/CFS-ARC-powerplant-2000px-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A rendering of the ARC donut shaped tokamak technology. (Courtesy of Commonwealth Fusion Systems)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You won’t need a pipeline to bring the fuel in, or a smokestack for the exhaust,” said CFS co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Bob Mumgaard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike fission, which splits heavy atoms like uranium to produce energy — and leaves behind radioactive waste — fusion creates energy by fusing light atoms, explained Alex Creely, CFS director of tokamak operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the big advantages of fusion is that it doesn’t produce any long lived waste material, and there’s no risk of some kind of meltdown event,” Creely said. “It&#8217;s a very safe energy source — something that you can live right next to and feel very comfortable with.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, said in a statement Tuesday that he will introduce legislation to define fusion energy in state code. The energy source would be allowed as &#8220;zero-carbon electricity&#8221; under the Virginia Clean Economy Act, a 2020 law aimed at  decarbonizing the state’s electric grid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Since the VCEA’s passage, we have succeeded in driving energy innovation in the commonwealth, and today marks another important step in what has been a remarkably successful effort — a step that would not have been possible had Virginia declined or abandoned the opportunity and responsibility it took to lead in clean energy,” Sullivan said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin emphasized that the project will be financed entirely by CFS, with no cost passed on to Dominion Energy ratepayers. The facility will operate as an independent l power producer, selling its electricity to specific customers through power purchase agreements or directly into the regional PJM Interconnection market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a reasonable hypothesis that the growth in data centers in Virginia will very happily take the power that is generated at this plant,” Youngkin said.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_41546" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2000px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/cfs-arc-facility-front-2000px/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-41546" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/CFS-ARC-facility-front-2000px.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/CFS-ARC-facility-front-2000px.jpg 2000w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/CFS-ARC-facility-front-2000px-300x169.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/CFS-ARC-facility-front-2000px-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/CFS-ARC-facility-front-2000px-768x432.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/CFS-ARC-facility-front-2000px-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Another rendering of the Commonwealth Fusion Systems proposal for Chesterfield County. (Courtesy of Commonwealth Fusion Systems)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preston Bryant, senior vice president at McGuireWoods Consulting, which was involved in the site selection process, said Virginia was chosen in part because the Nuclear Regulatory Commission determined  months ago that fusion technology does not require a federal license like fission and can instead be approved at the state level.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project will still need several state permits, including a radioactive materials license from the Virginia Department of Health, and a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">certificate of convenience and public necessity from the State Corporation Commission. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kristen Cullen, vice president of global policy and public affairs at CFS, said additional approvals may include an air permit from the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality for backup generators during emergencies and potentially a storm water discharge permit, depending on the site-design.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bryant noted that it was “a coincidence” that the selected site was initially chosen by Dominion for a proposed natural gas plant before the utility relocated that project to the nearby, former coal-fired Chesterfield Power Station. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The announcement followed discussions with  local environmental groups, which expressed some support for the project, but also raised questions about its impact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Considering rising energy demand in Virginia driven by data centers and that most folks in the environmental world are not in support of more gas infrastructure, SMRs or hydrogen energy, this seems like a promising solution, if and when it actually comes online,” said Melissa Thomas, senior organizer with Mothers out Front, a climate advocacy group. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thomas also raised questions about whether the plant’s backup power would rely on gas-powered systems or electric alternatives.</span></p>

Solar power growth is expected to help some parts of the country meet electric demand this summer. (Robert Zullo/ States Newsroom)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New rules for building solar energy projects on prime Virginia farmland and forested areas are part of the ongoing  solar siting discussion in the state and are drawing ire from solar developers but support from the farmers and the forestry industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rules, known as House Bill 206 regulations, stem from </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB206#:~:text=The%20bill%20specifies%20that%20a,adverse%20impact%20on%20natural%20resources." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> passed in the 2022 session that established the legal determination that solar projects generating up to 150 megawatts would have an adverse impact and require mitigation if they were built on more than 10 acres of prime farmland, and 50 acres of contiguous forested land.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prime farmland is critical to the agricultural industry in Virginia because of its rich soils that help crop growth. Forests provide wildlife habitat, capture carbon from the air and soak up floodwaters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the Virginia Clean Economy Act, a 2020 law seeking to decarbonize the grid, mandates that Dominion Energy build about 16,100 megawatts of solar power and Appalachian Power Company build 600 megawatts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the general rule of thumb being that one megawatt of solar needs about seven acres, the potential development of solar has rural communities fuming over projects taking away their cherished landscapes and contributions to the agricultural and forestry industries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This bill was meant to try and strike that balance,”  Del. Michael Webert, R-Fauquier, said during a panel discussion at the Virginia Clean Energy Summit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past five years, about 2,400, or 3%, of the 97,000 acres of prime farmland lost annually has been taken up by solar, with other types of development making up the difference in losses, according to the Department of Environmental Quality. About 7,730 acres of forest has been lost over that period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed rules are the culmination of two stakeholder groups’ </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/12/20/state-work-group-on-solar-development-unable-to-reach-consensus/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">discussions </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">over the past two years. DEQ is reviewing the comments and is expected to finalize them early next year.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What the rules call for</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rules largely follow a 1:1 mitigation ratio for the two types of land, meaning that for every acre that is disturbed on-site, developers must take mitigation steps to conserve that amount on- site or off-site, including paying for easements that prevent development to protect the same type of land in nearby areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The amount of mitigation needed can change depending on certain steps taken during development. One example would be a developer not changing the grade or slope of the land, which can alter how much erosion occurs from water running off of the panels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitigation requirements can also be reduced by limiting soil compaction in order to help the land return to agricultural production at the end of a solar facilities’ typical 30-year lifecycle. Incorporating </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/18/dominion-energy-pairs-solar-with-honey-bees-to-preserve-agricultural-land/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">agrivoltaics </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and preserving riparian forest buffers can also prevent erosion along waterways and soak up pollutants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disturbance of C1 or C2 forest corridors, which are recognized as having enhanced wildlife and environmental benefits, do require increased mitigation measures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s very clear as to what has to be mitigated, but it says nothing about how to mitigate those impacts, so we looked at the different tools,” said Jonathan Rak, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">chief policy advisor at DEQ.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Conflicting comments</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solar developers see the rules as being costly, while agricultural community members support the requirements to preserve land for Virginia&#8217;s top economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The regulations “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">overlook solar&#8217;s substantial economic contributions, including thousands of jobs, millions in tax revenues, land-lease payments, and significant capital investment in Virginia,” wrote Marshall Conrad, with the North Carolina-based solar developer Strata Clean Energy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental groups, including the Southern Environmental Law Center, the Chesapeake Climate Action Network, the Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Council, submitted comments voicing similar concerns, saying the easement costs “could easily exceed $2 million at larger facilities,” and could push developers to a lengthier approval process at the State Corporation Commission. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But other environmental groups, like the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and Virginia Association of Soil and Water Conservation Districts, supported or wanted to strengthen the rules because of the potential harm solar development poses to Chesapeake Bay cleanup goals, which includes planting trees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Utility scale solar projects are therefore impairing Virginia’s ability to meet its environmental obligations to the Chesapeake Bay region,” Scott Cameron, second vice president of the Virginia Soil and Water Conservation District, wrote in comments sent to the board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the agricultural front, the Virginia Cattlemen&#8217;s Association pointed to the concern that about 500,000 acres of all types of Virginia farmland have been lost over the past five years as reason to support the rules to keep farmland in production. And the Virginia Forestry Products Association voiced similar worries over the loss of trees, but noted a potential unintended consequence of 500 acres of forestland being lost to solar development, and another 500 acres of land going under an easement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The potential net effect of this type of mitigation is instead of sawmills losing 500 acres for future harvest, we have lost 1,000 acres if truly commercial timber harvesting is in any way discouraged under these easements,” wrote the Virginia Forestry Products Association.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Disturbed lands</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To avoid using farmland or forested areas, many have suggested developing solar projects on previously mined land that’s already been disturbed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Virginia Energy, there are 125,000 acres of that land available, though some if it is remote with limited distribution lines, has rocky terrain that could be challenging to build on and could be used for economic development projects aimed at revitalizing the area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think there&#8217;s a balance there of looking at what locations are better suited for some types of development,” said Daniel Kestner, economic development program manager at Virginia Energy.</span></p>

Wes Moore leads Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin and officials of Chesapeake Bay watershed jurisdictions, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Chesapeake Bay Commission from the Maryland State House to the annual public meeting of the Chesapeake Executive Council on Dec. 10, 2024. (Will Parson/Chesapeake Bay Program)</p><p>Top officials from all the Chesapeake Bay states and the federal government gathered in Annapolis Tuesday to reiterate their commitment to cleaning up the historically and economically critical estuary and strengthening the decade-long partnership that has helped improved the Bay’s health — even if that progress hasn’t been as swift and consistent as they might have hoped.</p>
<p>Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D), seated next to Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R), with Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D) participating by video, convened the annual meeting of the Chesapeake Bay Executive Council, which consists of leaders of the six states in the Bay watershed, along with the District of Columbia, to retool their 10-year-old cooperative agreement at a critical juncture in the Bay cleanup.</p>
<p>The meeting comes just weeks before the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, who unsuccessfully tried to eliminate funding for Bay programs during his first term, adding an element of uncertainty for the Chesapeake’s state-based environmental stewards. But officials from red and blue states described their allegiance to the Bay cleanup as durable and unshakable Tuesday.</p>
<p>Moore called the Bay “the greatest heirloom clearly we have,” saying, “We did not create it. We inherited it. So it’s up to us to protect it.”</p>
<p>He also outlined legislation that he plans to introduce during the 2025 General Assembly session to strengthen Bay health, which he is tentatively calling the Bay Legacy Act.</p>
<p>The original multistate partnership, fashioned by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2014 during the Obama administration, laid out 31 goals for the Bay states and D.C. to meet by 2025. While some states have fallen short of hitting some of the marks, federal and state officials describe the program — and particularly the sense of partnership it has engendered — as an overwhelming success.</p>

<p>The state and federal leaders did vote Tuesday to <a href="https://d18lev1ok5leia.cloudfront.net/chesapeakebay/documents/FINAL-Beyond-2025-Steering-Committee-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revise the watershed agreement</a>, taking several recommendations from a steering committee of numerous stakeholders that has been meeting for more than two years. Some of the proposed changes seek to streamline the way data is collected and analyzed, and also try to heighten accountability in Bay cleanup efforts.</p>
<p>One proposal would place more emphasis on habitat rehabilitation throughout the Bay watershed, while another would spotlight climate impacts in the government’s ongoing scientific inquiry.</p>
<p>The Chesapeake Bay Program is also going to create an Agricultural Advisory Committee, to elevate the priorities of a sector that’s critical to Bay health — and a huge economic driver in the region — before the executive council.</p>
<p>“This allows farmers to make improvements while preserving the viability of their businesses,” Youngkin said.</p>
<p>The agriculture committee will complement the work of the <a href="https://www.chesapeakebay.net/who/group/lgac" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Local Government Advisory Committee</a>, <a href="https://www.chesapeakebay.net/who/group/stac" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scientific and Technical Advisory Committee</a> and <a href="https://www.chesapeakebay.net/who/group/citizens-advisory-committee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stakeholders Advisory Committee</a>.</p>
<p>Every speaker during the public meeting Tuesday — including environmental agency officials from D.C., Delaware, West Virginia and New York, and two high-ranking EPA officials — emphasized the importance of the ongoing partnership between the states and the federal government.</p>
<p>“The Chesapeake Bay has always been our region’s greatest unifier, and we just saw that bipartisan support for the Bay is alive and well,” said Hilary Harp Falk, president and CEO of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation. “It’s a really big deal when three governors and leaders from around the region meet to stack hands and reaffirm commitments to clean water. This kind of local and state leadership is more critical than ever.”</p>
<p>Such cooperation hasn’t always been the case. In 2020, Maryland, Virginia and D.C. <a href="https://marylandmatters.org/2020/09/10/maryland-virginia-d-c-sue-epa-over-failure-to-enforce-chesapeake-bay-cleanup-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">filed a federal lawsuit</a>against the Trump administration’s EPA, accusing the agency of violating the Clean Water Act by failing to enforce Chesapeake Bay pollution reduction limits for Pennsylvania and New York.</p>
<p>During his speech Tuesday — he was supposed to attend the meeting in person, but was sidelined by the heavy fog that blanketed the Mid-Atlantic — Shapiro acknowledged that his state had been lagging on its commitment to Bay cleanup goals until recent years.</p>
<figure id="attachment_85317" class="wp-caption alignright"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"> </figcaption></figure>
<p>“It is important for me to participate in this conversation, because for a long time, Pennsylvania was on the sidelines and now we’re in the game,” he said.</p>
<p>And in another sign of interstate collegiality, Youngkin nominated Moore to serve another year as chair of the executive council.</p>
<p>Asked after the meeting about the potential impact of the incoming Trump administration on Bay cleanup efforts, Moore reiterated the states’ commitment to working together.</p>
<p>“We all collectively understand the importance of this work,” he said, adding, “We look forward to working with the new administration to ensure that our goals are met.”</p>
<h4 class="editorialSubhed">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Moore’s Bay Legacy Act</h4>

	</h4>
<p>Moore, from the dais of Tuesday’s meeting, offered broad details of the legislation he’s planning to introduce in the upcoming legislative session on Bay health. Those plans were fleshed out slightly by administration officials in interviews Tuesday. They said the bill, tentatively called the Bay Legacy Act, would:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seek to increase regenerative farming practices in the state, particularly on land owned by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR), in part by offering long-term leases to farmers to encourage them to regenerate the soil;</li>
<li>Improve aquaculture permitting in the state; and</li>
<li>Strengthen water-quality monitoring programs within DNR, largely by establishing new protocols that would make it easier for the agency to work with other entities and “citizen scientists” who conduct water quality tests of their own.</li>
</ul>
<p>Administration officials said more details on the proposed legislation could be released in a matter of days.</p>
<p>“We are going to continue to move forward and move fast in this state,” Moore said, “because that is what the people of Maryland demand and require.”</p>

				<span style="font-weight: 400;">At the meeting, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin reiterated his </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/09/virginia-regional-governors-to-discuss-chesapeake-bay-cleanup-goals/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executive directive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that expressed a desire to “work with farmers, not against them,” by maintaining the voluntary adoption of pollution-reducing agricultural best management practices through a cost-share program, which added 574 new farmers last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We need to accomplish our water quality goals through these voluntary approaches that allow our farmers to make conservation improvements while maintaining the viability of their businesses,” Youngkin said on Tuesday, later adding that “partnership compounds effectiveness.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the meeting, Virginia Secretary of Natural and Historic Resources Travis Voyles acknowledged in a statement to the Mercury that technical assistance, which is the engineering component needed to get pollution reducing agricultural best management practices installed properly and counted toward cleanup goals, is important.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Coupling technical assistance with fully funding the agricultural cost-share program is a critical component of providing farmers the tools needed to successfully implement best management practices,” Voyles said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The directive from Youngkin also called for re-evaluating how the state’s taxpayer dollars are used, “including stormwater,” Voyles noted. One form of funding for stormwater cleanup projects is the Stormwater Local Assistance Fund, or SLAF, which was created in 2013 and has awarded matching grants to local governments for 357 projects totalling $212 million after approvals made earlier this </span><a href="https://www.deq.virginia.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/22326/638415063756400000" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, the directive called for the creation of a Statewide Wetlands Technical Team, led by the Department of Wildlife Resource.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wetlands can soak up pollution before it enters waterways, but have been diminished  due to development and sea level rise from climate change. Given that the watershed hasn’t been able to keep up with preserving wetlands, Virginia director of the Chesapeake Bay Commission Adrienne Kotulasaid the wetlands team will “certainly help the experts creating on-the-ground projects better align efforts, and result in increased efficiencies in their work.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calling the loss of wetlands her top concern for reaching cleanup goals, Kotula pointed to the $8 million in funding the Department of Wildlife Resources recently received from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to enhance the Ragged Island Wildlife Management Area along the </span><a href="https://dwr.virginia.gov/media/press-release/dwr-receives-grant-to-enhance-and-restore-critical-marsh-habitat-at-ragged-island-wildlife-management-area/?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR0fQafdwSn9XzPd4wsL6aUH2kbehWdu1IeLwauR5EzPDlNpIH1jYqHNETs_aem_5IbrEuAHr-hNymAhhK-nCQ" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">James River</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as an example the wetlands team can focus on That project can be coordinated “together,” Kotula said, with the about </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/01/federal-government-awards-150-million-to-reduce-emissions-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$50 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the agency received as part of a larger appropriation from the Environmental Protection Agency to conserve wetlands. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The question of how Virginia will address wetlands loss at the policy level remains unanswered and is critical for the Commonwealth to address,” Kotula said, roughly four weeks before the General Assembly session starts Jan. 8. — Charlie Paullin, Virginia Mercury reporter</span>			</div>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission released its long awaited <a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt598-2.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> on data centers Monday, detailing the expected soaring energy demands and large economic benefits of the industry ahead of the 2025 General Assembly session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Residents and activists have been clamoring throughout the past year over  projections that energy demands could triple by 2040, which JLARC said could lead to a $37 monthly bill increase for Dominion Energy Virginia customers. But at the same time, the industry provides about $9.1 billion in annual activity to the economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the report, Northern Virginia is the largest data center market in the world, ahead of Beijing and London.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report also presents three suggestions for the tax exemptions the state currently offers data centers. The exemptions could be “extended to maintain data growth and economic benefits, allowed to expire to slow growth and reduce energy impacts, or modified to balance those priorities,” explained Mark Gribbin, JLARC’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">chief legislative analyst.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the release of the report, Youngkin, in a statement to the Mercury, signaled a desire to strengthen the industry’s presence in the state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s get serious, embrace common sense, growth, and opportunity, and keep Virginia winning,” Youngkin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report’s modeling to meet increasing energy needs includes the use of new natural gas plants, which release climate changing emissions and harmful pollutants to the surrounding community, to provide reliable power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia has a simple choice: embrace all of the above and deliver affordable, reliable, and, yes, increasingly clean baseload power to support future economic growth, while taking advantage of the billions of dollars in capital investment, high-paying jobs, and local and state tax revenues that come from data centers,” Youngkin said. “Or bend the knee to a green energy agenda and give away Virginia’s leadership position.” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Energy </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report is in line with a recent regulatory filing from Dominion Energy stating annual increases in electric power demand would be relatively flat, if it weren’t for data centers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modelling from E3, a third-party consultant, showed that energy demand for the state would increase from just over 10,000 gigawatt hours in 2023 to just over 30,000 gigawatt hours by 2040, if data center development didn’t have to deal with constraints, including needing energy requirements like transmission lines to be available prior to coming online. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without data center development, the demand increased to about 12,500 gigawatt hours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To meet those demands, more renewable energy facilities like solar and offshore will be needed, but so will natural gas, JLARC’s report stated, which would amount to a new plant being built every one and a half years, approximately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Either meeting the full unconstrained demand, or half of it, relies on offshore wind and nuclear technology, which JLARC stated could come from the “unproven” small modular reactor technology. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_41100" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1011px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/jlarc-chart/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-41100" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/JLARC-chart.jpg" alt="" width="1011" height="943" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/JLARC-chart.jpg 1011w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/JLARC-chart-300x280.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/JLARC-chart-768x716.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1011px) 100vw, 1011px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A chart from the Joint Legislative Audit Review Commission showing different ways to meet energy demands under the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA) or without it. (Courtesy of JLARC)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The percentage of costs for those upgrades that could be borne by the data center industry will be the subject of an upcoming technical conference on Dec. 16 hosted by the State Corporation Commission, which regulates Virginia’s utilities, Gribbin noted.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Water use and air pollution </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of the high demand for energy for data centers is the operation of the processors, but also the cooling systems, which also draw on water, depending on the technology it uses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gribbin said there are sufficient environmental protections in place for the facilities to use the same amount of water as a large office building, or about 6.7 million gallons per year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The fact of the matter is, it is still using a lot,” countered Sen. Danica Roem, D-Prince William, in an interview.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_37153" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/06/virginia-local-governments-will-now-have-to-plan-for-water-supply-regionally/sept-rapp-pic-morning/" rel="attachment wp-att-37153"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-37153" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sept-rapp-pic-morning-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1920" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sept-rapp-pic-morning-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sept-rapp-pic-morning-300x225.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sept-rapp-pic-morning-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sept-rapp-pic-morning-768x576.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sept-rapp-pic-morning-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sept-rapp-pic-morning-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  The Rapidan River experiencing drought conditions in early September of 2023 (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She added she’d like to provide more information to localities on water demands instead of hiding behind the shroud of “proprietary” information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Transparency has always been seen by the Virginia General Assembly, over the 400 years of the legislature’s existence, as an administrative burden as opposed to a requirement of government,” Roem said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report noted that data centers use fossil-fuel burning generators as back-up power sources, but “are a relatively small contributor to regional air pollution — in Northern Virginia, they make up less than 4 percent of regional emissions of nitrogen oxides and 0.1 percent or less of carbon monoxide and particulate matter emissions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2023, the diesel generators needed for backup power emitted only 7% of what they were allowed, which largely came from maintenance testing.  </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Economic</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s data center exemption totaled about $928.6 million in savings in 2023, and went primarily to the big four tech companies, Amazon Web Services, Google, Meta and Microsoft, according to JLARC. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state is competing with other “primary markets” for data centers that offer tax exemptions. Those markets include facilities that amount to about 1,600 megawatts in Hillsboro, Oregon, 1,560 in Phoenix, Arizona, 1,170 megawatts in Columbus, Ohio and 1,070 mw in Atlanta, Georgia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 74,000 jobs a year stem from the industry; about1,500 are created during construction, in the form of concrete pourers and electricians. Once in operation, data centers employ about 50 people on site with roles including site managers, IT professionals and security personnel.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Localities around the state have benefited from the business personal property and real estate taxes. But the variations of tax incentives to lure in data centers can offset how much revenue is given to jurisdictions, and economically distressed areas with less flat land and accessibility to transmission lines may have difficulty competing, Gribbin said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While noting the energy costs concerns, Republican Del. Ian Lovejoy, R-Prince William suggested legislative action on data centers is inevitable in January.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think it’s impossible to see nothing happen,” Lovejoy said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think pragmatically you want to have pro-economic policies and certainly there’s tax revenue here,” he added.</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury).</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After decades of work to clean up the polluted Chesapeake Bay, the federal, state and local partners within the 64,000-mile watershed have acknowledged they won’t reach their 2025 goals. But neither are they giving up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Representatives of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement, the regional partnership of states within the watershed, will gather Tuesday in Annapolis to discuss how to achieve not only those goals but new ones.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, the discussion already has included pollution reduction measures farmers can adopt, and funding for them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The good news is that we’re entering this meeting with the partnership stronger than ever,” said Adam Ortiz, the Environmental Protection Agency&#8217;s administrator in the mid-Atlantic, who noted this will be the first meeting since 2014 with the governors from Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania in attendance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The presence of all three is an indication of the importance of the Chesapeake Bay to their states’ ecosystems — it is home to over 300 types of fish, birds, insects and plants — and economy. The Bay’s seafood industry alone is worth $3 billion a year to Virginia and Maryland, according to the </span><a href="https://www.naturalresources.virginia.gov/initiatives/chesapeake-bay/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Secretary of Natural and Historic Resources</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acknowledging the shortcomings of the work so far, the Chesapeake Bay Program Beyond 2025 Steering Committee earlier this year </span><a href="https://www.chesapeakebay.net/who/group/beyond-2025-steering-committee" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recommended</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recommitting to the partnership and streamlining processes. It also advocated for local involvement and new approaches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, Gov. Glenn Youngkin issued a four-page Executive Directive, stressing that, “Virginia is committed to being a part of the Partnership and continuing our efforts to protect the bay.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But he also wrote, “it is evident that a clearer path forward is needed.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Behind on the Bay </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After starting the partnership in 1983 with a one page document, the partnership&#8217;s work has become a complex system with the states making commitments to reach certain </span><a href="https://www.chesapeakeprogress.com/outcome-status" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">outcomes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, such as oyster abundance and water quality standards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has met 100% of its sediment reduction targets, but only reached 80% of the reduction for nitrogen and 62% of the reduction for phosphorus. The concern is that those nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients feed harmful algal blooms and oxygen-deprived “dead zones,” that culminate with less than desired water quality standards. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October, </span><a href="https://www.chesapeakebay.net/news/pressrelease/chesapeake-bay-sees-slight-improvement-in-water-quality" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">29.8%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the Bay and the tidal tributaries feeding into it were found to have met water quality standards, “below the 100% attainment necessary to support a healthy Bay ecosystem.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Chesapeake Bay restoration is at a crossroads,” said Chesapeake Bay Foundation Virginia Director Chris Moore in a recent statement lauding Youngkin’s commitment to the partnership. “Virginia’s upcoming legislative session is a prime opportunity for the Commonwealth to continue our important investments in cleaner waterways and iconic living resources.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The causes</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Work on the bay the past 40 years have focused on pollution reductions from the stormwater and wastewater sectors, and the agricultural community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a December 2023 meeting with the Virginia State Water Commission, Mike Rolband, the director of the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, reported that upgrades to </span><a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/26062024/chesapeake-bay-program-flunked-2025-cleanup-goals/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stormwater</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> treatment plants, which are behind on the goals, and </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/chesapeake-bay-tmdl/wastewater-out-front-bay-restoration" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wastewater</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> treatment plants, which are ahead of the goals, had led to a reduction of 8.2 million pounds of nitrogen and 708 pounds of phosphorus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But farmers, while making </span><a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2024/RD376/PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">progress</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year, have only installed about 6,095 acres of forested buffers, or 28% of what&#8217;s needed for targets set for 2027. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_41080" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:838px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=41080" rel="attachment wp-att-41080"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-41080" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Ag-practices.jpg" alt="" width="838" height="337" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Ag-practices.jpg 838w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Ag-practices-300x121.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Ag-practices-768x309.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 838px) 100vw, 838px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A chart of agricultural practices installed in Virginia. (Courtesy of Department of Conservation and Recreation).</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Martha Moore, vice president of governmental relations with the Virginia Farm Bureau, said the slow adoption rates were due to insufficient funding from the state’s cost-share program</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They got really frustrated,” said Moore of farmers who were told, “we just don’t have the money.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Farmers also were upset that they were not part of the conversation. This year that changes with the creation of a farmers advisory </span><a href="https://www.bayjournal.com/ag-and-the-bay/ag-bay-storylist/ag-to-get-greater-voice-in-chesapeake-bay-cleanup-effort/article_c9a892c2-b0b4-11ef-99da-5bf2c9855093.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">committee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We know that we can’t see an acceleration of and completion of the restoration effort without the success of farmers,” Ortiz said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his directive, Youngkin acknowledges a need to verify best management practices that may be happening but not being counted, which happens because they haven’t been reevaluated in years. Moore said a survey with the Virginia Cooperative Extension will help capture those numbers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Really what we want to see is the continuation and building upon where we’re seeing those successes,” said Travis Voyles, secretary of Natural and Historic Resources, in an interview. “Avoiding the hammer, but really embracing those incentive based approaches, in a voluntary manner, that are being effective.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The funding</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s directive also calls for an evaluation of water quality improvement funds, which provide the funding for the stormwater and wastewater plant upgrades. Excess revenues for the fund are to be directed to the best management practice cost-share program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview Friday, Chris Pomeroy, an attorney with the Virginia Association of Municipal Wastewater Agencies, said funding for the wastewater sector must continue in order to maintain the reductions that have been made, calling it “the single most important thing Virginia can do.”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pomeroy said about $600 million had been appropriated so far and about $800 million is needed to complete projects underway.</span></p>

David Bulova, D-Fairfax, speaks during a Joint Senate Agriculture Conservation and Natural Resources Committee and House Agriculture Chesapeake and Natural Resources Committee retreat in September. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the agricultural program fully funded now, Moore said, “I’m just very proud of the fact that we finally have achieved that goal. Now, I think we just have to figure out, how do we get to the end?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One potential way, according to the Virginia Soil and Water Conservation Board that oversees the conservation districts around the state that administer the cost-share program, is more staffing to get the money out the door. A point the board made in a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Letter-to-Senator-Marsden-and-Delegate-Bulova-1.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Sen. Dave Marsden, D-Fairfax, and Del. Alfonso Lopez, D-Arlington, the chairs of Virginia’s natural resource and agricultural committees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The team is now deploying more resources than at any point in their history, while pay compression and uncompetitive salaries strain the Department’s ability to retain key staff,” wrote board chair Charles Newton. “The Virginia Soil and Water Conservation Board is concerned that without new investment into </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Department’s team, the agency will face more staff loss and be unable to keep pace with the growing demands for their services.”</span></p>

(Ellison Orcutt/ Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The little bumblebee, considered a keystone species because of how it benefits the environment through pollination, could be getting some buzzworthy survival assistance along the Virginia and West Virginia state border.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Nov. 25, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service </span><a href="https://www.fws.gov/press-release/2024-11/seeking-public-comment-proposed-critical-habitat-rusty-patched-bumble-bee" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposed </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">designating about 1.6 million acres of land across the country as a critical habitat for the rusty patched bumblebee. The area </span><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/11/26/2024-27316/endangered-and-threatened-wildlife-and-plants-designation-of-critical-habitat-for-the-rusty-patched" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">includes </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">118,603 acres in Bath and Highland counties in Virginia, and Greenbrier and Pocahontas Counties in West Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rich Hatfield, a senior conservation biologist in the endangered species program at the Xerces Society, said he’s “glad the service is using this tool,” though he has some questions over the effectiveness of the designation in urban areas in mid-western parts of the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Virginia these are the most isolated population of the rusty patched bumblebee that we know about,” Hatfield said. “Their contribution to the resilience (of the species) I don’t think can be overstated. Those populations are critically important.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How we got here</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rusty patched bumblebee is the little black and yellow critter with a brown spot on its second abdominal segment, giving it its name, though the Queen bees are entirely yellow. The bees pollinate several plant species.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bee was common throughout midwestern and northeastern parts of the U.S., and Canada, but since the 1990s it has </span><a href="https://www.nrdc.org/bio/lucas-rhoads/another-court-victory-rusty-patched-bumble-bee" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lost</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about 90% of its range, or area in which it is found. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">evidence suggests the causes of the decline to be sickness and exposure to some pesticides, as well as habitat loss, small population changes and the effects of climate change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, the agency added the bee to the Endangered Species Act, which requires federal agencies to determine if any permitted activity would adversely impact the species. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bee disrupted the building of the since-</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2020/09/08/virginias-vanishing-bee-state-works-to-save-rusty-patched-bumblebee/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">canceled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Atlantic Coast Pipeline. Judges in the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals yanked the permits for the project after determining the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service had erred in saying it wouldn’t have a detrimental impact on the species’ survival.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, the Natural Resources Defense said the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service had erred again by failing to designate a critical habitat for the bee and saying such wouldn’t benefit the species. After settlements, the federal agency agreed to make a critical habitat designation by Nov. 20 of this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This decision represents a vital step forward for one of America’s most endangered pollinators,” said Lucas Rhoads, senior attorney for pollinators and pesticides at the Natural Resources Defense Council</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We cannot afford further delays in protecting high-quality habitat that can save the bee from extinction. We look forward to this proposal being finalized as soon as possible.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The Virginia lands</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the proposal, the bee’s protected habitat in West Virginia and Virginia consists of 11,200 acres of  private lands, 1,845 acres of Virginia-owned lands, and 105,558 acres of federal lands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federally conserved lands include the Monongahela and George Washington and Jefferson National Forests. The entire 1.6 million acres overlap with habitats for other already-endangered species, USFWS said, meaning “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">little additional conservation effort is usually needed beyond what is already in place.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellison Orcutt, the lead field zoologist for the Virginia Natural Heritage Program at the Department of Conservation and Recreation, said the proposed area in north Bath County is a known High Potential Zone, or HPZ. There, the cooler climate and lack of development from the  federally protected forested land will likely make a favorable habitat for the bees, Orcutt said. </span></p>

(Courtesy of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DCR’s Natural Heritage Program has been working to conserve the species after its first identification in the state since the 1990s came in 2014, along with several other insects and plants, Orcutt explained. That work includes the Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources creating a Wildlife Management Area in neighboring Highland County, which now hosts native wildflowers the bees favor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal notes that the Appalachian region is home to a genetically diverse variation of the bee.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though, without baseline genetic data, “it&#8217;s unclear if this distinct genetic group existed before (the bee’s) decline or if it&#8217;s emerged since 1990 or so after the decline,” said Lori Ann Burd, environmental health director with the Center for Biological Diversity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The diversity could be the result of gradual shifts in genetics from the east to the west, and the nearby bees in Indiana and Ohio are now gone, making the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Virginia bees “more easily distinct,” Burd said. At the same time, the Virginia region could also be isolated from stressors, including competition with honey bees, allowing the rusty patched bumblebees to persist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This distinct genetic population is very critical to the future of the species,” Burd also said.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “A lack of genetic diversity in the species likely made the species as a whole more susceptible to disease and other stressors. The remaining populations have persisted through the major decline in the species so they may be better able to survive into the future.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maintaining and spreading that critical diversity is why Hatfield said it&#8217;s important to expand protections to additional areas outside of those that have 50 or more known bee sightings. That would create corridors for the bees to migrate in and protect bees that may live in areas but aren’t documented.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If we want the species to be able to repopulate its former range outside of areas protected as critical habitat, there needs to be corridors connecting currently unpopulated healthy habitat across the entire range,&#8221; Hatfield said.</p>

(Courtesy of Virginia Department of Transportation).</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Transportation estimates that it will take about three to six months to collect debris from Hurricane Helene, the storm that took the lives of three Virginians and damaged swaths of Appalachia in the southwest region of the state, leaving behind over $4 billion in damages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The debris removal timeline is expected to be presented to the Virginia Commonwealth Transportation Board at its </span><a href="https://ctb.virginia.gov/media/ctb/agendas-and-meeting-minutes/2024/dec/CTB_Workshop_Meeting_Dec_2024.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">meeting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Wednesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a methodical, route-by-route process to pick up debris, make areas safe from leaning trees/limbs, and remove mud/rock/soil resulting from slides,” said Jessica Cowardin, spokesperson for VDOT.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helene made landfall in Florida on Sept. 26 before it hit Southwest Virginia Sept. 27, causing the New River to rise to 31 feet in some areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hundreds of thousands lost power, and businesses large and small suffered damage, prompting Gov. Glenn Youngkin to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/18/virginia-localities-affected-by-hurricane-helene-now-eligible-for-special-snap-benefits/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">submit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the White House and Congress last month a total estimate of $4.4 billion in damages in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christian Martinez, press secretary for Youngkin, said the state is collaborating with federal, state, and local partners to advocate for “Virginia to receive targeted, accelerated federal support from agencies … to expedite recovery and provide the necessary assistance.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VDOT is expecting to receive all federal reimbursement for their efforts over a period of three years, including Federal Emergency Management public assistance and Federal Highway Administration emergency relief assistance for up to 100% of the costs to respond to the storm and rebuild roadways. Some of that funding, as well as individual assistance funding, has </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/14/youngkin-urges-hurricane-helene-survivors-to-contact-officials-shares-storm-recovery-update/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">begun</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be dispersed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The storm caused an estimated 511,000 cubic yards of debris to be strewn over the region.  VDOT has picked up about 110,000 cubic yards and contractors cleaned up 6,000 cubic yards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The estimate was developed based on historical information from previous storms,” Cowardin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state has a Debris Task Force, which includes FEMA, the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers, the Virginia Department of Emergency Management and several other federal and state agencies. Debris cleanup also consists of removing an estimated 135 acres of debris on the surface of </span><a href="https://www.nao.usace.army.mil/Media/News-Stories/Article/3948201/debris-removal-effort-ramps-up-at-claytor-lake-with-additional-resources/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claytor Lake.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The effort includes survey vessels, modular pontoon barges, hydraulic excavators and a 300-ton crane.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier in October, FEMA </span><a href="https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20241016/federal-agencies-working-together-multimillion-dollar-mission-remove-debris" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">a “multi-million” commitment with the Army Corps and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for debris removal from both Claytor Lake and the South Holston Lake Area over the span of about four months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Debris removal on the water is inherently more complex,” said Col. Sonny Avichal, commander of USACE’s Norfolk District, in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VDOT will also share on Wednesday an estimated timeline of about 12 months to rebuild damaged roads and structures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of roadways and structures including bridges that needed repair peaked after the storm peaked at 414 and 99 in the immediate aftermath of Helene, respectively. Since then, seven roadways and and four structures remain to be repaired. Damaged roadways include Routes 58 and 1212 in Damascus, and the Route 725 bridge in Taylor’s Valley was also impaired.</span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin and Democratic leaders in the General Assembly are aligned on one thing, it’s their enthusiasm for bringing more data centers to the commonwealth. Where they part ways is in how to provide enough electricity to power them. Youngkin and most Republican legislators advocate for an “all of the above” approach that includes fossil gas as well as renewables; Democrats are committed to staying the course on the transition to zero-carbon energy, with a near-term emphasis on low-cost solar. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data centers are making the transition harder, but so is local resistance to building solar. General Assembly members mostly understand the connection, leading to a lively debate in last year’s legislative session over whether to override some local permit denials for solar projects – and if so, how to ensure the localities still have some say. Though none of the legislative proposals moved forward last year, the topic has become a central one for the recently revamped Commission on Electric Utility Regulation (CEUR). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In January, the General Assembly is likely to consider legislation to override local solar permit denials in some cases, such as last year’s </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/HB636" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB636</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, or another approach that would break the solar logjam. It remains to be seen, however,  whether legislators will take any action on data centers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem has grown only more urgent as localities have continued to approve new data center proposals with little thought given to where and how they will get the power to serve them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ann Bennett, Sierra Club Virginia’s data center chair, has been tracking data center permit applications across the state. She counts at least two dozen Virginia counties with data centers under development, including rural areas far outside the industry’s stronghold in suburban Northern Virginia. By Bennett’s calculation, data centers existing and under development in Virginia will consume at least 100,000 acres. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even as local governments woo data centers, many have become hostile to solar development. A </span><a href="https://apps.dlas.virginia.gov/User_db/frmView.aspx?ViewId=6339&amp;s=7" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">presentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Weldon Cooper Center at the University of Virginia, which tracks solar permitting across Virginia, shows that far more local permits for solar facilities have been denied or withdrawn than were approved this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some cases, county boards that approve data center development also reject permits for solar farms. Sometimes, it happens even at the same meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an effort to understand this paradox, I watched footage from two county board meetings in Hanover County, one in March of this year and the other in September. At the March meeting, county supervisors </span><a href="https://www.hanovercounty.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=770" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">approved</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a 1,200-acre data center complex for an area north of Ashland. Later the same night, they denied a permit for a utility-scale solar project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The parcels of land slated to be developed for the data center complex “included wooded areas, recently-logged areas, open fields, wetlands, ponds and stream corridors.” The developer plans to build about 30 data centers on the property, each 110 feet tall (about 10 stories), with setbacks from the property line ranging from 150 to 250 feet. The complex will require 700,000 gallons per day of cooling water. When fully developed, the data centers are expected to total a staggering 2,400 megawatts (MW) of power capacity, not far short of what </span><a href="https://dgtlinfra.com/data-centers-virginia-ashburn-loudoun/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">all of Loudoun County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had in 2022. There was no discussion of where so much electricity would come from. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public testimony was overwhelmingly negative. The objections echoed those that have been widely reported in </span><a href="https://www.insidenova.com/headlines/digital-gateway-data-center-opposition-escalates-in-prince-william-county/article_61124a3a-e506-11ed-8485-a77c6d7e7ff1.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">response</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to projects such as the Prince William Digital Gateway: noise, light, a massive increase in truck traffic, secrecy surrounding the project, air pollution from diesel back-up generators. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet the Hanover supervisors voted unanimously in favor of the project. It came down to money: the developer promised a tax benefit to the county over 20 years of $1.8 billion, plus upfront cash for road improvements and a $100,000 donation to a park. Supervisor Jeff Stoneman, who represents the Beaverdam district where the complex will be located, acknowledged his constituents’ concerns but noted that the revenue would be a “game-changer for this community.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even for me, as thoroughly aware as I am of all the downsides of data center sprawl, the negative impacts on communities, the risks to our water and energy security, the possibility that folks will be left with nothing but regrets – well, I just have to say: It’s really hard to argue with $1.8 billion. Rural leaders see Loudoun County </span><a href="https://www.loudounnow.com/news/business-leaders-tout-data-center-benefits-at-chamber-forum/article_f5148f4e-491f-11ef-acc5-a36d8b4e0299.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raking in revenue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from data centers, letting it cut taxes for everyone else. Why wouldn’t they want in on that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I noted before, though, there was no discussion of how or where the enormous amount of electricity needed to power the data centers would be generated. This disconnect was underscored later in the same meeting when the supervisors voted to reject a 20 MW solar project on 100 acres of a 315-acre site, in the same district as the data center complex they had just approved. </span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="yIZWD5yzmk"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/26/under-pressure-from-the-scc-dominion-reveals-the-true-cost-of-data-centers/">Under pressure from the SCC, Dominion reveals the true cost of data centers</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Under pressure from the SCC, Dominion reveals the true cost of data centers&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/26/under-pressure-from-the-scc-dominion-reveals-the-true-cost-of-data-centers/embed/#?secret=s1eoTaSPZM#?secret=yIZWD5yzmk" data-secret="yIZWD5yzmk" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was especially hard to understand the denial of this particular permit. Supervisors agreed the project met all the terms of the county’s solar ordinance, including provisions for the use of native grasses and pollinator plants. Most of the property would remain untouched. The county would receive an upfront cash contribution of $438,600, in addition to the increased tax revenue from the project. The planning commission had recommended approval. No one testified against it; a number of people, including the farmer across the street, testified in its favor.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the discussion of the project focused on screening the solar panels from view. Supervisors fussed that the trees to be planted at the entrance were too small, and worried that some of the existing mature trees along the road might die off over time and not be replaced. The developer agreed to put larger trees at the entrance, and even to walk the perimeter annually to monitor the health of the trees, and replace any if they needed to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was no use. Two of the supervisors wanted to approve the project, but they were outvoted. Stoneman, the Beaverdam supervisor who had led the way in supporting the data center complex, said he worried that erosion might impair the creek on the property, in spite of ample natural buffers, and said he did not have a “comfort level” with the project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evidently, the county’s </span><a href="https://www.hanovercounty.gov/DocumentCenter/View/10092/Ord-23-14-Solar-Energy-Facilities" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">solar ordinance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, adopted in 2023, was irrelevant, or at least, misleading. Such objective standards make a developer think it will be worth their while to put in months of planning, public outreach, and working with county staff. But then it turns out that what actually matters is whether a supervisor can achieve a certain undefined “comfort level.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Six months after the approval of the 2,400 MW data center complex and the denial of the 20 MW solar facility, another solar project </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2024-09-26/hanover-county-beaverdam-solar-farm-strata-clean-energy-jeff-stoneman" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">met the same fate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, again with Stoneman making the motion to deny the permit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time the project would take up 250 acres of a 1,500-acre site and produce 72 MW of electricity, achieved through stacking the panels to a double height. Again, the project more than met the requirements of the county solar ordinance. The land was described as currently consisting of managed pine forest, already subject to being cut over at any time, and fully 70% of the property would be preserved for conservation. Native grasses would be planted, and sheep would do most of the vegetation management. The shepherd, Marcus Gray of </span><a href="https://grayslambscaping.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gray’s Lambscaping</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, attended the hearing to describe the sheep operations he runs successfully at other solar sites. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Approval of the project would earn the county roughly $1.7 million upfront, and $300,000 in annual tax revenue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supervisors praised the developer for “a really good application” that “respected” the ordinance and the environment, for the company’s willingness to listen and respond to concerns, and for agreeing to build stormwater basins and sacrifice buildable space in favor of conservation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several members of the public testified in favor of the project, but this time there were also opponents. Some of them repeated common </span><a href="https://energysolutions-solar.com/busting-renewable-energy-myths/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">myths</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about solar panel toxicity and the risk of fires. One woman stated flatly, and obviously incorrectly, that it was not possible to raise sheep at a solar farm because they would die from the heat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The supervisors themselves did not appear ill-informed or misinformed, though one expressed surprise that Gray could successfully sell his lamb at farmers markets when buyers knew where they had been raised. (Watching, I could only laugh, because I’ve always thought of the solar-sheep synergy as a great selling point for climate-conscious carnivores.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concern raised most often was the risk of impacts to the nearby North Anna River, though the developer had agreed to shrink the project to accommodate a much greater setback from the river than required. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, however, Supervisor Stoneman’s argument for denying the permit rested on a different argument. He praised the developer for doing a good job, and noted the project was in accordance with all requirements. But, he said, “Beaverdam is just a different place.” People take pride in the rural character and forest and farmland. Our job, he noted, is to protect the trees that are harvested on the site currently, something “that is as important as the power.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Money is not the most important thing,” concluded the man who led the cheering squad for a data center complex in his district six months earlier.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two supervisors who had supported the smaller solar facility that had been rejected in March made their best arguments for this project as well, though they ultimately voted with Stoneman as the home supervisor. One said she supported solar “because I’m pro-farm,” and solar is a way to preserve farmland from development. The other noted that the land would certainly be developed one way or another, and the results would almost certainly be worse. Maintaining rural culture is important, he noted, but “we are approving residential development and seeing by-right development that people don’t want either.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also warned his colleagues, as he had in the spring, that rejecting good solar projects was going to result in legislation that would take away local authority and give it to the unelected State Corporation Commission. He said he would go along with Stoneman’s motion to deny the permit because “I assume he knows something,” but he made it clear he considered it the wrong decision, and a dangerous one for local autonomy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evidently, he had been paying attention to the conversation at the General Assembly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be clear, my sympathies lie wholeheartedly with people whose instincts are to protect the woods and fields around them. I share the one Hanover supervisor’s belief that solar is a means to preserve land from permanent development and even improve soil health and wildlife habitat, but I also understand it may be years before some people see sheep grazing under solar panels as a welcome feature in their landscape. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I get how a rural county, having sold a little bit of its soul for $1.8 billion, might then slam the door to other development, even after applicants had worked with the county for months in good faith and done everything asked for. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not a choice I’d make – I’d take solar over data centers every time – but then, no one made it the county’s responsibility to contribute electricity to the grid that serves it, much less to produce the electricity needed to run the data centers it embraced.</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> opportunity for residents who want solar on their property is expanding to the Richmond and Hampton Roads area amid potential changes to how much savings Virginia&#8217;s two largest utilities will offer to customers who install panels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solar United Neighbors says participation in its co-op program to install solar panels on residential properties can be a way to hedge against larger electricity bills coming from that increase, and while using carbon-free energy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I haven&#8217;t paid Dominion Energy for (energy) consumption in almost 18 months,” said Brandon Praileau, Virginia program director for the group, who said he installed solar panels on a church he’s a pastor at earlier this decade. “The utility rate has risen … since I went solar, but I don&#8217;t see it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The co-op model SUN advocates for involves a period when community members join as a group to ask a solar developer to install panels on their properties. The larger ask brings the cost of installation down compared to companies needing to complete one-off projects, Praileau explained. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once 20 to 30 members sign up, the co-op will send out a request for proposals to developers, which will then be reviewed by a selection committee of a few members to determine which builder to go with. The installer pays SUN a referral fee for each member who signs up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The spring, summer and the early bit of September, October — that&#8217;s peak season time,” Praileau said. “The goal is to try to get those systems installed so that those consumers will be able to produce peak energy consumption during the peak time of solar.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of the ultimate savings equation includes selling renewable energy credits created when solar energy is produced, and participating in net metering, Praileau added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Net-metering reduces the need to pull electricity from the grids’ centralized generation sources, and allows the excess energy that is produced to be sold back to the utility, with the value of that sale being credited, or netted, against a customer’s future bill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Think of it like the old AT&amp;T rollover minutes. The minutes you don&#8217;t use roll over to the next month. It&#8217;s the same concept here,” Praileau said. “If you produce more energy than what you consume, that unused energy you bank is then rolled over to the next month for you to then draw back from against whatever your next month&#8217;s energy consumption is.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the National Renewable Energy Labs, the average residential solar install is about 7.5 kilowatts. The equation saving’s answer in Virginia, Praileau said, ultimately amounts to customers getting a return on their 30-year investment on a 4 to 8 kilowatt system in about eight or nine years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What makes that eight years reasonable are the incentive tax credits around solar right now on the federal level … and if you&#8217;re in a rural area,” Praileau said, adding some localities have tax credits, too. “There might be credits for you if you&#8217;re in a disadvantaged community.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the savings do come with “cost-shifting” concerns. For instance, non-solar users argue that solar users benefit from the grid for energy needs when their panels aren’t producing or when they&#8217;re selling their excess energy back to the grid. That concern has prompted Appalachian Power Company, which serves Southwest Virginia, to ask regulators to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/13/appalachian-power-company-requests-reduction-to-pay-rate-for-net-metering-solar-customers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reduce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its payment for excess power from 16 cents per kilowatt hour to 4 cents per kilowatt hour. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appalachian’s request, Praileau said, “basically would kill the solar market and kill the solar industry, because that makes the return on investment like 30 years,” and puts an increased focus on what Dominion Energy may request with the State Corporation Commission, which regulates Virginia’s utilities, in May.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s also already a cost shift happening across the entire grid, Praileau said, with new generation sources needing to be added to the grid to meet rising energy demands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Who do you think is going to pay for that? The rate payer is going to pay for that,” Praileau said. “Where is the real cost shift to?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SUN began a </span><a href="https://solarunitedneighbors.org/co-ops/virginia/richmond-and-hampton-roads-fall-2024-co-op/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">campaign</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the Richmond and Hampton Roads area Nov. 21 and will run it until April 4. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest campaign comes after four previous ones in Virginia, which includes Arlington and Fairfax counties, D.C. and the Maryland counties of Howard, Montgomery and Frederick. As a result of those about 1,000 customers signed up and about 4.8 megawatts of solar has been installed leading to an investment of about $4 million, Praileau said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We know that Virginia&#8217;s energy consumption is rising at a very rapid pace,” said Praileau, adding that getting more residential solar, or “distributed generation” on the grid is part of alleviating the demand. Pair that with battery storage and demand side management programs with smart meters that can adjust a home&#8217;s electricity needs to create “virtual power plants,” Praileau said, “you can add just as much capacity as you could building a peaker power plant,” which Dominion is doing to ensure grid </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/22/air-regulators-awaiting-info-for-dominions-proposed-natural-gas-plant/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reliability</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those tools Praileau laid out are available as the state and municipalities have pledged to reduce fossil fuel emissions in their jurisdictions. The Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments set a target to have </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/27/d-c-region-including-nova-sets-ambitious-goal-for-rooftop-solar/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">250,000 rooftops</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> install solar. The City of Richmond has reduced the 3.5 million tons of community-wide carbon emissions in 2022 by 23% as part of its goal to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The plan includes the adoption of residential </span><a href="https://www.rva.gov/sites/default/files/2023-01/FullDocumentRVAgreenClimateEquityActionPlan2030.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">solar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Three percent of the city-wide emissions are from municipal government,” said Laura Thomas,  director of the Office of Sustainability with the city of Richmond during a recent media even. “That means 97% (of reductions) need to happen out in the community.”</span></p>

(Hugh Kenny)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reelection of Donald Trump shows the continued prevalence of climate denialism, which involves a rejection of the scientific consensus that human activity is changing the climate. As in his first term, Trump will no doubt try to hold our country back in the race to slow climate change by phasing out fossil fuels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike Trump’s climate denialism, survey research indicates that we in Virginia largely </span><a href="https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycom-us/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">agree</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that climate change is happening. And most of us understand that it is caused by our reliance on coal, oil, and natural gas. But we have our own special variety of denialism here in the commonwealth: a denial that there are limits to how much electricity we can produce for data centers without also shattering our commitment to shift away from fossil fuels. Ultimately, a transition to renewable energy will require that we slow or stop the current data center boom in order to get there.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Data center development and growing energy demand</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The name “data center” sounds innocuous, but their need for energy is anything but harmless. Data centers are large warehouses stacked full of electronics that convert energy into data storage and computation, increasingly for artificial intelligence. The </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/03/07/ai-data-centers-power/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">amount of electricity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that data centers need is staggering. Just one data center can use as much power as tens of thousands of households combined.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With at least </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/19/energy-policymakers-convene-for-virginia-clean-economy-act-summit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">500 data centers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that have been built or permitted in Virginia, along with more in the works, the state has a </span><a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/24052024/virginia-data-center-market-electricity-demand/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">higher data center density</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than anywhere else in the world. Even before the data center boom, a transition away from fossil fuels across the state to 100% renewable energy would be a daunting task. But thanks in large part to data centers, it is now much harder. Virginia is experiencing </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2024-11-14/meta-google-amazon-dominion-energy-data-centers-virginia-power-demand" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">greater demand</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for power than any time since World War II. Electricity consumption in the state is </span><a href="https://news.dominionenergy.com/2024-10-15-Dominion-Energy-Virginia-releases-comprehensive-long-term-plan-to-meet-growing-power-demand-with-reliable,-affordable-and-increasingly-clean-electricity" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">projected to double</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the next fifteen years. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The limits of green technology</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This growing energy demand cannot be met while also phasing out fossil fuels. Solar panels are an essential part of the energy transition, but they can’t do it all. For example, just one </span><a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/cleanarc-to-develop-600mw-campus-in-caroline-county-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">600 megawatt data center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently approved in Caroline County will use the equivalent of as much electricity as is produced in Spotsylvania County’s </span><a href="https://colonial-materials.com/portfolio/energy/spotsylvania-solar/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">solar farm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which covers 3,500 acres of land with solar arrays and is the largest solar development east of the Rocky Mountains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wind turbines have tremendous promise for electricity production, but also can’t provide a magical solution for meeting energy demand. For example, Dominion Energy is developing a 176 turbine project off of the coast of Virginia Beach. This project will produce enough electricity to meet the needs of about 600,000 homes, or just a bit more than the energy that will be required to power a single data-center mega project that is currently being developed in </span><a href="https://www.bayjournal.com/news/energy/energy-demands-for-northern-virginia-data-centers-almost-too-big-to-compute/article_d64ab388-2cb7-11ef-a753-4ffcc056f619.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hanover County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the limits of solar and wind energy in meeting expected energy demand, Dominion Energy and Amazon Web Services — a main developer of data centers in our state — have announced </span><a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/amazon-signs-deals-to-invest-in-nuclear-smrs-to-power-data-centers/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to build small nuclear power plants as low-carbon sources of energy. But it would take dozens of these new reactors to produce enough electricity for Virginia’s data centers alone. Since nuclear power remains controversial and because many Virginians likely do not want to live next to a nuclear power plant, it is uncertain where they would all be built.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Climate denialism, Virginia style</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s style of climate denialism doesn’t dispute that fossil fuels are causing climate change. Instead, denialism in the commonwealth happens when we commit to phasing out fossil fuels but don’t have a plan to get there, and instead approve data center after data center as if there is an unlimited supply of low-carbon electricity to run them all. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion Energy, for instance, says that it is committed to Virginia’s goal of phasing out fossil fuels, even while proposing the development of </span><a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/10112023/dominion-peaker-plant-chesterfield-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new natural gas power plants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Amazon Web Services stresses the importance of achieving carbon neutrality by 2040, even if its CEO </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/17/amazon-announces-deal-with-dominion-energy-to-develop-a-small-nuclear-reactor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">admits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that he doesn’t know how it will be achieved. And local leaders, like those in my hometown of Fredericksburg, proclaim their commitment to 100% renewable energy goals without a climate plan, while also </span><a href="https://fxbgadvance.substack.com/p/fredericksburg-city-council-passes" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announcing new efforts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to attract data center development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to overcome Virginia’s special flavor of climate denialism, we must recognize that there are limits to how much energy we can produce without fueling climate change. This means there is also a limit to how many data centers that can operate as we transition away from fossil fuels. In the interest of protecting our climate, it is time for a moratorium on the approval of new data centers in our state.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this month, Sen. Mark Warner announced that India will receive the frozen birds after reduced tariffs facilitated the first shipment</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Obviously you&#8217;ve got a big turkey industry in the Shenandoah Valley,” Warner said during a press conference on Nov. 14. “We have been fighting for some time to get the markets of India and Turkey, (the) country Turkey, open. That has now taken place.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Virginia was the country’s sixth largest producer of turkeys in 2023 with 15.5 million birds, while its North Carolina neighbor ranked second with 29 million birds. Minnesota had the most with 38.5 million birds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, Virginia’s turkey production contributed to the overall poultry industry’s economic impact of $5.8 billion directly to Virginia’s economy. John King, president of the Virginia Poultry Growers Cooperative, said in a statement that the shipment to India “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">will directly benefit our nearly 200 independent grower owners.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shipment earlier this month occurred after Ambassador Katherine Tai, the U.S. trade representative, worked with India to get the country to reduce tariffs on frozen turkey, frozen duck and fresh frozen, dried and processed blueberries and cranberries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In June 2023, before Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the United States, Warner, Sen. Tim Kaine and five other senators sent a </span><a href="https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/7/6/7638bcc5-a2eb-4c3f-93a9-462c8d258d29/905D5CD94F560DB2CD32591ADD0D8148.6.21.23-india-u.s.-turkey-letter-to-ustr-final.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Tai urging her to work to get India to reduce the tariff, which amounted to an additional 30% duty, or fee. In </span><a href="https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2023/september/united-states-announces-resolution-outstanding-wto-poultry-dispute-india" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">September</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Tai announced the tariff for turkey products dropping to 5%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Resolving this last outstanding (World Trade Organization) dispute represents an important milestone in the U.S.-India trade relationship, while reducing tariffs on certain U.S. products enhances crucial market access for American agricultural producers,” Tai said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The demand for turkey is “strong” in India, said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shana Oshinskie, a spokesperson for Warner’s office, “driven in part by their robust population growth, lack of a domestic alternative, and increasing protein need.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the World Health Organization, the population of </span><a href="https://data.who.int/countries/356" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">India</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is expected to increase to about 1.7 billion people by 2050. In 2016, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, produced a </span><a href="https://kiran.nic.in/pdf/farmers_corner/pamphlets-2016/TurkeyFarming.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> outlining ways to increase domestic turkey rearing and called the birds’ meat “the leanest among other poultry species with lower fat and cholesterol content compared to red meat.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is part of Sen. Warner’s broader push to strengthen our economic and diplomatic ties with India, one of our most key partners, and this move particularly benefits Virginia’s sizable population of poultry producers,” Oshinskie added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">King, by phone interview, said his group had sales of turkey’s at a rate of about 17.7 pounds per person when the group started 20 years ago, but that’s <a href="https://www.usda.gov/oce/commodity/wasde/wasde1024.pdf" target="_blank">dropped</a> to about 13.9 pounds per person this year due to bird illnesses, limited supply and rising costs. While Mexico “continues to be a great trading partner,” markets in China have become “not as reliable,” King said, prompting the desire to seek the populous India.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We need some help in the export markets,” King said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first shipment of frozen turkey products raised by the Virginia Poultry Growers Cooperative left the U.S. out of the Port of Virginia. They’re expected to arrive in the country in the coming weeks, Oshinskie said.</span></p>

(Hugh Kenny)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever since data centers started spreading across the Virginia landscape like an invasive pest, one important question has remained unanswered: How much does the industry’s insatiable demand for energy impact other utility customers? Under pressure from the SCC, this month Dominion Energy Virginia finally provided the answer we feared: Ordinary Virginia customers are subsidizing Big Tech with both their money and their health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion previously hid data centers among the rest of its customer base, making it impossible to figure out if residents were paying more than their fair share of the costs of building new generation and transmission lines. Worse, if data centers are the reason for burning more fossil fuels, then they are also responsible for residents being subjected to pollution that is supposed to be eliminated under the 2020 Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA). The </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title56/chapter23/section56-585.5/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VCEA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> calls for most coal plants in the state to be closed by the end of this year – which is not happening – and sets rigorous conditions before utilities can build any new fossil fuel plants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion’s 2023 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP), filed a year and a half ago, projected steep increases in energy demand and the cost of electricity. The utility asserted that for reliability purposes it needed to keep coal plants operating, build new methane gas generating units without meeting the VCEA’s conditions, and add small nuclear reactors beginning in 2034.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="y96cnfBug6"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/28/once-again-dominions-energy-plan-falls-short-this-time-the-scc-isnt-having-it/">Once again, Dominion’s energy plan falls short. This time, the SCC isn’t having it.</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Once again, Dominion’s energy plan falls short. This time, the SCC isn’t having it.&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/28/once-again-dominions-energy-plan-falls-short-this-time-the-scc-isnt-having-it/embed/#?secret=uWxZlBPtXo#?secret=y96cnfBug6" data-secret="y96cnfBug6" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion’s failure to file a plan that complied with the VCEA led to </span><a href="https://reisingergooch.com/virginia-energy-regulatory-updates-january-2024/#:~:text=SCC%20states%20that%20it%20will,56%2D585.1(A)." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an unusual stalemate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the SCC, with the IRP neither approved nor rejected. Ignoring the foul-weather warning, Dominion filed a similarly-flawed </span><a href="https://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/820101!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2024 IRP</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in October.  None of the modeled scenarios showed coal plants closing, none met the energy efficiency requirements set by law, and all proposed building new gas and nuclear reactors, with the first small nuclear plant now pushed off to 2035.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neither of the two filings separated out the role of data centers in driving the changes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even before the 2024 IRP was filed, though, the SCC directed the utility to file a supplement. It was obvious the IRP would project higher costs and increased use of fossil fuels. How much of that, the SCC demanded to know, is attributable to data centers? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot, as it turns out. Though Dominion continues to obfuscate key facts, </span><a href="https://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/82l101!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the document</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it filed on November 15 shows future data center growth will drive up utility spending by about 20%. Dominion did not take the analysis further to show the effect on residential rates. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The filing also shows that but for new data centers, peak demand would actually decrease slightly over the next few years, from 17,353 MW this year to 17,280 MW in 2027, before beginning a gentle rise to 17,818 MW in 2034 and 18,608 MW in 2039. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, without data centers, electricity use in Dominion territory would scarcely budge over the next decade. Indeed, the slight decrease over the next three years is especially interesting because near-term numbers tend to be the most reliable, with projections getting more speculative the further out you look.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surprised? You’re not alone. We’ve heard for years that </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/02/virginias-electric-vehicle-transition-depends-on-the-power-grid-how-is-it-faring/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">electric vehicles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and building electrification will drive large increases in energy demand. When Dominion talks about the challenges of load growth, it cites these factors along with data centers, suggesting that ordinary people are part of the problem. We’re not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decreasing demand is a testament to the profound effect of energy efficiency, as advances in things like lighting, heat pumps and other appliances allow consumers to do more with less. Presumably, the electrification of transportation and buildings will eventually outpace gains in efficiency – no doubt reflected in the projections for slightly increasing demand over the 2030s – but the effect is still modest. Electrification is not to blame for demand growth; data centers are.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a future without new data centers, there should be no reason for Virginia’s energy transition to get off track. Solar, offshore wind and battery storage could increasingly displace fossil fuels, clean our air and bring down greenhouse gas emissions at an orderly pace. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least, that’s the intuitive result, though Dominion fights hard to counter it. The new filing is supposed to show what a VCEA-compliant plan would look like without data centers, but it retains assumptions from its IRPs that skew the results in favor of fossil fuels. These include limiting energy efficiency and artificially capping the amounts of solar and storage that its computer model could select. Obviously, if you won’t invest in low-cost energy efficiency and solar, you need more of something else. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion’s computer model also doesn’t choose offshore wind in spite of the fact that the 2,600-MW Virginia Coastal Offshore Wind project is under construction. No doubt the higher cost of offshore wind is responsible for this counter-factual omission, but again, leaving it out requires that something else be selected. Nuclear similarly doesn’t make the cut due to cost.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By limiting or eliminating all zero-carbon options, Dominion would like you to conclude that, with or without data centers, it “needs” more gas plants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are other reasons to be skeptical of this manufactured result. As with the 2024 IRP itself, Dominion does not appear to have incorporated the social cost of carbon in its supposedly-VCEA-compliant plan, a mandatory consideration for any new fossil fuel generation. It’s also worth noting that Dominion will once again have to buy carbon emission allowances to run its coal and gas plants now that a court has </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/20/judge-deems-youngkins-actions-to-withdraw-virginia-from-rggi-unlawful/?emci=3782c1a1-7ca7-ef11-88d0-6045bdd62db6&amp;emdi=d50fd664-00a8-ef11-88d0-6045bdd62db6&amp;ceid=343350"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nullified</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s illegal withdrawal of Virginia from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). (Youngkin has vowed to appeal.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, President-elect Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress seem likely to overturn new EPA regulations tightening pollution standards for fossil fuel plants. That would make fossil fuels appear cheaper by shifting costs onto residents in the form of worse health outcomes and climate-related weather disasters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to showing what the energy mix might look like without data centers, the SCC directed Dominion to identify which of its approximately 200 planned transmission projects were needed solely because of data centers. The 4-page table in Dominion’s supplemental filing reveals that about half of the projects are solely data center-driven, with two or three dozen more serving a mix of customers that includes data centers. I tried to add up the numbers but lost track at a billion dollars’ worth of projects needed solely for data centers – and I was still on the second page. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is one more caveat to keep in mind. Since the SCC’s order applied only to future growth, Dominion’s new numbers don’t show the cost and energy impact of data centers in operation today. Data centers already make up a quarter of Dominion’s sales, and that growth was the main reason the utility pivoted back to fossil fuels in its 2023 IRP. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, most of the data center growth lies ahead of us, as does Dominion’s plans for new fossil fuel and nuclear generation. With state leaders avidly chasing more data centers in the name of economic development, ordinary Virginians are left to watch the assault on their energy supply, their water, and their environment and wonder: Is anyone going to fix this? </span></p>

(Getty Images) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rural electric cooperatives are joining in on the deployment of electric vehicle charging stations statewide, after Virginia Energy announced $1.1 million in awards to two co-ops last week, as well as an EV charger developer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A&amp;N Electric Cooperative, which serves the Eastern Shore, will receive $274,290 for two charging stations in New Church and Capeville. Rappahannock Electric Cooperative, through its subsidiary Vividly Brighter, will get $121,974.40 for three chargers, including two in Caret and one in Doswell. Electric vehicle charging station developer Blink Charging will net $542,444 for five stations in Cape Charles, Norfolk, Suffolk and Petersburg and two stations to be built in Salem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The funds stem from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Electric Vehicle Charging Assistance Program and are being administered by the Virginia Department of Energy. A lack of available charging stations has been a challenge for EV infrastructure development across the state, a concern from major auto manufacturers amid declining sales projections, and a chief argument of opponents of policies aimed at spurring electric vehicle sales.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The charging stations will complement the network of charging stations the federal government is also funding through the BIL and the Virginia Department of Transportation, being deployed along interstates and state highways. Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, has introduced measures to expand EV charging stations in rural areas to benefit the tourism industry, but they have failed to pass the past three years’ legislative sessions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transportation emissions constitute about one-third of the state’s and the country&#8217;s climate changing greenhouse gas releases, which  are trapping heat in the atmosphere and leading to more intense and frequent storms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement about the latest awardings, Virginia Energy said the chargers will attract more visitors to tourist destinations and support local businesses. The tourism industry in the state brought in $24 billion in 2023, the most ever, according to the statement, which added that more electric vehicle infrastructure in these rural areas “will only increase those dollars.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“EV charging stations have the potential to boost revenue of nearby businesses by $1,500 annually, keeping Virginia competitive in the evolving tourism industry,” said Glenn Davis, Virginia Energy director.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A study by Massachusetts Institute of Technology released in </span><a href="https://news.mit.edu/2024/study-ev-charging-stations-boost-nearby-business-spending-0904" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">September</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that opening charging stations boosted annual spending at nearby businesses by an average of about $1,500 in 2019, and about $400 between January 2021 and June 2023. The decline was due to more EV charges being available, leading to less utilization, and a decrease in spending at businesses after the pandemic and a lower number of businesses served by each charger.</span></p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: This story was corrected to say transportation emissions constitute about one-third of the state&#8217;s and country&#8217;s greenhouse gas releases.</em></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/ViewMeeting.cfm?MeetingID=40753" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">systems </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">include eight from Fauquier and Loudoun Counties, with a smattering of results from the rest of the state, including Fairfax County, the Hampton Roads region and Roanoke County in Southwest Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Combined, the systems serve about 2.29 million people, with the Loudoun and Faquier counties systems serving about 360,000. Six systems, consisting of the Loudoun Water Central System, and one in Newport News, Norfolk, Stafford County and Fairfax County, serve about 2.2 million people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of this data has been publicly available for some time so there weren’t any big surprises,” said Carroll Courtenay, a staff attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center. “I’m glad to see that some water systems took advantage of self-reporting data to DEQ to make sure the PFAS assessment process is as comprehensive as possible.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PFAS chemicals are found in several household items, including clothing and cookware. They’re used in  firefighting foam because of their tight chemical bond that repels liquid and quells heat. That bond also makes them incredibly difficult to break down once they’re in the environment.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Identification</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality became aware of the drinking water results following a transfer of reporting data from the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/21/virginia-dept-of-health-plans-to-test-small-disadvantaged-communities-for-pfas/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Department of Health</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as required by legislation from Sen. Jeremy McPike, D-Prince William, and Sen. Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke.</span></p>

(Data courtesy of DEQ)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The transfer included results from past testing by VDH and results from a test called the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule, or UCMR 5, and self reporting from Loudoun and Fauquier counties. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those results found the level of PFAS to be above the maximum contaminant levels to prevent death and reduce exposure for certain types of PFAS, which is 4 or 10 parts per trillion. One part per trillion is the equivalent of </span><a href="https://www.ehs.harvard.edu/news/cambridge-drinking-water" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 drop of water in 20 Olympic-sized swimming pools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Voluntary reporting</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The findings from Fauquier County and Loudun were self-reported, which DEQ spokesperson Irina Calos said, “is the result of their proactive approach to sampling and voluntarily sharing the data.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ben Shoemaker, executive Director at Fauquier County Water and Sanitation Authority, said they conducted sampling at their 48 groundwater wells supplying their system to correct a lab issue with contamination. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The testing method for PFAS is similar to other water sampling methods, but since the chemicals are pervasive, it’s easy for them to transfer from clothing and infiltrate samples, creating false positives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You always have to be careful sampling drinking water, for PFAS you have to be even more careful,” said Shoemaker. “There’s a whole set of guidelines out there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sampling was also done to meet requirements for funding from class action lawsuits to deal with PFAS, Shoemaker said.  It cost about $500 per test, meaning it cost about $25,000 to test all their wells.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let&#8217;s just go sample everything we have,” Shoemaker said of his agency’s reasoning. “That way we&#8217;re not guessing, there&#8217;s no questions. We can find out what we got and we can deal with it.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a similar sense, Loudoun Water, the provider for the Loudoun Water Central System, Beacon Hill-LCSA and Creighton Farms systems, has worked to understand their situation and provide information on their website for customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We value coordination with our regional water community to improve our collective understanding of PFAS occurrence, identify sources and how to mitigate it,” said Sue Crosby, executive director of communications for Loudoun Water.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Assessment</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that the results have been revealed, the law from McPike and Rasoul now requires DEQ to evaluate “potential sources” and notify them to either self-report, self-report and monitor, or just monitor, Calos said, which could be done by relying on past information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sources of PFAS are typically thought to be manufacturing facilities that discharge them in their wastewater and landfills, from which the chemicals can leak without protections like liners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DEQ could use a past voluntary survey they sent out in 2022 to identify PFAS sources, Calos acknowledged, but the 10% response rate, “was low, and the information…is dated.” Another potential source is the Danville Northside Wastewater Treatment plant, which the SELC and environmental advisory group Wild Virginia said is </span><a href="https://www.southernenvironment.org/press-release/groups-urge-deq-to-stop-pfas-pollution-at-its-source-in-issuing-permit-to-danville-va-treatment-plant/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">known </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to discharge PFAS.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If in surface water, the sources could be anywhere upstream in the watershed, including discharges permitted by DEQ under the VPDES program and/or places where DEQ allows land application for sludge,” said David Sligh, conservation director of Wild Virginia. “If in groundwater, as is the case for the majority in this list, the source could be anything that happens on the land.” </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39020" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1901px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/21/virginia-dept-of-health-plans-to-test-small-disadvantaged-communities-for-pfas/pfas-6-13-24-with-legend/" rel="attachment wp-att-39020"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-39020" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/PFAS-6.13.24-with-legend.jpg" alt="" width="1901" height="756" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/PFAS-6.13.24-with-legend.jpg 1901w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/PFAS-6.13.24-with-legend-300x119.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/PFAS-6.13.24-with-legend-1024x407.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/PFAS-6.13.24-with-legend-768x305.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/PFAS-6.13.24-with-legend-1536x611.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1901px) 100vw, 1901px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A screenshot of sites sampled for PFAS by the Virginia Department of Health (Courtesy of Virginia Department of Health)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The difficulty for groundwater wells, Shoemaker said, is that the source could be biosolids spread on agricultural land as fertilizers or other activity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, an explosive car crash could have occurred on a property a decade ago and firefighting foam could’ve been used to squelch the fire. PFAS could leak  into one well but not another on the same property.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The short answer (is) we don&#8217;t know,”  Shoemaker said about where the PFAS came from in Fauquier County water. He was surprised the initial results showed exceedances of the chemicals, since the area doesn&#8217;t have much industrial activity and is pretty rural.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ubiquitous nature of PFAS chemicals is one reason lawmakers crafted the law to require DEQ to identify potential sources, and then prioritize requirements for reporting and monitoring. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">PFAS advisory committee</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The PFAS Advisory Committee, created by the law and seen as a way to provide oversight of DEQ’s actions to address PFAS, is now determining the prioritization process for identifying sources. But environmental groups are concerned about their lack of participation so far in that process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee is evaluating how other states like Arizona, North Carolina and Maryland have made assessments, and the “public health impacts, drinking water system characteristics, and environmental considerations,” for potential sources, Calos said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Surface waters are looking at the entire watershed upstream of the water treatment plant,” Calos said. “For groundwater (GW) sources we are looking at a three (mile) radius from the well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The prioritization process is expected to be put into a draft plan and shared with the Committee at a Dec. 16 meeting and finalized in January. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40948" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1430px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=40948" rel="attachment wp-att-40948"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40948" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/PFAS-committee-members.jpg" alt="" width="1430" height="768" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/PFAS-committee-members.jpg 1430w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/PFAS-committee-members-300x161.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/PFAS-committee-members-1024x550.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/PFAS-committee-members-768x412.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1430px) 100vw, 1430px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  The members of the PFAS Advisory Committee. (Screenshot courtesy of minutes from the meeting)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But absent from the committee is an environmental group, as required by law. DEQ Director Mike Rolband is in charge of making appointments, according to the measure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is absolutely unacceptable that DEQ has failed to include conservation group representatives on the committee well before the first meeting was held on November 8th,” said Sligh, who added that he notified DEQ of his qualifications, which include being a former employee for the State Water Control Board and DEQ who oversaw pollution permits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By that failure, Director Rolband is violating the express command of the statute and I hope legislators will insist that he correct it immediately,” Sligh said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to the claim, Calos said DEQ consulted with the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, James River Association and SELC, which led them to offer the position to a Duke University professor whom the groups recommended, but she declined the invitation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">DEQ has reached back out to these environmental groups to obtain additional recommendations that will be considered,” Calos said. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">DEQ will evaluate the credentials of those individuals recommended and appoint additional members to the committee as needed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agency has hired two of three additional staff to carry out the legislation’s goals, and will continue its rotating fish tissue sampling to support the identification process, which has already happened in the basins of Tennessee/Big Sandy, Chowan, James, Potomac/Shenandoah, Rappahannock, and Roanoke Rivers. The New River basin, the York River basin, and the small coastal basin remain to be sampled.</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s air regulators are awaiting data from Dominion Energy to further process the utility&#8217;s air permit request for the natural gas plant they’re proposing to build to meet rising energy needs, as pushback over the location and potential environmental impact of the facility continues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are expecting to receive air quality monitoring data … in the next couple of weeks or so,” said Mike Dowd, director of air and renewable energy at the Department of Environmental Quality, in an update to the State Air Pollution Control Board Thursday. “As soon as we get the air quality modeling data, we will be processing the permit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion spokesperson Jeremy Slayton confirmed to The Mercury that the utility is “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">currently planning to submit our modeling report to DEQ in early 2025.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion Energy, Virginia’s largest utility, is proposing the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to meet increased energy demands expected to hit the state as a result of data center development. After local opposition, Dominion moved the proposed location from an industrial site on Battery Brooke Parkway to its former coal-fired Chesterfield Power Station on Coxendale Road. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Construction is expected to start in 2026. It’s expected to be operational in 2029.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental and community groups have staunchly fought against the project, saying it runs counter to the state’s 2020 Virginia Clean Economy Act that mandates the retirement of fossil fuels by 2045, unless there’s a concern over being able to reliably send electricity to the grid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Critics also are concerned about the air pollution impacting the surrounding community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The update on the timeline means next year </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“is going to be pretty busy in terms of the public engagement,” said Mason Manley, a field manger with Clean Virginia, an advocacy group formed by millionaire Michael Bills to oppose Dominion’s influence in the legislature. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The public will likely have the chance to weigh in on both the air permit for the Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center, as well as a separate Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity from the State Corporation Commission, which regulates Virginia’s utilities, Manley said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The air permit is expected to be issued by July 28, according to DEQ’s permitting website, with public engagement opportunities occurring before then. The CPCN is going to be requested “in the first quarter of 2025,” said Slayton, with Dominion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andy Farmer, a spokesperson for the SCC, said “It is too early to discuss an SCC public engagement process when an application hasn’t been filed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“After Dominion files the application, the SCC will issue an Order for Notice and Hearing that will include a hearing schedule and public comment opportunities,” Farmer said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manley said the public engagement opportunity is when community members can make their case for a denial or express their concerns necessitating controls for emissions be put in place. Last month, community members held a “People’s Hearing” to collect public testimony that will be submitted to DEQ during the public engagement period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“(The air permit) is extremely important, (Dominion) can&#8217;t actually begin construction until that is issued,” Manley said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The timeline update comes as opposition continues over local approval of the land use for the project, which is considered one of the first requirements before the DEQ and SCC processes can finish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, the Friends of the Chesterfield, a group formed to oppose the plant, filed another appeal with the Chesterfield County Board of Zoning Appeals over a decision to use a 2010 conditional use permit for the Coxendale Road site for the proposed plant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previously, the friends group challenged a zoning determination from Chesterfield County Deputy Administrator Jesse Smith, but the zoning board said that determination was made as part of the air permitting process under the air board’s authority, not its own. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the rejection, the friends group followed up with Chesterfield County Chesterfield County Planning Director Andrew Gillies with their own request for a zoning determination on using the conditional use permit for the new site. Gillies responded on Oct. 18 saying that the previous letter stating the existing conditional use permit applies to the proposed plant, “fully answers your letter.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evan Johns, an attorney with Appalachian Mountain Advocates, which filed both appeals on behalf of the Friends group, said the second appeal is a response to a determination by Gillies, a zoning official, which the groups says is reviewable by the zoning board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It seems like a determination that can be reviewed,” said Johns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chesterfield County spokesperson Teresa Bonifas said, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not comment on pending or potential litigation.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next zoning board meeting is scheduled for Dec. 4.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another requirement for the air permit process is a determination of “site suitability.” As Chesterfield County has declined to make that determination, Dowd said “there hasn’t been a full resolution.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I assume this is all part and parcel with (the appeal),” Dowd said.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin speaks to reporters outside the Capitol near the end of the 2024 General Assembly session. (Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Floyd County Circuit Court Judge Randall Lowe ruled Wednesday Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin acted unlawfully by withdrawing Virginia from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a program aimed to reduce climate changing emissions that has funneled hundreds of millions to the state to deal with the impacts of extreme weather events.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his five page opinion, Lowe wrote that “the only body with the authority to repeal the RGGI regulation would be the General Assembly. This is because a statute, the RGGI Act, requires the RGGI regulation to exist.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For the reasons set out in this opinion, the court finds that the attempted repeal of the RGGI Regulation is unlawful, and thereby null and void,” Lowe wrote.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">RGGI background and how we got here</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia began participating in RGGI in 2021 after Democrats, with trifecta control of state government the year prior, passed the Clean Energy and Community Flood Preparedness Act (which Lowe referred to as the RGGI Act).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RGGI is a multi-state program in which electricity producers in participating states are required to buy allowances for the emissions they produce. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proceeds from the allowances are returned to the states, where, in Virginia, about $830 million had been generated for programs increasing flood resiliency and energy efficiency efforts prior to the state’s withdrawal at the end of last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the 2020 law, 50% of the funds go toward energy efficiency programs that reduce how much electricity is needed, 45% go toward the Community Flood Preparedness Fund, or the flood fund for community-scale flood protection projects, with 5% used for administrative functions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, utilities produce their own electricity and are allowed to recover the costs of the allowances from ratepayers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a typical Dominion customer, the recovery amounted to a $2.39 monthly fee, before it was paused amid uncertainty around Virginia&#8217;s participation in RGGI. The fee was then added back in the amount of $4.34 for a typical residential customer to make up for when cost recovery wasn’t levied and participation in RGGI continued. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fee is no longer tacked on to utility bills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That fee is what Youngkin called a “hidden tax,” when he proposed a regulation in the fall of 2022 to repeal the existing regulation requiring Virginia’s participation in RGGI. The State Air Pollution Control Board approved the repeal regulation in August 2023.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The day of that vote, four groups filed a challenge against the Youngkin administration in Fairfax County Circuit Court. The judge found only one group, the Association of Energy Conservation Professionals, had standing to bring allegations forward and transferred the matter to Floyd County Circuit Court, the jurisdiction where AECP is headquartered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There, the Floyd County Circuit judge recused himself over a conflict of interest and the office of Attorney General Jason Miyares, representing the Youngkin administration, argued for the case to be reheard in front of the Lowe, who issued his ruling Wednesday.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What the ruling means</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lowe based his decision that Youngkin overreached on precedents set by two cases, Supervisors of Botetourt County v. Cahoon from 1917, and Bean vs. Simmons from 1852.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Cahoon case, the court ruled that where this a “duty coupled with the power …usually the power must be exercised,” Lowe noted, adding that “what they are empowered to do … the law requires shall be done.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bean case, Lowe explained, demonstrated that where “public interest and right are concerned,” the public has a right to agency powers being used.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The RGGI Act, Lowe wrote, includes in the first substantive provision that participation in RGGI “shall be incorporated” by DEQ without further action by the air board. The RGGI Act also “hereby authorized” the DEQ Director to participate in RGGI, Lowe pointed out, thereby coupling the duty to participate in RGGI and the power to do so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There can be no doubt that the RGGI Act is designed for the purposes discussed in Cahoon,” Lowe wrote. “Because (the AG’s office) lacked the statutory authority to repeal the RGGI Regulation, it is unnecessary to address whether the decision to do so was supported by substantial evidence.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Had the Youngkin administration “amended,” the RGGI regulation in ways that were still consistent with the law, Lowe added, “it is doubtful that their authority to do so could be challenged. That is not what happened here.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Reaction from environmental advocates and lawmakers</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental groups and Democratic lawmakers had said repeatedly that the RGGI withdrawal was unlawful and hurt Virginians.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Billy Weitzenfeld, former executive director of the Association of Energy Conservation Professionals, said in a statement, “All along we knew that the actions taken by the Air Board and DEQ were wrong.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His group was granted standing in the case by Lowe because the repeal of the regulation meant the association was injured by losing a source of revenue to carry out their energy efficiency work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a win for communities across Virginia who have benefited from the state’s participation in RGGI in the past and those that now will have a chance to continue to see those benefits,” Weitzenfeld said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chelsea Harnish, executive director of the Virginia Energy Efficiency Council, noted that the revenue from RGGI “cannot be replaced or matched,” since the allowance revenues “exceeded every other source of energy efficiency funding in Virginia combined.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members of other environmental groups hailed the judge’s decision as a victory. Mike Town, Executive Director of the Virginia League of Conservation Voters, said the result of Youngkin’s move was, “dirtier air, more communities left exposed to floodwaters, and fewer tools to help Virginians cut energy costs.” Walton Shepherd, Virginia director and senior attorney with the group, added that “as we witness the grim toll of the increasingly dangerous weather in a warming world, today’s decision is good news for all Virginians.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Majority Leader Charniele Herring, D-Alexandria, who carried the 2020 law through its passing and pushed for a budget amendment this past session to reinstate Virginia in RGGI, said the decision was a “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">resounding victory for Virginia’s families.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are proud to stand with every Virginian who benefits from this initiative and will continue fighting to ensure these protections remain intact,” said Herring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in response to Lowe’s determination, Youngkin Press Secretary Christian Martinez, said, “We respectfully disagree with the judge&#8217;s decision and will pursue an appeal.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Governor Youngkin remains committed to lowering the cost of living for Virginians by continuing to oppose the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which fails to effectively incentivize emission reductions in the Commonwealth,” Martinez said. “Instead, it functions as a regressive tax, hidden in utility, bills passed on to all Virginians.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorney General Jason Miyares, in response to a question about the judge’s decision posed by  </span><a href="https://www.wtvr.com/author/cameron-thompson" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cameron Thompson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Richmond television station WTVR on Wednesday, said, “I think you can see from the beginning this is in the governor’s powers and how the law was actually written to the Virginia code. … We obviously have a disagreement in the interpretation of the law and the code.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Next steps</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lowes’ opinion explains the rationale behind his decision and will need to be followed up by an order to officially repeal the regulation that withdrew Virginia from RGGI, and reinstate the previous regulation requiring participation, explained Nate Benforado, senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, which represented the AECP. The timing of that order is yet to be determined.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the old regulation goes back into effect, DEQ will then need to take the steps necessary to resume participation in RGGI, Benforado said. While the Youngkin administration has stated they’ll be appealing the decision, they’ll need to also ask for a stay, or a pause, if they want to delay resuming participation in RGGI while they challenge Lowe’s decision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calling the ruling “validating,” Benforado said, “It is up to the administration on what they want to do next.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The RGGI program, Benforado added, was “critical” to reducing one-third of emission from independent power producers, since the state’s other landmark law reducing emission from power companies, the Virginia Clean Economy Act, applies only to Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power Company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“RGGI is really the key, if not the only tool, Virginia has,” Benforado said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state’s third major emissions-reducing regulation, which tethered Virginia’s vehicle tailpipe emissions to California’s Advanced Clean Car II standards that ban the sale of new gas powered vehicles starting in 2035, has also been repealed during Youngkin’s tenure. Environmental groups have signaled they’ll challenge that administrative move, also.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokesperson for Miyares’ office declined to elaborate on questions from the Virginia Mercury concerning what happens next with the state’s RGGI participation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We look forward to defending the commonsense repeal of this counterproductive program on appeal,&#8221; the spokesperson said.</span></p>

Marsden to host summit on Virginia Clean Economy Act next week&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/11/sen-marsden-to-host-summit-on-virginia-clean-economy-act-next-week/embed/#?secret=BRpvvKKik6#?secret=nBWrjz5cOB" data-secret="nBWrjz5cOB" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s spiking appetite for electricity is fueled by the continued development of data centers here, which funnel about 70% of the world&#8217;s internet traffic, said Kate Smiley, </span>director of Virginia government affairs for the Data Center Coalition. There are about 11,000 data centers in the world, with about 500 in Virginia, or 4.5%, she said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That explosion of electricity needs, and the  realities of how enacting the VCEA have played out, were the center of dialogue at the summit, convened by Sen. Dave Marsden, D-Fairfax.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is serious business,” Marsden said. “It’s going to be the most serious business that this Commonwealth deals with.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are seven key takeaways from the meeting.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Solar siting</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process of solar project approval in Virginia is expected to  lead to clashes this legislative session. Legislators are considering proposals that could give state officials authority to approve projects if localities reject proposals. Other ideas include creating a regional siting board to review projects or have state officials issue an advisory opinion to localities to lend technical expertise. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 75 localities have approved solar projects, according to Aaron Berryhill, solar program manager at Virginia Energy. But one solar company said during a panel the uncertainty of the local approval process is causing “sleepless nights.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Local permitting is more consequential and influential to the success of our business than any other factor in development,” said Danny Van Clief, CEO of Sun Tribe. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dean Lynch, executive director of the Virginia Association of Counties, a member of the panel, said the group is interested in continuing conversations on the proposals, but “we want authority,” not just input on decisions.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">SMRs</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">67 years after the U.S. Army’s first nuclear reactor was deployed at Ft. Belvoir in 1957, Dominion Energy is pursuing the construction of a small nuclear reactor (SMR), said </span>Todd Flowers, manager of business development at the utility.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congressional action, called the </span><a href="https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/governing-laws/advance-act.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ADVANCE Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has streamlined the licensing and permitting process to mitigate the “threats to deploy nuclear,” Flowers said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As tech companies build out artificial intelligence amid the development of data centers, providing adequate American power is key to “strengthening our national security,” said David Long, vice president of operations at HII Nuclear Mission Technologies.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ddXsoKGv4M"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/17/amazon-announces-deal-with-dominion-energy-to-develop-a-small-nuclear-reactor/">Amazon announces deal with Dominion Energy to develop a small nuclear reactor</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Amazon announces deal with Dominion Energy to develop a small nuclear reactor&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/17/amazon-announces-deal-with-dominion-energy-to-develop-a-small-nuclear-reactor/embed/#?secret=5wBDPjJ2o6#?secret=ddXsoKGv4M" data-secret="ddXsoKGv4M" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SMRs can help the U.S. win against other nations in the “AI race,” Long said. “Nuclear has got to be part of that.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">PJM queue </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is part of a regional grid transmission operator, called PJM Interconnection, which also has authority to approve solar projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to an influx of solar project proposals, PJM has a backlog of about 208,500 megawatts of energy generation sources awaiting approval across its entire footprint, which stretches across the mid-Atlantic. About 53,492 megawatts is awaiting approval in Virginia, with about 29,600 of that being solar. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PJM Interconnection is undergoing reforms and expects to get about 107 projects on the ground in Virginia by the end of 2025, totalling about 11,967 megawatts.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40890" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2236px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=40890" rel="attachment wp-att-40890"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-40890 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot_20241118_210740_Adobe-Acrobat-e1731982804293.jpg" alt="" width="2236" height="1080" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot_20241118_210740_Adobe-Acrobat-e1731982804293.jpg 2236w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot_20241118_210740_Adobe-Acrobat-e1731982804293-300x145.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot_20241118_210740_Adobe-Acrobat-e1731982804293-1024x495.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot_20241118_210740_Adobe-Acrobat-e1731982804293-768x371.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot_20241118_210740_Adobe-Acrobat-e1731982804293-1536x742.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot_20241118_210740_Adobe-Acrobat-e1731982804293-2048x989.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2236px) 100vw, 2236px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  The energy generation projects from Virginia that are stuck in PJM Interconnection&#8217;s approval queue, part of a presentation at the VCEA summit held Nov. 18, 2024. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It really depends” if developers can overcome local land use permitting and financing obstacles to get those projects online to help with incremental increase in energy needs, Matthew LaRocque, senior consultant at PJM Interconnection, told the Mercury.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Energy storage</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While solar may be able to send power to the grid during the day, Dominion Energy said the concern is maintaining enough electricity when the sun isn’t shining.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Households will need that power  before the sun comes up in the morning and after it sets in evening, particularly in the wintertime,explained Brandon Martin, manager for power generation business development at Dominion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result of legislation, including the 2018 Grid Transformation Act, Dominion is testing several battery storage projects that could be charged during the day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have a ton of excitement with respect to long duration energy storage, but we need to allow these technologies to develop and evolve and ultimately test those projects before we are able to bet the grid on them,” Martin said.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Energy efficiency</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Energy efficiency obviates the need for peak demand, as do demand-side management programs, which can reduce the amount of electricity needed to be generated in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The VCEA requires Dominion to reduce its electricity sales by 5%, and Appalachian Power Company by 2%, through energy efficiency measures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion Energy has had over a million participants in their energy efficiency programs equaling over 9,600 gigawatt hours of savings, the equivalent of 800,000 homes, said Mike Hubbard, manager of energy conservation with Dominion Energy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will Cleveland, a former Southern Environmental Law Center attorney now with his own private practice, said “the Virginia Clean Economy Act, doesn&#8217;t work if it doesn&#8217;t deliver you a zero- carbon grid that is both affordable and reliable.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If we don&#8217;t get all three of those things, it&#8217;s not going to work and it&#8217;s not a sustainable policy,” Cleveland said. “I think energy efficiency and demand response have a much larger role to play in achieving those … three goals than they do now.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Transmission </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transmission line development is part of the clean energy transition discussion in the state, since the lines could deliver power across greater distances of land as fossil fuel facilities come offline and new renewable sources are added to the grid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New approaches are being considered, including the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Order 1920 to enable more comprehensive planning and the use of grid enhancing technologies, or GETs, to increase the capacity of existing transmission lines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But including local input upfront could help avoid barriers to transmission projects, said Tom Rutigliano, senior advocate of climate &amp; energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s only in the last step before pouring concrete that there&#8217;s actual engagement with the public on transmission lines,” said Rutigliano. “You couldn&#8217;t design a better way to have transmission lines run into problems.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Business needs</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New businesses that are about to make the commonwealth their home are eying the energy discussion and gauging how long it may take to receive adequate power supply. Clean energy manufacturers LS Greenlink and Microporous just announced they are establishing operations in the state, said Jas El Koubi, director of the Virginia Economic Development Partnership.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For every $1 of incentives invested into luring businesses to the state, about $8 is returned in the first five years, El Koubi said, adding that about 90% of the state&#8217;s general fund for various priorities comes from sales and income taxes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Many businesses prefer clean energy once available and cost concerns are addressed, with a wide variety of clean energy considerations at play in those cases,” El Koubi said in an interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those growing business needs are also top of mind for the administration of Gov. Glenn Youngkin. The governor appointed Glenn Davis to be Virginia Energy director, whose approach to meeting the state’s energy demands mirrors Youngkin’s “All of the above” stance, including utilizing natural gas. At the summit, Davis reiterated the Virginia Clean Economy Act’s ban on natural gas and timelines to transition to a carbon-free grid should be lifted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While environmental groups and others say demand can be met with renewable energy and efficiency measures, Davis told the crowd, “We need to have additional natural gas built. It just is what it is.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We cannot have an affordable, reliable and increasingly clean grid without more natural gas built in the commonwealth of Virginia,” Davis said. “If anyone has a model that shows you can, please let me know.”</span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that President-elect Donald Trump and Republicans have gained control of the Oval Office and both chambers of Congress, the conservative playbook called Project 2025 may be closer to becoming a reality. It includes a </span><a href="https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_CHAPTER-12.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">chapter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> whose author has ties to Virginia’s energy laws and regulation creation process, and that calls for major overhauls to the U.S. Department of Energy, including repealing clean energy funding sources, increasing oil and gas production and streamlining the nuclear approval process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, put together Project 2025 in anticipation of a Trump presidency that will begin Jan. 20, 2025. The energy chapter was written by Richmond-based McGuireWoods lobbyist Bernard McNamee, who did not return requests for comment on this article. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump denied connections to Project 2025 on the campaign trail. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance’s transition team, told The Mercury Nov. 14 &#8220;no policy should be deemed official unless it comes directly from President Trump.” On Friday, Trump </span><a href="https://x.com/kleavittnh/status/1857518231076159736/photo/1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum would not only be Secretary of the Interior, but also </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-rapidly-unveils-appointments-cabinet-staff-posts-dizzying-post-election-week" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">chairman</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of a “newly formed” National Energy Council that will “oversee a path to U.S. ENERGY DOMINANCE.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here, we provide an overview of the energy and environmental implications of Project 2025, should it come to pass.  </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Repealing landmark federal legislation</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 54-page  energy chapter of Project 2025 calls for repeals to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act, which have funneled millions to Virginia for a range of initiatives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McNamee proposes to “Support repeal of massive spending bills like the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which established new programs and are providing hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies to renewable energy developers, their investors, and special interests, and support the rescinding of all funds not already spent by these programs.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to filings with the State Corporation Commission, which regulates Virginia’s utilities, Dominion Energy, the largest provider of electricity in the state, has </span><a href="https://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/815601!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">applied </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">for about $769 million in BIL and IRA funding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While noting all that funding hasn’t been awarded, the utility said “Any incremental credit or grant that the Company receives as a result of the IRA or IIJA will be passed on to customers through lower project costs.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40870" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/18/how-would-project-2025s-energy-implications-manifest-in-virginia/img_4118/" rel="attachment wp-att-40870"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40870" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_4118-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_4118-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_4118-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_4118-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_4118-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_4118-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_4118-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, speaks at a Virginia League of Conservation Voters event about Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding going to Richmond Public Schools. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appalachian Power Company, the state’s second largest utility, has </span><a href="https://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/814r01!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">applied </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">for about $79 million, while noting it would submit an application for funding provided by the </span><a href="https://www.energy.gov/oced/generation-iii-small-modular-reactor-program#:~:text=Program%20Announcements,supplier%20development%2C%20and%20site%20preparation." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BIL</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to support the development of a small modular reactor.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, that pursuit of SMR funding took a step forward with Appalachian Power Company </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/11/13/virginias-largest-megasite-lands-the-biggest-project-southside-has-ever-seen-after-years-of-trying/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announcing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it identified a site for the smaller form of a nuclear reactor on company-owned property in Campbell County. The company, “plans to apply for part of the U.S. Department of Energy’s $900 million grant program to accelerate the deployment of SMRs and help reduce customer costs,” a release on the announcement stated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other recent examples of federal funding flowing to Virginia include the Wednesday announcement that </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/11/13/virginias-largest-megasite-lands-the-biggest-project-southside-has-ever-seen-after-years-of-trying/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microporous</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a battery parts manufacturer, committed to opening a plant in Pittsylvania County after receiving a $100 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy with funding from the BIL. The company picked the location over other </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/07/virginia-develops-workforce-as-demand-for-electrification-grows/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">southeastern</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> states. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the summer, city of Richmond Public Schools received </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/richmond-public-schools-warner-kaine/article_9ec690ee-5444-11ef-bd3a-271298eb87a1.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$15 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to improve buildings’ energy efficiency and improve air quality in schoolhouses, which suffered from visible signs of mold, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Promoting fossil fuels</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another core premise of the chapter is the goal to increase  fossil fuel use, which Republicans and utilities say is needed  amid growing energy needs, but scientists and environmental professors say is counter intuitive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McNamee recommends a change to the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management, if it can’t be eliminated, to “increasing energy security and supply through fossil fuels.” The author also wants the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to “recommit itself to the (National Gas Act)’s purpose of providing the people with access to affordable and reliable natural gas.” The National Gas Act, or NGA was passed to regulate natural gas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The new energy crisis is caused not by a lack of resources, but by extreme ‘green’ policies,” McNamee wrote.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39170" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/05/dominion-chesterfield-county-weigh-site-suitability-for-natural-gas-plant-proposal/img_3704/" rel="attachment wp-att-39170"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-39170" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3704-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1584" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3704-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3704-300x186.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3704-1024x633.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3704-768x475.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3704-1536x950.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3704-2048x1267.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  The former coal-fired Chesterfield Power Station at Coxendale Road. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paul Bubbosh, adjunct professor at George Mason University, wrote the “energy crisis” that the author purports isn’t real, citing information from the Energy Information Agency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, crude oil prices will remain </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61222" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">flat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for 2024 and 2025,” </span><a href="https://cesp.gmu.edu/review-of-heritage-foundation-project-2025-department-of-energy-related-emissions-chapter-12/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Bubbosh in a blog post on the school’s website. “Further, the U.S. is setting </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61545" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">records</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in crude oil production. Natural gas prices may have a slight increase in the same time frame (2024-2025), but </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61385" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are well below crises markers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scientists say climate change is propelled by human-created emissions from fossil fuel use. Cale Jaffe, director of the environmental law and community engagement clinic at the University of Virginia, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">published an </span><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3217107" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Georgetown Environmental Law Review citing a 2015 Department of Defense analysis under the administration of President Barack Obama that said climate change is “present security threat.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It highlighted that climate change will ‘aggravate existing problems — such as poverty, social tensions, environmental degradation,’” Jaffe wrote. “For this reason, the Department of Defense labeled climate change as a ‘threat multiplier.’ Studies from the National Academy of Sciences and the Union of Concerned Scientists have further highlighted the national security risks associated with climate change.”</span></p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Increasing nuclear </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A third pillar of the playbook’s energy plan suggests easing the path to bringing more nuclear resources online, seen by some Virginia policy makers as critical to meet energy demands, but that also come with their environmental concerns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McNamee wants to “increase the level of private-sector responsibility for the disposal of nuclear waste,” and continue with Yucca Mountain being a central repository of waste after that idea was halted amid state </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/magazine/2022/04/11/america-nuclear-waste-san-onofre/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pushback</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also called for reforms under the Office of Nuclear Energy to “reduce regulatory obstacles,” and for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to “expedite the review and approval of license extensions of existing reactors, which will require the NRC to streamline and focus its (National Environmental Policy Act) review process.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia, being at the epicenter of data center development in the country, is faced with skyrocketing energy demands, prompting discussion about using carbon-free small modular reactors to maintain a reliable grid while achieving emission reduction goals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin has pushed for SMRs since the unveiling of his “All-of-the-Above” energy plan in 2022. This past year, the Democratic-controlled legislature passed  bills with bipartisan support that would allow Virginia&#8217;s two largest utilities to recover from ratepayers the pre-construction costs to bring an SMR online.</span></p>

Glenn Younkin speaks during at Dominion&#8217;s North Anna Power Station. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Republican spokesperson Garren Shipley reiterated to the Mercury leading stances from GOP lawmakers this past session: that solar and wind can’t provide enough electricity on its own. Shipley also noted that Germany&#8217;s decommissioning of nuclear power plants was met with reactivating coal plants, though those are now being again shut down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reliability is a major concern for any system that relies on wind and solar for their baseload power,” Shipley said. “Energy demand doesn’t stop when the wind calms or the sun goes down.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Democrats have supported a diverse energy mix that includes nuclear, including Del. Alfonso Lopez, D-Arlington.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But…there are significant problems with SMRs” he said, pointing to costs and waste, when discussing a failed </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB741" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Del. Israel O’Quinn, R-Washington. The bill would’ve changed approval of the technology to a streamlined Virginia Department of Environmental Quality process instead of at the SCC level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lopez also pointed out that “…we don&#8217;t have a solution for spent fuel rods,” acknowledging that waste from the existing, traditional nuclear power station at North Anna can be stored at that location, but Yucca Mountain isn’t available. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You&#8217;re talking about SMRs dotted across the Commonwealth in a perfect world…that&#8217;s got significant unintended consequences, in terms of drinking water, clean water, and what do you do with the spent fuel rods?”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virginia congressional representatives support federal funding</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enacting parts of Project 2025’s energy chapter and Trump’s stance on energy would require action from Congress. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump repeatedly urged the country to “drill baby drill” for more oil during his campaign, and made </span><a href="https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-speech-political-rally-chesapeake-virginia-june-28-2024/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statements </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in a Chesapeake </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/28/trump-rallies-in-chesapeake-backed-by-virginia-governor-gop-leaders/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rally </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that correlated offshore wind with whale deaths, though scientists attribute other reasons for the fatalities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic Sen. Mark Warner, in the minority of the incoming Senate, supports federal funding sources for clean energy, like the IRA signed by President Joe Biden.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the things you’ve got to give the Biden administration credit on is the IRA funding, whether it&#8217;s battery technology, or whether it is solar panels,” Warner said during a press briefing. “Most of that has gone to states that voted, in many cases overwhelming for President Trump. You’re going to shut down those manufacturing facilities?”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/18/how-would-project-2025s-energy-implications-manifest-in-virginia/img_0458/" rel="attachment wp-att-40871"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40871" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_0458-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_0458-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_0458-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_0458-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_0458-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_0458-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_0458-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, a newly-re-elected Republican representing the Virginia Beach area where Dominion Energy is building the nation’s largest offshore wind farm, couldn’t be reached for comment, but earlier this year, she signed on to a </span><a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/4815990-mike-johnson-ira-clean-energy-tax-credits/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sent to Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana, urging him not to repeal tax credits in the IRA, which have gone to </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2024/07/09/south-korean-company-plans-to-build-681-million-offshore-wind-submarine-cable-plant-in-chesapeake/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">businesses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in her district. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warner, a proponent of nuclear power generation, said not pursuing offshore wind power generation as carbon-free source “would be a mistake.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Think about the manufacturing components that go into offshore wind, we can be the country&#8217;s leader,” Warner said. “This is where the future of energy in the world is headed, and we need to have American competitors and American players in that sector.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">State level impact</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A press secretary for Gov. Glenn Youngkin declined to comment on the administration&#8217;s support for Project 2025’s energyplan or any policy proposals that may be introduced in the upcoming legislative session that align with it or Trump’s energy stances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin has pushed for re-evaluations of the Virginia Clean Economy Act, a 2020 law seeking to decarbonize the grid by mid-century, and promoted both a proposed natural gas facility and Dominion’s Offshore Wind farm to meet energy demands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Energy Director Glenn Davis, a former Republican legislator who was appointed by Youngkin to his current position, said in an interview he expects to see a “resurgence of </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/19/youngkin-joins-energy-choice-coalition-with-other-republican-governors/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">choice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for people’s energy supply.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Additionally, I think you&#8217;re going to see a focus on ensuring that we have an All-of-the-Above policy,” Davis said. “I think it&#8217;ll be more of a focus on data and in reality, as opposed to a feel good scenario.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But with Democrats in control of the state legislature, the impacts of the chapter and Trump’s federal agenda becoming a reality may be difficult to weather in Virginia.  Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, a patron of the VCEA, previously said he sees “</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/11/sen-marsden-to-host-summit-on-virginia-clean-economy-act-next-week/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">no reason</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” to stray away from the goals of the law.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_15244" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1920px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/sullivan-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-15244"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-15244" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sullivan-2-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1280" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sullivan-2-scaled.jpg 1920w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sullivan-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sullivan-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sullivan-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sullivan-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sullivan-2-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sullivan-2-696x464.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sullivan-2-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sullivan-2-630x420.jpg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Del.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some environmental advocates and a conservative policy group see the VCEA as a roadblock to Project 2025’s energy chapter being implemented in the commonwealth — but for different reasons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia has already committed to decarbonization — for example through the Virginia Clean Economy Act that requires our major utilities to be carbon free by 2045 or 2050 with limited exception,” said Nate Benforado, a senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center. He added Virginia also has the “Virginia Environmental Justice Act on the books” to make sure the state is “protecting environmental justice and fenceline communities.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steve Haner, a senior fellow for environment and energy policy at the Thomas Jefferson Institute for Public Policy, stated in a recent </span><a href="https://www.thomasjeffersoninst.org/trumps-energy-promises-face-hurdles-in-anti-hydrocarbon-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Dominion’s Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project that is set to be complete in 2026 would “likely retain” IRA benefits, because removing them “greatly increase the ultimate cost to consumers for building and maintaining the turbines.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the VCEA mandates will continue the transition to renewable sources, increasing costs to ratepayers, Haner added. Despite </span><a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/wind-solar-levelized-cost-electricity-drop/730533/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reports </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">of the </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/pdf/electricity_generation.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cost </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">of renewable energy decreasing, Hanerr said natural gas still looks “attractive,” with solar and onshore wind as “reasonable choices” that have limited use.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ultimately, Virginia’s voters need to demand a change in direction in Richmond to match the return to sanity in Washington,” Haner wrote.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin said in a press briefing Thursday afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor provided an update on the state’s continued recovery from the storm, which hit Virginia Sept. 27 and caused serious damage to Southwest Virginia, with the New River rising to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/08/hurricane-helene-flooded-the-radford-army-ammunition-plant-releasing-chemicals-into-the-new-river/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">31 feet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in one location and three people left dead. Youngkin also shared the state’s difficulty in getting in touch with storm survivors who need assistance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oftentimes there is an interaction necessary, and that interaction sometimes is around the fact that there are elements that people have filed for that don’t qualify for individual assistance,” Youngkin said. “Sometimes we just need to speak with people and let them know that so that they can get their application correct.” </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40858" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/20241114_155822/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40858" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20241114_155822-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1430" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20241114_155822-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20241114_155822-300x168.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20241114_155822-1024x572.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20241114_155822-768x429.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20241114_155822-1536x858.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20241114_155822-2048x1144.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin speaks with reporters on Hurricane Helene recovery efforts. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One example of a request that isn’t eligible for recovery funding is the cost of food in a refrigerator that was lost, Youngkin said. Insurance payments that exceed what the Federal Emergency Management Agency aid would cover also nixes federal assistance. Sometimes officials just need more information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you’re getting a phone call from a 202 number, which is (the area code for) Northern Virginia, Washington D.C. area, and you keep hitting no, chances are it could be an inspector that&#8217;s trying to call you or an applicant service assistant that’s trying to help you get your registration complete,” said FEMA Federal Coordinating Officer Timothy Phiel. “If you get a letter, consider that an invitation to come back to our (disaster recovery center). Please come back and see us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state has eight disaster recovery centers set up to help with the ongoing response to Helene, which also caused power outages for Appalachian Power customers that peaked at about 282,000 and roadways like </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/22/federal-government-sends-virginia-10-million-for-route-58-repair-after-hurricane-helene-washout/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Route 58</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be washed away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 10,000 applications for individual assistance have been filed with about $10.5 million paid out already, Youngkin said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thirty six localities have been approved for public assistance, which offsets the costs for emergency responses and cleanup, Youngkin said. Roanoke County is working to be added to that list. Some 93 applications for public assistance have been received, with 19 approved and $20 million already disbursed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 270 farmers have been helped through Farm Recovery Centers, which were set up to help with what the Virginia Cooperative Extension said was over $159 million of </span><a href="https://news.vt.edu/articles/2024/10/cals-vce-final-hurricane-estimate.html#:~:text=Almost%20a%20month%20after%20the,agents%20working%20across%2021%20localities." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">damage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to agricultural producers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personal </span><a href="https://www.vaemergency.gov/recover/hurricane-helene" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">debris </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">will be removed from seven counties starting next week, Youngkin added. Claytor Lake remains a priority; so far, about 10% of the debris has been pulled out of it. The state has received $59 million for flood mitigation and hazard mitigation projects to “prevent future damage from future emergencies,” Youngkin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The aggregate damage from the storm is still to be totaled, Youngkin said. The figure will be shared with the White House and Congress next week to spur additional funding from the Small Business Administration, the Housing and Urban Development and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Called the Virginia Grid Innovation Summit, Google and Virginia Energy led the summit with speeches from Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, Virginia Energy Director Glenn Davis, Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, and a representative of Dominion Energy, with several energy-related companies and nonprofits in attendance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a spokesperson for Google, the summit was closed to the public to allow attendees to speak in “candor” and “have a more in depth conversation.” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What the summit covered</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuesday’s summit was the latest gathering of energy industry professionals talking about data center growth in the state. Past events include the Virginia Clean Energy Summit, a Loudoun County Chamber of Commerce </span><a href="https://www.loudounnow.com/news/industry-leaders-talk-innovative-energy-solutions-at-chamber-forum/article_f5f0bfe2-96f8-11ef-9bc1-7f5c97364b25.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">event</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and next week, Sen. Dave Marsden, D-Fairfax, will convene the Virginia Clean Economy Act </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/11/sen-marsden-to-host-summit-on-virginia-clean-economy-act-next-week/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With support from the Virginia Department of Energy, these industry leaders have come together to collaborate on a broad set of cutting edge solutions which will further cement Virginia’s legacy as a global technology hub and continue to power Virginia forward,” said Gary Demasi, global director of data center energy and location strategy at Google, in a news release.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Participants discussed different types of energy that could be used to supply power for data centers, including SMRs, hydroelectricity and battery storage, according to attendees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data centers are the warehouses storing computers processing the internet and about 70% of those existing in the world are located in Virginia. Continued development of data centers is expected to more than double peak electricity needs in Dominion’s service territory, from 22 gigawatts this year to 45 megawatts by 2039. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The additional amounts of renewable, nuclear and natural gas electricity generation facilities Dominion is proposing to meet the expected 5.5% annual load growth during that time frame could lead to electric bills for a typical residential customer using 1,000 kilowatts of energy to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/16/dominion-pushes-for-renewables-more-natural-gas-in-latest-long-term-plan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from about $142.77 to $214.24 per month by the end of 2039.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google previously announced a $1 billion </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/28/virginia-explained-data-center-expansion-with-all-its-challenges-and-benefits/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">investment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the state earlier this year to expand its data center campuses. Amazon and Dominion Energy announced a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/17/amazon-announces-deal-with-dominion-energy-to-develop-a-small-nuclear-reactor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">deal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last month to develop a small modular reactor, or SMR, to meet energy needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Growth in power demand presents a tremendous opportunity to evolve a stronger, more reliable energy system – these investments will both support Virginia’s economy and strengthen our country’s national security,” said Davis, with Virginia Energy, in the news release. “No one entity can tackle this challenge on their own, so bringing everyone to the table is a critical step towards developing the right portfolio of solutions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion Energy, according to the news release, spoke about grid-enhancing technologies, or GET’s, which are ways to upgrade existing transmission lines to deliver more electricity without building new lines across communities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the end of last year, the utility had added or replaced 800 miles of transmission lines with advanced conductor technology, giving those cables an ability to carry </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Dominion-GET-fact-sheet.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">50% more electricity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion is also deploying dynamic line rate technology for about 27 lines in the Northern Virginia region, where data centers in the state are largely concentrated, to optimize how much electricity can be carried in different climate conditions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve been a leading pioneer on grid enhancing technologies for many years, including advanced conductors, and we continue deploying the latest innovations to enhance reliability and bring more clean energy on the grid,” said Ed Baine, President of Dominion Energy Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google also announced Tuesday that it will contribute $250,000 to the Virginia Energy Efficiency Council’s effort to train workers on energy efficiency, which is the idea of sealing up homes and upgrading appliances to require less electricity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Called the </span><a href="https://vaeec.org/programs/workforce/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Energy Efficiency Workforce Initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the VEEC began the effort two years ago when a signature component of President Joe Biden’s landmark climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, included tax breaks for the installation of modern heat pumps instead of older HVAC technologies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EEWI has teamed up with Community Housing Partners and expects to help 24 workers in the Central and Northern Virginia regions achieve by the end of the year state certification to make weatherization upgrades by the end of the year.  Their work will make homes more energy efficient by improving roofs, insulation and windows. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The funding from Google will also allow the VAEEC to offer energy efficiency training for other skilled trades, like electricians and plumbers, and expand their weatherization training statewide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Google’s support for energy efficiency job training comes at a critical time as we ramp up to meet the growing demand for these jobs,” said Chelsea Harnish, Executive Director of the Virginia Energy Efficiency Council. “Allowing the Council to expand our programs statewide will make a tremendous difference in helping the Commonwealth train and certify the needed energy efficiency workforce of the future.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next month, the state’s Joint Legislative Audit Review Commission is expected to release a wide range of policy recommendations concerning energy, water and land use needs for data centers.</span></p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note:</em> This story was updated to correct that the Energy Efficiency Workforce Initiative will help workers in the Central and Northern Virginia regions of the state by the end of the year.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Since DEQ&#8217;s permits are not filed by industry type (i.e., factory or data center), it is very time consuming to locate and pull permits for each data center when they are requested,” said Irina Calos, a spokeswoman for DEQ. “Furthermore, these permits are too large to send through email, necessitating the use of a large file transfer program to send. By placing these permits on our website, we are able to ameliorate these hurdles.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The webpage comes after other transparency initiatives have been introduced under DEQ Director Mike Rolband, including the creation of the Permit Enhancement and Evaluation Platform, or </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/virginia-launches-platform-to-make-environmental-permit-info-public/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PEEP</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a precursor of the Virginia Permitting Transparency </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/25/youngkin-unveils-new-permit-transparency-website/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">platform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DEQ has come under increasing scrutiny as data centers, the warehouses storing computers that process internet activity, proliferate in Virginia and present unprecedented energy and water demands. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emissions from diesel generators have become a big part of the discussion on data center development, with DEQ last year considering a variance to reduce pollution requirements on the generators in light of electricity transmission delays. The request was </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/department-of-environmental-quality-withdraws-proposed-variance-for-data-centers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">withdrawn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with a solution identified between the industry and the regional grid operator.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This past legislative session, Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, and Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, introduced </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB116" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would’ve banned the use of diesel for onsite power generation in order to receive the tax credits the state is deploying to lure in more data centers. Both measures failed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concerns over diesel generators stem from the tiny particulate matter in their emissions. The American Medical Association found that long-term exposure to PM 2.5 was linked with </span><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2801820" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increased risk of heart issues</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in California.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noise from data centers is also part of the discussion. Sen. Danica Roem, D-Prince William, introduced a bill intended to control how loud facilities are and prevent </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB288" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">generators</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from running 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/news/board-supervisors-approve-new-data-center-zoning-ordinance-amendment#:~:text=Equipment%20such%20as%20back%2Dup,allowed%20with%20special%20exception%20approval." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">September</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Fairfax County passed an ordinance to limit the noise from data centers, including requiring that “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">back-up generators must be 300 feet from the lot line of residential property or separated from the lot line of a residential district or residential property by the data center building.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The DEQ webpage lists 177 air permits as of Nov. 12. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An analysis by the Virginia Mercury found that 155 are in the northern region of the state, with 16 in the Piedmont, and two each in the Valley, Southwest and Tidewater regions. Loudoun County has 85 permits, with Fairfax County having 34 and Prince William County having 26. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon facilities make up 42 of the permits, and Microsoft has 14. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The oldest air </span><a href="https://www.deq.virginia.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/25698/638628519198400000" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">permit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> dates back to Nov. 22, 2000 for the “RREEF America REIT II Corp. VVV,” data center in Fairfax County. The air </span><a href="https://www.deq.virginia.gov/home/sho" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">permit </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">for the Hayden Data Center in Loudoun County lists over 150 diesel generators. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Permits are not issued if a facility would cause emission exceedances above state and federal air quality limits, Calos said, and require onsite inspections to view records. A majority of the permits issued are Minor New Source Review, or mNSR ones, instead of State Operating Permits, or SOPs, which are for smaller facilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As data centers have increased in size, mNSR permits have been issued more frequently, as they allow for new controls and emissions limits,” said Calos. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Piedmont Environmental Council, a nonprofit focused on preserving the Piedmont region’s rural landscapes, has a </span><a href="https://www.pecva.org/uncategorized/data-centers-diesel-generators-and-air-quality-pec-web-map/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">map</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of air permits for data centers last updated in 2023. The group lauded the creation of DEQ’s website so, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">reporters, academics, and other nonprofits no longer need to repeatedly request this information through Freedom of Information Act requests.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are over 12 gigawatts worth of capacity in these permits with the vast majority consolidated in the relatively small and highly populated area of northern Virginia,” said Julie Bolthouse, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">director of land use</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at PEC. “What is the total amount of additional pollution if all were to operate on an emergency basis during an ozone </span><a href="https://www.deq.virginia.gov/our-programs/air/monitoring-assessments/air-quality-forecast#:~:text=An%20exceedance%20occurs%20when%20an,Kristen%20Stumpf%2C%20or%20Mike%20Kiss." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">alert</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> period and what would be the public health impact? We deserve to know this basic information.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Josh Levi, president of the Data Center Coalition that represents members of the industry, said diesel generators “typically operate infrequently and under limited conditions, including during manufacturer-specified testing and maintenance activities.” The generators are needed, Levi said, in order to ensure companies can provide “uninterrupted operations and provide essential connectivity and data flow to their customers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Data centers are actively evaluating alternatives that can provide similar reliability, fuel availability, siting flexibility, and workplace safety protections,” Levi said. “As an interim measure, many data centers are looking to low-carbon fuel alternatives, including </span><a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/renewable-diesel" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">renewable diesel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where available.”</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Transportation announced the next round of recipients to receive federal funding to build electric vehicle charging stations along interstates and state highways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The awardings, presented by VDOT to the Commonwealth Transportation Board at its Oct. 22 </span><a href="https://ctb.virginia.gov/media/ctb/agendas-and-meeting-minutes/2024/oct/14-nevi-phase-1b-ctb.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">meeting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, total about $22 million for chargers at 35 different locations from 19 different applicants, six of which are the recipients for more than one location. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The funding comes from the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Program, which is part of the bipartisan Infrastructure and Jobs Act and which awarded Virginia </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/09/21/what-virginia-wants-to-do-with-100-million-in-electric-vehicle-charging-money/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$106 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for electric vehicle charging stations built over a five-year period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stations will be fast-charging with at least four ports, built within federally-designated “alternative fuel corridors” alongside interstate and highways, and be located within a 50-mile distance from the next charger.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The buildout of the electric vehicle charging stations is seen as critical to the adoption of electric vehicles to reduce climate changing emissions from tailpipes. In Virginia and the rest of the country, about one-third of planet-warming gasses come from the transportation sector.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as drivers have concerns over how far they can drive electric vehicles within the current charging station network, particularly in rural areas, automakers have scaled back pledges to transition fleet offerings from gas to fully electric cars. Some Republican politicians,, including Gov. Glenn Youngkin, have scaled </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/16/virginia-businesses-weigh-benefits-of-electrification-as-leaders-review-policies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">back</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Democratic desires to require new car sales be electric starting in 2035.</span></p>

The latest funding round expands EV charging options along interstates and adds new locations on state highways. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among them are six stations along Interstate 64, one on Interstate 66, two along Interstate 77, two along Interstate 81, one on Interstate 85 and three along Interstate 95. On the state highway front, six are proposed for Route 17, two for Route 23, six for Route 29 and five for Route 460.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest charging stations are proposed for a variety of location types, including 63% at convenience stores and gas stations and travel centers, 17% at hotels and motels, 11% at dining and shopping/grocery stores and 9% at “new construction or other” locations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A mix of electric vehicle charging station developers and gas stations, like Wawa, are among the recipients. The average award is about $647,657 with applicants providing an average match amount of about 36% of the total project cost. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed awards are subject to environmental reviews, an applicant’s desire to continue, site host agreements and other factors before coming online, but VDOT officials presented to the CTB a timeline of issuing notices to proceed between March and May of next year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/23/in-va-electric-vehicle-infrastructure-development-is-underway-incentives-could-spur-growth/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">summer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, VDOT officials told The Mercury that the charging station build-out was expected to be completed within two years of when a notice to proceed is issued. But supply chain issues around transformers, which are needed to deliver power from the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/02/virginias-electric-vehicle-transition-depends-on-the-power-grid-how-is-it-faring/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">grid</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to specific locations, added a six to 18- month delay on the completion of projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the first charger for the initial round of stations is expected to be in use by the end of this year, installation of chargers from this second round of funding could begin next year and extend into 2026. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VDOT is planning to use future NEVI funds to meet the every 50-mile requirement, including stations on Route 17 and Route 29 south of Warrenton and Route 460 east of Appomattox County. Remaining funds may be used for Phase 2 opportunities, including chargers for tractor-trailers.</span></p>

(Dominion Energy)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eight years ago this week, I wrote </span><a href="https://powerforthepeopleva.com/2016/11/10/why-trump-wont-stop-the-clean-energy-revolution/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a column</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> titled, “Why Trump won’t stop the clean energy revolution.” Calling global warming a hoax, businessman and reality TV star Donald J. Trump had just been elected with a promise to save coal jobs and pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Climate activists were deeply distraught then, as now. I wrote in 2016, “Reading the news Wednesday morning was like waking up from a nightmare to discover that there really </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a guy coming after you with a meat cleaver.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as I also wrote, there is only so much damage a president can do when technology, popular opinion and – especially – economics don’t support his agenda. Trump couldn’t save the coal industry (though </span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/trumps-order-on-energy-promises-coal-jobs-and-a-clean-environment-what-does-that-look-like" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">he tried</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Instead, his administration oversaw a </span><a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/us-coal-jobs-down-24-from-the-start-of-trump-administration-to-latest-quarter-61386963" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">24% decline</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in coal employment. And where coal supplied 30% of U.S. electricity in 2016, by the time Trump left office it had fallen to 20%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the intervening years, Trump seems to have lost interest in coal mining, even as he continues to embrace fossil gas production. His enthusiasm for gas fracking fits with his drill-baby-drill approach to energy, but it was also intended to win over voters </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielmarkind/2024/11/05/will-fracking-determine-the-next-president/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in Pennsylvania</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a major producer of shale gas. Ironically, the gas industry insists on calling methane “clean” precisely because burning it emits less CO2 than coal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While coal was dying, wind and solar were well on their upswing when Trump took office in 2017, and they continued to advance through his first administration. By 2020, wind and solar had become the </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-19/wind-solar-are-cheapest-power-source-in-most-places-bnef-says" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cheapest forms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of new electric generation. Today, renewable energy supplies more than 21% of the nation’s electricity, while coal’s share has dropped further, to just 16%. Trump or no Trump, technological advances and a thirst for cleaner energy continue to drive new wind and solar generation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, the offshore wind industry – famously </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/13/trump-president-agenda-climate-policy-wind-power" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reviled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Trump – wasted no time this week in congratulating its erstwhile foe on his victory and </span><a href="https://www.offshore-mag.com/special-reports/news/55240984/offshore-and-energy-industry-trade-groups-comment-on-trump-victory" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">insisting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, hilariously, that his election is a big win for the industry. The first Trump administration, they noted hopefully, “laid out the fundamental framework for our modern offshore wind industry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, okay. From their lips to Trump’s ears. Trump is hardly known for consistency, and it is not impossible to imagine him softening his position on an industry that is creating well-paying jobs for the blue-collar workers who make up a portion of his base. His Virginia acolyte, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, boasts of overseeing the building of the nation’s largest offshore wind farm. Why shouldn’t Trump pivot? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early in the Republican primaries, one candidate </span><a href="https://rollcall.com/2023/08/24/transcript-gop-presidential-hopefuls-debate-in-milwaukee/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">opined</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that all the solar panels and batteries sold in the U.S. are made in China. That wasn’t actually true. For years one U.S. company, First Solar, has ranked among the world’s top ten solar panel manufacturers. Among the domestic manufacturers of both EVs and batteries, one of the largest is Tesla, whose CEO Elon Musk is now a Trump darling. It is going to be fascinating to find out whether Musk uses his influence to benefit the clean energy transition generally, or only himself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet the notion that China dominates solar and battery production is also not wrong. China is eating our lunch on clean energy. Chinese companies produce </span><a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/solar-pv-global-supply-chains/executive-summary" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">80% of the world’s solar panels</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and more than half of its </span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/4/20/are-chinese-evs-taking-over-the-car-market#:~:text=China%20accounts%20for%20more%20than,electric%20cars%20sold%20worldwide%20today." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">electric vehicles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Sadly, perhaps, these are not cheap imitations of superior American products. They are world-leading technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chinese dominance of the world market was a major reason that President Joe Biden’s signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), put so much emphasis on supporting domestic manufacturing. Tariffs on Chinese goods, Trump’s preferred approach, help U.S. companies compete for American consumers, but they don’t support an export market when other countries produce better goods for less money. Even at home, critics note, tariffs mostly just </span><a href="https://www.bushcenter.org/catalyst/opportunity-road/rooney-tariffs-rising-prices" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raise prices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet Trump has vowed to repeal the IRA, and given that Congress passed it without Republican support, there is certainly a danger that a Republican Congress will comply. On the other hand, </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/climate/clean-energy-us-2024-election.html?searchResultPosition=1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">observers note</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that 80% of the manufacturing tax credits have gone to red states, and this August, 18 House Republicans signed a letter to Speaker Mike Johnson asking to keep the credits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t want to sound too optimistic. Wait, let me rephrase that: I don’t feel optimistic at all. We are facing headwinds today that weren’t around in 2016. At that time, gains in energy efficiency meant electricity demand was not increasing, in spite of a growing population. With wind and solar displacing coal, there was a clear pathway for CO2 emissions from the electric sector to continue falling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, however, the skyrocketing demand for electricity from data centers threatens the progress we’ve made on clean energy. It remains to be seen whether artificial intelligence will unleash efficiency gains and novel technologies that can put carbon reductions back on track. Right now, though, tech companies are so desperate for power that they will take it from wherever they can get it, and regardless of carbon content.  (I notice, though, that they still </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/11/as-virginias-scc-prepares-to-tackle-the-data-center-surge-it-can-learn-from-ohio/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">want it to be cheap</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and are </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/24/amazon-claims-to-power-all-its-operations-with-renewable-energy-if-only-that-were-true/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">happy to greenwash</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it to meet their sustainability goals). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the biggest change from eight years ago is simply that we are that much closer to reaching catastrophic climate </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/dec/06/earth-on-verge-of-five-catastrophic-tipping-points-scientists-warn" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tipping points</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. 2023 was the </span><a href="https://wmo.int/news/media-centre/climate-change-indicators-reached-record-levels-2023-wmo#:~:text=The%20WMO%20report%20confirmed%20that%202023%20was,was%20the%20warmest%20ten%2Dyear%20period%20on%20record." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">warmest year on record</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and 2024 is </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/climate/2024-temperatures-hottest-year.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on track</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to surpass it. The effects are evident in the number and costliness of severe weather and wildfires made worse by global warming. (Just ask </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/07/18/1198912918/home-insurance-rates-are-rising-due-to-climate-change-what-could-break-that-cycl" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">insurance companies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.) It is frustrating, to say the least, to contemplate losing the next four years to an administration that thinks climate change wouldn’t be an issue if we would just stop talking about it.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet Americans of all political stripes </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/08/09/what-the-data-says-about-americans-views-of-climate-change/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">continue to support</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> renewable energy by wide margins. And apart from a small minority of vocal climate deniers, most Americans want the U.S. to take stronger action on climate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This election revealed deep fault lines among the American public, but one thing we all have in common is the faith that our ability to solve intractable problems is stronger even than our tendency to wish the problems away. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why, even in the face of such serious headwinds, the clean energy revolution will continue. </span></p>

</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The landmark law Virginia passed in 2020 to decarbonize the electric grid is being tested, as energy demand from data centers surges, prompting discussions about how to meet the law’s goal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, Nov. 18, Sen. David Marsden, D-Fairfax, is hosting a </span><a href="https://files.constantcontact.com/005ceb5f201/c06272f5-4fac-4747-8e77-8e1ed319f5e4.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">summit </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in Richmond to talk about that law, the Virginia Clean Economy Act, and a wide range of related topics including economic considerations, challenges limiting local approvals for solar projects, energy efficiency, delivering energy through transmission lines and small modular nuclear reactors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The summit will be the culmination of discussions involving Marsden’s office that </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/05/foia-friday-chesterfield-foia-policy-scrutiny-king-george-data-center-park-debate/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">he said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would be exempt from Freedom of Information Act laws under a working papers exception, in order to allow for more candid conceptual discussions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re not touching the act,” said Marsden, in a previous phone interview with the Mercury. “The act itself is fine. What are the circumstances around it that have changed in four years and how do we adjust to that demand?” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Clean Economy Act, a policy passed under a Democratic trifecta control of state government, requires Virginia’s two largest utilities, Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power Company, to decarbonize the grid by 2045 and 2050, respectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the growing demand from data centers is expected to increase the electricity needs from Dominion’s current peak amount of about 22,000 megawatts to about 45,000 by 2039. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to filings at the State Corporation commission, Appalachian Power had a 2023 peak load of  about 3,200 megawatts. The utility is currently planning to add about 7,700 megawatts for large load customers, about half of which are data centers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small modular reactors, which are smaller nuclear reactors able to produce about 300 megawatts, have gained appeal because of their ability to provide baseload power without generating carbon emissions. Though one is yet to be used commercially in the United States, Amazon announced recently it would help pay for Dominion to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/17/amazon-announces-deal-with-dominion-energy-to-develop-a-small-nuclear-reactor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">develop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> one. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As SMRs potentially become viable, Marsden’s summit attendees will discuss other possible power-producing solutions, including </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/30/solar-developers-seeking-changes-to-local-siting-process-again/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">solar energy development</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some participants have previously advocated for altering the local approval process for solar projects by giving state officials the authority to override local denials, by creating a regional siting board or developing a state-level task force to support localities and regions by offering an opinion on technical guidance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We do not want to diminish local opinion, and we do not want to fail in the task of accelerating permanent approvals,” said Jay Ford, Virginia Policy Manager at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, a group that wants to see less emissions trickle down into the Bay. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There&#8217;s no doubt about it that if we&#8217;re going to hit our targets, we&#8217;ve got to accelerate utility scale solar being built out, but we have to do it in a way that doesn&#8217;t cause blowback and grind the whole thing to a halt,” Ford said in an interview after presenting the opinion idea to the Commission on Electric Utility Regulation on Thursday. “We&#8217;re trying to strike that balance right now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A major concern of localities and the farming community faced with Chesapeake Bay cleanup requirements and challenging economics: the loss of farmland to solar. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_36197" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/06/virginia-plan-projects-universal-broadband-access-by-2028/img_7178/" rel="attachment wp-att-36197"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-36197" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG_7178-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG_7178-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG_7178-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG_7178-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG_7178-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG_7178-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG_7178-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A Southside Virginia farm. (Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Greg Habeeb, a lobbyist on behalf of the Solar Energy Industries Association, Advanced Energy United and several solar developers shared numbers, told legislators at the CEUR meeting that only about 2,400, or 3%, of the 97,000 acres of prime farmland lost annually on average has been due to solar energy development, which is in line with numbers from the Department of Environmental Quality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Renewable energy is not the problem,” Habeeb said. “Other land use decisions are the problem.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s the concern over the loss of </span><a href="https://scholarscompass.vcu.edu/murp_capstone/41/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">forestland</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, said Kyle Shreeve, a lobbyist speaking on behalf of the Virginia Forestry Association, during the CEUR meeting, and “removing local land use authority makes conservation efforts much more difficult.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We think the regional planning outline, as Mr. Ford has presented, definitely has potential and could be a potential vehicle to work through some of these issues,” Shreeve said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other topics of discussion at the summit — such as increasing energy efficiency to build homes and businesses that require less energy, increasing distributed generation on the ground and more comprehensive planning  for transmission lines to deliver power across broader regions — have been proposed by environmental and energy groups.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Natural gas</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of natural gas isn’t on the summit’s agenda, but it is, but often brought up in discussions of the VCEA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result of the projected electricity demand, Dominion wants to build a natural gas plant and is planning for more, alongside a suite of renewable energy projects, to provide dispatchable reliable power to maintain the grid when solar and wind can’t. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental and ratepayer groups see that as running counter to VCEA, since natural gas facilities are required to come offline under the law unless there’s a concern over grid reliability. If that concern is present, Dominion and Appalachian Power can appeal to the State Corporation Commission regulators to keep a carbon-emitting source, like its planned natural gas plant, online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see no reason for us to give up on that very important state mandated goal,” said Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, one of the lead sponsors of the VCEA. “We can, and as far as I’m concerned, will meet that goal. I have confidence in Virginia and Virginians. When we set a goal we meet our goal.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although natural gas is not listed as a discussion topic for the summit, Glenn Davis, a former Republican legislator and now director of Virginia Energy appointed by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, said in an interview a key consideration is “getting rid of the banning of natural gas as we look forward.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The specific policies will be coming out over the next 45 days or so from the administration,” said Davis.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39170" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/05/dominion-chesterfield-county-weigh-site-suitability-for-natural-gas-plant-proposal/img_3704/" rel="attachment wp-att-39170"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-39170" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3704-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1584" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3704-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3704-300x186.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3704-1024x633.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3704-768x475.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3704-1536x950.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3704-2048x1267.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  The former coal-fired Chesterfield Power Station at Coxendale Road. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion has acknowledged the challenge of being able to provide power through solar, given recent analysis that gave it a lower effective load carrying capacity, meaning solar produces less power than previously thought. The utility is relying on the provision in the VCEA that allows for carbon emitting sources to stay online if need be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re quite confident that we will make that case, but it will be up to the State Corporation Commission to decide that,“ Dominion Energy chair, president and CEO Bob Blue said in a recent interview with reporters about its long-term plan, called an integrated resource plan, which increases natural gas usage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a company that complies with the law. We are doing that in this integrated resource plan. We’re going to do that moving forward,” Blue said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appalachian Power, in a statement, said it “will continue to work with regulators, developers, localities and other interested parties to meet the Virginia Clean Economy Act requirements.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are committed to meeting those requirements without compromising the reliability, affordability, or security of the electric power system,” said spokesperson George Porter.</span></p>

(Image courtesy of Chris Finley/BAE Systems)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/27/one-dead-five-va-communities-under-voluntary-evacuation-order-from-tropical-depression-helene/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Sept. 27, Hurricane Helene wreaked havoc on the Southwest Virginia region, including flooding the Radford Army Ammunition Plant and causing the release of chemicals in the New River, according to the plant and the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a spokesperson for the Radford Army Ammunition Plant, the facility “experienced significant flooding due to Hurricane Helene,” when the nearby New River crested at 31 feet the day after the storm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Due to areas of the plant being submerged, we’ve now identified the potential release of calcium sulfate and petroleum into the waterway and disclosed such instances to DEQ,” said Laura McLaughlin, a spokesperson for BAE Systems, the company that operates the plant, in an Oct. 26 email to the Mercury. “However, at this time, we do not believe there is a risk to public health or wildlife.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a pollution </span><a href="https://portal.deq.virginia.gov/prep/prepReport/315991" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filed with the DEQ, as of Monday, the “total confirmed release estimate” of dibutyl phthalate —a liquid plasticizer that is also found in nail polish, hair spray and raincoats — “is now 225 gallons,” stored in tote containers at the plant that were carried away by the river.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The flooding event came as the plant seeks a </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1073679164283740/?ref=newsfeed" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">variance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to accept and recycle acid waste, in lieu of acid RAAP already buys and uses. The move has prompted environmental groups to say the plant isn’t being fully transparent with the community and skirting stringent regulations, and is at risk for future flooding events.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If they provided more information, we would be able to understand it on a deeper level,” said Alyssa Carpenter, with the Citizens for Arsenal Accountability, which wants the request denied, or the process restarted with more information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But that doesn&#8217;t mean that it&#8217;s going to alleviate our concerns, because it&#8217;s hazardous waste,” said Carpenter, who had her thyroid removed after years of living near the plants and is “still seeing doctors.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The plant</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Radford Army Ammunition Plant, or RAAP, has been in Radford, a half hour from Roanoke, since 1940, manufacturing propellants for the U.S. Army munitions and rockets under a contract with the U.S. Department of Defense. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the years, the plant has come under scrutiny for its discarding of waste through open burning, which releases  pollutants in the air. Two years ago, the Citizens for Arsenal Accountability produced a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/10/11/citizen-group-pushes-for-halt-to-open-burning-at-radford-army-ammunition-plant/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> outlining the concern.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The flooding</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The flooding led to the release of potentially up to 127,500 pounds of calcium </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0095.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sulfate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wastewater and up to 700 gallons of diesel, said Justine Barati, chief of public and congressional affairs at Joint Munitions Command. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The release of DPB came from four containers found in the area after 13, each holding 275 gallons for a total storage of 3,575 gallons of DPB, were “lifted up and carried away” from the plant, Barati explained. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The search for the other nine totes is ongoing, and “includes surveillance by helicopter, drone and watercraft extending all the way to the Bluestone Dam in West Virginia,” according the pollution report.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the chemical releases, Barati said, “public health was not jeopardized, and there were no observed impacts to the environment.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tristen Franklin, a spokesperson for the Virginia Department of Health Office of Drinking Water, said, “there are no intakes in the New River downstream of RAAP,” Franklin said, meaning, “nothing released into the New River from the RAAP would have entered any Virginia waterworks or been received by their customers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is no concern that those chemicals (Calcium Sulfate, petroleum, DBP) released by RAAP are in any Virginia residents&#8217; drinking water,” Franklin said.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Preparation</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ahead of the flooding, the plant moved 14 tractor trailers of material to higher ground, Barati said, and prioritized work, which meant, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the potential impact to employee safety and the environment was greatly reduced.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The containers’ movement “was unexpected, but so was the size of the flood,” Barati said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the flooding, the plant began coordinating with DEQ, the National Response Center, the Department of the Army and local first responders, Barati said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Oct. 26 email from McLaughlin, the BAE Systems spokeswoman, she said, “We are happy to report that all of our employees are safely back at work on site.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Variance request</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As RAAP continues to operate now after the flooding, the plant is seeking a variance to the Virginia </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/admincode/title9/agency20/chapter60/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hazardous Waste Management Regulations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to accept and recycle acid waste, while still following the </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-resource-conservation-and-recovery-act" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resource Conservation and Recovery Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and complying with their air permit, according to DEQ. The plant is asking permission to receive up to 18 million pounds of nitric acid and 9 million pounds of sulfuric acid annually, said Julie Raimondi, a DEQ spokeswoman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal is for 100% of the accepted product to be reused, resulting in a “net environmental benefit,” Raimondi said, by requiring less raw material and eliminating hazardous waste. Barati added the plant would “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">not be taking on more acid than we otherwise do,” has “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">significant and strict controls in place.&#8221; The plant hasn’t heard from DEQ they’re lacking any information, Barati said, and is working on &#8220;modernization projects&#8221; for future flooding, but those &#8220;need to be presented to Army leadership, Department of Defense leadership, and Members of Congress for approval before being announced to the public.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The acid we would accept through this variance request would be in place of acid we would buy through other suppliers, not in addition,” Barati said. “This is an opportunity to re-use a product that is otherwise going to be wasted in a process that we are already currently performing here on the plant.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Thien Chau, a senior associate attorney with Earthjustice, an environmental advocacy law group working with Citizens for Arsenal Accountability, said there’s a lack of information in the request for the community to review, including a “consideration of potential cumulative risks from other nearby potential stressors,” as required by the </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/admincode/title9/agency20/chapter60/section1390/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">regulations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the controls that would be put in place, Chau said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Communities just shouldn&#8217;t be poisoned at all, let alone at the hands of their own government,” Chau said. “The problem we have here is that DEQ wants to grant the arsenal this variance without themselves having the information they need to determine if it&#8217;s going to be protective of human health and the environment, as it&#8217;s DEQ&#8217;s obligation to do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RAAP made their variance request before the flooding happened, which “sort of changes the situation based on what risks that poses to us as a community,” Carpenter said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A public comment period will be open until Nov. 25. A community </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1073679164283740/?ref=newsfeed" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">meeting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the variance request was scheduled for 6:30 p.m. at the Christiansburg Public Library Thursday night. </span></p>

(izanbar/Getty Images) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members of the congressional delegation from Virginia would like to see the Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act, or Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, reauthorized when it ends in less than two years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The BIL has fueled internet access </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/virginia-nets-almost-1-5-billion-in-federal-broadband-funds/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expansion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and funded several transportation and environmental projects in Virginia, including financially supporting the Long Bridge Project&#8217;s expansion and cleanup efforts at abandoned mine lands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law expires on Sept. 30, 2026, leaving a reshaped Congress and new presidential administration to consider its reauthorization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3684" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the BIL</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was signed into law on Nov. 15, 2021, authorizing $1.2 trillion for transportation and infrastructure spending with $550 billion targeted for “new” investments and programs over six years, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have just entered the fourth fiscal year out of a five-year package, so it&#8217;s not too soon to be talking about what comes next,” said Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg to the media during the Oct. 15 groundbreaking of the Long Bridge Project in Arlington. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we&#8217;ve had in this bipartisan infrastructure package is a level of investment that we&#8217;ve not had in my lifetime, clearly very much needed, especially when you talk about a 100 year-old asset like Long Bridge and thousands of cases like that around the country,” he added. “So we need to, I think, take all of the successes and learn from the experiences of the last few years, and it will very much be one of the biggest things on Congress’ plate in just about a year from now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the groundbreaking ceremony, lawmakers laid out how the act has helped and advocated for the law to be reauthorized.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger, D-Prince William, said the Long Bridge expansion was an example of how the law continues to impact Virginians and “makes good on the promise of investing in our communities.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, said reauthorizing the law would help address some unmet needs for rail, highways and airports in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If we just keep all the folks who voted for it last time and add in all the members of Congress who didn&#8217;t vote for it, but have shown up in ribbon cuttings across the country during the last five years, we&#8217;ll have an 85% passage,” Warner said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is also a catch-up for crumbling infrastructure that was allowed to languish and be neglected for a long time,” said Congressman Gerry Connolly, D-Fairfax.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some lawmakers have had a change of heart concerning BIL. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, had voted against the policy, initially </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=402544" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criticizing </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">how much of it was new spending or just reauthorizations of approved funding. Yet, he touted his role in securing a $1.6 million federal grant benefitting the Piedmont Planning District’s Commission’s Route 122 Regional Corridor Plan, which was funded under the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griffith explained the contradiction by saying “&#8230;once it’s passed into law, I would be failing to do my job if I didn’t then advocate for those federal monies to come to the 9th District,” in a September interview with the Mercury about his </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/27/in-the-fightin-ninth-baker-seeks-to-end-griffiths-13-year-tenure/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">campaign</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for re-election in the Southwest Virginia-based district.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Transportation </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers and industry leaders in transportation are excited about the future of public transit after millions in BIL federal funding have been dedicated to projects across the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Danny Plaugher, executive director for Virginians for High-Speed Rail, said the federal government’s $16 billion investment nationwide for rail is making a “huge difference,” eclipsing an earlier record of $2 billion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October, Virginia celebrated the groundbreaking of the Long Bridge expansion project after the commonwealth was awarded $729 million. Once completed, the bridge that connects Washington D.C. and Virginia, will allow for more freight and passenger rail service separation. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_21533" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1413px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2020/09/14/long-bridge-rail-project-barrels-full-speed-ahead/long-bridge/" rel="attachment wp-att-21533"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-21533" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Long-Bridge.jpg" alt="" width="1413" height="963" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Long-Bridge.jpg 1413w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Long-Bridge-300x204.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Long-Bridge-1024x698.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Long-Bridge-768x523.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Long-Bridge-218x150.jpg 218w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Long-Bridge-696x474.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Long-Bridge-1068x728.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Long-Bridge-616x420.jpg 616w" sizes="(max-width: 1413px) 100vw, 1413px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  The Long Bridge rail crossing over the Potomac River. (Washington D.C. Department of Transportation/ Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current two-track system, widely considered a choke point, has negatively impacted travel times. The plans include expanding to a four-track corridor and constructing approximately 1.8 miles of improvements to rail and pedestrian bridges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plaugher said the two largest federal investments for rail before the Act were $74 million in 2009 and $100 million for the Franconia-Springfield Bypass last year. The bypass is an elevated rail bridge south of the Franconia-Springfield station that separates passenger trains from the existing freight tracks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, across rail and transit services, Plaugher said Virginia has aggressively sought grants for bridge repairs, rail improvement, and safety projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Both the railway and transit side have been very aggressive in pursuing opportunities for those competitive grants, and we have also been very successful,” Plaugher said. “And so I think we should be proud of our elected and appointed leaders for ensuring that Virginia gets its fair share, and that good things are happening.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to USDOT, Virginia is expected to receive $1.2 billion under the law to improve its public transportation options.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other investments for Virginia include approximately $386 million for infrastructure development for airports, about $106 million per year over five years to support the expansion of an electric vehicle charging network in the commonwealth, and along with grant opportunities, earn a portion of $2.5 billion.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Energy &amp; environment</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation had a significant impact on environmental issues as well, and is assisting the commonwealth in tackling outdated pipes, supporting electric grid programs and cleaning up abandoned mine lands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with the release of incremental amounts of funding for Virginia to upgrade water and gas infrastructure, the BIL provided over $50 million in October to replace those lines in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-protects-communities-lead-drinking-water-announces-more-35" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $35.1 million is headed to Virginia to replace lead drinking water pipes, in line with an administrative rule to identify and replace those lines across the country within 10 years. The announcement comes after the EPA awarded $94 million to Virginia in </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-94-million-virginia-drinking-water-wastewater" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">February</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to upgrade drinking water, and wastewater and stormwater infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About $15.7 million out of the U.S Department of Transportation&#8217;s Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration, or PHMSA, is going toward </span><a href="https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/sites/phmsa.dot.gov/files/2024-10/FY%202024%20NGDISM%20Grants%20Report.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">replacing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 13.25 miles of aging gas mains with polyethylene and cathodically protected steel coated lines in Richmond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although environmentalists are critical of maintaining fossil fuel infrastructure, PHMSA said the funding will reduce 22.26 metric tons of methane, the most potent climate change causing greenhouse gas, annually by eliminating leaks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data centers, the energy intensive warehouses storing internet processors, are proliferating in Virginia, prompting electricity generation sources to be built, including  natural gas-run facilities. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while doling out almost $400,000 to the city of Norfolk for its </span><a href="https://www.norfolk.gov/5282/Norfolk-Coastal-Storm-Risk-Management-CS" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coastal Storm Risk Management</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> project, including a floodwall planned to deal with increasing storm surges the state is facing, the BIL also supercharged the Virginia Energy department’s effort to clean up abandoned mine lands, or AMLs in Southwest Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Energy had received about $3 million to $4 million annually since 1981 to clean up mine lands, but the BIL increased the coffers by $23 million over the next 15 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The AML program exists to clean up mine lands coal companies left unreclaimed, or remediated, before the 1977 Surface Mine Reclamation Act, which now requires sites to be reclaimed, meaning returned to their natural states or revamped for future economic opportunities. Dangers, such as a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/01/bipartisan-infrastructure-law-aiding-virginia-energys-abandoned-mine-cleanup/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">landslide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Dickenson County, can result from improper irrigation at AMLs if reclamation doesn&#8217;t happen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The increased funding is </span><a href="https://www.energy.virginia.gov/public/documents/newsroom/2024/Press_Release_DOI%20Announces%20$22%20MIll%20for%20VA%20AML%20BIL%20funding%2020240325.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expected</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to allow Virginia Energy to reclaim 70% of its inventory of abandoned mines it has found since 1981. That’ll lead to the creation of more than 1,000 jobs, the agency said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Congress considers reauthorizing the law, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia, predicted his colleagues could debate turning the act into a longer term investment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Six years is going to prove to the American public, and I hope to Congress, of course it&#8217;s worthwhile,” Kaine said. “So my prediction is when we have the reauthorization vote, it&#8217;s going to be by a bigger margin than the first one.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it’s not just this year. Weather records show that since 1980, Virginia has been hit with more than 100 extreme weather events that cost our state </span><a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/state-summary/VA" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over $1 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In that time period, the records show that the annual average of billion-dollar weather events in Virginia has tripled just in the last five years. Floods, freezes, and — for the last two years, in particular — extreme drought have all wreaked havoc on our agriculture industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This trend is no surprise to Virginia’s farmers. We live by the weather, and science doesn’t care what you believe. Our weather is, in fact, getting warmer and weirder every year. While we’ve always understood that our success at making a living by farming is dependent on favorable weather, we didn’t start out farming knowing how rapidly the climate would change and how devastating those impacts would be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve already seen how increases in average annual temperatures are impacting planting and growing seasons. </span><a href="https://crops.extension.iastate.edu/encyclopedia/corn-pollination-effect-high-temperature-and-stress" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows that corn silks and pollen die when temperatures exceed the mid 90’s. Our farm in the Shenandoah Valley is now in USDA plant </span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/climate-change-is-shifting-plant-growth-zones-heres-what-to-know-for-your-garden-this-year" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">zone 7</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; in 1990 we were in zone 6. Our Southwest Virginia farmers suffered catastrophic flooding while farmers in the Shenandoah Valley experienced extreme drought – for two years in a row.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the extreme weather trends have intensified at alarming rates in recent years, we have long known the identity of the primary culprit that is accelerating the pace of climate change: greenhouse gas emissions from our electricity and transportation sectors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We had a sound tool in place to more intentionally and meaningfully address power plant emissions, as designated by law. That tool was the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), which the administration of Gov. Glenn Youngkin single-handedly did away with earlier this year. Before he ended it, it was working. In the first two years of being in RGGI, Virginia’s power plant emissions fell </span><a href="https://campd.epa.gov/data/custom-data-download" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">16.8%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> statewide. Today, less than a year after Youngkin removed us from RGGI, </span><a href="https://campd.epa.gov/data/custom-data-download?bookmarkId=1422" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EPA data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Virginia’s electricity providers shows that emissions are up significantly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia benefitted from RGGI to the tune of more than </span><a href="https://campd.epa.gov/data/custom-data-download" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$827.7 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during the years we participated, between 2021 and 2023. The proceeds from RGGI were divided between two statewide programs: a low-income energy efficiency program run by the Virginia Department of Housing and Community Development and a flood resilience capacity building and project implementation program run by the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation. The emissions reductions from RGGI’s energy efficiency component were consistently progressing. And the flood mitigation measures implemented by the flood preparedness component were making headway at helping protect Virginia’s communities vulnerable to flooding. A total of 98 RGGI-funded resiliency projects had already been approved, but the status of many of those projects is now at risk because of the funding Youngkin pulled out from under Virginians when he pulled out of RGGI. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you talk to a dozen farmers, you’ll probably get a dozen different perspectives on the topic of climate change. But like I stated earlier, science doesn’t care what you believe; the weather is getting warmer and weirder. Taking Virginia out of RGGI is taking Virginia backwards in our fight against climate change — a fight that needs to be accelerated, not hindered or delayed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The effects of greenhouse gas emissions on our climate are cumulative. The longer we wait, the worse it gets. The harder it gets. The more expensive it gets. Virginia’s farming families cannot afford the cost of inaction. When we get Virginia back in RGGI, we’ll get Virginia moving in the right direction again. </span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CHESTERFIELD &#8211; About 150 Chesterfield County residents showed up Tuesday to again oppose Dominion Energy Virginia&#8217;s proposed gas plant that the utility says is needed to meet rising energy demand in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Friends of the Chesterfield, a group formed to push back against the plant, held their own &#8220;People&#8217;s Hearing&#8221;  in lieu of a public hearing they’ve requested but that the County Board of Supervisors hasn&#8217;t held.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maria Alvarado, a representative of the Central American Solidarity Association, or CASA, a group advocating on behalf of Black, Latino, Afro-descendent, indigenous, and immigrant communities, called the planned plant “a ticking time bomb” threatening residents’ health. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Every breath we take is at risk. It is not just about today, it is about long term health and survival of our community,” Alvarado said in Spanish, a translator rendering her words in English to the crowd. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Sustained opposition  </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuesday’s hearing was the latest pushback against the 1,000 megawatt natural gas plant that Dominion proposed in 2023. The utility has said the plant will provide power when solar and wind can&#8217;t amid increasing electricity demands from data center development, electrification of vehicles and Virginians’ everyday use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this month, environmental and community groups, including the local Sunrise Movement, protested outside Dominion&#8217;s Thomas F. Farrell II building in downtown Richmond before dropping off a letter for Dominion Chair, President and CEO Bob Blue asking for alternative energy sources.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40605" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/30/chesterfield-community-convenes-peoples-hearing-absent-a-county-held-one/img_4530/" rel="attachment wp-att-40605"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40605" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4530-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4530-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4530-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4530-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4530-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4530-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4530-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Rallyers protest outside Dominion&#8217;s Thomas F. Farrell II building in downtown Richmond. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the inception of initial plans to build the plant at the James River Industrial Park on Battery Brooke Parkway, community and environmental groups have lambasted the project, saying  it runs counter to the Virginia Clean Economy Act, a 2020 law that requires the state&#8217;s largest utilities to transition to zero-carbon emitting energy sources by mid-century, unless there is a concern over the ability to meet electricity needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After 15 state legislators issued a statement in </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/15/democratic-legislators-oppose-dominions-proposed-chesterfield-natural-gas-plant/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">opposition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the plant in May, four delegates attended the People’s Hearing Tuesday night, including Del. Rodney Willet, R-Henrico, Del. Rae Cousins, D-Richmond, Del. Mike Jones, D-Richmond, Del. Debra D. Gardner, D-Chesterfield. A staff member of Del. Dolores McQuinn, D-Richmond, was also present.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;ve heard tonight people would be directly affected by it and that&#8217;s just unacceptable,&#8221; said Willet alongside Cousins in an interview. &#8220;We passed the Clean Economy Act for a reason, to pursue those clean energy alternatives, and this is flying in the face of that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project is proposed to be built in  a community consisting largely of minority and low-income residents, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s environmental justice screening and mapping </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tool.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am a resident of the city of Richmond, but I&#8217;m here, and I will be here to help that fight. At some point they will not get those permits,&#8221; said Richard Walker Tuesday, while referencing past court decisions that have overturned air permits for other controversial energy projects, including one for an Atlantic Coast Pipeline </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2020/01/07/federal-court-overturns-union-hill-compressor-station-permit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">compressor station</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Buckingham County. &#8220;We went to the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals and that three judge panel told them, &#8216;You do not have sufficient evidence for us to agree to grant you this permit.’ That needs to happen here.&#8221;</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40607" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/20241029_192319/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40607" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241029_192319-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1920" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241029_192319-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241029_192319-300x225.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241029_192319-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241029_192319-768x576.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241029_192319-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241029_192319-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Attendees at the Friends of Chesterfield People&#8217;s Hearing Tuesday night. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The critics have asked the Chesterfield County Board of Supervisors to hold a public hearing to solicit community input for local approvals, a requirement for Dominion in order to receive its air permit from the Department of Environmental Quality and final certificate of public convenience and necessity from the State Corporation Commission. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But because a former coal plant site on Coxendale Road that is now the proposed location is already zoned for an electricity generation plant, Chesterfield officials have indicated to DEQ local requirements have been satisfied and no further public action is needed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attempts to reach Chesterfield County officials were unsuccessful, but Tuesday night, county Supervisor Jessica Schneider sent a statement to the Friends of Chesterfield, saying she was &#8220;sorry I am in the minority and could not convince my fellow supervisors to do the right thing and hold a public hearing.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I continue to stand with you in opposition to the gas plant, because not only does it go against the Virginia Clean Economy Act, but more importantly, it poses severe health risks to the Black and Brown and economically disadvantaged communities that are nearby and have been subjected to over 60 years of coal pollution and air pollution from the coal plant,” Schneider’s statement read. “It is a clear case of environmental injustice.&#8221; </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Dominion’s response</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In August, in response to community concern, the utility switched the location of the proposal to its former coal-fired Chesterfield Power Station where the existing infrastructure may be used to reduce construction costs. The utility signaled Tuesday that the planned plant will remain part of its future energy mix, which </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/16/dominion-pushes-for-renewables-more-natural-gas-in-latest-long-term-plan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">includes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more solar, wind, battery storage and nuclear sources than its previous plan, though the percentage of zero-carbon sources has decreased from 95% to 80% of the plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are all-in on renewables, building the largest offshore wind project in the U.S. and operating the nation&#8217;s second-largest solar fleet,&#8221; said Jeremy Slayton, a Dominion spokesperson. &#8220;Renewables alone cannot reliably keep our customers&#8217; power on around the clock. The Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center will allow us to continue to transition to renewables without ever sacrificing reliability.&#8221; </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40608" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/20241029_192616/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40608" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241029_192616-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1920" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241029_192616-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241029_192616-300x225.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241029_192616-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241029_192616-768x576.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241029_192616-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241029_192616-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A map showing the impact of pollution from Dominion&#8217;s proposed natural gas plant. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a </span><a href="https://www.southernenvironment.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Report_DominionsProposedCERCFacilityAEC23Jul2024-2.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">from the Southern Environmental Law Center, created in partnership with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applied Economics Clinic and touted at Tuesday’s event</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, suggests that clean energy could do the trick, instead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Not only would the 1,000 megawatt need be met with resources that do not add harmful air pollutants, these alternatives would cost less,” SELC staff attorney Rachel James told the crowd.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion previously said it expects DEQ to unveil a draft air permit by the end of the year. Critics of the plant say they&#8217;re preparing for Dominion to submit its application for a certificate of convenience and necessity to the State Corporation Commission early next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project is still expected to come online in 2029, though an update to Dominion&#8217;s long term planning document, called the Integrated Resource Plan, or IRP, shows 944 megawatts of electricity from natural gas first being produced in 2030. That represents the first full year of service, Slayton said. </span></p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: This story was updated to correct a transcription error on the size of Dominion&#8217;s solar fleet, and to note that Del. Candi Mundon King did not attend the People&#8217;s Hearing as previously reported. </em></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A coalition that represents solar developers in Virginia plans to ask the legislature to change how solar projects are approved at the local level, arguing that municipal bans are hurting efforts to meet the requirements of the state&#8217;s 2020 Clean Economy Act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past 18 months, 33 large utility-scale solar projects — representing  3,236 megawatts of power — have been </span><a href="https://marec.us/news-va-siting-reform/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rejected</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">across the state, according to the Mid-Atlantic Renewable Energy Coalition, or MAREC, which represents 47 renewable energy developers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s a big chunk of capacity in the short term,” said Evan Vaughan, executive director of MAREC Action, who called the current environment challenging.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MAREC says 34 counties have restrictive ordinances and 16 have limitations that amount to a ban on utility-scale projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data offers a snapshot of the struggles solar developers have faced in recent years as Virginia’s clean energy goals and growing energy needs have met local resistance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are opposed to removing the authority of local government in siting,” said Jim Riddell, with the Virginia Cattleman’s Association. “We believe decisions are best made at the local level where the people live and work and farm, grow their food.”</span></p>
<p><b>Constructs of the Clean Economy Act</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020 and under trifecta control of the state government in Virginia, Democrats passed the Virginia Clean Economy Act, which seeks to decarbonize the state’s electric grid by mid-century. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law requires Virginia’s two largest utilities, Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power Company, to transition to carbon-free electricity in part by owning 16,100 megawatts and 600 megawatts of solar electricity, respectively, by 2035.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The VCEA also requires Dominion and Appalachian Power to maintain renewable portfolio standards, which are met by buying renewable energy credits created when a solar panel generates electricity. The credits can come from utility-owned generation sources or third-party sources, and starting in 2025, have to come from Virginia-based solar facilities.</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the 2035 target and need for Virginia-based RECs to maintain the renewal standards past that target, some solar projects have been approved. One of the latest examples is Chesapeake in </span><a href="https://www.dailypress.com/2024/09/17/chesapeake-approves-41-acre-solar-project-farmers-say-it-will-provide-security/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">September</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, giving the OK for a 5-megawatt facility on 41 acres for a shared solar program, which lets residents subscribe to the electricity produced by a more centralized set of panels. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But other projects have run into opposition from those trying to preserve the state’s remaining farmland. Virginia’s farmland has </span><a href="https://articles.vafb.com/decline-in-farmland-worrying-farmers-agricultural-organizations" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declined</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by 500,000 acres over the last five years. For instance, </span><a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/community/orangenews/the-sun-has-set-on-solar-development-in-orange-county/article_8625ded8-664f-11ef-a390-6b9fff43d167.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orange County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently denied an 80-megawatt project proposed for 1,000 acres, the second project it had rejected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[Farming] has been the history and legacy of this county,” said Orange County Supervisor Crystal Hale at the board’s Aug. 27 meeting, according to the Daily Progress. “If we start taking out 1,000 acres out at a time, we’re taking out that history and legacy for the few that think that their property rights are more important than the rest of this county.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In total, as of mid-October, the State Corporation Commission, which regulates Virginia&#8217;s utilities, and the Department of Environmental Quality, which approves smaller solar projects, had approved 9,500 megawatts of solar, with 4,500 getting built, said Aaron Berryhill, solar program manager at the Virginia Energy department during a Virginia Clean Energy Summit panel recently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of those </span><a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2023/RD682/PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">built so far</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Dominion owns about 2,000 megawatts and gets 290 megawatts from third-party developers that sell the electricity to the utility through power purchase agreements, or PPAs, Berryhill told the Mercury. Appalachian Power owns a 5 megawatt facility and gets 55 megawatts through PPAs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s a lot of really exciting progress that’s already occurred, a lot of lessons learned and a lot of really good examples out there that I think are a really good foundation for this conversation,” Berryhill said during the panel.</span></p>
<p><b>A changing landscape</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion Energy officials have emphasized that they are ready to work with localities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m not going to tell a locality what to do, that’s not our job…we have to work within those things,” Ed Baine, president of Dominion Energy Virginia, said in a media roundtable with reporters recently. “We don’t try to dictate what we believe should be in their ordinances county by county, but we absolutely engage and try to educate on what is reasonable.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as the delays exist, energy demand is projected to more than double by 2048 in Dominion Energy territory, due to data center proliferation, and electrification of vehicles, and everyday life. That demand is prompting utilities to propose natural gas plants and small modular nuclear plans alongside renewable sources to provide electricity more reliability around the clock. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As those facilities take time to build, solar panels can be paired with battery storage devices that could provide dispatchable power on an instant&#8217;s notice similar to a natural gas plant, Vaughan said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We think we can be part of the solution,” he added.</span></p>
<p><b>Legislative proposals</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the most recent legislative session, MAREC lobbied for a bill that would give the State Corporation Commission authority to approve a solar project if a locality denied it. Another bill would have prevented a locality from banning solar projects so long as the total area of land under a solar panel remained under  4%. Both bills failed to advance over concerns of limiting local authority. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“(The Virginia Association of Counties) supports preserving and maintaining current land use authority in making decisions at the local level with input from a county’s respective constituency,” said Joe Lerch, director of local government policy for VaCo. “We do not support state preemption of this authority.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, MAREC is considering a bill that would create a solar siting board pairing local officials with state-level officials more familiar with solar projects in order to understand more holistically the benefits of a project, ways to mitigate any negatives and still meet clean energy goals. There could also be the creation of a standard set of best practices to follow in order to calm localities concerns, and provide certainty for future developers to know what to expect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vaughan said localities need to maintain input, “but there needs to be a balance again.”</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Farm Bureau, which has pushed back against solar development in the state in order to preserve farm and forested land, is opposed to taking away local authority. The Farm Bureau’s opposition includes the argument that farmers need to meet water quality standards, such as Chesapeake Bay cleanup goals, which benefit from tree canopy and forested buffers to collect pollutants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think the full picture of the local concerns should be taken into consideration when discussing a statistic,” said Martha Moore, vice president of governmental relations for the Virginia Farm Bureau. “There are many reasons why a locality might turn down a project.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Riddell, with the Virginia Cattlemen&#8217;s Association, added concern stems from an instance in Essex County in 2018 when a solar developer was fined for </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/04/18/youngkin-administration-sets-stricter-runoff-rules-for-solar-farms/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sediment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> control violations. Earlier this </span><a href="https://roanoke.com/news/local/business/solar-farm-developer-cited-for-western-virginia-environmental-violations/article_827cdf88-17b8-11ef-9c41-1322027bcd68.html#tncms-source=login" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, another solar developer was fined for similar reasons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We depend on solar energy for our grass and our food crops and to provide whole food to Virginia. Solar energy is important to us,” said Riddell. “There is major concern over the loss of ag and forestry land.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The topic is one of many to be discussed at a summit Sen. Dave Marsden, D-Fairfax, is hosting </span><a href="https://files.constantcontact.com/005ceb5f201/c06272f5-4fac-4747-8e77-8e1ed319f5e4.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nov. 18</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Richmond on ways to maintain the goals of the Virginia Clean Economy Act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re not touching the act</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” said Marsden, in a phone interview. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The act itself is fine. What are the circumstances around it that have changed in four years and how do we adjust to that demand?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But City Manager Pat Roberts wanted to first address the weightier issue of how the city viewed its partnership with the U.S Army Corps of Engineers for the </span><a href="https://www.resilientnorfolk.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$2.66 billion coastal storm risk management plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that could reshape the city&#8217;s waterfront with more than eight miles of walls as high as 16.5 feet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Corps has the final say on design,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have the final say whether or not we build it. And that&#8217;s maybe the simplest I can put it.&#8221;</span></p>

	</div>
	</div>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roberts&#8217; statement and others during an hour-long interview were a public signal that the city has plans to demand significant changes to the plan, the largest infrastructure project in its history, which could increase Norfolk&#8217;s share by millions of dollars. Meanwhile, Corps officials say the partnership agreement the city signed last year “codifies” the design in the feasibility study and only allows for changes that don’t significantly increase the cost – unless the city is willing to pay. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Plan background</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Norfolk surrendered much of its leverage to negotiate changes to the plan when the City Council</span><a href="https://www.norfolk.gov/DocumentCenter/View/77089/R-01A-Project-Partnership-Agreement---CSRM-Project" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> approved a partnership agreement </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that locked in the basics of the feasibility study, including the wall’s proposed alignment through downtown and nearby neighborhoods, and the city’s responsibility for a local share of 35% — roughly $931 million in the current cost estimate. The cost is expected to rise, and the project is likely to take longer than the scheduled ten years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the agreement, the city has review and comment power to request changes, while the Corps has the final word on design. If the city&#8217;s requested changes significantly increase the cost, the Corps can label them &#8220;betterments&#8221; and require the Norfolk to pay the difference, above the 35% local share. Even then, the Corps can refuse to build a betterment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city, though, has one final card it can play — refuse to fund its share at any point during the project. If that happens, the Corps can terminate construction unless the assistant secretary for civil works &#8220;determines that continuation of such work is in the interest of the United States.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;Will the federal government come into a community somewhere in the United States and make an investment against the will of the people that live there?&#8217; Roberts asked. &#8220;That&#8217;s the question. I don&#8217;t think so.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Community concerns</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deputy City Manager Doug Beaver, who took part in the interview, said there are ongoing negotiations with the Corps. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They have presented us with ideas, designs, (and) schematics that we don&#8217;t think are the best for the city of Norfolk to maintain a lively and beautiful waterfront,&#8221; he said. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roberts added the council members, who unanimously approved the partnership agreement on April 25, 2023, have concerns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard loud and clear from council members that they want to see it designed in a way that does no harm, that we leverage the funding, that we build the project, but we&#8217;re not going to destroy the waterfront,&#8221; he added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The comments come after residents in both wealthier and low-income neighborhoods complained that they were not informed about the project&#8217;s details, which includes floodwalls, pump stations, a mile-long barrier across the entrance to the Lafayette River and nature-based protections like grasses and oyster reefs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan only protects the city from major storms and a catastrophe like New Orleans experienced with Hurricane Katrina. It will not stop flooding from increasingly high tides and more intense and frequent rainstorms, or improve the city&#8217;s antiquated stormwater system. A 2012 study by the Timmons Group identified between $694 million and $782 million in drainage improvements needed in Norfolk over the coming decades, which equates to roughly $1 billion in 2024 dollars. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Norfolk plan is the first of the Army Corps’ proposed storm risk projects to edge towards construction. New York, Miami, Charleston, and other cities have requested significant design changes to their plans with the Corps, including new feasibility studies in some cases. A $52 billion storm risk proposal for New York and New Jersey</span><a href="https://www.edf.org/media/advocates-celebrate-breakthrough-campaign-overhaul-flawed-army-corps-flooding-plan-ny-nj" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">was dismissed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by state leaders who said the plan only focused on storm surge; the Corps was sent back to the drawing board to create a comprehensive plan that protects against tidal and river flooding, heavy rainfall, groundwater emergence, erosion and sea level rise in addition to storm surge. Miami–Dade County</span><a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/environment/article265388996.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rebuffed a $5 billion plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requested more nature-based solutions and fewer walls </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">after renderings commissioned by the city’s downtown development agency showed 20-foot-high floodwalls blocking waterfront views. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without the project, a 2019 Corps report estimated that all</span><a href="https://www.nao.usace.army.mil/NCSRM/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but a sliver of Norfolk’s interior</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would be at risk for flooding from a major storm by 2075. With the project, the </span><a href="https://usace.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p16021coll7/id/5490/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">feasibility study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> says the city will reap </span><a href="https://www.nao.usace.army.mil/Media/News-Stories/Article/1892903/leaders-sign-norfolk-coastal-storm-risk-management-design-agreement/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">annual net benefits of $122 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from reduced damage to businesses, homes, and critical infrastructure, including healthcare facilities. Norfolk and Corps officials have said repeatedly  that only the first portion of Phase 1 from Berkley Bridge to Chesterfield Heights has been designed. But the feasibility study outlines wall alignments and other details to meet the requirement that the benefit-cost ratio be more than one dollar for every dollar spent on the project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congress appropriated $400 million to start the project in early 2022. When City Council approved the partnership agreement more than a year later, it also approved a resolution stating that half the local share — roughly $465 million over 10 years — had to be funded by the state. So far, the city has received a $25 million state grant. There is $25 million in the state&#8217;s fiscal year 2025 budget, but nothing in the 2026 budget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">City Council, Roberts said, will have a series of votes over the years to decide whether to move forward with the project, fund any betterment, and authorize easements for the wall, utility relocation, and property purchases through eminent domain. It could also require contributions from third parties including Gold Key, the company angling to build a waterfront development. He noted that the city&#8217;s </span><a href="https://www.norfolk.gov/DocumentCenter/View/90107/PH-01-Amended-and-Restated-Option-Development-and-Construction-and-Use-Agreements" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">agreement with the casino developer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requires a $7.5 million payment for the floodwall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;We want the city share to be as little as possible, but at the same time, if there&#8217;s a betterment that makes sense, then the council would consider that,&#8221; Roberts said. &#8220;Council will have likely multiple decisions to make. The big one is, do they appropriate money for that phase? The second big decision, in many cases, will be, does the city acquire real estate?&#8221; he added. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nao.usace.army.mil/Media/Images/igphoto/2000751368/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michelle Hamor,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> chief of policy and planning for the Norfolk district of the Corps, described the comments as a common challenge for local partners. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The city of Norfolk is nearly fully developed. So how do you, after the fact, now implement measures to secure that way of life that people have expected when they move to a waterfront community, and then also provide that level of risk reduction, risk management that keeps them and their investments more secure than before?&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hamor and Roberts said they expected future design charrettes in other neighborhoods, including Freemason, where residents have erected yellow poles the height of the proposed walls in protest to the plan.</span></p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Funding limits</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kristin Mazur, the program manager for the Corps, said via email that the initial $400 million plus the local share is enough to finish three parts of Phase 1, including the wall from the Berkley Bridge to Town Point Park, but not the stretch from West Ghent to Town Point Park. That includes the Fort Norfolk site Gold Key is considering developing and the proposed </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/26/norfolk-hits-obstacles-implementing-storm-risk-protection/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wall through the historic Freemason neighborhood.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Corps has an unfunded backlog of nearly $100 billion in projects. Hamor cautioned that any future appropriations for Norfolk would compete nationally with other requests. Storm risk plans for Virginia Beach,Hampton and Newport News are in the works over the next several years. So are revised studies for New York, Miami, Charleston and other cities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After residents in Freemason, a neighborhood where condominiums range from $350,000 to more than $500,000, complained about a proposed wall through the city, the Corps held an open house attended by about 175 people at a neighborhood YMCA last month. They were concerned about decreasing property values and waterfront access. Hamor promised the design team would consider their concerns but added a caveat: The congressional act that authorized the project &#8220;codified&#8221; the project cost and the wall alignment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s really important. As we think about moving forward, there&#8217;s a limit to what we can do to modify those alignments without exceeding the cost of the project,&#8221; she told residents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hamor was one of a handful of Corps staffers who attended an all-day design charrette in July to address the wall alignment along a site in</span><a href="https://air.norfolk.gov/#/property/11620900" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Fort Norfolk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a rare undeveloped waterfront plot purchased for $2 million in 1996 by </span><a href="https://mcleskey.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">McLeskey,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a Virginia Beach company. The Mercury obtained a 20-page draft report of design options and a file of notes labeled &#8220;CONFIDENTIAL &#8212; DO NOT SHARE OUTSIDE OF THIS TEAM&#8221; from the meeting through a public records request.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the notes, Thompson, who is  McLeskey’s partner, made a presentation offering &#8220;a transformative vision for the area, like how the Cavalier transformed a portion of the Oceanfront in Virginia Beach.&#8221; Eighteen city staffers and consultants, including department heads, met with Thompson and eight others from Gold Key. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed alignment of the wall, which runs down Front Street and puts luxury condominiums on the water side, would kill the Gold Key development, according to the July meeting notes. The charrette report examines the pros and cons of different wall alignments, including hugging the shoreline, putting it in the river, or a combination. Those likely will increase the cost. Hamor, according to the notes, cautioned that there were limits to changes without the Corps invoking a betterment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One preferred option runs the wall along the shoreline while the other moves much of it into the water. Both envision a raised public greenspace on the water&#8217;s edge of the development with the wall buried inside. A planned September workshop to agree on a final design was postponed until the Army Corps hires consultants for the work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kyle Spencer, the city’s chief resilience officer, said because of numerous utility conflicts on Front Street, the cost of those alignments may not be greater and could avoid being considered a betterment. But Hamor, in an interview, said putting the wall in the water raises other issues. It would have to be more robust. There are also water quality and habitat concerns, the fact that the river is a federal navigation channel, and potential conflicts with utilities in the river bottom. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to an email seeking an interview, </span><a href="https://www.goldkeyphr.com/leadership" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bryan Cuffee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Gold Key&#8217;s vice president of development, said the company was in the exploratory phase to determine project feasibility. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are anxious to determine the additional, if any, cost over and above what is appropriated to determine the additional, if any, funding requirements,&#8221; he wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thompson and Gold Key became the focus of a controversy over the development of The Main, a hotel in downtown Norfolk, when The Virginian-Pilot in 2017 reported that the city&#8217;s contributions to the project </span><a href="https://www.hotel-online.com/press_releases/release/incentives-in-norfolk-smooth-path-for-developer-of-hotel-conference-center/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">were nearly $103 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, far more than is normal for similar developments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roberts and Beaver noted the Corps has negotiated changes to the wall along Lamberts Point docks to accommodate </span><a href="https://millergrpva.com/portfolio/fairwinds-landing" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fairwinds Landing, </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">a marine logistics center to support offshore wind, and the City Council&#8217;s concerns about designs for Town Point Park, which are still in development. Spencer has repeatedly said that the Corps has not described those changes as a betterment that would require additional local funds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, in an email via a Corps&#8217; spokesman, Mazur said the question remains open. &#8220;We cannot make a determination about what is or isn&#8217;t a betterment before we have a design,&#8221; she added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With potential changes in the conceptual designs for Freemason, Front Street, Fort Norfolk, Town Point Park, Pretty Lake Avenue, and elsewhere in the works, the City Council will need to decide over the coming years whether to continue funding a plan that protects only against a storm surge the Corps said has a 1.4% chance to occur in any year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our goal is to build the whole project,&#8221; Roberts said, &#8220;but we have to figure out each phase, one at a time.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note:</em> This story has been updated with additional details from the Army Corps, to clarify that the authorization that codifies the storm risk project cost requires one act while funding requires additional congressional action.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After  giving Dominion Energy the green light to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/24/as-offshore-wind-installation-rises-dominion-showcases-environmental-economic-benefits/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">construct</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project in one WEA 27 miles off the coast of Virginia Beach, and in August awarding the utility a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/14/dominion-wins-second-offshore-wind-lease-area-with-lone-bid/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">second</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> WEA directly east of CVOW, the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bureau of Ocean Energy Management</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is accepting comments ahead of drafting the new WEAs in what is called the Central Atlantic 2 Call Area, a span of about 13.4 million acres off the coasts of New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia and North Carolina.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40581" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1586px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/central-atlantic-2-call-area-map/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40581" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Central-Atlantic-2-Call-Area-map.jpg" alt="" width="1586" height="1054" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Central-Atlantic-2-Call-Area-map.jpg 1586w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Central-Atlantic-2-Call-Area-map-300x199.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Central-Atlantic-2-Call-Area-map-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Central-Atlantic-2-Call-Area-map-768x510.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Central-Atlantic-2-Call-Area-map-1536x1021.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1586px) 100vw, 1586px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  The Central Atlantic 2 Call Area map.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with progressing toward the federal government Biden’s goals, Dominion’s two offshore wind sites, and a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/08/dominion-to-purchase-second-offshore-wind-lease-area-off-coast-of-north-carolina/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">third </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">site 36 miles off the coast of North Carolina the utility recently finalized acquisition of, are critical to the utility’s compliance with the Virginia Clean Economy Act. The 2020 law seeks to decarbonize the state’s electric grid, which is facing challenges amid </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/16/dominion-pushes-for-renewables-more-natural-gas-in-latest-long-term-plan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">surging</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> demand nationwide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Shaun Gehan, counsel for Omega Protein, wrote in the company’s request that extending the 6-mile buffer currently proposed for any future WEAs off the coast of Virginia is “vitally important.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not only are the waters around the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay the area where most of the conflicts with the menhaden fishery would be most acute, it is also an economically vital shipping lane, important area of military operations and traffic, and a high traffic area for recreational vessels,” Gehan wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Omega Protein, the lone menhaden reduction fishery in the Chesapeake Bay, is a staple in fishery management in Virginia, with lawmakers, regulators and recreational striped bass fishers clashing over how to oversee the company’s operations. Critics have said Omega has a negative impact on the fish, while the company has called for sound science to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/18/recreational-fishers-call-on-legislators-for-action-on-menhaden-management/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prove</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> those claims.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Reedville-based company focuses their catches of the tiny-nutrient rich menhaden fish in the calmer waters of the Bay to reduce them to fishmeal and oil. The company says it catches 93,000 metric tons, or 70%, of its menhaden annually in an area extending along the coast from North Carolina to Long Island in New York within the </span><a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/eez.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exclusive Economic Zone</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, while a “majority of the harvest occurs in the waters off of Virginia.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company deploys two vessels about 40 feet long and 13 feet wide that will circle schools of menhaden with a 1,100-foot long purse seine net in between them to scoop the fish up, Gehan explained. The operation involves spotter planes flying as low as 500 feet above sea level, and the boats potentially floating within a 2-3 mile distance of their net sets across a 30 minute to 2 hour duration in order to make their catches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It seems amply apparent that a fifteen-mile buffer would still provide ample areas for wind energy development,” Gehan wrote.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While other fisheries have raised concerns over potential conflicts in the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/06/23/as-feds-eye-more-wind-leases-off-virginia-fishing-industries-fear-losses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">past</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, recreational fishers have touted the potential for new fishing opportunities around wind turbines that can simulate diverse coral reefs and attract different species. The Nature Conservancy is partnering with Dominion and the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/18/scientists-to-study-how-offshore-wind-construction-off-virginia-beach-impacts-fish/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> any marine life benefits or harms to guide future offshore wind policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Virginia Saltwater Sportfishing Assn is in favor of this 15 mile buffer if it means that Omega will be fishing more often in the EEZ rather than the waters of the Chesapeake Bay where there have been conflicts with recreational fishers and associated small businesses for many years,” Steve Atkinson, chairman of the VSSA, told the Virginia Mercury.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But compared to recreational fishers, the larger vessels of Omega Protein need more space to operate, explained company spokesperson Ben Landry said in an interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Traditional, very well established (fishing grounds) are at stake here,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">explained “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are not anti-wind energy or renewables.”</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce/ For the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On October 15, Dominion Energy Virginia filed its <a href="https://www.dominionenergy.com/-/media/pdfs/global/company/irp/2024-irp-w_o-appendices.pdf?rev=c03a36c512024003ae9606a6b6a239f3" target="_blank">2024 integrated resource plan</a> (IRP), and just as in 2023, the company shows no inclination to meet the carbon-cutting requirements of the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA). Blaming soaring load growth from data centers, Dominion models only scenarios with increasing amounts of fossil fuel generation to supplement its investments in renewable energy and nuclear. A scenario that would actually comply with the law is discussed only as something stakeholders asked for, then dismissed as “infeasible.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tellingly, the company notes casually that its own scenarios “evaluate the impacts of” the VCEA, as if the law were merely advisory, while the utility retained the final say. It’s kind of like a driver thoughtfully “evaluating the impact” of a speed limit – and then accelerating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be fair, this used to work for Dominion. The State Corporation Commission (SCC) has a long history of criticizing Dominion’s IRPs and ordering the company to do better next time, but never outright rejecting a plan. If traffic cops only ever gave out warnings, you would expect to see more scofflaws.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, though, the three-member SCC has two new commissioners, and already they have shown they intend to take their oversight role seriously. The commission didn’t even wait to see what Dominion would come up with before demanding improvements. On October 11, four days before Dominion submitted its IRP, the SCC issued an </span><a href="https://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/81xf01!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> instructing the utility to supplement its filing with additional work, to be submitted by November 15.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The task list includes modeling plans that meet the requirements of the VCEA, with at least one that incorporates data center load and one that doesn’t, as well as least-cost plans with and without data centers. In addition, the SCC wants Dominion to break down the costs of new transmission projects to identify the expenses that are primarily due to data center demand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The order tacitly acknowledges that the staggering growth of the data center industry in Virginia has upended utility planning. At the same time, the SCC is not giving Dominion a free pass, either on costs or on VCEA requirements. If Dominion believes it can only meet demand reliably by adding expensive gas peaker plants, it is going to have to prove it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/11/as-virginias-scc-prepares-to-tackle-the-data-center-surge-it-can-learn-from-ohio/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wrote a few weeks ago</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the SCC plans to convene a technical conference in December to examine issues around serving data center load. Of paramount interest to the commission are the questions of how much it will cost to meet the burgeoning demand, and how to protect other consumers from rate increases for new generation and transmission infrastructure needed only because of one industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SCC is not alone in its concerns about Dominion’s cavalier approach to its IRP obligations. Last year, with a goal of improving utility oversight, the General Assembly </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/05/after-six-years-of-inaction-virginia-commission-on-electric-utility-regulation-reconvenes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">revitalized</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its Commission on Electric Utility Regulation, which formerly served as a graveyard for utility reform bills. (CEUR used to be pronounced “sewer,” but commission members would dearly love it if you would now call it “the cure.”)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a September 16 </span><a href="https://apps.dlas.virginia.gov/User_db/frmView.aspx?ViewId=6315&amp;s=7" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">memo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, CEUR director Carrie Hearne recommended members consider a list of reforms that would, among other things, require Dominion to include in its IRP “a VCEA conforming scenario that does not assume to exercise an immediate exemption due to reliability concerns.” This scenario would have to incorporate the social cost of carbon, meet energy efficiency metrics (another area where Dominion has fallen short), plan for the retirement of fossil fuel plants targeted for closure in the VCEA, and assume an “unobstructed” buildout of renewable energy and storage (removing the artificial caps Dominion currently employs). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, CEUR would like Dominion to follow the law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ratepayer and environmental advocates have applauded the more muscular approach being taken by CEUR and the SCC. Dominion, however, has remained steadfastly oblivious to the hints flung at it from all sides.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company remains unapologetic. In an </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2024/10/19/column-all-of-the-above-approach-needed-for-virginias-growing-power-demand/?share=motroiopfetoicdelaeb" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">op-ed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Dominion Energy Chairman Bob Blue insists the company is pursuing an “all of the above” strategy that will produce electricity that is “reliable, affordable and increasingly clean” – an assertion he repeats three times, as if saying it often enough makes it true. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the IRP puts it, however, “perceptions of affordability are subjective.” Analyzing its favored scenario using the methodology directed by the SCC, Dominion projects residential bills will rise over the next 15 years from an average of $142.77 today to $315.25 in 2039. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s be charitable, though. Maybe when Mr. Blue said the company was committed to affordable energy, he meant for data centers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Increasingly clean” is even more counter-factual. As </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/16/dominion-pushes-for-renewables-more-natural-gas-in-latest-long-term-plan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Mercury, “The utility’s previous plan projection said about 95% of electricity generation would be pulled from </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/12/dominion-regulator-recommends-rejection-of-utilitys-long-term-plan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">renewable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sources. Tuesday’s updated plan calls for about 80% of generation to be spurred by renewables.” And as with the 2023 IRP, Dominion plans to keep expensive and highly polluting coal plants operating beyond their previous retirement dates, putting the company even further away from “clean.”</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Dominion pushes for renewables, more natural gas in latest long-term plan&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/16/dominion-pushes-for-renewables-more-natural-gas-in-latest-long-term-plan/embed/#?secret=GkpAHJrLQI#?secret=aj0oHhlxJS" data-secret="aj0oHhlxJS" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion’s 2023 IRP received considerable</span><a href="https://bluevirginia.us/2023/07/dominion-energys-climate-numbers-dont-add-up" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> criticism</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for projecting a doubling of greenhouse gas emissions by 2048, a year when they should be at zero under the terms of the VCEA. Dominion appears to have learned a lesson from that public shaming, but not the right lesson. The 2024 plan shortens the emissions time frame to 5 years, cutting out reporting for the later years when the proposed new methane gas plants would be in service and spewing out CO2. Instead, the IRP brags about lowering “emissions intensity,” a success it can achieve without cutting carbon, just by selling more electricity. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So much for affordable and increasingly clean. As for reliable, burning more methane will only exacerbate the climate change and extreme weather that have been wreaking havoc on southeastern utilities’ ability to keep the lights on. The recent storms should be a wake-up call for utilities to ramp up renewables, including distributed solar generation and storage to serve communities, rather than building more centralized, carbon-intensive fossil fuel plants to power data centers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But some companies, like some people, never learn. Finding itself deep in a hole, Dominion proposes to keep on digging.</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regulations guiding hunting, one of Virginia’s oldest traditions, will remain unchanged after the Board of Wildlife Resources voted 6-3 against two proposals to update the state’s right to retrieve law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The right to retrieve law lets deer and bear hunters go onto other people’s property to get their dogs, which hunters use to scare up game. The Supreme Court of Virginia </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/11/right-to-retrieve-legal-challenge-dismissed-as-state-considers-new-rules/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> upheld rulings pointing to right to retrieve as an exception to trespass criminal law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Property owners, increasingly </span><a href="https://www.coopercenter.org/research/amid-slow-population-growth-virginias-demographic-landscape-being-transformed#:~:text=Yet%2C%20examining%20the%202023%20population,the%20highest%20share%20since%201975." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">moving</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to rural areas, have argued the law allows their private land to be turned into public property for hunters. The hunters contend that they want to continue their tradition as they have for decades, lawfully. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to the tension, the Department of Wildlife Resources issued reports and convened workgroups over the past several years that presented seven </span><a href="https://dwr.virginia.gov/wp-content/uploads/media/10242024-Board-Meeting-Materials-02.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including the two the board rejected Thursday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the rejected proposals would have required deer and bear hunters to put GPS collars on the hounds they use. The other rejected proposal would’ve required hunters to make “reasonable efforts” to not let their dogs roam onto other property once property owners notified them they weren’t welcome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other five proposals included raising awareness about ways to avoid conflicts between the two groups, as well as pursuing funding for more conservation police officers to respond to issues. The other proposals were not regulatory and have already been acted upon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Board Member Jim Edmunds, a former legislator, attempted to have the GPS collar proposal advance, board members ultimately voted against it and the other regulatory change. DWR recommended the rejections, saying the group didn’t have the power to make such changes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The right to retrieve is statutory. That’s why you see that discussed at the General Assembly, how trespass itself is statutory,” said DWR Executive Director Ryan Brown. “It’s not something that this board would have the authority to take up.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The decisions came after several property rights advocates said the current law violates their constitutional rights, disturbs their peace and safety and compromises their ability to maintain their livestock. The advocates also said the expenses of putting barriers on their property to bar roaming dogs outweighed the costs of hunters using GPS collars. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don’t care if others hunt with dogs, we don’t want to stop that. We want to stop the constant intrusions onto our properties,” said Property Rights Coalition of Virginia representative Jim Medeiros, who was one of the property owners who sued the state over the right to retrieve law, but lost. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This board has been specifically and exclusively given the authority to regulate (hound hunting) by the General Assembly,” Medeiros added. “Like it or not, you own this problem.”</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several hunters, donning blaze orange hunting caps, also spoke at the meeting, citing the cost of the collars as a barrier to young hunters participating and the seemingly low rate of trespass convictions resulting from conflict — 60 out 60,000 complaints that did not warrant changes (though property rights advocates called out difficulties in proving trespassing).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We will stand up for our rights, also for our traditions, as Virginians,” said Kirby Burch, chief executive officer of the Virginia Hunting Dog Alliance, after saying the solution is to “show respect for one another.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We will continue to hunt with hounds for another generation, if you will work with me to make those promises I just gave come to pass,” Burch said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has a process underway to solicit suggestions for next year’s deer and bear season regulations, but the rejection means the battle over the law could end up being fought in next year’s General Assembly session, which starts in January.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://www.nrdc.org/resources/flooded-again-flood-data-visualization-tool" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new analysis and online tool</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> created by the Natural Resources Defense Council reveals that nearly 7,000 Virginia properties had repeated claims for flood damage over 10 years. And the program, administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, will keep paying out. Only 554 of those properties mitigated their flood risk through methods like basement filling, house raising, or replacing it with a structure that can better withstand flooding, according to the NRDC research.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One of the most frustrating things about the flood rebuild model that we&#8217;re following in the United States is that there is currently no requirement for property owners to mitigate their property to reduce the likelihood of repeat flood damage,&#8221; said </span><a href="https://www.wetlandswatch.org/bio-stiff" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mary-Carson Stiff, </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">executive director of </span><a href="https://www.wetlandswatch.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wetlands Watch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a nonprofit based in Norfolk that helps create resilience and adaptation solutions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past, FEMA has declined to provide details about flooded properties and while individual addresses are not included in the data, the new analysis includes key information about payouts, flood mitigation, and zip codes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NRDC&#8217;s data shows that the number of repetitive loss properties continues to rise as storms grow more intense and more frequent in a warming world. They also illustrate the inadequacy of FEMA flood maps, which are updated infrequently and have relied on outdated data that looks back rather than forward at a hotter, wetter Virginia. But those maps continue to guide developers, engineers, banks, local land use officials, and homeowners when deciding where to build and finance a project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The cost of flooding is increasing every single year with every big storm event and small event,&#8221; Stiff said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, three-quarters of the repetitive loss properties are in Hampton Roads. Of those, 841 </span><a href="https://www.nrdc.org/resources/losing-ground-flood-visualization-tool" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are severe repetitive loss properties,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which have reported four or more claims of more than $5,000. The vast majority — 689 — have not been mitigated against future flooding. They accounted for 1% of the Virginia claims but 21% of the payments. According to NRDC, 10% of them are outside FEMA-designated flood zones. Nearly 3,000 of the properties whose owners have been paid claims in Virginia no longer have flood insurance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Beach had 128 severe repetitive loss properties paid more than $20 million. That&#8217;s an average of more than $150,000 each. Of that, 114 were not mitigated. Norfolk had 125 severe loss properties paid $18 million with 93 not mitigated. Hampton had 110 properties paid $18.2 million with 91 not mitigated. Poquoson, a city of about 12,500 on a peninsula on the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay, had 50 severe risk loss properties paid nearly $6.6 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NRDC data illustrates the co-dependent flood and payout cycle it calls “</span><a href="https://www.nrdc.org/resources/losing-ground-flood-visualization-tool" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">losing ground.”</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some cases, the damage payouts exceeded the property&#8217;s value. In Norfolk, one single family home received $173,736 over seven claims, but had a value of $104,400, according to the database. It was not protected against future flooding. A Virginia Beach home worth $149,400 received $243,502 in payments and while it’s still insured, it is not mitigated against flooding. A single-family home in Portsmouth, insured and mitigated against flooding, received $250,558 in two claims, but is worth $239,380. One Richmond property in the database, labeled non-residential, received nearly $1.4 million in payouts but has a value of $211,750. It is no longer insured or protected. An insured single-family home in Poquoson worth $155,300, according to the database, received five claims totaling $480,010.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The relatively new FEMA insurance rates, called Risk Rating 2.0, attempt to take a more realistic and equitable look at flood insurance. Most policyholders saw their premiums either drop or increase by no more than $10 per month in its first year. Under the law, no premium can increase by more than 18% annually. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But i</span><a href="https://www.floods.org/news-views/from-the-directors-desk/risk-rating-2-0-adjustments-needed/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">n a column last year, Chad Berginnis, executive director </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">of the Association of State Floodplain Managers, agreed with Stiff that flood hazard mitigation measures needed to be credited and that FEMA needed to be clearer about which mix of mitigation would translate into reduced premiums.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we talk of the NFIP, we often talk about it as a four-legged stool: floodplain management, flood mitigation, floodplain mapping, and flood insurance,” he wrote. “However, it’s become clear to the floodplain management community that the new rating system has severed those first two legs and as a nation we still haven’t prioritized flood mapping the entire U.S. to better reflect flood risk.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stiff noted the present system leads to “the active bankrupting of the National Flood Insurance Program. We&#8217;re all on the hook to bail them out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communities, she added, can track cumulative damage to a property and, when it reaches the FEMA threshold of more than 50% rebuilding, require the owners to bring it up to the latest flood protection standards. But that&#8217;s not an option Virginia cities have embraced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It is a higher standard that local governments can elect to use in their communities, and if they do, then they receive credit through the community rating system, which will lower flood insurance policies annually for every policyholder in the local government,&#8221; she added. &#8220;There are ways in which our communities can be proactive against this issue, but our communities are choosing not to take these additional measures because it&#8217;s politically unappetizing.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NRDC&#8217;s recommended solutions for the repeated payouts echo her comments and include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Update building codes and land use standards for development in floodplains.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensure flood-risk maps are updated and account for future risk.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make flood insurance more affordable for low and moderate-income households.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give home buyers and renters the information to understand their risk.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.nrdc.org/bio/anna-weber" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anna Weber, </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">senior policy analyst for environmental health at the NRDC, noted that Virginia is</span><a href="https://www.nrdc.org/resources/how-states-stack-flood-disclosure" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> one of many states that do not require seller</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">s to disclose a property&#8217;s flood history. Only seven states require tenants to be notified, according to a new paper in the Journal of Land Use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Virginia is effectively a buyer-beware state,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There&#8217;s very little that you are guaranteed a right to in terms of that information. So, when we talk about flood disclosure, we think it&#8217;s important that people have a right to know not just what it says about your home on a FEMA flood insurance map, but what specifically has happened in the past at that property. Has it flooded before? Have there been flood insurance claims? How much did those claims cost? How many times has the home flooded?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Weber and others call the FEMA maps inadequate, they also note they are often out of date. They&#8217;re required to be updated every five years, but often are not. Norfolk&#8217;s map, for instance, has not been updated since 2017.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flooding, Weber noted, has multiple causes that call for multifaceted solutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Some of that looks like thinking hard about our land use choices. Some of that looks like improving and strengthening our building codes so that we&#8217;re building in a smarter way,” she said. “Some of that has to do with long-term community planning. What do we want our coastal communities to look like in 50 years?&#8221; she said. “In 100 years, we may not be able to live in the same places in the same ways as we have in the past.” </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.law.columbia.edu/faculty/michael-gerrard" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Gerrard, </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">the founder of the </span><a href="https://climate.law.columbia.edu/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sabin Center for Climate Change Law </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">at Columbia University, recently published </span><a href="https://scholarship.law.columbia.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5544&amp;context=faculty_scholarship" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a paper examining the legal tools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to combat what he called a growing crisis of urban flooding. He endorsed many of the same solutions proposed by the NRDC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It makes no sense to continue to rebuild the same house at government expense,&#8221; he said, adding that there needs to be a reckoning with the costs of the climate crisis&#8221;The overall problem is that people and governments are unwilling to pay for the cost that climate change is imposing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And that will just get worse over time as the climate worsens.&#8221;</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce for The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The United States Department of Transportation announced Friday that it’s sending </span><a href="https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/biden-harris-administration-sends-virginia-10-million-emergency-relief-funding-roads" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$10 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the Virginia Department of Transportation to “restore and reopen” a one-mile stretch of Route 58 in Washington County that was washed out when Hurricane Helene wreaked havoc in the Southwest Virginia region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hurricane Helene’s devastation affected communities in multiple states, including Virginia, and the Biden-Harris Administration is here to support all of them as they recover and rebuild,” said U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, in a statement on the funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Route 58 spans the entire state all the way from Virginia Beach through Southside and into Tennessee, where it becomes State Route 383. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The washed-out portion runs between </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the intersection of Route 91 at Damascus and Feather Camp Road in the Konnarock area</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which has prompted a 30-mile detour until the road is reopened. The mountainous region has limited thoroughfares connecting the more populated regions, making Route 58 an important alternative to hilly, curvy backroads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Estimates of when the road will be functional were not included in the release.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A total of 484 primary and secondary roads and 118 bridges were closed following the storm. Now, only two primary and 16 secondary roads, and 10 bridges, remained closed, Virginia Secretary of Finance Stephen Cummings said in an update to legislators at a Senate Finance Committee last week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The announcement of the funding comes after Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Oct. 17 </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2024/october/name-1035403-en.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">  the Office of Hurricane Helene Rebuilding and Recovery to track the state’s restoration efforts. The storm  is now credited with killing three Southwest Virginians, after one person who was injured in North Carolina during the weather event and died after returning to his home in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cummings also relayed in his update to legislators that  200 people in hard-to-reach areas were still without power and that nearly all schools had reopened by Oct. 7, with Grayson County Public Schools re-opening soon after.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Oct. 7, five disaster recovery centers have been opened in the state in Damascus, Independence, Tazewell, Dublin and Marion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of Oct. 8, damage in the region had led the state to lose about $731.4 million in income tax, $8.9 billion in taxable sales, and 249,330 jobs, Cummings shared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement about the creation of the office, a Youngkin news release said the move “does not redirect the administration of resources from any agency, but formalizes the coordination and oversight of resources and activities out of the Governor’s office.” Cummings added the office could be made up of one or two people, and would free up the Virginia Department of Emergency Management to continue to respond to other events.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We know this is a long road, but with the incredible grit and resilience of the people and communities affected, in collaboration with local, state and federal partners, Southwest Virginia will rebuild stronger than ever,” Youngkin said in his statement.</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morgan Slaven runs a sheep farm in Augusta County, where her family has been across different operations for seven generations, now with her nieces pitching in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, Slaven was grateful because of her “off farm job” to generate income after drought conditions, presenting back to back years of challenges ahead of this year’s harvest season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What if I lost my job?” said Slaven, who works with Shenandoah Valley Electric Cooperative. “The only reason I have this place right now is because I have an off-the-farm income.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Record drought hit Virginia this past summer, impacting profits in the largest economic sector in the state, even though programs are available at the federal level to offset losses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, agriculture contributes about $82.3 billion annually to the </span><a href="https://www.vdacs.virginia.gov/markets-and-finance-agriculture-facts-and-figures.shtml" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">economy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with more than 381,800 jobs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But temperatures reaching 99 degrees twice at the end of June in the Lynchburg area, with no rain and strong winds, pinched farmers’ pockets putting an emphasis on assistance programs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have a lot of claims,” said Danielle Bappert, regional crop agent for Virginia Farm Bureau Crop Insurance</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Yeah, it’s definitely tough this year.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The drought </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality manages dry spells through the Drought Monitoring Task Force, a collection of other state agencies, which issued advisories that got put in place, expanded, lifted and put in place again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On June 24, the task force placed a warning, which indicated that “a significant drought is imminent,” impacting 12 counties, mainly in Northern Virginia and the Northern Shenandoah Valley. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less than a month later, the warning expanded to 60 counties.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40470" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:285px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=40470" rel="attachment wp-att-40470"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-40470 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/unnamed.gif" alt="" width="285" height="199" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A map of drought advisories in Virginia. (Courtesy of Department of Environmental Quality)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conditions persisted until tropical Storm </span><a href="https://www.weather.gov/akq/Aug082024_Debby" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Debby</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hit the area in early August with about 7-10 inches over a few days. The task force then lifted 76 of the drought warnings, and watches, which is a less severe advisory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But then in September, more severe warnings were issued  for the northern Shenandoah Valley. Following Hurricane Helene, which hit the region at the end of September, the task force moved the warnings to less severe watches. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to what is being seen on a planetary level, these trends were hamstrung by dry conditions at the start, said Weeden Cloe, manager of the office of water supply at the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were hoping that there would be a very wet winter, with significant recharge for the groundwater, but it wasn’t really enough to bring groundwater levels to a point where they were able to be normal for this year,” said Cloe. “They were almost operating right off the bat in a deficit. This year, they dropped down very fast. In the Shenandoah Valley, they really haven’t popped back up until now.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Dry conditions</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The drought this year hurt sheep farmers, and the corn and bean commodities Virginia is known for. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slaven, on her 68 acres, has about 55 ewes, or female sheep, for breeding that she fully rotates around her pastures every four to six weeks so they don’t nibble too far down on the grass where parasites are, and so the grass can recover.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40463" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=40463" rel="attachment wp-att-40463"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-40463 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4275-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4275-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4275-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4275-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4275-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4275-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4275-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Morgan Slaven&#8217;s farm in Augusta County. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, Slaven managed her father’s cattle and split the profits, which are supposed to be about 60 cents per pound the gain. The rate is supposed to be 2 pounds every day, but hers only gained about 15 pounds over 90 days. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, she went into a partnership with another farmer to take 40% of a hay crop to ensure feeding.  But she skipped the first, early season harvesting with hopes to take the second and third cuts. The drought caused those to never come, and she had to spend between $150 and $200 a week on feed at the store to make up for food.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It feels like why am I doing this, because the mortgage payment is still the same,” Slaven said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The effects of the dry spells can be felt with commodities, according to the United States Department of Agriculture National Ag Statistics, which said in </span><a href="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Statistics_by_State/Virginia/Publications/Current_News_Release/2024/OctCrop24_VA.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">October</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that corn yields were estimated to be 36.1 million bushels, down 38% from the 2023 level. Soybeans are forecast to be up 22% from last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whereas beans “idle” throughout the season, Robert Harper, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">grain marketing specialist at the Virginia Farm Bureau,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said that corn is “like a running back in the NFL, it’s explosive, it&#8217;s strong, and quick and fast.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40468" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=40468" rel="attachment wp-att-40468"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40468" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4334-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4334-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4334-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4334-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4334-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4334-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4334-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A corn field in Augusta County. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In June, the lack of moisture and the warm night time temperatures not getting below 85 degrees meant the corn never pollinated or “silked” to produce its ear.  When the rain came in July, the crop had already missed its chance to grow an ear, Harper said. Downpours came that did some damage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a half a crop at best, and it’s highly damaged,” said Harper. “It’s a year of extremes. It seems like we’re just getting these cyclical weather patterns, and we get stuck in them.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Programs for help</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assistance is there for the taking, but some may be reluctant to use it, and it may only allow farmers to break even.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to get help, the USDA issued </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a primary natural disaster designation for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">15 </span><a href="https://www.vdacs.virginia.gov/press-releases-240730-localities-eligible-usda-emergency-loans.shtml" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">counties</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which allows for emergency loans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slaven tapped into disaster assistance, because she was paying the expenses out of pocket for feed instead of relying on naturally growing grass.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People have a lot of pride, they don’t want to take donations, but it’s there, because your tax dollars are paying for it,” Slaven said. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40467" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=40467" rel="attachment wp-att-40467"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-40467 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4323-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4323-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4323-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4323-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4323-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4323-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4323-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Bales of hay in Augusta County. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is also farmers insurance, which is similar to a health policy by having farmers pay into it then get compensated by the government, Bappert said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A “vast majority,” of clients will be filing a claim this year, Bappert said, adding that insurance and meeting environmental standards is a prerequisite to become eligible for Emergency Relief Program payments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Michael Webert, R-Fauquier, a farmer who faced similar feed shortages for his livestock, which forced him to buy 100 bales at $50 a piece in July, said the insurance can help producers break even.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you do that correctly, you don’t lose money,” Webert said. “You don’t make money, but you don’t lose money.”</span></p>

(Courtesy of Dominion Energy)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion Energy&#8217;s 1.6 MW Black Bear Solar project in Buckingham County is now partnered with Mountain House Apiaries, using Italian honey bees to maintain the land around the solar arrays while benefiting the local agricultural community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project falls under the category of agrivoltaics — another way to label pairing solar panels with agricultural uses — and is an effort by Dominion to show and see how solar can live in harmony with the land and surrounding agriculture industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of people are very, very passionate about making sure the area stays agricultural,” said Adam Fillius, electrical distribution program manager at Dominion Energy, while out on a tour of the facility. “If you can provide them with clean energy and still be able to stay agricultural. That&#8217;s a win for everybody.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The honey bee, which almost became the state’s official pollinator species by way of legislation earlier this year, is lost at a 35% rate each year, but has spiked up to a 48% loss in one year.  Honey bees are needed for about one-third of all food </span><a href="https://honeybee.sweetvirginia.org/#:~:text=But%20honey%20bees%20are%20declining,%2C%20cold%20winters%2C%20and%20pesticides.&amp;text=Virginian%20beekeepers%20and%20farmers%20suffer%20from%20low%20honey%20bee%20populations%20too." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">production</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s plenty of feral bees out there, ones that live in the tree,” said Chuck Burden, beekeeper at Mountain House Apiaries. “The honey bees are endangered.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Interconnecting with honey</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $7.5 million solar project, which can produce enough electricity to power 400 homes, came online in 2023 after the State Corporation Commission approved it as one of the first projects proposed under the VCEA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through a mutual contact, Fillius got connected with Burden, who reviewed some online </span><a href="https://va.beecheck.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">maps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to see if there were other bee farms within a five-mile radius, since bees travel within this range, that might create competition for food. He also checked to see what farms are in the area that might use herbicides, pesticides or insecticides. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buckingham County, located in the middle of the state, has 375 farms totaling about 80,900 acres with an average of about 216 acres per operation, according to the United States Department of </span><a href="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/AgCensus/2022/Online_Resources/County_Profiles/Virginia/cp51029.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agriculture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but Burden said he didn’t find any conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Part of my thinking is the solar farms don’t do herbicide spraying or insecticide spraying, so the earth that they&#8217;re sitting on, regardless of what it was used for prior to, is allowed to heal and get back to its natural state,” he said. Burden also saw added appeal from the security fence and trees surrounding the facility to protect the bees from bears.</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion has a requirement to have a percentage of their seed mix be pollinator friendly, which helps the bees, Burden said. That resulted in a traditional turf mix planted under the panels surrounded by native pollinator plants: white clover, little bluestem, black-eyed susan, eastern columbine, lance leaf coreopsis and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Keeping all the clover and the other pollinators that we have mixed in with this grass that’s growing here, it’s a big benefit,” said Steve Voreh, c</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ompliance program manager in the renewable energy department </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with Dominion. “You can see here there’s almost no erosion at all, just a nice big green field with clover and other pollinators.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Busy bees</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since August, the about 14-acre site Dominion Energy leases &#8211; has been home to about 45,000 bees in each of the about four hives made with wood and nailed together at the corner joints, for a total of about 180,000. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Burden bears the costs of the bees, with room to add another four hives and possibly up to 24 across the whole site. He’ll check on them by testing the pollen for chemicals and weighing them to make sure they get enough food. He’ll harvest about 20 pounds of honey, with about 60 to 80 pounds left so the bees can make it through the winter. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hives join the roughly 200 that Burden has at 10 locations across the state to sell product at his shop on State Route 151 in Nelson County, turn it into mead or let his daughter consume it to avoid her needing daily allergy shots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia is probably the allergy capital of the world,” Burden said.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The goal</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tension between solar developers and the farming community is centered around the Virginia Clean Economy Act, a 2020 law that seeks to transition Dominion to renewable generation sources that don’t emit climate changing emissions by 2045. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developers want to build, but farmers are concerned about land loss and disturbances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea of honey bees is an extension of other agrivoltaics efforts that use sheep to rotationally graze about 40 acres of land every few days, and potentially planting crops on the middle of panels after more research is done.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Dominion is very focused on looking at agrivoltaics right now with its solar farms,” said Tim Eberly, a Dominion spokesperson. “We’re exploring other sites where we could put bee hives.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40449" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/18/dominion-energy-pairs-solar-with-honey-bees-to-preserve-agricultural-land/20241002_120752/" rel="attachment wp-att-40449"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-40449 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241002_120752-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1920" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241002_120752-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241002_120752-300x225.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241002_120752-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241002_120752-768x576.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241002_120752-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241002_120752-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Adam Fillius, electrical distribution program manager at Dominion Energy, stands next to the Italian honey bees and solar panels at the Black Bear Solar facility in Buckingham County. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Martha Moore, senior vice president of governmental relations with the Virginia Farm Bureau who has pushed for legislation to preserve farmland, said the concept of agrivoltaics is “interesting,” but the jury is still out as Virginia Tech conducts </span><a href="https://ralphphall.com/tag/agrivoltaics/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the viability of the concept.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re certainly open to the discussion,” said Moore, while also wanting some more details:  “What does that entail? How is it economically viable for farmers?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But for Burden, the project with Dominion is a “very promising” part of the transition to a natural environment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The other thing that&#8217;s promising is, what better opportunity do you have to be right in the middle of all the farmers to help educate them to strike a balance?” he said.</span></p>

(Courtesy of Amazon)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon announced Wednesday that it entered into an agreement with Dominion Energy to pay for the development of a small modular reactor as the utility explores building one at its North Anna Power Station, an existing traditional nuclear power plant in Louisa County.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At its second headquarters in Arlington, Amazon also announced an agreement with Energy Northwest to invest in building a small modular reactor in the state of Washington.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There&#8217;s a ton that we need to do between here and there, and there&#8217;s a lot of work that needs to go into this, but this is a really important milestone that we&#8217;re celebrating today,” Matt Garman, CEO of Amazon Web Services, said at the announcement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A small modular reactor, or SMR, is a newer, smaller form of nuclear technology that doesn’t emit carbon that fuels climate change. Part of SMR’s appeal is that parts can be manufactured off site and put together on site with smaller footprints, but isn’t yet commercially viable outside of Russia and China. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The announcements show a commitment by one of the worlds’ largest tech companies to produce a zero-carbon emitting energy source instead of relying on  natural gas to supply power for data centers, the energy intensive warehouses that store computers’ processing equipment, internet network servers and data drives.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 70% of the world’s data centers are concentrated in Northern Virginia. Amazon Web Services has some in </span><a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/amazon-acquires-three-data-centers-in-sterling-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loudoun County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is home to an area dubbed Data Center Alley. </span><a href="https://www.vedp.org/industry/data-centers" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">as a whole is home to about 150 hyperscale data centers, those that can support artificial intelligence and have increased computing and energy needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data centers have sparked public </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/28/virginia-explained-data-center-expansion-with-all-its-challenges-and-benefits/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">concerns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about land clearing, water usage and noise, but also the opportunity to pad local and state coffers with tax revenue. </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/sep/15/data-center-gas-emissions-tech" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data centers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have also been reported to be increasing emissions worldwide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SMRs could change that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our goal was by 2040 to get to a carbon-zero world,” Garman said. “We didn&#8217;t know how to do it. We didn&#8217;t necessarily know the path to get there. We knew it was important, and an important goal for us to set. Today is an enormous milestone along that path.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re very happy to partner with AWS,” said Ed Baine, president of Dominion Energy Virginia, adding, the agreement in the form of an MOU is “a way to help mitigate risks for customers while still advancing the technology.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SMRs can produce about 300 megawatts of electricity, enough to </span><a href="https://www.gevernova.com/content/dam/gepower-nuclear/global/en_US/documents/product-fact-sheets/SMR%20BWRX300%20Infographic.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">power</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about 300,000 homes, compared to a traditional reactor that produces about 1,000 megawatts, or 1 gigawatt. In its latest long term planning </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/16/dominion-pushes-for-renewables-more-natural-gas-in-latest-long-term-plan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">update</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Dominion expects to connect a total of 16 new data center campuses, totalling an energy need of about 1 gigawatt by the end of 2024, and those projections are expected to </span><a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/24052024/virginia-data-center-market-electricity-demand/#:~:text=Even%20with%20those%20commitments%2C%20the,Web%20Services%2C%20which%20Virginia%20Gov." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon’s announcement comes after Dominion Energy unveiled over the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/11/dominion-seeking-small-nuclear-reactor-proposals/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">summer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a request for proposals to design and determine the feasibility of an SMR at the North Anna Power Station. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s too early to say if that RFP would culminate in the Amazon-funded SMR. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal, state and local officials were on hand for the Amazon announcement, including U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, U.S. Democratic Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner and Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin.</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce/ For The Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Virginia’s largest utility, Dominion Energy, on Tuesday filed an <a class="c-link" href="https://www.dominionenergy.com/-/media/pdfs/global/company/IRP/2024-IRP-w_o-Appendices.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.dominionenergy.com/-/media/pdfs/global/company/IRP/2024-IRP-w_o-Appendices.pdf" data-sk="tooltip_parent">update</a> to its long-term electricity generation plan showing the majority of energy it expects to produce will come from renewable sources.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion’s revamped, non-binding Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) looks 15 years into the future to detail how power will be provided and calls for an “all-of-the-above” approach that includes more reliance on natural gas. The utility’s previous plan projection said about 95% of electricity generation would be pulled from </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/12/dominion-regulator-recommends-rejection-of-utilitys-long-term-plan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">renewable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sources. Tuesday’s updated plan calls for  about 80% of generation to be spurred by renewables.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are experiencing the largest growth in power demand since the years following World War II,&#8221; said Ed Baine, president of Dominion Energy Virginia. &#8220;No single energy source, grid solution or energy efficiency program will reliably serve the growing needs of our customers.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although subject to change as technology and demands evolve, the IRP is a glimpse into Dominion’s generation project proposals, which are paid for by ratepayers. This year’s update is a fine-tune adjustment to the plan unveiled </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/05/03/dominion-projects-new-gas-plants-advanced-nuclear-will-be-needed-to-meet-soaring-demand/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">last </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">year, which is when the public learned that the utility was reviving plans for natural gas plants, one of which was </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/27/dominion-still-facing-opposition-to-natural-gas-plant-proposal-after-location-change/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposed </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in Chesterfield County to meet growing energy needs, heightened by Dominion’s concern over renewable energy’s ability to produce enough power.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental and ratepayer groups decried last year’s plan and said it would contribute to the emission of greenhouse gasses that scientists say are exacerbating climate changes’ increasing storm intensity and frequencies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Critics also said the utility’s IRP conflicted with the Virginia Clean Economy Act, which passed in 2020 with the goal of decarbonizing Dominion’s grid by 2045 by transitioning to renewable generation sources. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law allows for a carbon-emitting, fossil fuel facility to remain online past 2045 if  grid reliability or the ability to provide enough power would be risked without it. Detractors countered by saying those risks are not a guaranteed reality and the plan would leave ratepayers on the hook for a polluting facility that will need to be shut down in years to come.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Dominion’s latest energy plan blatantly disregards the financial well-being and health of Virginia families,” said Kate Asquith, deputy director of energy and operations at Clean Virginia, a group founded by millionaire Michael Bills to counter Dominion’s influence in the state legislature. “By continuing to invest in gas-burning facilities, Dominion is not just raising bills—it&#8217;s locking Virginians into a future of higher costs and greater pollution.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The IRP update this year considers four different plans based on different regulation requirements. The most realistic plan, which incorporates rules under the VCEA and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency could increase a current monthly bill of $142.77 to $214.24 by the end of 2039 for a typical residential customer using 1,000 kilowatts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increased grid demand is the key driver of the updated forecast, with 5.5% annually now expected, compared to the 5.1% annual use projection Dominion relied on last year.  The new forecast also projects about 45 gigawatts of electricity that will be needed for use during the summer in 2039, an additional 6 gigawatts of power compared to what was expected last year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The utility is also pushing to own more generation sources to avoid purchasing power during peak demand moments in the summer and winter when cooling and heating units are cranking and the electricity cost </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/07/costs-for-electricity-during-extreme-weather-rising-dominion-says-nothing-to-worry-about-yet/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">skyrockets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Dominion’s plan also related an increased concern over the ability for solar, wind and battery storage sources to produce as much power as possible during cloudier, darker and colder months, known as an effective load carrying capability, or ELCC.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Data Center Coalition, a group advocating on behalf of the data center industry that is proliferating in Northern Virginia, has said they are committed to addressing the concern over renewables, even as fossil fuel generation sources that have been providing baseload power begin retiring under new state policies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The data center industry is leaning in as a collaborative partner with utilities, grid operators, policymakers, regulators, and other stakeholders at this transformative moment to advance and accelerate grid modernization and energy infrastructure to support Virginia&#8217;s — and the nation’s — economic growth and competitiveness,” said Josh Levi, president of the Data Center Coalition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost 6 gigawatts, up from about 3 gigawatts, of new natural gas fired generation is included in the plan, the equivalent of five more of the 1 gigawatt plants Dominion has proposed in Chesterfield. Tuesday’s IRP didn’t suggest locations for new facilities beyond the use of brownfield sites, which are already-disturbed lands that require remediation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan also explores adding combined cycle steam turbines to the generation mix, which could create electricity from the gas turbines to reduce emissions while also operating “more often to serve customers’ everyday loads.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nuclear is another part of the proposed generation plan, with the development of five small modular reactors slated to start in 2035. The update mentioned SMR development advancements as examples of the technology&#8217;s progression, including the design approval of NuScale Power, which was canceled amid ballooning costs, and the approval of </span><a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Wyoming-TerraPower-groundbreaking" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TerraPower’s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> construction permit in May. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The renewable generation sources included in the plan include: about 3.4 gigawatts of offshore wind the utility is pursuing; about 12 gigawatts of solar; and 4.5 gigawatts of battery storage. Along with the IRP update, Dominion also filed an application for about 1 gigawatts worth of solar projects that the State Corporation Commission will review. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The updated IRP discussed  how energy efficiency can reduce Virginia’s energy needs by 314 megawatts in the summer in 2024 and 553 megawatts by 2029.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion is also considering blending hydrogen with natural gas to further reduce emissions, and is performing a company analysis of environmental justice communities in Virginia. So far, it found that 78% of the total geographical area and 89% of the population qualify as EJ communities under the Virginia Environmental Justice Act that passed in 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With such a large proportion of the Commonwealth defined through the VEJA…as an EJ Community, avoidance is not possible,” the utility wrote.</span></p>

(Graham Moomaw / Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three Virginia residents’ legal challenge to state code tied to one of Virginia’s oldest traditions, the &#8220;right to retrieve&#8221; hunting law, has been dismissed, as, just ahead of deer hunting season, state officials will soon consider changes to the measure that allows hunters to go onto private property to get their dogs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">James Medeiros, of Dinwiddie County, and Mauricio Tover and Robert Pierce, who own property through Blue Wing LLC, of Halifax County, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/04/14/lawsuit-challenges-virginia-right-to-retrieve-law-for-hunting-dogs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sued</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources in April 2022 in Henrico County Circuit Court over a challenge to the law, stating that it amounted to the government turning their private property into a public use, which is known as a “taking.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking requires that the government compensate the property owners under the </span><a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/b-139543-o.m.#:~:text=The%20Fifth%20Amendment%20to%20the,made%20of%20the%20amount%20due." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fifth Amendment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s Just Compensation Clause and </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/constitution/article1/section11/#:~:text=No%20private%20property%20shall%20be,achieve%20the%20stated%20public%20use." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Article I, § 11</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the Virginia Constitution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An appeals court rejected a challenge to the lower court&#8217;s decision. The Supreme Court of Virginia affirmed that decision in September. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What is the ‘right to retrieve’ law?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s right to retrieve law was created in 1936 to allow fox and raccoon hunters to go onto other people&#8217;s property without permission in order to retrieve their hunting dogs. Now, deer and bear hunters use the law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hunters will let the dogs run around property they’re allowed to be on to scare up animals to harvest. But, sometimes, the hunted animals will run onto another property and the dogs will chase them there too, meaning the hunters will need to go retrieve them if they don’t return, even without the property owner’s permission.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The issue of roaming hunting dogs has escalated largely in the eastern and Middle Peninsula regions in the state. Three hunting dogs were </span><a href="https://6rdh5iebb.cc.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001Daf1qJAQfWpHi-2MeqYurIMLZ-Q1W_QrW5eti1Ne7D1fZ1pIWU1d1E3Ud0NeU5QSTxQD1b0k2ASHjLQKGXYYp2yh4WSAL9oDOEECaqckLb71UuY8LqQEFKKbBTr_LgFNGQxOs3rnh9Rpa5KxOofQ0GUQ0kTh_82sT110MUpZqXNvFadpuRL4GSERVqccvXg8kfOm04ifk9P9g8DC9WjpHTMUu1q7J_2lABqtYs8WuwDd2aVF2aDWTVmuLa0-505oDg6AgD7ulUW8iqeMFGuLWMvJKCZPs9aQz5sAnVH6svXEQynQivycDg==&amp;c=L-noH9Tmpgzwx2NtXZHA0oU0uzvwzS05uRJ3rZgNi9dYJwZDjhMpow==&amp;ch=HshoJDPV4W8xM4zeej1cbxgAqRI-gtHQ5DFCnMEw4XNjXZ5-jqExTw==" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">killed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in King and Queen County in January, and a hunting dog was killed by a Caroline County couple in 2019. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_38206" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:909px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/26/board-of-wildlife-resources-considering-changes-to-right-to-retrieve-laws/dog-hunting-hotspots/" rel="attachment wp-att-38206"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-38206" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/dog-hunting-hotspots.jpg" alt="" width="909" height="620" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/dog-hunting-hotspots.jpg 909w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/dog-hunting-hotspots-300x205.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/dog-hunting-hotspots-768x524.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 909px) 100vw, 909px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A screenshot of trespass complaints in Virginia referencing dogs.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hound hunters’ style is in contrast to still hunters, who sit in tree stands, quietly waiting for deer to cross their path before taking them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using dogs for hunting is now  part of the hunting industry that is estimated to contribute over $877 million annually to the state’s economy, but it dates back to the early colonial period, with hunters mounted on horses following foxes and raccoons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“George Washington and Thomas Jefferson were both avid foxhunters,” wrote Virginia Assistant Solicitor General Jordan Minot, who </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Medeiros-Appellee-Brief_AG.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">argued </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">against the challenge on behalf of DWR. “George Washington also had a specialized breed of raccoon dogs, gifts from the Marquis de Lafayette.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What was the basis of the lawsuit?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Medeiros, one of the appellants, said hunting dogs roaming onto his property caused a nuisance and loss of “time, money and even animals,” as the dogs “ripped” his free-range hens to pieces. Tover, similarly, said the dogs could spook horses being ridden at his stable, throwing and trampling riders. Pierce said his property is rented out to hikers, who could get caught in crossfire from the hunters. They said those risks justified compensation from the state.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The attorney for the appellants, Daniel Woislaw, of the Pacific Legal Foundation, argued in Henrico County, the appeals court and the Supreme Court of Virginia that the law clearly states its intent is to grant “access to private properties for the public use of hunting with dogs.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woislaw arguments relied on a case he previously argued and won in 2021, Cedar Point Nursery v. Hassid, which found that a California regulation allowing union organizers&#8217; access to private property constituted a taking, requiring compensation to property owners. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Minot, for the state, argued that nothing in the law prohibits land owners from building fences or barriers to prevent dogs and hunters from entering their property during hunts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also under the law, there’s an ability for civil remedies, such as property owners suing for damages to land or livestock, and prohibitions on hunters carrying weapons while retrieving their dogs. Hunters must also identify themselves or face a penalty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law is meant to create an exception under trespass penalties, Minot argued, adding, “the statute ‘takes’ no property rights from them.&#8221;   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woislaw argued that the law is not written in the same way other legal exceptions for criminal penalties are, but the Henrico County Circuit Court dismissed the case, citing that the law was only that, “an exception to criminal trespass,” and the “plaintiffs failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In July 2023, the court of appeals decided not to take up a challenge over the lower court&#8217;s decision because there wasn’t a transcript of the oral arguments in the case. Without testimony or new evidence, attorneys agreed to not request a court recorder during the oral argument. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woislaw argued to the Supreme Court in </span><a href="https://pacificlegal.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/2024.04.03-Medeiros-v-DWR-PLF-Opening-Brief.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">February</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that a transcript wasn’t necessary, and the circuit court’s order was “a complete and sufficient record for review.” But the Supreme Court of Virginia wrote in its Sept. 26 </span><a href="https://www.courts.state.va.us/courts/scv/orders_unpublished/230691.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “the Court is of the opinion that there is no reversible error in the judgment of the Court of Appeals,” ending the case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woislaw, in a statement to the Mercury, said he was “disappointed” in the supreme court ruling but that the issue likely isn’t over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Jim Medeiros and other property owners across the Commonwealth whose lands have been flooded by hunters and hounds each hunting season deserve a firmer and more broad-reaching precedent,” Woislaw said. “Virginia&#8217;s rural property owners are not ones to sit on their rights and it is very likely this question will be back before Virginia&#8217;s highest court before long.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorney General Jason Miyares, in a statement about the Supreme Court of Virginia’s decision, stated the law has existed “without incident,” for over 100 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia hunters treat their dogs as family, and there are fewer traditions more prized by rural Virginians than our hunting dogs,” Miyars said. “More than half of hunters in Virginia use hunting dogs, and fewer than 60 out of 6,000 hunting complaints involved trespass violations involving hunting dogs.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">New regulations?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Supreme Court ruling comes as the Board of Wildlife Resources is considering changes to the right to retrieve regulations at its meeting on Oct. 24. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following failed legislative attempts to change the law, months of work by a stakeholder advisory </span><a href="https://dwr.virginia.gov/hunters-landowners-sac/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">committee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led to two recommendations  made earlier this year. One would require hound hunters to use global positioning system </span><a href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/ViewStage.cfm?stageid=10290" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">collars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on their dogs to better track where they are. The other would require hound hunters to make “</span><a href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/ViewStage.cfm?stageid=10291" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reasonable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” attempts to prevent dogs from entering a property after “after receiving notification that the hunter&#8217;s hunting dogs are not desired on the landowner’s property.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a meeting in </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/26/board-of-wildlife-resources-considering-changes-to-right-to-retrieve-laws/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">March</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, property owners generally supported the measures as a way to control roaming dogs, but they also had concerns over a potential increase in conflicts from notifying hunters that their dogs aren’t welcome. The hunters saw the proposals as barriers to the tradition they’ve long loved and said the collars could be cost-prohibitive. One audience member had to be escorted out after a heated exchange with Board of Wildlife Resource member Woody Woodall.</span></p>

<p>The board ultimately voted to move forward with the recommendations, which have received 3,471 comments through the DWR website, mail, email and Town Hall website, the latter of which getting about 300 <a href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/comments.cfm?stageid=10290" target="_blank">comments </a>on the GPS collars recommendation, mostly in opposition, and 1,220 comments on the <a href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/comments.cfm?stageid=10291" target="_blank">notification</a> requirements, also mostly in opposition.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Board will consider these proposals at its October meeting on 10/24” said Shelby Crouch, a spokesperson for DWR, the state agency that oversees Virginia&#8217;s hunting regulations. “The exact effective date on any new regulation approved by the Board is at the Board’s discretion and in accordance with state code.”</span></p>

(Getty Images) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the tried and true Old Farmer’s </span><a href="https://www.almanac.com/winter-extended-forecast-farmers-almanac" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almanac</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is calling for warmer temps and less snow this winter season, cold weather is on the way. The state and utilities throughout it are now accepting applications to help pay for residents’ heating bills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Social Services offers the energy assistance </span><a href="https://www.dss.virginia.gov/benefit/ea/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which includes fuel assistance to offset heating bills from several utilities including Dominion Energy, Appalachian Power Company, Virginia Natural Gas and more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The department also offers crisis assistance, which can cover equipment upgrade costs as well as heating bills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applications for fuel assistance are being accepted until the second Friday in November, the 15th. The application window for crisis assistance equipment upgrades is Nov. 1 through March 15. Virginians can apply for crisis assistance to pay for bills between the “first workday in January through March 15.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be eligible for assistance, residents’ income must not exceed 150% of the federal poverty </span><a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/topics/poverty-economic-mobility/poverty-guidelines" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">level</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which for a family of four is $31,200. To determine eligibility and submit applications, residents can visit the state’s website, </span><a href="https://commonhelp.virginia.gov/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CommonHelp</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and visit local department of social service </span><a href="https://www.dss.virginia.gov/localagency/index.cgi" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">offices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/05/application-windows-for-heating-and-cooling-assistance-could-expand-under-virginia-bill/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this past session from Del. Phil Hernandez, D-Norfolk, allowed VDSS to expand the application window, since customers in need may not know and ask for it until the middle of the winter season. But, the bill was contingent on additional funding, which hasn’t been provided yet, meaning the application period may actually not be expanded until 2026. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of people can’t </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/12/utility-benefit-assistance-program-isnt-reaching-enough-virginians-state-report-says/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">afford</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to pay all of their bills,” said Dana Wiggins, director of consumer advocacy at the Virginia Poverty Law Center, adding residents should still apply now for the energy assistance program in case they need help. “They’re making really hard choices.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More directly associated with utilities, Dominion Energy offers the EnergyShare </span><a href="https://www.dominionenergy.com/virginia/billing/billing-options/energyshare" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, historically funded at $13 million by shareholders. Recipients can get $600 in assistance without income restrictions and the application period is Oct. 1 and May 31. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The utility, and Appalachian Power Company, also have a </span><a href="https://dss.virginia.gov/benefit/PIPP/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Percentage of Income Payment Plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which caps monthly electric heating bills to 10% of the monthly income of a customer making less than 150% of the federal poverty level. After 12 consecutive months of on-time payments, any balances are eliminated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Natural Gas, which serves customers in the Northern Neck, Middle Peninsula and the Norfolk region, also has an EnergyShare </span><a href="https://www.virginianaturalgas.com/residential/billing-and-payment-options/energy-assistance-programs.html#:~:text=web%20de%20ClearPoint.-,Virginia%20Natural%20Gas%20EnergyShare%20Program,customers%2C%20including%20seniors%20and%20veterans." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the Salvation Army.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We recognize that colder temperatures lead to increased energy consumption, which can strain household budgets,&#8221; said Shannon Pierce, President of Virginia Natural Gas, in a statement. &#8220;VNG is dedicated to informing our customers about the resources available to them during the winter heating season.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another practice to lower bills is through increasing </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/12/national-group-finds-low-income-residents-in-richmond-are-severely-energy-burdened/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">energy efficiency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the idea of weatherizing, or sealing up and insulating homes, as well upgrading equipment to use less energy, said Chelsea Harnish, executive director of the Virginia Energy Efficiency Council. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LIHEAP funding for </span><a href="https://www.dhcd.virginia.gov/wx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">weatherization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is available through the Department of Housing and Community Development. Old Dominion Electric Cooperative, which provides the power for electric cooperatives, also offers energy assistance to those customers, Harnish said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can give a man a fish or teach a man how to fish,” said Harnish. “The point is, with heating assistance you’re not really solving the problem, whereas if you&#8217;re providing weatherization assistance and making their home energy efficient, that will help reduce their energy and they will not continue to rely on assistance.”</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Energy use is skyrocketing across Virginia with the proliferation of new data centers, but as it turns out, we are not alone. Across the country, the rise of artificial intelligence and its voracious demand for power has prompted tech companies to locate new data centers wherever they think they can secure the necessary land, energy and water supplies. The result is upending utility planning everywhere. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One utility in Ohio has </span><a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/aep-ohio-data-center-crypto-rates-puc/716150/#:~:text=Under%20AEP%20Ohio's%20proposal%2C%20data,GW%20or%20more%2C%20he%20said." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposed a requirement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that data centers commit to 10-year service contracts requiring them to pay at least 90% of the cost of the electricity they ask for, regardless of whether the data centers end up using that much power.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AEP Ohio says it has received service inquiries from data centers totaling 30 gigawatts of new power demand, and that serving all those new data centers would require a massive investment in expensive transmission lines. The utility wants to ensure other ratepayers aren’t stuck with the bill if the data centers leave town, if the AI boom goes bust, or if technological breakthroughs reduce the amount of energy they need. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data center industry is apoplectic, but other utilities and their regulators are watching closely to see if this is a requirement they should adopt, too. This includes Virginia’s State Corporation Commission, which on October 2 </span><a href="https://www.scc.virginia.gov/getattachment/5cb8de50-1f06-4ba3-ae9e-399da0c26c10/PUR-2024-00144-Scheduling-Order-and-Notice.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a technical conference on data centers to discuss “issues related to servicing this new electrical load.” Specific topics on the agenda include minimum bills for data centers, contract term lengths and whether certain transmission and/or generation costs should be directly assigned to a new customer class consisting of large-use customers like data centers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The conference is scheduled for December 16, and those who want to participate as panelists can nominate themselves on or before October 22. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AEP Ohio’s solution is not as novel as it might sound. It is normal for new industrial customers to be required to guarantee they will buy at least most of the electricity they say they will need. It’s a reasonable ask: a utility that spends millions of dollars on infrastructure to serve a new factory needs to make sure costs are covered if the factory folds up shop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Normally, though, the customer has to guarantee it will buy 60-70% of the electricity it has asked for, not 90%. Tech companies complain it is unfair to require more of data centers than of other industries. If the higher number is approved, they warn, they may decide to locate in some other state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Seriously? If they were to use that talking point in Virginia, the response </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/07/10/virginia-sprawl-data-centers/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">from residents</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> might be, “Is that a threat or a promise?”)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, there are good reasons to treat data centers differently. One is the sheer scale of the energy demand involved, meaning a lot more money is at risk. AEP Ohio projects that electricity use in Central Ohio will </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/09/13/data-centers-power-grid-ohio/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than double</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between 2018 and 2028 due to the growth of the data center industry.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another concern is that data centers operate more like warehouses than factories. It’s hard to move a factory, so it is likely to use a predictable level of electricity over a long period of time. By contrast, the contents of a warehouse (in this case, racks of servers) can be moved somewhere else if market conditions change. I </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/10/geothermal-energy-is-having-a-moment-could-it-power-virginias-data-centers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote recently</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about the potential of enhanced geothermal energy as a low-cost, renewable technology that is already starting to outcompete fossil fuels in western states. Utilities are right to worry about tech companies pulling out to chase cheaper, greener energy elsewhere. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, there is the question of whether this enormous energy demand is as real as it feels right now. Analysts have been questioning whether </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2024/08/07/is-the-ai-bubble-about-to-burst/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI might be a bubble</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If companies can’t make it profitable soon, the demand they project might evaporate, leaving a lot of data centers empty and utilities with infrastructure no one needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another, happier route to lower energy demand could be more energy-efficient operations. The data center industry as a whole has cut energy waste significantly over the years, and research suggests there may be further gains in efficiency coming. </span><a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/opinions/the-dual-pronged-energy-saving-potential-of-quantum-computers/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quantum computing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is frequently cited as one tool to unlock efficiencies. More dramatically, University of Minnesota researchers recently developed hardware that </span><a href="https://cse.umn.edu/college/news/researchers-develop-state-art-device-make-artificial-intelligence-more-energy" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">they say</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can lower the energy consumption of AI applications by “a factor of 1000.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quite possibly, the best  outcome for society would be for the data center boom to go bust, reducing any need for utilities to burn more fossil fuels and relieving communities of impacts on neighborhoods, parks and water resources. But utility regulators can’t wait around to see if that happens. They have to plan according to today’s expectations, which include data center demand growth of </span><a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/AI-poised-to-drive-160-increase-in-power-demand" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">160% by 2030</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, the response from the General Assembly, the governor, and utilities like Dominion Energy has so far amounted to nothing – or more precisely, worse than nothing. At the governor’s behest, the General Assembly actually increased tax subsidies for the wealthy industry in a bid to attract more data centers, while Dominion declared plans for expensive new fossil fuel generation and transmission to feed the demand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That makes the SCC’s decision to wade in especially timely. The Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission is expected to release a </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/resolutions/2024_Data%20centers_JLARC.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data center study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the end of the year, and when it meets again in January, the General Assembly is likely to see a repeat of many of </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/15/as-data-centers-continue-spreading-across-virginia-state-lawmakers-propose-new-development-rules/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">last year’s failed bills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> addressing data center efficiency, siting and ratepayer protection. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the SCC can bring some sanity and cohesion to the discussion, it will be not a minute too soon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking to reporters in Richmond on Tuesday, Youngkin highlighted the progress made in restoring services in Virginia’s hardest-hit areas, especially in the mountainous regions in the western part of the commonwealth. He noted that power had been restored to all but less than 200 customers in remote areas, with full service expected soon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, all cell phone towers in the region have been repaired, ensuring communication abilities are back online.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boil water advisories for drinking water are down from 35 systems to 19 in the areas hardest hit by Helene, as water can still be used for other purposes. Test kits for well users are available at a disaster recovery </span><a href="https://www.vaemergency.gov/recover/hurricane-helene" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including one at the Damascus Shopping Mall in Washington County.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two primary roads and 16 secondary roads remain impassable, Youngkin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State officials and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are concerned about debris and chemicals in Claytor Lake in Pulaski County, and South Holston Lake in Washington County, as the bodies of water are used for hydroelectric power generation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe this will be a 10 to 12-day period of just assessing and getting cleanup personnel on site,” Youngkin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medical crews remain in the area, but Virginia does “not have a shortage,” of fluid </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2024-10-07/intravenous-fluids-shortage-baxter-international-marion-north-carolina" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">IV</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> supplies, Youngkin said. Health systems, however, are still determining if elective procedures can be delayed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Employment Commission is helping with job losses, Youngkin added, and the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services is working with the </span><a href="https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2024/10/04/usda-offers-resources-adds-flexibilities-disaster-assistance" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">United States Department of Agriculture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to assist with the potential “hundreds of millions of dollars of lost income from our agricultural community.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Individual assistance has been </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/10/05/list-of-localities-declared-under-a-major-disaster-grows-to-nine-in-southwest-virginia/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expanded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the counties of Montgomery and Pulaski, as public assistance for local governments, has been expanded to Lee County. Most of those who have sought assistance have primarily used the </span><a href="https://www.fema.gov/assistance/individual" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FEMA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> app, Youngkin said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And less than two weeks after Helene hit the United States Southeast, claiming the lives of two in Virginia and over 227 people around the </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-death-toll-asheville-north-carolina-34d1226bb31f79dfb2ff6827e40587fc" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">region</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Hurricane Milton is forecast to slam into the western coast of Florida.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Milton is expected to head across the state into the Atlantic Ocean without an impact to Virginia, unless there’s an unexpected turn, which Youngkin said on Tuesday gave him confidence to deploy search and rescue and emergency management teams to support North Carolina. a He also sent the Helicopter Aquatic Rescue Team, a partnership with Virginia National Guard and Chesterfield County firefighter and EMS crews, to Florida in preparation for Milton’s arrival.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked by the Virginia Mercury about protections for Southwest Virginia in the event of future flood events since the hurricane </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/24/health-department-urges-preparedness-ahead-of-peak-storm-season/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">season</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lasts until Nov. 30, Youngkin said that “protections are hard.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As much as we’d like to build a giant wall, in addition to the wall we should build at the southern border, we have to be prepared,” Youngkin said, renewing his request from last week to not get “</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/04/youngkin-shares-update-on-helene-damage-in-virginia-urges-to-not-be-distracted-by-climate-change/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">distracted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” by discussions about climate change. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have great capabilities in order to make sure that loss of life is protected against, but, on top of that, we also know that our response capabilities are extraordinary as well,” Youngkin said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the demand for electrification grows, companies and specialists in Virginia are helping to develop the workforce necessary to build and maintain electric vehicles, connect consumers to electric transportation, and uncover resources to power low-emission vehicles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, to attract and retain employees and build, sell, and maintain electric and low-emission vehicles, leaders in the respective industries said the commonwealth needs to provide incentives and support efforts to continue building an efficient charging infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leaders in the trade industry said one of the biggest misperceptions is that people can’t be successful unless they go to college. Experts said it&#8217;s one of the driving forces behind the shortages of electricians, mechanics and technicians. Trade workers are needed in the electric vehicle industry, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don Hall, president and CEO of the Virginia Automobile Dealers Association, said Virginia can help by continuing its commitment to career and technical education (CTE) training as well as working with the federal government to develop an accessible and convenient charging infrastructure and create ways to invest and incentivize EV purchases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are many things the state can do, but both parties have been lacking in that arena,” said Hall. “Yet one party over the other says, ‘this is where we need to be’ [and] ‘we need to be selling more of them.’ Okay, I agree, but help us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not clear how state efforts on workforce development are focused on electric vehicles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked why Gov. Glenn Youngkin nixed a proposed battery manufacturing plant slated for Virginia’s Southside, press secretary Martinez said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the governor “decided not to finance technology affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party using Virginia taxpayer money,” and pointed to other clean energy jobs the state is </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2024/07/09/south-korean-company-plans-to-build-681-million-offshore-wind-submarine-cable-plant-in-chesapeake/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pursuing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia was </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/11/virginia-americas-top-state-for-business-nations-best-schools-solid-infrastructure.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">named</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the top state to do business in 2024 by CNBC. But the governor admitted that the commonwealth still has work to do in the area of workforce development, after CNBC ranked the state ninth on that measure, largely because of the shortage of educators moving to the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin told CNBC that the workforce grew by 240,000 since he took office in 2022, but that growth hasn’t included electric vehicle makers at a rate other Southeastern states are experiencing. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Jobs: Building electric vehicles</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia businesses and higher education institutions are becoming involved with testing and developing semiconductor chips and building electric vehicles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, Virginia </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/virginia-micron-semiconductor-chips-lynchburg-batteries/article_973cc5fa-fda5-11ee-99bd-076706ef8fb7.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">settled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on an incentive package with manufacturers to develop batteries and semiconductor chips used to support vehicles, after the country experienced a shortage in chip manufacturing. Micron, one of those manufacturers, designs the advanced fabrication for many of its chips in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delbert Parks, vice president and site executive at Micron Technology, said the chips are the backbone of the EVs. The chips also drive advancements in power electronics and electrification efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also said developing a “robust and diverse talent pipeline” is essential for driving innovation in the semiconductor industry and supporting EV trends; some of that talent could come from . community colleges and universities. Students and university researchers can design and manufacture cutting-edge solutions, meet growing production demands, improve energy efficiency and maintain global competitiveness in the semiconductor industry and the EV revolution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Micron has partnered with several Virginia colleges including Virginia Tech and Norfolk State University to grow the workforce and provide experiential learning opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The semiconductor industry is facing a global talent gap requiring industry, academic and government partnership to ensure we create pathways for students, K-PhD, to enter into our industry,&#8221; Parks said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the help of a grant from the National Science Foundation, the Bradley Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Virginia Tech has been working to advance semiconductor research and education. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The department also hosts workshops and summer camps to encourage high school students to pursue careers in semiconductor-related fields, and has been putting more emphasis on offering semiconductor chip courses in light of the nation’s shortage of chips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volvo Trucks North America is one of the vehicle manufacturers in Virginia promoting the sale of heavy electric trucks, including tractor trailers.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40032" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1024px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-40032" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/NRV-Site-Aerial-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/NRV-Site-Aerial-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/NRV-Site-Aerial-300x169.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/NRV-Site-Aerial-768x432.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/NRV-Site-Aerial-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/NRV-Site-Aerial-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  The Volvo Group North America New River Valley Plant located in Dublin, VA. (Courtesy of Volvo Group North America)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calling itself the largest manufacturing employer in Southwest, Virginia, the company employs about 36,000 people at its plant in the New River Valley and says its been committed “from the beginning” to building an educated workforce for those selling and working on the trucks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“During the dealer certification process, all employees receive safety and basic EV training and a minimum of two technicians per location must be certified,” said Bobby Compton, product marketing manager at Volvo Trucks North America. “Traditionally, these technicians have experience working on traditional (internal combustion engine) powertrains and are adding the skill set for zero-emissions-vehicles.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has benefited from the Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which equates to a $40,000 tax credit for buying an electric battery truck. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The IRA, President Joe Biden’s landmark law regarded as the largest investment in climate policy in the country&#8217;s history, has offered tax credits to incentivize the creation of electric manufacturing facilities throughout the country. The Southeast has taken advantage of those offerings, giving the region the name “battery belt.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The policy has been using funding from the IRA and 48C tax credits to spur EV component development. This is </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/podcasts/the-daily/biden-electric-vehicles.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">intended</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to create domestic manufacturing and make EV purchase tax rebates, which require components to be made in the U.S.A., more accessible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Virginia has not been part of that movement, although it has come close. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state almost became home to a battery plant in Danville, but the Richmond Times-Dispatch </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/ford-disputes-reporting-on-pittsylvania-county-pick-for-battery-project/article_3fce0f3e-9697-11ed-9b9d-d309e4bf363a.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in January 2023 Youngkin pulled the plug because of a concern over connections to China.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“His concerns were validated when Ford scaled </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/business/ford-pausing-construction-of-battery-plant-that-had-been-considered-in-virginia/article_480a2dae-5bf4-11ee-9ec7-ffe193373d83.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">back</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its Michigan battery plant plans, resulting in fewer jobs than anticipated, and the Defense Authorization Act </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-19/us-will-ban-pentagon-procuring-batteries-from-china-s-catl-byd" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">banned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Pentagon from purchasing batteries based on (Chinese-based Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited technology),” Martinez said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, in Dec. 2023, Microporous, a Tennessee-based company that manufactures lead-acid battery separators, was the recipient of a $100 million grant from the federal government through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to potentially invest over $1 billion and create 282 jobs to build a lithium-ion battery plant in Virginia’s Pittsylvania County. But no final decision has been made and the company is considering building the plant in other states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brad Reed, vice president of corporate development at Microporous, said the U.S. Department of Energy and the Virginia Economic Development Partnership are working to finalize a grant agreement and incentives package before year’s end.  Among the other states, Virginia was the “best for support offered in the area of workforce recruitment and development,” Reed said, but offered lower financial services compared to North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Ohio.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No final decisions or public announcements will be made until these are finalized and approved,” Reed said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And in April, Applied Materials, the second company alongside Micron to receive a state incentive package, received $100 million in federal funding to open a battery plant in Lynchburg. The public </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/04/22/5-ways-the-battery-plant-planned-for-lynchburg-is-significant/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">saw</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this move as a way for Virginia to enter the battery belt industry. But in August, </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/08/02/battery-plant-backed-by-100-million-federal-grant-no-longer-planned-for-lynchburg/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">news</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> broke that the company had scrapped its plans without a clear answer as to why.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked what other EV component manufacturing plants the state was pursuing, Martinez, with the governor’s office, said “the administration is actively working on several economic development opportunities,” and pointed to successful 48C tax credit awardings, used to spur domestic clean energy development, luring in other engineering-related manufacturing operations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those included a $681 million investment from GreenLink LS in </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2024/july/name-1030531-en.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chesapeake</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to make a submarine transmission cable for offshore wind projects, and an over $400 million investment by Topsoe, a carbon emission </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2024/may/name-1026403-en.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reduction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> company, in Chesterfield County. Those investments received $235 million in the 48C tax credits, “the third most of any state in the nation,” Martinez said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The administration has and will continue to leverage available federal dollars to unleash economic growth in Virginia,” Martinez said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Southern Alliance for Clean Energy and Atlas Public Policy </span><a href="https://www.cleanenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/Transportation-Electrification-in-the-Southeast-2023-Report.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">found</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the end of last year that Florida, Alabama, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee and Georgia, had announced the addition of 65,242 manufacturing jobs and $60 billion in investment by building out the battery belt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noting that announcements of the jobs may not always come to fruition, the report stated, “One factor in the growth of EV jobs in the Southeast is the significant economic incentive packages offered by state and local governments.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Jobs: Maintaining EVs</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While EVs require less maintenance, Matt Shepanek, vice president for credential testing programs with the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence (ASE), said it&#8217;s a “misconception” that there won’t be any jobs available for technicians in the EV industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With EVs, you don&#8217;t have some of the maintenance items, like there&#8217;s no oil and power steering fluid and things like that, but there&#8217;s still plenty of things that technicians need to do, as far as diagnostics and just overall vehicle care.” Shepnaek said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two years ago, ASE created a free </span><a href="https://ase.com/ev" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EV safety standards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> document, which the institute and members in the vehicle industry developed. The institute also started providing testing programs to help technicians and salespeople become certified to work and provide information to consumers about electric vehicles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shepanek said well over 5,000 people have participated in both testing programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For years, car manufacturers have also trained technicians to work on their vehicles at service stations and shops and taught salespeople to understand vehicle details important to consumers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dan Banister, chair of the Virginia Automobile Dealers Association and owner of Banister Automotive, said car manufacturers such as Nissan and Ford have provided extensive training for his technicians at five dealerships, four of which are in Virginia and the other in Maryland. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the age of electrification, Banister said the role of technicians has changed, with some experts primarily using tools such as wrenches and now computers. He credits secondary schools and community colleges, including those in Chesapeake, for creating opportunities for students and the automotive industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We need people out there willing to get their certifications (and) to help with all the skills we&#8217;re lacking right now,” Banister said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banister said it’s important to have certified employees available to meet the demands of all their customers including those with EVs. On average, he said technicians work on four to five EVs a month with warranty work or tire replacements.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a real need for electricians trained to install chargers and charging stations around the commonwealth, with electric vehicle owners and future consumers increasingly searching for access. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charles Skelly, business manager with IBEW Local 666, which represents and trains electricians, said the organization is helping new and experienced electricians prepare for the wave of charger installations. Those installations require electricians to be familiar with electrical load calculations and code requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;With the manufacturing jobs that are coming countrywide from the IRA and other laws that have come out recently &#8230; there&#8217;s just an extreme demand for electricians right now,&#8221; Skelly said. Class sizes have increased from 20 to 25 students per class in the last few years. The number of classes  per semester has increased from two to three this fall, with 75 new apprentices starting. The program has 300 apprentices total. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://evitp.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Training Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the primary program for electricians to complete to install chargers, requires applicants to have 8,000 documented hours of fieldwork. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re neck deep in making sure we&#8217;re prepared for the work,&#8221; Skelly said, adding that their training can vary from residential to commercial and industrial levels. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Jobs: Uncovering resources</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The International Energy Agency found that 1.46 carbon dioxide equivalents, the same amount produced by 164 gallons of gasoline, are emitted when mining for lithium carbonate, a component of lithium-ion batteries that power a majority of electric vehicles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there are no major mining operations in the commonwealth, mineral mining is one practice in Virginia that could yield some success in collecting non-fuel minerals. However, there are environmental concerns about digging for resources, and processing minerals can add more emissions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the IEA found that making an electric vehicle emits less climate-changing emissions than gas-power internal combustion engine cars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Total lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of EVs are around half those of internal combustion engine cars on average, with the potential for a further 25% reduction with low-carbon electricity,” the IEA </span><a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/sustainable-and-responsible-development-of-minerals" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trip Pollard, with the Southern Environmental Law Center, said that’s the evidence to support electric vehicles instead of ones that guzzle gas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Overall, when you look at the environmental toll, you know the entire process of a gas-powered vehicle and an electric vehicle,” Pollard said. “Hands down, you&#8217;re better off with electric vehicles, which is why we support that transition.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40119" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-40119" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/deq-charger-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/deq-charger-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/deq-charger-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/deq-charger-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/deq-charger-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/deq-charger-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  EVgo chargers deployed by the Department of Environmental Quality at a gas station in Richmond. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. has a ban on </span><a href="https://www.state.gov/conflict-minerals/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">conflict minerals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which come from countries known to have human rights violations. Cobalt, a mineral explored as a more efficient power source for batteries, can come from the Democratic Republic of Congo. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, Sen. Bill Stanley, R-Franklin, introduced a bill this past session to prevent public bodies, including state and local governments, from procuring an electric vehicle unless the manufacturer swears child labor wasn’t involved in the process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At an August meeting when discussing his bill, Stanley said finding “clean energy sources … is a policy decision that the commonwealth has made and rightly so.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Stanley continued, “I still believe that we can make a general inquiry and determine what nation states, what countries are mining this cobalt rationally, reasonably and without harm to their children or to their citizenry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scapegoating electric vehicles in that pursuit isn’t fair, Pollard said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If we&#8217;re really concerned about this issue, which is a serious issue, it should apply to all products, don&#8217;t single out EVs,” Pollard said. “I think there are concerns that need to be addressed, and, absolutely, (the SELC is) involved in a couple of projects that are mining projects in the south. They&#8217;re pushing for more steps to be taken to minimize any adverse environmental impacts.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has nearly all of the 50 critical minerals in the state in trace elements, including Cobalt, which has a “moderate potential” for economic development, and lithium, which has an “unknown potential.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sixteen of the elements have high potential for development,” said Tarah Kesteron, a spokeswoman for Virginia Energy. “These include the 14 rare earth elements (REEs), titanium, and zirconium.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One company that mines for titanium and zirconium is Atlantic Strategic Metals. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement on the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/12/petersburg-based-company-to-reactivate-mining-operations-in-dinwiddie-sussex/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reactivation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the mine in Dinwiddie and Sussex counties, Christopher Wyatt, the CEO said that Virginia had “a knowledgeable and talented workforce.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More broadly, Virginia is exploring ways to procure rare earth elements from waste </span><a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2024/SD3/PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">coal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as well as </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/08/08/four-takeaways-from-southwest-virginias-critical-mineral-investigation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">innovative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ways to find critical minerals in the earth or mined coal, through an initiative with Virginia Tech called Evolve Central Appalachia, or CAPP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The work around minerals is part of the transition that the Natural Resources Defense Council said can be more affordable than spending  $1,117 a year to fuel a gas-powered vehicle, compared to $485 a year to fuel an electric one, the group found, citing a University of Michigan </span><a href="https://www.nrdc.org/stories/electric-vs-gas-cars-it-cheaper-drive-ev" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The cost saving also comes with benefits for humans and the planet they call home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At 20 pounds of co2 for every </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/greenhouse-gas-emissions-typical-passenger-vehicle#:~:text=How%20can%20burning%20one%20gallon,the%20carbon%20and%20hydrogen%20separate." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gallon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that’s burned, this is a phenomenal number of carbon dioxide molecules that are released in gasoline,” said Harned. “I think that the social cost of carbon, the impacts around people&#8217;s lives, the refugee movements, the economic harms from the additional storms, the heat events and the loss of life, that will over time reduce our consumption.”</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin, in blue jeans, assesses storm damage caused by Hurricane Helene in Grayson County on Sept. 29, 2024. (Courtesy of Christian Martinez, Office of Governor Glenn Youngkin)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Restoration efforts in Southwest Virginia continue after Hurricane Helene’s deadly impact, as Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin asserted that blaming the intense storm and the future unpredictability of weather on climate change was a distraction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While giving an update on damage assessments from the storm that made landfall in Florida last week and dumped several inches of rain, with two confirmed tornados, in the mountainous regions of Virginia, Youngkin urged people to call 1-800-621-3362, go to FEMA.gov or use a FEMA app download to seek help and start documenting the application process for federal recovery funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Also, there are regional centers that are being established by FEMA and (partner)with the Virginia Department of Emergency Management in the area,” Youngkin said, adding people are going door-to-door to help people fill out forms as part of the Major Disaster Declaration the state </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/02/post-helene-virginia-granted-major-disaster-declaration-access-to-federal-funding-for-recovery/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">received</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a really important process,” Youngkin said. “Many people don’t know how to fill out these forms. Getting them the help that they need is critically important.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the update from federal, state and local officials at the Virginia Department of Emergency Management Emergency Operations Center in North Chesterfield Friday morning, VDEM spokesman John Elmore reported that 519 homes had been counted as damaged so far, with 44 destroyed, and 475 damaged or affected. The total number of impacted businesses, ranging from small ones to large manufacturers, had climbed to 83. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These counts, which don’t include damages to local government buildings, are expected to go up. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two people died in the immediate wake of the storm, and Youngkin said that everybody has been accounted for. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 13,700 people are still without power in the region, Youngkin said, after about 96% of outages had been restored. Crews are using helicopters to deliver telephone poles to the hard to reach areas that remain. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Out of the 287 cell-phone service towers that were knocked out, 14 still needed to be fixed, the governor added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, 28 water systems are under a boil advisory, and Youngkin urged everyone in the region to flush systems and seek replacement pumps, particularly for well users that comprise a vast majority of residents in the area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schools in “many counties” remained closed Friday, while others were having delays, Youngkin said. Waivers have been requested by the federal government so meal services for disadvantaged families could be extended to all school children. About 40,000 meals had been given out, in addition to grassroots efforts, as a medical reserve corps of professionals from other regions in the states have trekked to the impacted area to help with medication, oxygen tanks and wheelchairs that “have been just washed away.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two primary roads remain impassible, and 52 secondary rods are closed, and U.S. Route 58 has about a 1.5 mile stretch that is “absolutely impossible,” Youngkin added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is going to be a long restoration rebuild process, but I am confident that if we can just keep focus, and not allow the standard ‘it’s been two weeks now and we’re moving on to the next issue’ to settle in, because I will not allow that to happen,” Youngkin said, adding that Southwest Virginia will rebuild “stronger than it was before.”</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin speaks to the staff at the Virginia Department of Emergency Management. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While taking questions from reporters, Youngkin declined to share his thoughts about climate change’s influence when a Virginia Mercury reporter asked about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nobody get distracted by that question,” said Youngkin, who in 2022 acknowledged climate change was a “</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-virginia-utilities-nuclear-power-generation-df7fa2571b5d875ac1fe9af1e0b52c35" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">threat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” in an interview about his energy plan, which called for a re-evaluation of the state’s Virginia Clean Economy Act. The landmark 2020 VCEA seeks to decarbonize the grid by mid-century to halt human-caused </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/06/12/as-smoke-from-canada-enters-virginia-research-links-climate-change-with-more-frequent-wildfires/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">climate change</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are right now in a moment of providing people a pathway back to hope,” Youngkin continued, before talking about the gratitude he received for his visits, including an afternoon visit by U.S. Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, the Republican vice presidential nominee, on Thursday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yesterday, when Senator Vance was there and everyone was saying ‘thank you for coming,’ this is a region of Virginia and America that has historically been forgotten,” Youngkin said. “I just have no time for folks who are trying to politicize this moment.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell said on the CBS news program </span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/deanne-criswell-fema-administrator-face-the-nation-transcript-09-29-2024/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Face the Nation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Sunday that  “In the past, when we would look at damage from hurricanes, it was primarily wind damage, with some water damage.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But now we’re seeing so much more water damage, and I think that is a result of the warm waters, which is a result of climate change,” Criswell said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After FEMA had denied relief requests from residents in the region in 2022 and 2021, the state dipped into $830 million in revenues from a carbon-market that requires electricity producers to purchase allowances for carbon emissions as another attempt to halt climate change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state directed $29 million of the funds, which were initially intended to increase flood protections and make homes energy efficient, to provide relief to residents. Youngkin pulled Virginia out of the market — the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative — calling it a “hidden tax,” since utilities can recover the costs of allowances from </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/05/regulators-approve-request-from-dominion-to-drop-rggi-fee-on-customer-bills/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ratepayers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislators used a budget amendment to appropriate any unused funds, which amounted to about $40 million at the start of the year, according to a </span><a href="https://www.wvtf.org/news/2024-10-03/youngkin-virginia-legislators-mull-legislative-steps-in-helene-recovery" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">by Radio IQ. A special session would be needed to pass a similar budget amendment or legislation to support the region ahead of the regular session scheduled to start in January.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve got to assess what we need,” Youngkin said when asked if he would call one.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a news release, the Federal Emergency Management Agency announced Democratic President Joe Biden’s approval of the declaration, which the state sought  in the days following the storm. The aid, which can come in the form of grants, low-interest loans and other programs, will allow residents to seek individual assistance money to repair damages to homes and property. Local governments may apply  for public assistance to reimburse some of their costs incurred while responding to the storm. First responders and the National Guard performed over 70 swift water rescues statewide to save residents from rising floodwaters. Two people died as a result of the storm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People can </span><a href="http://disasterassistance.gov/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">apply online</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, through the </span><a href="http://fema.gov/app" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FEMA App</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or by calling the FEMA helpline at 1-800-621-3362, according to a FEMA spokesperson.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Long road to recovery</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of 1 p.m. Wednesday, Appalachian Power Company said about 36,300 customers remain without power in Virginia, after the utility saw a peak of 282,000 customers without power in Virginia, West Virginia and Tennessee on Friday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, FEMA officials began </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/09/30/fema-aid-to-southwest-virginia-to-be-determined-in-the-wake-of-hurricane-helene/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">assessing </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">how much might be requested from the federal government, according to Cardinal News. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A group of U.S. Senators, including Virginia’s Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, wrote to Senate leadership on Oct. 1 that early estimates of damage and economic loss will reach over “tens of billions of dollars.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who called the storm the most significant disaster in the state since 2011, said Wednesday he was thankful the state received the major disaster declaration and expressed gratitude to Warner, Kaine and U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, the representative for the 9th Congressional District spanning much of the affected region, who all signed on to a letter seeking the previous emergency declaration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This will allow us to get resources to our impacted communities and Virginians as fast as possible,” Youngkin said. “We will continue to work to add jurisdictions as additional assessments occur in impacted areas.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin has also praised the cooperation from FEMA’s cooperation, including during preparation for the storm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But some community advocates question whether or not the FEMA funds will actually reach people in Virginia’s impacted communities, because the money may </span><a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/biden-mulls-calling-congress-back-to-pass-disaster-funds/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">not </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">have been provided in the temporary budget deal, called a “continuing resolution,” that Biden signed on Sept. 26 to keep the federal government running.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A FEMA spokesperson said the resolution provided “sufficient funding for disaster relief fund needs.” But Appalachian Voices, a nonprofit grassroots organization working in Virginia’s mountainous communities, said FEMA had already exhausted its disaster relief funds prior to Helene and isn’t scheduled to reconvene until Nov. 12.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If we’ve learned anything in the almost 20 years since Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, we know that robust federal funding is critical to our success right now,” said Chelsea Barnes, director of government affairs and strategy at Appalachian Voices. “Appalachians are resilient, and we will rebuild. But we need Congress to return to Washington and pass disaster funding now.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The senators’ Oct. 1 letter urged Congress to act to “meet the unmet needs in our states and address the scope and scale of destruction experienced by our constituents,” and suggested this may “require Congress to come back in October to ensure we have enough time to enact legislation before the end of this calendar year.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/20/after-hurley-and-whitewood-floods-virginia-considers-state-relief-fund/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">previous</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> storms that hit Southwest Virginia, the towns of Hurley and Whitewood saw about four to six inches of rain over an up to roughly nine-hour period in 2021 and in 2022, respectively. Buchanan County, where the two towns are located, asked FEMA for $1.57 million in individual assistance for the Hurley flood and $1.9 million in individual assistance for the Whitewood flood, money that would help residents impacted by the disasters, but was denied its requests.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The locality did receive $2.6 million in public assistance FEMA funding to help the local government recover from the Hurley flood, and FEMA awarded $3.8 million in the same type of aid to Buchanan and nearby Tazewell County for the Whitewood flood recovery efforts. FEMA also provided the state funding to buy and tear down nearly three dozen structures in Buchanan to prevent future flooding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FEMA spokesperson said Wednesday residents could find more details on if they would qualify for aid on the agency’s </span><a href="https://www.fema.gov/assistance/individual" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Individual Assistance </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The limited individual FEMA funding for Hurley and Whitewood flood victims prompted the Virginia legislature to pull $11 million and $18 million respectively, from revenues from the regional carbon market known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative for relief efforts. The state also said at the time it would explore creating a state program to fill in gaps with FEMA funding through legislation in the 2025 session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, Virginia Department of Emergency Management State Coordinator Shawn Talmadge said “We’re not really sure right now” if any proposals will be put forward in January when the 2025 session begins.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">More severe weather ahead?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although earlier this week state and federal officials were urging caution for another storm forming off the Gulf Coast that could hit the region, Ben Gruver, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service’s </span><a href="https://www.weather.gov/rnk/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blacksburg</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> office, said a high pressure system is forecast to bring “tranquil” dry weather through next week. The storm south of the Gulf has a 40% chance of forming at this point, Gruver added, and if it does develop, it would likely be after the next seven days and it’s uncertain if it would impact Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Where it goes beyond that is anybody’s guess at this point,” Gruver said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the growing number of electric vehicles is expected to cause the demand on Virginia’s electric grid to surge, Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power Company are actively preparing for the changes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, conservation groups are monitoring the impact on the environment and Virginians, ensuring that the transition is as sustainable as possible and of less concern than data centers that are prompting continued fossil fuel use as a dispatchable power source.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The transition to electric vehicles is intended to remove tailpipe greenhouse gasses that make up one third of the emissions in the state and nationwide, contributing to climate change-fueled increasing storm intensities and frequencies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is also navigating the Virginia Clean Economy Act, a 2020 law that seeks to transition Dominion and Appalachian Power to zero-carbon generation sources by 2050 to reduce emissions from the power sector.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion Energy, the state’s largest utility with 2.6 million customers serving large swaths of Northern Virginia, the Richmond region and Hampton Roads, is pursuing a suite of zero-carbon generation sources like solar, offshore wind and nuclear in order to meet its projected demand on the grid, or “load growth,” which includes more electric vehicles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the utility is also proposing a carbon-emitting natural gas plant, largely needed for data center growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have to think about meeting load 24/7, so you&#8217;re going to see a mix of both renewable and dispatchable resources to meet that growth,” said Nathan Frost, general manager of new business and customer solutions at Dominion. “I feel, again, very confident that we can meet the load associated with EVs.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trip Pollard, a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, cautioned that some “concerns are definitely legitimate” when it comes to whether clean cars contribute to skyrocketing energy needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But a lot of the rhetoric has been very overblown, especially by the fossil fuel industry and politicians who derive a lot of donations from the fossil fuel industry,” Pollard added. “There&#8217;s far, far greater impact from things like data centers, which are still provided taxpayer subsidies.”</span></p>
<p><b>How does the grid work? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though people don’t see them when they plug a toaster into a power outlet or flip on a power switch, utility companies are always managing the power grid, an interconnected network, to provide electricity to customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the country, the power grid has come under strain to meet all the electricity demands to power data centers that support entertainment devices, kitchen appliances and even electric and low-emission vehicles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The grid’s work begins with electricity being created by a generation source, such as a solar panel or natural gas plant. Then, power is sent through transmission lines that are carried by the tall steel towers seen along highways and through countrysides. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those transmission lines connect to substations, where higher voltage electricity is converted to lower power so it can be delivered across distribution lines, the wooden poles along roadways. Distribution lines then connect to transformers to send electricity to homes, businesses, electric vehicle chargers and more. The whole system is evolving to keep up with the ever-increasing demand for power. </span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have the grid transformation plan that&#8217;s been underway going back to 2019,” Frost said. “That is again another comprehensive approach to making sure that we&#8217;ve got an electric distribution grid that can meet the needs of tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Theresa Hamilton Hall, spokeswoman for Appalachian Power, a utility company that provides services in Southwest Virginia, said the company is also working to address customers’ new needs, including “enabling EV charging at home, while they shop, or are on a road trip.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Appalachian Power typically extends a secondary service from the company’s primary system by setting an appropriately sized transformer and service conductors (wire) that will handle the maximum demand of the charging station(s),” Hall said.</span></p>
<p><b>Can the grid support the increase?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appalachian Power and Dominion are confident the power grid will be able to support the increase in demand for electricity. However, there is still uncertainty about when that increase will begin, and exactly how much EVs will contribute to it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 91,000 all-electric cars registered in Virginia as of June 30, but Dominion has projected an adoption of over 220,000 passenger electric vehicles by 2027, and the peak need from electric vehicles by 2038 is 1,600 megawatts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is what we do all day, every day,” Frost said. “Whether it&#8217;s connecting a home or business or an EV charger, we take all of it very seriously.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hall, with Appalachian Power, said the utility is anticipating modest growth related to electric vehicle adoption across the company’s three-state service territory, growth that is accounted for in Appalachian Power’s load forecasting models. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Using information gleaned from the amount of electric load carried on the company’s circuits and stations, and other internal data, this model allows the company to identify areas of future load growth on the system that may require improvements to the distribution system infrastructure,” Hall said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SELC hired consultants to do an analysis and concluded that the Clean Car Standards are only projected to increase the demand about 4% by 2040.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the smaller municipal electric grids in Virginia, including the Harrisonburg Electric Commission, and Electric Cooperatives that serve rural areas, it’s the transmission and distribution lines that need thoughtful planning, some utilities say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I look at my [utility] peers and, we&#8217;re all in this and scratching our heads, trying to say, how do we do this in a more efficient way to be able to address the growth that we&#8217;re seeing?” said Peter Muhoro, chief strategy, technology &amp; innovation officer at Rappahannock Electric Cooperative, serving the Central Piedmont region. One solution the company is exploring is pairing a battery with a charger so higher voltage power can be stored and distributed more easily on site, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Old Dominion Electric Cooperative, which supplies the power to the cooperatives, relies on a planning tool developed by University of California at Davis to stay aware of EV adoption for forecasting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“ODEC and (the Virginia, Maryland and Delaware Association of Electric Cooperatives) have a collaborative working group with VDOT, Virginia Energy and Virginia Clean Cities, which meets quarterly so the state agencies are aware of what cooperatives are doing in preparation for EV adoption in their services territories,” said Kirby Jordan, a spokesperson for ODEC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brian O’Dell, general manager at Harrisonburg Electric Commission, added that when the chargers are built close to each other, strain on specific points in the grid  need attention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don&#8217;t know that we&#8217;re heavily into forecasting, because that seems to be a little bit of a moving target, but it does require us to keep tabs on our distribution system, making sure things are balanced and not overloaded,” O’Dell said.</span></p>
<p><b>Impact on Virginians </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the electricity demand increases, questions around the cost for ratepayers are driving public concerns.</span></p>
<p>Garrett Gee, a senior attorney at SELC, said his group petitioned the Virginia State Corporation Commission to have the utilities do more comprehensive planning.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plans for electrification of vehicles were filed in May 2023, but updates are now due February 2025, after environmental groups asked for a better public picture of what the utilities are expecting in terms of medium- and long-term energy demand, and the plans the utilities have to mitigate some of that demand with part of the investments that will be required and paid for by ratepayers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It takes deliberate work, I think, from policymakers, as EV adoption increases to make sure that stays the case,” Gee said. “It doesn&#8217;t just happen, but it&#8217;s something that we can do, and we need to do.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the 2025 session beginning in January, representatives from the Electrification Coalition, a nonprofit organization advocating for electric vehicles, said they would like to see legislative support for utilities to be able to pre-plan for medium- and heavy-duty growth and rural EV deployment expanded across the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As this becomes the norm, and people want the choice for how they propel their vehicle and fuel it every day, we don&#8217;t want people in the rural regions of the state to be left behind,” said Jordan Neerhoff, senior policy analyst with the Electrification Coalition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb107" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, in the 2024 session would have provided funding to offset some of the non-utility costs for installing chargers in rural areas. It ultimately failed in the House.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That is going to be a problem in our rural areas,” said Cheri Conca, transportation and smart growth program manager for the Virginia Chapter of the Sierra Club.</span></p>
<p><b>Ratepayer opportunities</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Utility providers are offering ratepayers and electric vehicle owners incentives to install chargers at home. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of several <a href="https://www.dominionenergy.com/virginia/save-energy/electric-vehicles" target="_blank">programs</a> available to EV drivers, Dominion offers $40 a year to residents who participate in a demand response program to reduce charging at peak system load and encourage charging during off-peak hours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We also have time of use rates, which are time varying rates that incentivize customers to charge off peak or overnight to the extent they want to,” Frost said.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39170" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/05/dominion-chesterfield-county-weigh-site-suitability-for-natural-gas-plant-proposal/img_3704/" rel="attachment wp-att-39170"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-39170" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3704-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1584" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3704-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3704-300x186.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3704-1024x633.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3704-768x475.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3704-1536x950.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3704-2048x1267.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  The former coal-fired Dominion Chesterfield Power Station at Coxendale Road.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appalachian Power’s Virginia residential customers similarly can </span><a href="https://apcova.clearesult.com/shop-rebates/electric-vehicles" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">apply</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a $100 rebate towards the purchase of an Energy Star rated Level-2 EV charger, and also use a similar time of use schedule.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Customers who charge off-peak save money, and programs like this help us keep the grid working for everyone,” Hall said. “As demand grows and we make improvements to the electric grid, we are also using those opportunities to make the grid more reliable.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gee said SELC has pushed both Dominion and Appalachian Power to adopt electricity rates to encourage people to charge their cars at night, when there is more renewable energy available or when there is less overall demand for power. He said the idea aims to balance the energy use and ensure that the grid benefits from a more steady and efficient use of electricity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of places now, like California, are seeing that it makes a lot of sense for fleets to charge in the middle of the day,” Gee said. “That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s really important to do this planning at the state level.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Monday gave the update on deaths from the storm that hit several states in the Southeast, including Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky and Virginia. Over 100 are dead, the Associated Press </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-north-carolina-asheville-f02869c7d01e68f2d7f0553abb82252f" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are bringing resources to bear in an unprecedented way for Southwest Virginia,” Youngkin said. “I heard over, and over and over again: ‘I’ve lived here for 70, 80 years, I’ve never seen anything like this.’ That has been clear.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin gave his update at the Virginia Department of Emergency Management Emergency Operations Center Monday afternoon, a day after President Joe Biden approved an Emergency Disaster Declaration to unlock assistance through the Federal Emergency Management Agency to aid responses in the counties of Grayson, Smyth, Tazewell, Washington, Wise, and Wythe, as well as the city of Galax. Another thirteen counties and five cities are expected to be added, Youngkin said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the National Weather Service, the city of Galax saw a </span><a href="https://www.weather.gov/akq/rainfall-monitoring" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dumping</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of about 8.6 inches of rain over a 72 hour period. The town of Damascus, with a population of about 788 people in Washington County, saw </span><a href="https://waterwatch.usgs.gov/?m=real&amp;r=va" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">19.5 feet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of flooding in the southern end of the New River Valley, which experienced high waters as far north as Radford University.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They put out guidance that this would be a horrific season, with almost 30 storms, yet, here we are, we’re only on Helene,” said Shawn Talmadge, state coordinator at VDEM, referencing how storms are named in alphabetical order. “But this storm itself is unique. It rapidly intensifies, made landfall very quickly as a [Category 4] and then started interacting with this unusual environment, just huge amounts and volumes of rain.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 70 swift water rescue operations have occurred, with Virginia National Guard members rappelling from helicopters and pulling people from cars, Youngkin said. Helicopter crews out of Abingdon helped rescue about 50 people from the roof of a hospital in Tennessee by building a makeshift platform to land on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a life-changing storm for many people and communities,&#8221; said Tom Cormons, executive director of Appalachian Voices, an environmental non-profit with grassroots efforts throughout Appalachia. “Recovery is going to be a long, difficult process.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the peak of the storm, about 282,000 Appalachian Power customers in the region were without power. That number was down to 83,000 as of 1 p.m. Monday, the </span><a href="https://www.aepnationalcustomers.com/outages/storms/details?stormUpdateID=205&amp;id=48" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said in a news release. The CEOs of Appalachian Power Company and its parent company American Electric Power visited the region, Youngkin said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An issue responders are still dealing with is the lack of cell-phone service. The state has deployed mobile towers to provide service in the meantime, Youngkin said. If possible,residents are urged to call 211 or visit vaemergency.gov for ways to get help. Impacted residents may also stop by shelters where they can shower and get meals, which have been handed out by incarcerated members under coordination with the Department of Corrections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know a lot of people want to stay where they are, but sometimes it&#8217;s just not safe,” said Youngkin.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40236" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1200px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/30/hurricane-helene-deaths-in-virginia-up-to-2-future-rain-prompts-more-concern/unnamed-2-3/" rel="attachment wp-att-40236"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40236" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/unnamed-2.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="797" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/unnamed-2.jpg 1200w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/unnamed-2-300x199.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/unnamed-2-1024x680.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/unnamed-2-768x510.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Gov. Glenn Youngkin and First Lady Suzanne S. Youngkin assesses storm damage caused by Hurricane Helene in Grayson County.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Forestry had cleared 817 miles of roadways by Sunday afternoon, but road closures have added 30 minute- to hour long-detours in the region that already had minimal thoroughfares to go around mountainous terrain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regions further east and north in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia also saw road closures, including five in Albemarle County where one road was </span><a href="https://www.vdot.virginia.gov/news-events/news/culpeper-district/helene-may-have-left-va-but-effects-remain-behind.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">washed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> out and will need to be rebuilt. In Madison County, route 670, or Old Blue Ridge Turnpike, was washed out, as Route 637, or Mutton Hollow Road, in Greene County was closed due to high water.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with farmers having hay crops and berry farms ruined, and residents needing oxygen tanks and medication, Youngkin said dams, including the Appalachian Power Company hydroelectric power dam, were a concern going into the storm. But as the water receded, so did officials’ caution. The concern now is areas like Claytor Lake in the New River Valley.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re worried about what&#8217;s in the water behind the dam,” said Youngkin. “The combination of both our surface rescue teams and hazmat teams are working to get as much stuff out of the water as we can. Propane tanks, in the water, we got to get them out. There’s floating cars, there’s all kinds of stuff.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, Youngkin added, the state would be submitting its request for a Major Disaster Declaration, which will release federal funds to provide post-disaster relief for families in the form of individual assistance as well as reimbursing localities for their costs through public assistance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin, nor Timothy S. Pheil, federal FEMA federal coordinating officer, knew exactly how much the state was going to request.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s going to be big, we’re going (through) all the thresholds. I can’t begin to estimate,” Youngkin said. “Aggregating the personal loss, business losses … we had local law enforcement offices that were flooded. All of that has got to be assessed. It’s a lot.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Potentially complicating the post-disaster relief, though, is that FEMA funds were left out of a congressional budget compromise reached a couple weeks ago, amid partisan disagreement, to keep the federal government running.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is my understanding that Congress would have to return in order to approve supplemental disaster funds,” said Emily Steinhilber, director of climate resilient coasts and watersheds for Virginia at the Environmental Defense Fund. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Weather Service in Blacksburg is forecasting scattered showers and a possible thunderstorm through Tuesday night at the Brookneal/Campbell County Airport, which is about 30 minutes south of Lynchburg. Another </span><a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">storm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> forming off the Gulf Coast is prompting fresh concerns, Youngkin said, as it could hit the region already inundated with water.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Particularly, the New River Valley is still angry,” Youngkin said. “The river is angry and full, and more rain is only going to make that worse. The whole stretch up the New River Valley has real risk associated with it.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mary-Carson Stiff, executive director of the nonprofit Wetlands Watch, said it&#8217;s the hurricanes that heat up in the Gulf’s increasingly warmer waters that are dumping “unimaginable amounts of rain in rivers and creeks.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia&#8217;s communities are already experiencing roughly 20% more rainfall since 2006, so when you add more rain from a big storm into our already full water bodies and stressed infrastructure, the outcome is disastrous,” Stiff said. </span></p>

(Map courtesy of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One person is reported dead in Virginia and five localities in the southwest region of the state are under a voluntary evacuation order as a result of Tropical Depression Helene, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin said in a Facebook live </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?ref=watch_permalink&amp;v=842692187932999" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">update</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> around 4 p.m. Friday afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The one fatality in Craig County stemmed from a tree falling and a building collapse, Youngkin said, adding that “We lift up the family of this victim in our prayers.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Augusta, Wythe, Pulaski, and Giles Counties are under the voluntary evacuation order, along with the city of Salem. Residents there aren’t required to leave their homes, but the order strongly suggests that it would be safest to do so. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While these are voluntary evacuation orders for particular communities, please adhere to them for your safety. Your life is too important,” the governor said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helene formed south of Florida and made landfall as a hurricane in that state late Thursday with maximum sustained winds of 140 miles per hour, according to the </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-florida-georgia-carolina-e5769b56dea81e40fae2161ad1b4e75d" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Associated Press</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Yet, the impacts could be felt in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Weather Service Blacksburg Office forecasted Friday morning that rainfall rates of 2 to 3 inches per hour were likely. According to the </span><a href="https://www.weather.gov/akq/rainfall-monitoring" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NWS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 12.2 inches of rain had accumulated in the Grayson Highlands area in Southside Virginia near the North Carolina border as of 4 p.m. Friday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin said that while rain “may have subsided in certain parts of Virginia,” a tornado was reported just north of Danville.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A vast section of the state is still under a tornado watch, and that extends all the way to Virginia Beach” Youngkin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 50 swift water crews had already been deployed with helicopter air support, “although the high winds have limited their ability to access some of the more challenged spots,” Youngkin said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helicopters were able to help efforts in Washington County, particularly the city of Damascus, where “we have seen substantial flooding,” Younkgin said. Flooding has also occurred along the New River, particularly at Radford University, he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I urge everyone to please stay informed, use good judgments and get to high ground,” Youngkin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 241,000 people have lost power throughout Southwest Virginia, Youngkin added. The state has been in contact with the electric cooperatives that primarily serve rural regions in Southwest Virginia, and Appalachian Power Company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s going to take some time,” Youngkin said, on restoring power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Virginia State Police helicopter unit was sent to help with the 50 people stranded on the roof of Unicoi County Hospital in </span><a href="https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/local/2024/09/27/tennessee-flood-people-stranded-roof-ballad-health-hospital-erwin-unicoi-county/75414357007/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennessee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Youngkin said. At least 40 people in four states had died from the storm by Friday evening, according to the </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-florida-georgia-carolina-e5769b56dea81e40fae2161ad1b4e75d" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Associated Press</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A National Weather Service monitor at Blacksburg Airport </span><a href="https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=37.2258&amp;lon=-80.4101" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">forecasts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a partly sunny Saturday, with a chance of showers into the evening. More rain showers and possibly a thunderstorm are forecasted to occur into Monday night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This storm is not over, and therefore, again, I urge everyone to please stay off the roads, unless you have to be on them,” Youngkin said.</span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s out of sight and out of mind, and it might just be killing people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For decades, American factories have been sending their wastewater to municipal sewage treatment plants across the country, which handle it along with the effluent from other industries, homes and businesses. At the other end of the process, the separated and dried-out solids are often delivered to farmers as free fertilizer. The land application of this “sewage sludge” has long been encouraged by environmental regulators as a way to deal with what would otherwise be a vexing waste disposal problem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet not all of that wastewater, or the sludge that becomes fertilizer, is benign. An increasing number of industries discharge effluent laced with toxic per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which most treatment plants aren’t equipped to remove. PFAS are notoriously long-lasting, so much so that they are nicknamed “forever chemicals.” And now some states are finding that PFAS-laced sewage sludge is contaminating farmland and </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/21/climate/farm-pfas-meat-poison-sewage-sludge.html?unlocked_article_code=1.MU4.49KT.7DApop-_3wl1&amp;smid=url-share" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">poisoning consumers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PFAS are a relatively new class of synthetic chemical, </span><a href="https://www.manufacturingdive.com/news/the-history-behind-forever-chemicals-pfas-3m-dupont-pfte-pfoa-pfos/698254/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">emerging commercially</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the 1950s to find their way into a wide range of useful products, including non-stick pans (</span><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9071322/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most notoriously</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Teflon), waterproof clothing, stain-resistant fabrics and firefighting chemicals. Unfortunately, exposure to PFAS has been shown to cause an almost equally-wide range of environmental and human health </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7906952/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">harms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including cancer, kidney disease, thyroid disease, reproductive problems and obesity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After years of foot-dragging, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency finally </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/pfas-forever-chemicals-pollution-epa-superfund-2a88bfb2ae4b3bb2f0d23a0686b8e99a" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">took action</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against two early types of PFAS that had already fallen out of use, </span><a href="https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news/2024/04/what-theyre-saying-about-epas-regulation-forever-chemicals-drinking" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">setting drinking water standards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for those and a few others. At the same time, however, chemical companies have been turning out literally </span><a href="https://peer.org/commentary-epas-whack-a-mole-forever-chemicals-posture-is-an-intolerable-failure/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">thousands of new iterations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that have been little studied and remain largely unregulated. PFAS have become so ubiquitous in the environment that scientists estimate </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/28/health/pfas-testing-guidelines-wellness/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">98% of Americans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — and even some </span><a href="https://news.emory.edu/stories/2023/09/hs_PFAS_in_newborns_14-09-2023/story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">newborns </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">— have detectable levels in their blood.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, public health advocates have started to worry that PFAS may also be entering our food supply via the sewage sludge applied to farmland. </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/31/climate/pfas-fertilizer-sludge-farm.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the New York Times, five states – Texas, Michigan, New York, Maine and Tennessee – have detected PFAS on farmland treated with sewage sludge, sometimes in high levels. Crops grown in contaminated soil absorb the chemicals and pass them up the food chain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Maine and Michigan, officials shut down farms after finding high concentrations of PFAS in the soil and in the meat of grazing animals. Maine officials </span><a href="https://www.mainepublic.org/environment-and-outdoors/2023-02-01/more-than-50-maine-farms-impacted-by-pfas-but-state-officials-see-glimmer-of-hope" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">found contamination</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on 56 farms and in 23% of more than 1,500 groundwater samples taken from farms and residences. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022, Maine banned the use of sewage sludge on agricultural land and prohibited most uses of PFAS in consumer products starting in 2030. The state is now working with affected farmers to </span><a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2024/03/19/maine-pfas-fund-fields-first-farm-buyout-request/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">compensate them</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or find alternative uses for contaminated land. Officials note that the testing programs are just beginning and fear that they may be seeing only the tip of the iceberg. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York Times did not include Virginia among the states known to have PFAS-contaminated farmland. That’s not because we don’t have a problem. Rather, it’s because the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), which issues permits to municipal wastewater treatment plants, doesn’t require sludge to be tested. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What little we do know is cause for concern. The conservation group </span><a href="https://wildvirginia.org/our-programs/preventing-pfas-pollution/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wild Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> analyzed data submitted to DEQ in 2022 by a small number of drinking water and wastewater treatment plants that voluntarily tested their effluent. Limited and incomplete as it was, the information </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlfIknLbJJs" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">revealed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that 20 of the 21 wastewater treatment plants that tested for PFAS found significant concentrations in their effluent. Only 8 of the plants also tested their sludge, but all 8 reported significant concentrations of PFAS. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I talked by phone with David Sligh, Wild Virginia’s c</span>onservation director <span style="font-weight: 400;">and a former DEQ employee, who told me the group plans to publish a report on this problem in the coming week. DEQ, he said, has the authority to regulate PFAS in treatment plants’ effluent and sludge and should be doing so to protect the public. His group has joined other members of the </span><a href="https://vcnva.org/agenda-item/stopping-pfas-at-its-source/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Conservation Network</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in calling on DEQ “to place the responsibility and cost of cleaning up PFAS on the industries that use and manufacture PFAS by requiring PFAS disclosure, monitoring, and limits in pollution discharge permits.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DEQ, however, seems to be in no hurry. Neil Zahradka, manager of the land applications program at DEQ, wrote in an email to Tyla Matteson, a Sierra Club volunteer who works on sewage sludge issues, “To date, DEQ has relied upon the EPA biennial reviews to determine if additional regulation of biosolids is necessary beyond that contained in current permits, and no additional limits or criteria for PFAS have been set. … [A]ccording to the EPA PFAS Strategic Roadmap, they plan to complete the risk assessment for PFAS in biosolids this year.  We do plan to update the DEQ biosolids fact sheet once we have additional substantive information to offer landowners.”</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Three interesting bills: declawing cats, sewage regulations and on-duty physicians&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/08/three-interesting-bills-declawing-cats-sewage-regulations-and-on-duty-physicians/embed/#?secret=0lkUwvvNmj#?secret=fUF0nnw6HF" data-secret="fUF0nnw6HF" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waiting for EPA to act first is convenient, but it does a grave disservice to Virginians. EPA itself has stalled for so long that Potomac Riverkeeper, Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER) and other groups finally sued the agency this year for its failure to regulate PFAS in sewage sludge used as fertilizer. </span><a href="https://peer.org/epa-flees-pfas-biosolids-contamination-crisis/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to PEER</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, EPA identified 10 different types of PFAS among some 250 pollutants contaminating sewage sludge, yet insists it is only obligated to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">identify</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the toxics in sewage sludge, not </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">do anything</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about it. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I suspect EPA and DEQ’s hesitance is due to the fear of what they would find in any extensive testing program. If testing confirmed widespread contamination in sewage sludge, DEQ would – one hopes – feel obligated to stop the practice of spreading it across the farms that produce our food. After all, if you identify a poison in your product, the answer is probably not to spread it among as many people as possible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annoying as it would be for DEQ, industry and even farmers to learn the truth, though, the alternative is worse. PFAS </span><a href="https://cen.acs.org/environment/persistent-pollutants/Getting-PFAS-drinking-water/102/i20" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">can be removed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, either in the wastewater treatment process or, ideally, before it leaves its industrial source. Not testing and treating means needlessly exposing farmers, their families and their animals – and ultimately all the rest of us – to chemicals that have no safe level of exposure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given what we know about the harms PFAS causes, DEQ’s inaction is inexcusable. If Maine can tackle this threat to its land and people, surely Virginia can do it as well. We should expect no less.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin on Wednesday </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/eo/EO-37---Declaration-of-a-State-of-Emergency-Due-to-Hurricane-Helene.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declared</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a state of emergency for the commonwealth of Virginia in anticipation of impacts from Hurricane Helene later this week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the current storm path places its center west of Virginia, </span><a href="https://www.weather.gov/media/jax/briefings/nws-jax-briefing.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">forecasts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the National Weather Service and the National Hurricane Center suggest that the western parts of the state could face significant rainfall and flooding from Friday into Saturday, compounded by earlier rain events expected in the coming days.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even though the largest impacts of Helene are predicted to the south and west of us, we cannot ignore the fact that we have had significant flooding events arise from pre-cursory rain events and outer bands from tropical systems that drop locally heavy rainfall leading to flooding, especially in our southwestern region,” Youngkin said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is critical that we remain vigilant, understanding that tracks and impacts can shift. As high winds and heavy rains are predicted for parts of Virginia, we urge everyone to stay informed through trusted resources and follow the direction of your local officials.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor’s state of emergency declaration gives Virginia greater flexibility to mobilize resources and equipment to respond to the storm, including activating Virginia’s Emergency Operations Center and the Virginia Emergency Support Team, putting into effect anti-price gouging measures and authorizing up to $350,000 in response and recovery funding. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Hurricane Helene approaches Florida, search and rescue teams from Northern Virginia and suburban Maryland have been deployed to assist. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Task Force 1 </span><a href="https://wtop.com/local/2024/09/virginia-and-maryland-searchers-and-rescuers-heading-to-the-hurricane/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">was dispatched</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tuesday afternoon and is already en route to the storm, while Maryland Task Force 1 departed for Florida on Wednesday afternoon.

(Photo courtesy of Kenny Fletcher/Chesapeake Bay Foundation)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a reversal from a decision earlier this year, the Virginia Marine Resource Commission voted 4-1 Tuesday to have a public hearing on keeping the winter dredge crabbing season closed, but extend the pot catching season, two measures both the industry and one conservation group did not oppose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VMRC board members A.J. Erskine, Will Bransom, Jeanette Edwards and Thomas Preston voted in favor of the </span><a href="https://www.mrc.virginia.gov/commission_briefing_packets/2024/2024-09-24-Briefing-Packet.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Spencer Headly voted against, with three other board members absent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VMRC will come back in October to make a final decision on the proposals, after initially voting in </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/26/virginia-votes-to-reopen-winter-crab-dredge-season/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">June</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to repeal the regulation that prohibited the winter dredge crabbing season. Crabbers sought the repeal to create a winter market to sell their catches at higher values. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposals acted on Tuesday were recommendations by the VMRC Crab Management Advisory Committee, or CMAC, which </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/03/virginia-crab-management-committee-requests-opening-winter-season-for-dredging/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">initially</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recommended to VMRC the reopening of the winter dredge season. But since the June decision, CMAC met twice with a discussion facilitator to examine data on the number of crabs in the Chesapeake Bay, and what the impact of a winter dredge crabbing season would be. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The change from the June decision, CMAC members told their VMRC colleagues this week, was a realization of a “conservation equivalency,” that having the winter season would force crabbers to catch less during the rest of the year in order to stay below conservation caps put in place across the Chesapeake Bay when crabs reached disastrously low levels in the early 2000s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of these crabbers are like, ‘hold on, I don’t want to give up my slice with my size of the pie to accommodate a fishery that I might or may or may not participate in,’” Ed Tankard said during Tuesday’s meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Winter crab dredging is the act of using metal chains to catch crabs buried in the bottom of the seafloor to haul them in. A winter dredge survey is conducted to count the numbers of females that bury into the mud during the colder months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concern with a winter dredge catching season is that 90% of the catches are females, which are sought after to spawn new juvenile crabs. One issue with the species, Romuald Lipcius, a professor at the Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences, told VRMC, is that juvenile crabs aren’t living long enough, possibly because of predation from catfish or red drum, or eggs getting impacted when they end up on shorelines. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia had a winter dredging season, but closed it in 2008 after the number of female crabs in the Bay plummeted from over 200 million in 1991 to about 50 million in 2002.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get those numbers back up, the three regulatory bodies within it, including VMRC, the Potomac River Fisheries Commission and the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, all took a 34% cut in crab harvest. VRMC closed the winter dredge season to account for half of that reduction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The species since has only been allowed to be caught through traps, or “pots”, between March 17 and Nov. 30, except for a few years in which the season was extended by a couple weeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of crabs in the Bay has spiked back up and down to about 250 million in 2017, but has been on a downward trend to just under 150 million this year with no need for additional conservation measures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vote in June had put the VMRC in a bit of a pickle, because it repealed the regulation putting in place the prohibition on winter crab dredging from Dec. 1 to March 31. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, Virginia currently has no rules on winter catch limits, and the number of participants after the regular season ends on Dec. 16, following a previously approved extension. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a winter dredge crabbing season would require determining catch limits and participants in order to establish the conservation equivalency, as well as changes to license regulations, all of which may not have been created until Dec. 3. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advertising for a public hearing to keep the season closed this year came with an additional motion to have CMAC continue exploring the regulatory framework for future years, in order to allow a stock assessment expected to be finished in 2026 to not be altered. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The assessment was in 2011, even though others typically happen every three to five years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More time allows staff to also figure out how to more easily open or close the winter season with that framework and understand what the full ramifications would be. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One potential impact could be limiting the type of </span><a href="https://www.mrc.virginia.gov/Notices/2024/2024-09-24-VIMS-PC.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">equipment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be used in certain areas, and a brief ban on sponge crabs, which CMAC member Mark Sanford said wouldn’t impact him, but Nathan Reynolds said it would impact 90% of the crabbers on the Eastern Shore. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m not trying to pin one thing against another person,” Reynolds added. “As we work to try to build that framework for the dredge fishery, we can extend the season.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">latter </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">would allow crabbers to continue fishing beyond an extension already to work through Dec. 31 and begin again March 1. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A similar extension happened in 2016 to 2017, and represented roughly 1% of the annual catch. Warming water could mean the crabs have not been buried into the sea floor during those extension periods, said Pat Geer, VMRC’s chief of fisheries management. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris Moore, of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, an environmental group, said he understood the proposals had been recommended by the CMAC, but, “It’s not one of my favorites about this,  because I think you all set very good seasons based on the information I had available back in June.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VMRC also faces opposition to winter crab dredging from other groups, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Chesapeake Bay Office Sustainable Fisheries Goal Implementation team,  and six online comments</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">— but none in support of opening the winter dredge season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Crabbers way down the Bay have a much longer harvesting season than those who crab in the upper part of the bay, because of water temperature,” the Virginia Twin Rivers Waterman’s Association, which crabs at the end of the Rappahannock River and Potomac River, wrote in a letter to VMRC. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We need to shorten the harvest season so crabs can recover some before they are potted heavy again.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Be prepared,” said Bob Mauskapf, VDH director of the office of emergency preparedness, “for anything that you can think of that you would be without.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Health is part of the state’s Virginia Emergency Support Team, or VEST, responsible for monitoring health impacts from mold showing up in flooded homes, the transfer of diseases through mosquitoes that congregate near collections of water and resulting hospital surges, and more. The Virginia Department of Emergency Management spearheads the team, which includes several other state agencies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, North America switched from its dryer El Niño season into a wetter La Niña one, which happens every two to seven years. The change prompted the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to predict there could be an increase in damaging named storms this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Millions of people were left without power in Texas this summer and at least three died after encountering Hurricane Beryl, the second, and perhaps most devasting, storm of this season. So far this year, Virginia has only issued a state of </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2024/august/name-1031553-en.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">emergency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for Tropical Storm Debby, the fourth storm of the season. Debby didn’t hit Virginia as hard as North Carolina, but preliminary findings confirmed </span><a href="https://www.weather.gov/lwx/DebbyTornadoes" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tornado</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> touchdowns in Glendie and Willisville, where winds were estimated to have reached 90 and 100 miles per hour, respectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“(Debby) was a grazing blow to us,” said Mauskapf, adding the storm season that runs until Nov. 30 “has not come to fruition.” But Virginia’s “highest incidence of Tropical Storm Activity in the area is usually October and early November. We&#8217;re entering into, if you will, the </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/weather/richmond-tropical-storm-gaston-shockoe-bottom-flooding/article_9462326e-64a4-11ef-8adf-db796acbf85c.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">height</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the Atlantic basin hurricane season,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, Virginia braced for increased rain from </span><a href="https://www.weather.gov/ilm/2024PTC8#:~:text=Potential%20Tropical%20Cyclone%20Eight%20was,from%20the%20warm%20ocean%20surface." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tropical Cyclone 8</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a storm that typically moves in a circular pattern, unlike a </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/weather/richmond-tropical-storm-gaston-shockoe-bottom-flooding/article_9462326e-64a4-11ef-8adf-db796acbf85c.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">derecho</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that runs in a straight line across a region, Mauskapf explained. Rain left the state sooner than expected, but water levels on the James River at Sewell Point in the Norfolk area reached as high as 4.87 feet, over a foot above ground level, on the eve of Sept. 17. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Winds as strong as 15 miles per hour from the northeast prevented water from receding, and so it lingered in that area. Weekend rain led to water levels in that same area rising over 5 feet Sunday night into Monday.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To prepare for the next bout of severe weather, the VDH is urging people to charge phones, keep backup power on hand, fill up gas tanks, safely store perishable food and, have a first aid kit. Sheltering options are available through one of VDH’s 35 local departments across the state and, in the event of emergencies, additional safe spaces are coordinated with universities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The State Corporation Commission, which oversees that state’s insurance, is also urging residents to maintain updated policies, which can include “</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/05/virginia-officials-tout-preparedness-as-hurricane-season-begins/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">essential</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” flood insurance to repair damage to homes as government assistance can lag and the threat of flooding is expected to continue. It’s a familiar danger in Virginia, in the short and long term.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Located on the East Coast, Norfolk experiences the fastest rate of sea level rise in the country at 5.38 millimeters a year, which  prompted the locality to propose a $2.6 million flood </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/26/norfolk-hits-obstacles-implementing-storm-risk-protection/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wall</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> project. The state’s Coastal Resilience Master </span><a href="https://www.dcr.virginia.gov/crmp/document/VirginiaCoastalResilienceMasterPlan-Summary.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, due for an update at the end of this year, states “the number of residents living in homes exposed to major coastal flooding is projected to grow from approximately 360,000 to 943,000, an increase of 160%.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Southwest Virginia, the towns of Hurley and Whitewood  were pummeled with four to six inches of rain in 2021 and 2022, respectively, leading state emergency officials to explore ways of filling in gaps for post-storm </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/20/after-hurley-and-whitewood-floods-virginia-considers-state-relief-fund/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">relief</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Scientists have said what happened in those smaller localities is a result of climate change: intenser, more frequent storms. Officials are now challenged with how to deploy resources in the face of increasingly violent weather.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don&#8217;t deal in climate change or forecasting. We do deal in the results of climate change,” said Mauskapf.  “So we prepare our plans and our messaging, for these types of more frequent storms, higher temperatures, lower temperatures, whatever we may see. It&#8217;s the same threat.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Searching for a new vehicle can be challenging, but not as complex as it is to develop the infrastructure needed to power electric and low-emission vehicles at rest stops, gas stations, homes, workplaces and public areas in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To build its EV infrastructure, the state leaned on the federal government’s nationwide plan to install charging stations across major corridors around the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, those areas are found along Interstates 81, 295 and 495, to name a few. The commonwealth has received $61 million, with a future allocation of $45 million, from the federal government’s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, to build out charging stations along interstate highways, with one planned at least every 50 miles, and within one mile of federally identified designated alternative fuel corridors (AFCs). So far, the process has progressed slowly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whenever you put a large amount of new money into a system, meaning deploying EV infrastructure where none previously existed, the startup is going to be very difficult. New processes and procedures need to be established to ensure taxpayer dollars are used appropriately and we minimize the potential for waste, fraud, and abuse,” said Del. David Reid, D-Loudoun, who is a strong supporter of electric vehicles and owns one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, homeowners, businesses, and residential and commercial developers could tap into another infrastructure layer soon — or even now, if they have access to a 240-volt outlet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state could incentivize Virginians to install chargers at shopping malls, homes and corporate offices through future legislation. Previous efforts have failed due to the lack of support or funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reid said the state needs to build out the charging infrastructure along major highways, but there’s also the potential for existing wiring to support a Level 2 EV charger, which is typical for home, the workplace and public areas such as gas stations.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Divesting from gas stations for charging stations</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s gas stations and convenience stores are aware of the transition to electric vehicles, but are generally prioritizing their available fossil fuel at the moment. Some, though, are seeing a new business opportunity with government funding to provide EV charging infrastructure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of June 30, the Department of Motor Vehicles said there were about 6.9 million vehicles registered in Virginia, with about 311,000 being electric, plug-in hybrid or traditional hybrid. That means at least 6.6 million cars need a gas station to fuel up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mike O’Connor, president and CEO of the Virginia Petroleum and Convenience Marketers Association, acknowledged the transition to more electric vehicles is “going to happen regardless of what pressures are brought to bear because there are people that are interested in these vehicles.” O’Connor’s group represents owners or suppliers for the 3,385 gas stations and convenience stores across Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But given some challenges with adopting electric vehicles, including their difficulty performing in cold weather, O’Connor said for his group, the percentage of new cars sales being electric vehicles likely won’t increase beyond the current 7% rate as fast as previously thought. So they’re not focusing on EV drivers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If I&#8217;m one of these businesses, I&#8217;m doing a long term projection, and you say it&#8217;s going to increase by 100% in 10 years — which I think is optimistic given what&#8217;s going on — you&#8217;re going to go from 7% to 14%,” O’Connor said. “You&#8217;re still going to have 14% EVs and 86% internal combustion engines. If I’m making my efforts in planning, I&#8217;m focused on the 86% in those locations where I&#8217;m operating presently.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40119" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/deq-charger/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40119" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/deq-charger-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/deq-charger-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/deq-charger-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/deq-charger-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/deq-charger-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/deq-charger-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/deq-charger-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  EVgo chargers deployed by the Department of Environmental Quality at a gas station in Richmond. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That hold-out philosophy is present in the Shenandoah Valley, where Holtzman Oil is one of the largest suppliers of gas and is keeping with its model based on conversation with retailers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Our gut feeling is that fossil fuel has a long and bright future ahead of us,” said Todd Holtzman, general manager of the company&#8217;s propane division and a Republican member of the town of Mount Jackson’s council. “[Chargers] are very, very expensive and I think it&#8217;s a possibility when the public wants them. Where you see ‘em, I think they’re heavily subsidized and they’re not heavily used.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Individual gas station owners decide if and when to install EV chargers, O’Connor said, similar to the choice between selling “Coke versus Pepsi.” A separate group of gas stations and convenience stores, ranging from national chains to mom and pop stores that are a part of the Charge Ahead Partnership, ranging from national chains to mom and pop stores, take a fuel-agnostic stance, said Ryan McKinnon, a spokesman for the group. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If customers want charging, they want to provide it,” McKinnon stated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But with Level 3 fast chargers costing about $100,000 to install — the type which take about 15 to 20 minutes to charge a battery up to 85% for up to a 300 mile duration, typically — McKinnon said gas stations owners want certainty their investment will provide a return and not be overlooked by a charger built down the street. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That certainty, McKinnon said, can come from giving private companies a right of first refusal to prevent utilities from building, owning and profiting chargers paid for through ratepayer funds within a 12-mile radius of an existing publicly used one, which is what a 2024 </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb118" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, sought to achieve. Dominion Energy, which McKinnon said has been cooperative with building charging infrastructure, argued against the bill, saying it would have hampered their ability to provide more charging stations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a pretty big business opportunity,” McKinnon said, adding gas stations can be well lit, attended by people and are close to highways. “We’re uniquely positioned.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The government’s role</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it can be considered as a subsidy, the government is providing incentives to overcome the funding concerns with building EV chargers, particularly at gas stations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2016, a settlement with Volkswagen for cheating emission tests led to $14 million for charger development, primarily at gas stations in Northern Virginia and the Hampton Roads area. More recently, the Virginia Department of Transportation began doling out National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure funds from the federal government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Erin Belt, decarbonization program manager with the Virginia Department of Transportation, said the applicants include traditional gas stations and travel centers. The list of applicants also include third party operators running the stations, and those from the tourism industry operating dining establishments, grocery stores and shopping centers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;ve seen pretty good, and I would say better than expected, response from applicants across the state,” said Chris Berg, director of sustainability at VDOT. “I think we had some concern around ‘are there some areas of the state that have lower EV penetration?’ where we may see less interest. But in our first round we saw multiple applications at all of our target areas.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_38259" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1148px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/02/vdot-announces-sites-for-electric-vehicle-charging-stations/nevi-sites/" rel="attachment wp-att-38259"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-38259" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/NEVI-sites.png" alt="" width="1148" height="649" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/NEVI-sites.png 1148w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/NEVI-sites-300x170.png 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/NEVI-sites-1024x579.png 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/NEVI-sites-768x434.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1148px) 100vw, 1148px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A map of the sites chosen to receive federal funding for electric vehicle charging stations.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sullivan told the Mercury in a phone interview he’s used a charging station much like what the NEVI program is working on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m in Western New York state right now. I drove up here in my EV,” Sullivan said “My wife and I stopped at a Sheetz in Bedford, Pennsylvania; took 20 minutes to charge our car while we were inside, using the restroom and buying some food for the road. And then we were on our way, not unlike an internal combustion engine vehicle stopping for a gas fill up.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">EV traveling in Virginia</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Industry leaders say charging stations along Virginia’s interstates are moving along, but have some challenges amid concerns over car batteries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022, VDOT said after it received funding for the </span><a href="https://publicinput.com/Customer/File/Full/b483a081-9d89-4e33-874b-19ae8529c991" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NEVI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program, it would be working through 2026 to expand the network to over 1,000 charging stations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Berg said it&#8217;s the largest investment in the commonwealth’s history. However, VDOT is uncertain when deployment could be completed, due to factors such as whether the program will be reauthorized and what the demand will be in a couple of years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supply chain delays could also impact when award recipients complete the installation of charging stations, as could applicants’ need to ensure they understand the federal requirements and obligations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program does not cover infrastructure installation in areas beyond Virginia&#8217;s interstates, like the commonwealth’s rural regions. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40113" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/img_4173/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40113" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4173-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4173-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4173-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4173-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4173-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4173-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4173-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A demonstration of a charger for an electric vehicle that is part of a fleet. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, some communities are applying for the </span><a href="https://www.transportation.gov/rural/grant-toolkit/charging-and-fueling-infrastructure-grant-program" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charging and Fuel Infrastructure Discretionary Grant Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> created under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to address those areas. The application process, which closed last month, offers a $2.5 million cut for groups such as local governments and planning organizations in urban and rural communities. The funding will help to deploy EV charging and other alternative vehicle-fueling infrastructure projects in publicly accessible locations.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The idea behind the CFI funding is to essentially fill in gaps left by the NEVI program,” said Anne Blair, vice president of policy for the Electrification Coalition, a nonprofit organization advocating for electric vehicles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While NEVI dictates specific funding every 50 miles, a mile off the interstate, this is designed to really go in areas outside of that, [such as] rural communities (and neighborhoods with)multi-family housing, for instance, that also need assistance in terms of deployment of funding.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s stated </span><a href="https://www.mwcog.org/file.aspx?&amp;A=8kzH4dtaFasiXH88W0qktEqlAIWJZ5eDj4%2Bc8Rd2uUI%3D" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">goal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the charging network is to create a system that facilitates “convenient, reliable, and equitable access to fast charging stations throughout the commonwealth, while spurring growth in this promising industry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sullivan has introduced a bill three years and counting to make sure “all Virginians” can have access to charging, including rural areas that won’t directly benefit from the NEVI program. Sullivan’s bill attempted to offset some infrastructure costs in less populated, lower income areas, which Republican lawmakers have said is lacking while also largely opposing the clean cars policy seeking to increase the state’s adoption of electric vehicles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those rural areas are where state parks typically are, too, said Sullivan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want all of our Virginia citizens to be able to charge electric vehicles. We want people coming into the states, into our beautiful tourist attractions all over the state. We want those people who own electric vehicles to feel confident that they can charge there as well.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reid suggested that state involvement could help alleviate any inequities for people who live in places that don’t have garages or dedicated spaces for charging such as apartments and condominiums. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Operating and improving EV charging in Virginia</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some consumers considering the idea of transitioning to electric are looking to businesses, legislators and local and state governments to make finding charging stations easier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some parts of Virginia, electric and low emission vehicle owners have already taken steps to install chargers at their homes. In some cases, a homeowner is required to have an electrical permit to install a charger. Experts say most EV charging is done at home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://www.pwcva.gov/department/building-development-division/residential-EV-charging-stations" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prince William</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an electrical permit is required when a circuit or feeder is added or extended to supply the vehicle charging system or if the system is hard wired. A permit is not required if the charging system is cord-and-plug connected to an existing circuit that meets the requirements of the manufacturer’s installation instructions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EV and hybrid owners also use chargers at shopping malls and at workplaces as the more effective charging stations become available.</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers attempted to increase the number of charging stations and home chargers during the previous three sessions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, the Virginia legislature passed the first EV Rebate Program providing tax incentives for consumers to purchase a new or used electric vehicle. However, the program was never funded by the legislature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reid said the state’s EV Rebate Program lost support because some interpreted it as a means to support the wealthy purchasing expensive EVs; others balked because of the cost to support the program. He said the commonwealth has a “finite amount of money,” and the legislature has to make some “very difficult decisions” about priorities, some of which have been neglected for decades, such as increasing teacher pay, disability waivers and law enforcement pay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don&#8217;t fault anyone for that, but it was one of those unfortunate things that we were able to pass the legislation, but we had different priorities when we got to the budget,” Reid said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2023, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1312" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to give localities the option to require developers to include charging infrastructure in their proposals failed, which he said was supported by localities in Northern Virginia. A similar bill in </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb405" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2024 </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">would have convened a workgroup to evaluate the technical requirements for building EV charging infrastructure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, said she supports localities having the flexibility “in certain areas” to require developers to include charging infrastructure in their proposals, especially multi-family dwelling unit construction proposals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have to keep up with the times and with the technology and giving localities another tool in the toolbox to make some decisions for themselves, knowing their communities better than anybody else, I think it’s a reasonable thing,” Boysko said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blair from the coalition acknowledged that it’s been “a fairly controversial issue for the building community, because it&#8217;s another thing on their list to include in their standards.” But it&#8217;s “vastly less expensive to do it when you&#8217;re building a new apartment complex than to retrofit a property after it&#8217;s already been built,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without Boysko’s bill passing, the city of Alexandria has been using “Standard Conditions” to encourage developers to agree to include charging infrastructure as they submit building proposals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virtually all development projects incorporate some degree of EV infrastructure into their project,” said Amy Posner, EV planner for the city of Alexandria. “We typically see at least 2% of the parking spaces on a project will have Level 2 EV chargers. The latest update to the Standard Conditions raised that to 5% of parking spaces to better align with EV adoption rates in Alexandria.”</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city also wants to provide the chargers in areas like city parks and libraries, but costs are a challenge. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get around that, the city is offering up their locations to developers who would own, operate and profit from charging stations, but “ideally” enter a revenue sharing agreement with the city. Grants that Alexandria receives could also go toward building chargers. It’s similar to a program Virginia Beach is doing, Posner said, “to really accelerate the public charging that we know we need to make it easier for folks to make the switch.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stuart Gardner, executive director of </span><a href="https://generation180.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generation 180</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which provides consumer education on switching to electric, said a way the organization is helping to spur interest is working with businesses in developing charging stations, and encouraging localities to apply for federal grants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last January, Henrico County became the recipient of a </span><a href="https://henrico.gov/news/2024/01/henrico-earns-1-4-million-grant-to-create-ev-charging-station-network/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1.4 million discretionary grant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the </span><a href="https://www.transportation.gov/rural/grant-toolkit/charging-and-fueling-infrastructure-grant-program" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charging Fuel Infrastructure Grant Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for developing stations at seven county facilities including at two libraries and a recreational center. The second round of applications closed last month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Generation 180 and a coalition of partners reached out to localities across the state to say ‘hey, let&#8217;s not leave money on the table.’ They’re going to award these grants, so let’s make sure that money is in Virginia,” Gardner said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Virginians unable to charge at home, businesses like Dominion are making it possible at the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/27/dominions-electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure-program-has-zero-sign-ups/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">workplace</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>The company also <a href="https://www.dominionenergy.com/virginia/save-energy/electric-vehicles/residential-charger-program" target="_blank">announced</a> last Thursday that it would provide a one stop shop for qualifying residents who want to add chargers at home by connecting them with electricians. Participants can pay $1,835.96 upfront for the charger plus required materials, permitting, installation, maintenance and support, or pay $40.27 a month for five years. Low-income participants, including a family of four making less than $88,000 a year, can also participate at no cost. The utility will provide ongoing support, including a five year warranty.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This program eliminates a significant barrier to EV ownership by simplifying the process to purchase and install a home charger,&#8221; said Nathan Frost, General Manager of New Business &amp; Customer Solutions for Dominion Energy. &#8220;We are excited to help empower our customers to reduce their fuel costs and their emissions at the same time.&#8221;</span></p>

(Courtesy of Evan Visconti)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new program that scientists have sought to make Chesapeake Bay clean up more effective is now underway in Virginia, following a budget allocation from the legislature this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Known as the Pay-for-Outcomes grant </span><a href="https://www.deq.virginia.gov/topics-of-interest/nps-pilot-program?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) is accepting applications until Feb. 3 for the $20 million that is available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re not reimbursing people for efforts, we’re only paying for outcomes,” said Jonathan Rak, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">chief policy advisor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at DEQ, which administers a wide range of water quality programs. “We’re really excited about that.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is part of the Chesapeake Bay Program, a collection of the six states that are home to the waters of the 64,000 mile watershed feeding into The Bay, the nation’s largest estuary, which remains polluted after decades of efforts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bay program has pledged to clean up the Bay by reducing nitrogen, phosphorus and sediment erosion entering waterways, primarily through adoption of storm and wastewater treatment facility upgrades and agricultural best management practices, called Ag BMPs. Those efforts reduce waste or rainwater runoff that carry nutrients into rivers and streams. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the Bay Program is behind on meeting deadlines for 2025.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As several organizations, including the Chesapeake Bay Commission, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and state, environmental, local and farming groups discuss what the new goals should be and how to achieve them, the Pay-for-Outcomes program has gained attention as a way to get the most bang for a cleanups’ buck. Maryland adopted a program last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“New financial incentive programs such as pay-for-performance or pay-for-success programs,”  wrote the Scientific and Technical Advisory Committee of the Bay program in a Comprehensive Evaluation of System Response 2023 </span><a href="https://www.chesapeake.org/stac/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/CESR-Executive-Summary.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “offer opportunities … to encourage adoption of highly effective practices that land managers may not consider under standard cost-share programs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bay Program has counted progress toward cleanup goals by relying on modeling from the adoption of the Ag BMPs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has recently pumped record amounts of funding into a cost-share program to help with installing those BMPs, which include streamline fences to keep animals from defecating in waterways, or buffers to catch fertilizer before it trickles into streams and creaks, participation hasn’t been at desired levels. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the Ag BMP modeling is backed by scientific calculations, there isn’t a full verification to guarantee water quality is improving after a practice is installed. The Pay-for-Outcomes program is seen as a way to ensure actual results, while also exploring new technologies that can offer a targeted approach, said Joe Wood, a senior scientist with the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, an environmental group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One example of a new technology is a bioreactor, which is essentially a wood chip pile that filters spring water through it. Monitoring water between the spring and the reactor, and then past the reactor, can show how effective the technology is and if certain springs are releasing levels of pollution into waterways at higher rates than others, Wood explained.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In parts of the Shenandoah Valley, which have higher rates of nitrogen loads from a wide range of sources, including agricultural land that can also release varying amounts of nutrients in different sections, the Pay-for-Outcomes program can incentivize the use of the reactors to hone in on where work is needed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That kind of fine scale is really key to making our programs efficient,” said Wood. “If something like 10% of the land accounts for 50% of the loads, and if you go work in the areas that are low loading, you might never really get to address the key places.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jim Riddell of the Virginia Cattlemen&#8217;s Association, which represents thousands of cattle producers across the commonwealth, said he wasn’t sure what the level of interest in the program among farmers would be, but that it is an “opportunity” to go along with the Ag BMP cost-share program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We see this as additional supplemental money that will be directed toward nonpoint pollution,” Riddell said. “It’ll be interesting to see who and what the applicants are.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program is wide open to municipalities, farmers, environmental groups and for-profit groups within the Chesapeake Bay watershed, which in Virginia includes the James River and areas north of it, for awards of up to $100,000 to $7 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applicants can be groupings of projects, which eases the amount of review work the DEQ must do, Rak said, and most show they achieve pollution reductions beyond what is already required under statute and regulation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proposals will first be reviewed by a technical committee consisting of professors from Virginia Tech and the Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences chosen by DEQ Director Mike Rolband, that will determine a “confidence interval” for how likely the project will reach success since some of the proposed methods will be novel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, a selection committee with members of the DEQ and the Department of Conservation and Recreation will choose participants based on a scoring criteria, largely looking at the cost effectiveness of the program. Also, along with the confidence interval, proposals will be selected based on “habitat and resilience benefits, readiness to proceed, local government coordination, the provision of long-term maintenance and applicability to locally impaired waters,” states the budget </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2024/1/HB30/Introduced/MR/365/3h/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">language</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> proposed by Del. David Bulova, D-Fairfax.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applicants will have up to five years to achieve their results, which must be presented through monitoring or known modeling calculations, like for buffers. Then, payment will be delivered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There likely will be projects that fail,” said Rak. “That’s the nature of a pilot program. But we’re going to learn from that.”</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin speaking to a crowd in Richmond on April 8, 2024. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin has joined a group of nine other Republican governors who are advocating for “energy choice,” intending to “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">minimize permitting and other regulatory barriers” and “limit expensive energy mandates,” among other goals. Some clean energy advocates said the term is</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a euphemism for the continued use of natural gas that pollutes the planet and drives climate change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Called the Governors’ Coalition for Energy Choice, Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry and New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu announced the group in a press release </span><a href="https://gov.louisiana.gov/news/4637" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuesday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin&#8217;s press secretary, Christian Martinez, said the governor has &#8220;consistently called&#8221; for measures the group wants since releasing his energy plan that seeks &#8220;access to a reliable, affordable, increasingly clean, and growing supply of power.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The governor is encouraged by the broad support of Republican governors across the country leading the way, urging federal leaders to follow suit,&#8221; said Martinez.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The coalition includes Govs. Brian Kemp, of Georgia; Bill Lee, of Tennessee; Eric Holcomb, of Indiana; Mark Gordon, of Wyoming; Sarah Huckabee Sanders, of Arkansas; Kristi Noem of South Dakota; and Kevin Stitt, of Oklahoma.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid “high costs of energy and accelerating energy cost inflation,” the group highlights a need for energy policy that is “focused on affordability, reliability, and good stewardship” to “foster economic opportunity and improve the lives of their citizens.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin has touted similar messaging by advocating for his “All-of-the-Above” energy </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/19/youngkin-speaks-about-energy-plan-ahead-of-update-in-coming-weeks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which calls for continued natural gas usage, a re-evaluation of the Virginia Clean Economy Act — a 2020 landmark law that aims to decarbonize the state’s electric grid by 2050 — and using nuclear energy to provide reliable power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He and Kemp also joined other Republican leaders in Louisiana in </span><a href="https://lailluminator.com/2024/06/03/republican-governors-energy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">June</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to attack President Joe Biden’s climate policies, which are </span><a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/featured-stories/the-inflation-reduction-acts-benefits-and-costs" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">projected</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to prevent 21 billion tons of emissions and $5.6 trillion in environmental damages by investing in renewable energy technologies like solar, battery storage, offshore wind and nuclear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the need for electricity around the country and in Virginia is </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/28/virginia-explained-data-center-expansion-with-all-its-challenges-and-benefits/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">projected</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to skyrocket in coming years due to data center development, electrification of vehicles and increased use of technology, calling into question whether renewables can reliably provide enough power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its outlook, the EIA also projected that solar would be able to generate 28% of the energy it is capable of, what is known as a capacity factor, while natural gas has a capacity factor of 87%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But tools are available to alleviate the shortfall of renewable energy’s production by getting it on the grid faster, which will also decrease reliance on fossil fuels that are </span><a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/methane-tracker-2021/methane-and-climate-change" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">exacerbating</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> climate change, said Walton Shepherd, Virginia policy director for the Natural Resources Defense Council.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those tools include the recent Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rule 1920 to better coordinate transmission planning; technologies available to upgrade existing transmission lines; reforms underway to speed up approvals at PJM Interconnection, the regional grid Virginia is a member of; and savings created through energy efficiency by using less electricity in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All of those solutions are there, readily at hand for Governor Youngkin to help everyone who’s working on this,&#8221; said Shepherd. “For Youngkin to stick his head in the sand and side with fossil fuel interests is something that will raise costs, not lower them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, the costs of renewable energy, which comes with the benefit of avoiding health issues, will  only improve, said Tim Cywinski, communications director for the Virginia Chapter of the Sierra Club, by not relying on a volatile market like natural gas does, and by avoiding fossil fuel delivery fees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The more we put on the grid the cheaper it will become,” Cywinski said.</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin / Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recreational fishers in Virginia are asking legislators to take action on managing menhaden in the Chesapeake Bay, as the only reduction fishing company catching the tiny nutrient fish continues to refute allegations it’s harming the species.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a Sept. 3 </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/menhaden-letter.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Virginia Saltwater Sportfishing Association sent the request to all 100 members of the House of Delegates and 40 members of the Senate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure and it can no longer support this level of industrial-scale fishing in its fragile waters,” wrote Steve Atkinson, chairman of the VSSA, after detailing ways management of menhaden has and hasn’t changed in recent years. “Our citizens ask for your support of sensible regulatory/legislative action to better manage this vital public resource.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oversight of the menhaden reduction fishery in Virginia has long been debated through regulation requests and ongoing </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/08/29/virginia-ag-asks-for-dismissal-of-suit-over-menhaden-fishing-in-the-chesapeake-bay/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">court</span></a> <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/16/defendants-seek-dismissal-of-lawsuit-alleging-fraudulent-ownership-scheme-of-omega-protein/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cases</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that sought to reduce the catch amounts for Reedville-based Omega Protein, the lone reduction fishery in the Bay that reduces menhaden into fishmeal and oil.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The VSSA and conservationists say Omega’s catches are hurting the striped-bass population, though the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, the regional fishing management authority, says the species is </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/virginia-researchers-find-low-number-of-juvenile-striped-bass-in-2023/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">overfished</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but overfishing is not occurring. Overfished is a regulatory term meaning that the number of fish or weight of fish is below a sustainable reference point, while overfishing happens when catching or death rates are below a sustainable reference point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent </span><a href="https://www.chesapeakebaymagazine.com/study-links-menhaden-depletion-to-osprey-chicks-starving-in-nests/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is now linking lower populations of menhaden to starving osprey chicksin several areas of the Bay, not just the lower Mobjack Bay region that </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/08/03/local-audubon-society-asks-va-regulators-to-suspend-use-of-fishing-nets-in-bay-over-osprey-worries/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">previous</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> research examined. Over the summer, the USGS presented to the ASMFC separate </span><a href="https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eesc/science/osprey-pandion-haliaetus-population-and-availability-menhaden-brevoortia" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also looking at how catching menhaden, as well as pollution and weather events, could be starving the osprey species amid competition with other birds, including the double crested cormorant and brown pelicans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, the Virginia legislature transferred regulatory oversight to the Virginia Marine Resources Commission, where the VSSA and conservations thought stricter rules on Omega would be easier to attain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a 2022 petition with 11,000 signatures calling for Omega to move its fishing to the Atlantic Ocean in order to study the impact of the company on the Bay led to the VMRC entering into a non-binding </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/12/07/virginia-regulators-enter-into-agreement-with-menhaden-fishery/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">memorandum of understanding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the company, which agreed to not fish around holidays and weekends. Another </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/24/latest-petition-to-reduce-omega-proteins-menhaden-catch-limit-is-rejected/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">request</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for stricter regulations on Omega was denied earlier this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Omega, which is limited to a 51,000 metric ton cap on catches in the Bay under ASMFC’s direction, has said that fishing in the Bay is critical when inclement weather makes fishing in the Atlantic Ocean unsafe. There also isn’t any science showing their operations — which employ over 250 people with annual wages totaling $29 million, $26 million of which stays in Northumberland and Lancaster counties — aren’t as impactful on birds in the Bay as “a range of issues” that the USGS presented are, contends the company that operates Omega’s fishing vessels, Ocean Harvesters..</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ocean Harvesters believes that any organization can and should participate in the governing process, but the groups’ statements must be grounded in facts and the best available science; not erroneous rhetoric that is meant to misinform like that of VSSA,” said Ocean Harvesters in a statement, adding such rhetoric could “negatively impact the blue-collar, union, and minority workforce of Ocean Harvesters.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The letter from the VSSA references a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/31/house-committee-delays-action-on-study-of-menhaden-in-chesapeake-bay/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from this past session carried by Del. Lee Ware, R-Powatan, that would’ve funded the $2.6 million study both the recreational fishers and Omega have called for, but the measure was carried over to next year’s session. The recreational fishers, Omega, academic institutions and conservations crafted the framework of the study, to be conducted by the Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attempts to reach Ware weren’t immediately successful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Betsy Carr, D-Richmond, who is a member of the study’s subcommittee that voted to carry over Ware’s bill and several other funding requests said in a statement, “I and many of my colleagues remain supportive of it and interested in (the menhaden study’s) crucial findings.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I look forward to continuing to work on this issue in the coming Session and am hopeful that we can secure the funding and resources,” Carr said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the USGS presentation over the summer, the ASMFC </span><a href="https://www.usgs.gov/centers/chesapeake-bay-activities/news/atlantic-states-marine-fisheries-commission-asmfc-vote" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">approved</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a motion from Lynn Fegley, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources director of fishing and boat services, to form a workgroup to consider “precautionary options,” including seasonal closures, for regulations on Omega. Virginia’s representative on the board, Pat Geer, chief of fisheries management at VMRC, attempted to postpone the measure to gather the science first, but his motion failed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[Fegley’s] motion is leading down a path of the seasonal closure for a fishery based on public opinion,” said Pat Geer, VMRC Chief of Fisheries. “We need the science first. We need to have that information. It is very frustrating for us, and it&#8217;s embarrassing, that we can&#8217;t get the funding to do this, if it&#8217;s that important.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ASMFC workgroup is expected to present  proposals in October. Any regulation changes to Omega need </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> happen between October and December, the time period negotiated as part of the oversight transfer to VMRC to allow the company to prepare for the season that begins in May.</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s largest producer of natural gas is expanding its regional headquarters in the Southwest region of the state. Natural gas can be derived from coal bed methane, a potent greenhouse gas driving climate change which, in Virginia, is emitted through mining in the state’s coalfields.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, CNX Resources held a ribbon cutting to celebrate moving its regional headquarters from Claypool Hill in Tazewell County a few miles north to the Richlands Professional Building in the town of Richlands within the same county.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“CNX brings to life our vision for an all-American, all-of-the-above approach to fueling Virginia’s unprecedented economic growth and energy needs, leveraging Southwest Virginia’s rich coal mines to produce abundant, affordable, and lower emissions natural gas,” Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin said, referencing his energy </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/19/youngkin-speaks-about-energy-plan-ahead-of-update-in-coming-weeks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that calls for continued use of natural gas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move, announced in </span><a href="https://www.vceda.us/cnx-resources-celebrates-groundbreaking-for-new-virginia-headquarters-office/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2023</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, was made possible with a $900,000 loan from the Virginia Coalfield Economic Development Authority, a regional authority the Virginia legislature created in 1988 to diversify the economy in the state’s 13 coal-producing counties in the region. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The funds for the loan come from a severance tax Tazewell county assessed on coal and natural gas companies, explained Youngkin’s press secretary Christian Martinez.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The loan will go to the Tazewell County Industrial Development Authority, which will use $500,000 to purchase about 121 acres of CNX Resources property near Tazewell High School. The IDA will also give the remaining $400,000 to CNX Resources to pay for upgrades to the Richlands Professional Building, where CNX Resources has entered into a 15-year lease.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The expansion will house 75 employees and bring on eight new ones, while also increasing the Richland’s Professional Building square footage by 85%. The loan must be repaid within five years, but the $400,000 is forgivable if CNX Resources employs at least 75 employees full-time  with an average annual salary of $100,000 by the fifth anniversary of the loan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonathan Belcher, executive director of the VCEDA, said in a statement the authority was “pleased” to work with a “great” company that demonstrates why the region is “such a great place to do business and expand.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNX Resources, headquartered in Pittsburgh with operations also in Ohio, West Virginia and across the counties of Buchanan, Russell and Tazewell in Virginia, produces natural gas from the Marcellus and Utica shales of Appalachia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which operates in Virginia as Pocahontas Gas, produced around 52% of all natural gas in the state in 2023, mostly in Buchanan County, Virginia Energy spokeswoman Tarah Kesterson stated. Natural gas across the state that year had an estimated value of $217 million and accounted for 54% of in-state electricity generation, she added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The year prior, in 2022, about 83% of that natural gas came from coal beds through the extraction of methane from coal, a process known as coalbed methane, or CBM, according to the <a href="https://www.eia.gov/state/print.php?sid=VA#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20about%2083%25%20of,nation's%20total%20coalbed%20methane%20production." target="_blank">Energy Information Administration</a>. Those levels accounted for 10% of the county’s coal-bed methane.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Methane is 25 times stronger than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere, and can also come in the form of coal mine methane, or CMM, produced by mining operations releasing it as a safety measure to prevent explosions during underground digging for coal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brian Aiello is a spokesperson for CNX Resources, which was part of a 2023 state workgroup that suggested Virginia could create </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/20/new-report-says-virginia-could-incentivize-methane-capture-from-coal-mines/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">incentives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for CMM capture to stimulate economic activity and reduce emissions that would otherwise escape into the atmosphere.  The headquarters’ move “signifies our commitment to the region and aligns with our ongoing efforts to drive economic progress while reducing emissions in the Commonwealth,” Aiello stated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the topic of CMM incentives, Aiello said the company was “pleased that efforts at both the state and federal level to encourage the capture and beneficial use of coal mine methane continue to move forward,” adding that such projects are  “an environmental and economic win-win for the region.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia received funding from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency over the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/01/federal-government-awards-150-million-to-reduce-emissions-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">summer </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to capture coal mine methane. Sen. Travis Hackworth, R-Tazewell, introduced a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?251+sum+SB562" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">this past session that would have allowed CMM to count as a renewable energy source, but it got carried over to the 2025 session amid concern that it wouldn’t be a clean energy source and could continue incentivizing methane. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The International Panel on Climate Change, which links human created emissions to climate change, said that one ton of methane has a </span><a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/methane-tracker-2021/methane-and-climate-change" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">planet warming potential</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over a 100-year time frame that is equal to 28 to 36 tons of carbon dioxide emissions. Scientists have long linked climate change with increased severe weather events but the extent of its impact is unknown.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the commonwealth’s transition to electric vehicles, dealerships and private companies have been grappling with meeting sales targets, and the costs to convert fleets and install infrastructure, as one major auto retailer with a plant in Southwest Virginia manufactures the parts necessary for electric heavy trucks to hit the road here and across America. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of June 30, the Department of Motor Vehicles reports there were about 6.9 million vehicles registered in Virginia, about 1.7 million cars short of having one for every person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not clear how many of those cars are registered by private citizens or part of private companies’ fleets, but they contribute 37% of the state’s emissions from the transportation sector, almost double the next leading sources of Virginia’s 122 million metric tons of climate changing pollutants, according to a climate reduction </span><a href="https://www.deq.virginia.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/22732/638451476222270000" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality. The plan lists vehicle electrification as its number one solution to the problem..</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reducing those carbon emissions by using more electric vehicles is better for the environment, would provide opportunities and spur new jobs, said Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Loudoun, chair of the Senate Transportation Committee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe that if we don&#8217;t take necessary steps to reduce carbon emissions, and we know that transportation is the largest contributor to that, that we&#8217;re really going to be in very serious trouble,” Boysko said. “We should be thinking forward instead of trying to find ways of getting out of taking action.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration celebrated the </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2024/august/name-1032230-en.html#:~:text=RICHMOND%2C%20VA%20%E2%80%94%20Governor%20Glenn%20Youngkin,the%20City%20of%20Danville%20and" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expansion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of RBW Sports &amp; Classics to Virginia, placing another electric vehicle manufacturer in the commonwealth next to Volvo, which operates a factory in Dublin. But the governor also pledged to sever Virginia’s tie to California’s electric vehicle standards, and his administration said in a statement that electric vehicles may not be a one-size-fits-all solution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Electric vehicles are and will continue to be an attractive option for some drivers and businesses, but they simply won’t work for all Virginians,” said Christian Martinez, a spokesman for the governor. Youngkin’s move to “declare independence from the California Electric vehicle mandate restores Virginians’ freedom to decide which vehicles best fit the needs of their families and businesses and rids the commonwealth from a misguided mandate imposed by unelected bureaucrats.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Clean Cars and legislative efforts</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the controversial “Clean Cars” transition rules broadly require that 100% of new vehicle sales be electric starting in 2035, the regulations are nuanced and allow for hybrid-type vehicles that run on gas, and sales in other states, to be credited toward meeting the targets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia had been following the Advanced Clean Car I standards out of California under authority granted in the federal Clean Air Act. Those standards required about 7% of new vehicle sales in 2024 to be electric, before California passed the updated Advanced Clean Car II standards, which imposed the 100% electric sales requirement. The ACC II standards </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">start with 35% of new sales required to be electric or plug-in hybrid beginning in 2026. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new mandate under the ACC II standards is what led </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/05/youngkin-says-virginia-wont-follow-californias-clean-car-standards-anymore/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to say Virginia will revert back to following the less-stringent federal standards next year, with the backing of Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, who said the 2021 law tying the state’s tailpipe regulation to California’s didn’t mean the state had to follow the updated standards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin and Miyares have advocated for consumer choice, and so has Will Hupman, vice president of American Petroleum Institute that represents the oil and gas industry, in </span><a href="https://www.api.org/-/media/files/news/letters-comments/2024/api_comments_epa_acc_ii_final.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">comments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> submitted to the U.S. The Environmental Protection Agency, which is still considering </span><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/12/26/2023-28301/california-state-motor-vehicle-pollution-control-standards-advanced-clean-cars-ii-regulations" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">approving</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the exemption allowing California to set its own rules under the Clean Air Act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The 100% (zero emission vehicle)mandate for new vehicles plainly will have a significantly adverse effect on the nationwide market for liquid transportation fuels produced and marketed by API members and ignores other approaches that can result in similar emissions reductions, on a faster timeline, and at a lower cost,” Hupman wrote.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40024" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/img_4135/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40024" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4135-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4135-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4135-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4135-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4135-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4135-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4135-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A plug-in hybrid vehicle charges in Richmond. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental groups like the Southern Environmental Law Center, however, point to the standards’ flexibility that allow for compliance, like allowing credits from sales to be transferred among manufacturers. Credits from sales in other states, including manufacturers in California who “continue to over comply” with meeting requirements, according to the state’s online </span><a href="https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/applications/annual-zev-credits-disclosure-dashboard" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dashboard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, can also count toward sales requirements in Virginia, should the state fall behind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s also an option of allowing plug-in hybrid electric vehicles to account for 20% of a requirement. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, or PHEVs, run on gas but also can charge their battery with a plug, while a traditional hybrid uses its engine to charge its battery while the car is running.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EV sales have slowed from their earlier accelerated pace, leading to concerns about meeting future Clean Car requirements.  But the SELC contends adoption of the ACC II standards that include sales requirements will lead manufacturers to send more EVs to the state to continue development of the market. Because the rules offer flexibility in how its requirements are met, the group also said, that concern isn’t warranted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No manufacturer has ever failed to meet the requirements of the Clean Car Standards on the present side of things,” said Carroll Courtenay, a staff attorney with the SELC. “There&#8217;s a lot of play in the joints and a lot of flexibility in terms of how manufacturers kind of plan nationally to meet the standards across the various states where they&#8217;re in place.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic lawmaker Boysko acknowledged a concern she’s heard from some Virginians is that the commonwealth hasn’t done enough to spur the adoption of electric vehicles for consumers and create incentives for businesses to build the infrastructure for charging stations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the challenges that I hear from consumers, and I&#8217;m one of those, is that I want to be able to drive wherever I need to go in the commonwealth, and I&#8217;m not confident at this point to be able to do that because we have not done the work that my legislation set out to,(to) make a very clear effort that we are moving an electrified transportation system direction,” said Boysko.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Dealers juggle EV demand and regulations</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the updated rules, dealers in Virginia have either embraced the sales targets or been met with sales and supply challenges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is selling between 4-5 electric vehicles per month, according to Tim Pohanka, Chief Operating Officer for the Pohanka Automotive Group and Legislative Chairman for the Virginia Automobile Dealers Association.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said electric cars made up around 8% of all car sales across the country in 2023, in part due to some states helping consumers pay for cars through subsidies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the DMV, electric, traditional hybrids and plug-in hybrid vehicles made up about 1%, 3% and .001% of registered vehicles in the state as of June 30 this year, respectively. The about 311,199 total registrations of those vehicle types have contributed about $75.5 million toward the controversial </span><a href="https://www.wavy.com/news/investigative/charged-for-efficiency-the-highway-use-fee-debate/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">highway use fee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> drivers must pay to make up for lost gas tax revenue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as hybrids, another form of low emission vehicles, continue to sell quickly, Pohanka said one of the chief challenges for dealers is some customers’ hesitancy to buy EVs because of factors like the cost, lack of charging infrastructure and anxiety with how far EVs can travel on a charge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think it&#8217;s safe to say that the dealer body in this country is ready to go on anything that the consumer wants,” Pohanka said. “It really comes down to how that demand gets generated, and right now we just don&#8217;t see any of that demand.”</span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behind the scenes, Pohanka said dealers across the country are building the infrastructure for the charging stations, investing in safety equipment for staff, educating consumers and training sales professionals and technicians.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pohanka said there is a misconception that dealers are against electric vehicles. In reality, he said, dealers are allowing consumers to pick what suits them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When a consumer comes in and they&#8217;ve got questions about any type of drive train, be it (internal combustion engine), be it hybrid, be it electric, we&#8217;re showing all of those technologies to a consumer so they can make the right choice themselves,” he said. “There&#8217;s no pushing one way or pushing another. You really want the customer’s needs to be in charge of their purchase.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the country’s goals to convert gas powered vehicles to electric, or low emission, Pohanka predicts no state will be able to meet the California regulations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You&#8217;re not going to be able to go from 8% market share to 25% market share overnight. You&#8217;re going to need considerable help to get to those numbers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is some optimism about future EV sales, though.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stuart Gardner, executive director of </span><a href="https://generation180.org" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generation 180</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which provides consumer education on switching to electric, is confident vehicles will continue to sell. Generation 180 also found that women are underrepresented when it comes to EV ownership, representing  less than 30% of EV owners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re still seeing people shopping for electric vehicles, and people buying more and more electric vehicles every year in Virginia. So that&#8217;s still happening,” Gardner said. “Even though state media and national media is focusing on ‘oh, the sales are dropping,’ they&#8217;re still beating records, it&#8217;s just not growing as fast as it was and that&#8217;s the natural evolution of anything that sells. As it starts to move more mainstream that kind of adoption curve flattens out.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Converting fleets</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JK Moving Services, which is headquartered in Northern Virginia, has been preparing for the transition  enthusiastically, but still faces challenges like many other businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chuck Kuhn CEO and founder Chuck Kuhn said over the years the company has committed to sustainability. They use waste oil for furnaces and warehouse operations, provide sales members incentives to use electric vehicles and have converted all of its buildings to using motion sensors with LED lighting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JK’s truck drivers also use small, environmentally friendly generators when on the road instead of running diesel trucks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m passionate about protecting the environment, and it&#8217;s truly embraced in all aspects of how we run the business,” said Kuhn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shortage of electric trucks is one of the businesses’ key challenges, Kuhn said, especially after he invested and placed orders for Tesla’s electric vehicles years ago, which he has yet to receive. While he is still committed to converting the company’s fleet to electric, Kuhn admitted he was discouraged after learning that PepsiCo received less than half of the vehicles promised by the manufacturer, according to an April report by </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-semi-trucks-short-supply-pepsico-its-rivals-use-competing-ev-big-rigs-2024-04-19/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said he believed Tesla to be in the best position to bring electric heavy duty trucks to the market. He ordered six local tractors, but has been waiting four years after paying a deposit. The goal is to convert the entire tractor fleet by purchasing 12 units total. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would have thought by now a large portion of our local fleet would have been converted to electric,” Kuhn said. “I had no idea it was going to take this long to get them.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shelley Francis, co-founder and managing partner of EVNoire, a consulting company that focuses on autonomous mobility solutions, said some of the reasons businesses are converting their fleets to electric vehicles is because of the cost of maintaining a gas powered vehicle. Francis said electric vehicles have limited maintenance costs for tires, windshield wipers and fluids.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to JK Moving Services, Francis said their clients are also converting their fleets to meet their sustainability goals such as reducing their carbon footprint. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kuhn said some other challenges he anticipates once his EV trucks arrive is the need to outsource maintenance support for the trucks until he can train his mechanics, preparing for the lack of infrastructure across the country and limitations on how many miles a truck can travel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s easy to sit back and say, ‘no, that won&#8217;t work,’ ‘we can&#8217;t do it,’ and then you don&#8217;t change, and I&#8217;m a firm believer: if you don&#8217;t embrace change, you&#8217;re going to be left behind,” Kuhn said.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Heavy truck industry opposes regulations</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some businesses are working to convert its fleet of heavy trucks, others are in opposition to federal rules calling for the transition due to the mandates and costs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Trucking Association, which said there were 43,338 heavy and tractor trailer truck </span><a href="https://vatrucking.wildapricot.org/resources/ATRI_FastFacts_2024_VA.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drivers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Virginia in 2022, said there’s been a 98% reduction of nitrous oxide emissions coming from the trucking industry’s tailpipes since 1985.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heavy trucks in Virginia follow rules from the federal government, which finalized an update in March that, similar to the passenger car rules, calls for truck drivers to use cleaner gas engines, traditional and plug-in hybrids, and battery electric and hydrogen fuel cell type vehicles for model years 2027 through 2032. Several groups are challenging the rules, which could delay their implementation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EPA </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-finalizes-strongest-ever-greenhouse-gas-standards-heavy" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">estimates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the rules will remove one billion tons of climate-changing emissions from the 25% of emissions heavy trucks contribute to the transportation sector’s total emissions. The rules could also save the country $13 billion in avoided health costs, fuel and operation benefits.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though environmental groups like the Natural Resources Defense Council said the rules didn’t actually go far </span><a href="https://www.nrdc.org/bio/guillermo-ortiz/epas-latest-heavy-duty-vehicle-rule-does-not-meet-moment" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">enough</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Dale Bennett, president and CEO of the Virginia Trucking Association, said the rules had “picked the technology” by pushing toward electric vehicle adoption, which the industry says will cost </span><a href="https://www.trucking.org/news-insights/ev-mandates-trucking-industry-are-disconnected-reality" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1 trillion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in purchases, and require building charging infrastructure and upgrading power supply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That price tag will force drivers to either hold on to their trucks or hurry to purchase trucks now, which aren’t up to the EPA’s Clean Car standards, Bennett said. Higher costs will also trickle down to raise the costs of transported goods, and with the lack of heavy truck charging, which works differently than passenger vehicle charging, there’s what’s called “range anxiety” over how long a change will last and concern over an EV trucks’ towing ability, he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“W</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">here&#8217;s that money going to come from?” said Bennett. “It will require more trucks to haul the same amount of freight we&#8217;re hauling. We’ve got to figure that out. We think there are other technologies and ways to get there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volvo Group, which runs the 2.3 million-square-foot New River Valley Operations electric heavy trucks manufacturing plant in Dublin, a town within Virginia’s Pulaski County,  sees things differently. The company is “c</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ompletely aligned” with the EPA’s desire of “speeding the transition to zero-emission vehicles,” said Volvo Group North America Public Relations Director Janie Coley. They also have other emissions-reducing ideas for the commonwealth and other localities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Along with electrification, states can realize significant reductions through greater use of renewable, lower carbon fuels, like HVO (renewable diesel),” Coley said, adding the plant uses HVO to move finished vehicles off the plant’s production line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In total, there are 560 </span><a href="https://www.volvotrucks.us/trucks/vnr-electric/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volvo VNR Electric</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> trucks, which make up 44% of the Class 8 battery electric heavy trucks, the heaviest class, in the country, said Bobby Compton, product market manager at Volvo Trucks North America. Those vehicles have driven over 7.8 million miles since being launched in 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local carriers, including Camrett Logistics, Watsontown and Online Transportation, are using the model on daily routes in and out of the facility, transporting parts on two shifts while drivers charge them up on their lunch break, Compton said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the model has more towing power, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “The Volvo VNR Electric features 4,051 lb./ft of torque, which is substantially higher than the 1,850 lb./ft of torque on a traditional internal combustion engine VNR.” </span></p>

(Courtesy of Volvo Group North America)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coley admitted that zero-emissions trucks including the VNR Electric have a higher production cost, resulting in a higher purchase price for customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is why we’ve seen the greatest rate of adoption of the VNR Electric in states and Canadian provinces where there are incentive and grant programs to offset some of the cost of purchase for customers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company takes a “consultative approach” with customers to evaluate their operations, see if they fixed or planned routes, work to find incentives and offer financing options, including for charging infrastructure, Compton added.</span></p>

(VCU Capital News Service)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state&#8217;s second largest utility serving a majority of Southwest Virginia is asking state regulators for a 70% reduction in the pay rate for customers who generate their own electricity and sell excess amounts back to the company. The request could stifle residential customers’ adoption of solar in the region, proponents of the zero-carbon energy source say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appalachian Power Company submitted the </span><a href="https://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/815r01!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">request</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the State Corporation Commission Aug. 30 as part of a new rulemaking process required by the Virginia Clean Economy Act, a law seeking to decarbonize the utility’s grid by 2045. The process governs the program known as net-metering, which took off in 2017.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Net-metering allows residents and companies to install generation sources on their roof or property to provide the electricity they would otherwise need to pull from the utility’s grid. In APCo’s territory, those generation sources have mostly been solar panels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The homes and businesses sell back to the company whatever amount of electricity they generate beyond what they need, and net that revenue against their costs for energy they may pull from the utility when their source isn’t producing, resulting in savings or credits that can be applied to a future month’s bill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appalachian Power is currently paying those participants $0.16 per kilowatt hour for the excess power they generate, and wants to grandfather them for 25 years, while offering new participants $0.04 per kilowatt hour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a customer who needs about 1,000 kilowatts of electricity, and generates 1,057 kilowatts through their panels, the change would result in a monthly bill increase from $7.96 to $66.95. An APCo customer who doesn’t participate in net metering faces a monthly bill of $174 under current rates, which </span><a href="https://roanoke.com/news/local/appalachian-power-rate-increase-virginia-utility-aep/article_2b39b428-6fc7-11ef-ab1c-6b350691a782.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">may</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> go up again, despite resident and legislator opposition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rate change also reflects a change in netting methodology for new participants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the old system, the customer would generate a total amount of electricity for a given month and net that against the power they pulled from the utility when their source was not generating enough, which happened 80% of the time in a year and resulted in the savings, according to the utility. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new methodology would compensate a customer for the excess energy they send back to the grid, at the new rate, and then charge them, at standard rates, for the energy they pull from the utility when their generation source wasn&#8217;t meeting their needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The proposed netting methodology will still allow the customer-generator to offset their usage with their solar generation that is equal to or less than their usage in a given hour at full retail rate,” said company spokeswoman Teresa Hall. “But any excess generation that is exported to the company’s system will not be carried over to a different hour when they are using energy from the company,” Hall said. Instead, “it will instead be given a bill credit at the avoided cost rate proposed in the petition.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company asked for the reduction and change largely because participants rely on the overall grid’s transmission and distribution system to sell their power back to the utility, or draw in power when their solar doesn’t produce enough of it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the 3,860 program’s participants — who represented about .07% of APCo’s 542,000 customers in 2023 — don’t pay for the costs to maintain that grid, the utility said, which resulted in a $3.8 million savings that year coming from non-participants, who do pay the fees for maintaining transmission and distribution lines. The company said this is an inequitable arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Due to the inherent cross-subsidization in the current net metering program, non-participating customers, including low-income customers and/or customers that are members of environmental justice communities bear a disproportionate share of the costs necessary to facilitate net metering as it exists today,” attorneys for Appalachian Power wrote in their petition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solar developers, though, counter that having more net metering solar projects on the grid creates more distributed generation resources and reduces the wear and tear on those transmission and distribution lines by not relying on them as much. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As data centers proliferate in Virginia, demand for electricity is expected to increase, which will increase the need for costly improvements to transmission and distribution lines to deliver more power, said Russ Edwards, president of Tiger Solar, a solar developer that has done business in APCo territory. APCo can recover those costs from customers, plus a roughly 10% return on equity, or profit margin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“(Demand) has been flat for a while. It’s not any longer,” said Edwards. “That’s a big deal and should be in the public’s best interest for all utilities to promote distributed generation.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">APCo stated that participation in net metering has increased by 31.6% from the 1,310 participants it had in 2018, and has generated a total of 36.9 megawatts, about 1% of the 3,225 MW peak amount of electricity the utility produced in 2023. The generation that net metering customers relieve the grid of “definitely won’t go up,” Edwards said under the new program. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The difference in the final bill costs between the old rate and the new rate may only be about $59, but when residents are considering whether to participate to save about $108 on a bill, compared to non-participants, Edwards said, the change could increase the amount of financing needed and the time period from when the savings will pay off the cost of the solar panels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It makes the economics way more challenging,” Edwards said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unless the nascent technology of an energy storage device can be paired with a project to provide power when a generation source isn’t producing, Southern Environmental Law Center staff attorney Josephus Allmond said, the detrimental effects of reducing the net-metering payment rate has been experienced in California, which one </span><a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/california-puc-net-metering-policy-nem-appeals-court/702569/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said lead to a loss of 77% to 85% in sales and 17,000 jobs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The risk of reduced net metering participation also comes after the federal government announced it’s giving Virginia </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/23/president-biden-visits-prince-william-park-to-talk-solar-youth-involvement-on-earth-day/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$156 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to deploy more solar alongside other funding opportunities.  And solar projects on rooftops can help avoid conflicts with </span><a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/community/orangenews/the-sun-has-set-on-solar-development-in-orange-county/article_8625ded8-664f-11ef-a390-6b9fff43d167.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">localities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that are concerned with losing agricultural and forested land to panels needed to reverse climate change, Allmond said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We need utilities to show us some solutions. Customers deserve that,” Allmond said. “Given (the) funding on the way to Virginia for low income solar, ApCo&#8217;s petition to slash the net metering compensation rate by roughly 70% will hamper residential solar, a crucial part of the energy transition.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The State Corporation Commission is expected to review the request over the next 12 months, with several other parties interested in being involved, including Solar United Neighbors, Clean Virginia and more, since the result could set a precedent ahead of Dominion submitting its petition next year.</span></p>

(Photo courtesy of Bradley Strahm / Community Housing Partners)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A report from a national energy efficiency research group found that one of every four low-income residents in Virginia’s capital city are severely energy burdened, spending more than 17.5% of their income on electricity, and heating and cooling costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Published Wednesday, the </span><a href="https://www.aceee.org/press-release/2024/09/study-one-four-low-income-households-spend-over-15-income-energy-bills" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy found that nationally, 25% of low-income households spend more than 15.2% of their income on those costs. In Richmond, the energy costs for low-earning residents are even higher. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The amount of income a household spends on energy costs is called energy burden. That energy burden is considered high when households spend more than 6% of their income on it, and called severe when it takes up more than 10% of a household’s income.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improving energy efficiency — the idea of sealing up buildings and using modern appliances so less energy is needed to keep homes warm, cool and illuminated — can lessen the energy burden.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is an update from ACEEE’s 2020 </span><a href="https://www.aceee.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/u2006.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which was used in a 2023 Nature Conservancy </span><a href="https://rampages.us/wilderresearch/wp-content/uploads/sites/37363/2023/01/Pitt-et-al.-2023-Analysis-of-the-Impacts-of-RGGI-and-the-HIEE-Program-1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> detailing energy burden statewide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ACEEE’s latest report</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> used data from the 2021 U.S. Census Bureau’s American Housing Survey. The households reviewed were single family homes, or within a multi-family building made up of four or less units, and included those who own and rent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Richmond, 25% of all households with the highest energy burden spend more than 5.1%. Of those, Black and Hispanic households have an energy burden above 6.9% and 6.2%, respectively. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nationally, the 25% of all households with the highest energy burden spend more than 5.7%, with black and Hispanic households spending more than 7.2% and 6.2%, respectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report calls out Richmond as one of two examples, the other being Boston, of what low-income households face with a median annual income of $20,000 and a median annual utility bill of $1,800, or monthly bill of $150. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That household would have an energy burden of 9%, but for the 25% of low-income households in the city earning $11,700 a year or less, and with the annual energy bill as high as $2,640, which is the case for three-quarters of Richmond’s low-income households, “the energy burden skyrockets to 22.6%,” the report stated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roxana Ayala, lead author of the policy brief and senior local policy research analyst at ACEEE, said in a statement on the overall findings that low-income households are likely to live in older buildings that are less energy-efficient. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The households that are least able to afford the upfront costs of home energy upgrades are the ones that most need utility bill savings, so bringing low- or no-cost efficiency improvements to them is vital to reduce their burdens,” Ayala stated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report provides several policy recommendations to ease the energy burden on low-income families, including ways to make cost-saving programs more </span><a href="https://www.aceee.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/adapting_energy_efficiency_programs_to_reach_underserved_residents_-_encrypt.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accessible</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It also points to funding opportunities in the federal Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to provide energy efficiency upgrades.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

(Kristin Herring/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">James Madison University professor Mace Bentley had a friend living on the Eastside of Atlanta who noticed his VCRs and TVs going on the fritz after several lightning strikes during thunderstorms that would move west across the sprawling Southeast city. It was a comparatively minor issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A fire chief of a nearby station told Bentley and a colleague that he “hardly” had “enough trucks to send out for these fires that are occurring from lightning strikes.” That, and other anecdotal evidence, spurred Bentley to dig into the data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When they surveyed data sets, Bentley said, “We found … there’s more lightning that’s occurring downwind from the city. It looked like the city was actually enhancing lightning and producing this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bentley has continued that research, now with a focus closer to Virginia. In July, he </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169809524001844?dgcid=rss_sd_all" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">published</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> findings that show from 2006 to 2020, between the months of May and September as pollution levels increased from cities, including the Washington D.C. metro area, lightning strikes also increased. The research offers a look at the potential, present day impact of climate change in the region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most of the research on climate change, most of the press, is global climate change. We didn&#8217;t want to think about climate change from the standpoint of what is going to happen 20 years from now,” Bentley said. “We want to see: Are humans impacting the climate right now and where and how much?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The research included reviewing lightning strike data gathered from the </span><a href="https://ghrc.nsstc.nasa.gov/home/lightning/index/data_nldn" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Lightning Detection Network</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The locations of those strikes were traced back to where storm events were observed to have traveled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bentley then looked up hourly air quality monitoring data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to find levels of particulate matter 2.5 and particulate matter 10, tiny carcinogens that are 2.5 and 10 microns in diameter, respectively, which come from tailpipe emissions, industrial and manufacturing activity and several other sources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The research then determined when there were high levels of Convective Available Potential Energy, or CAPE, a metric used to measure the atmospheric conditions that are ripe for lightning activity. As the CAPE increases with hot humid air at the ground level and cooler air above, when pollution enters the mix during those “dog days of summer,” Bentley said, it leads to more lightning flashes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bentley and his team found that pollution is “affecting thunderstorm development, electrification and thunderstorm intensity over time,” Bentley said, noting the right CAPE conditions are needed before pollution can create more lightning strikes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can&#8217;t say, &#8216;oh, it&#8217;s a polluted day, so we&#8217;re going to get thunderstorms.’ That&#8217;s not the case. Pollution is like an accelerant,” Bentley said. “Once you get a thunderstorm, it&#8217;s like a fire accelerant.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But even at low, medium and high levels of CAPE, the research further found that increased pollution levels still produced more lightning strikes, showing “the pollution is really playing a fundamental ingredient in electrifying these storms,” Bentley said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Washington D.C. area lightning strikes also happened the most on Thursdays, later in the week, after people have been commuting to work and driving around and enough pollution has built up, before winding back down over the weekend — all while CAPE levels remained the same.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s like when you turn on the heat on your stove, the water doesn&#8217;t boil instantaneously. It takes a while. That heat has to transfer to the water, and then finally gets hot and boils,” Bentley said. “The same thing happens with cities.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The research also found that size of the pollutant didn’t matter; it was the volume of them within the atmosphere that counted. Larger cities like D.C. can also impact regional communities, like Fredericksburg, Charlottesville and Richmond, the data also found, with winds strong enough to push a storm around. Smaller cities can also have an impact on surrounding communities, just at a smaller scale, Bentley added.</span></p>

(Courtesy of Mace Bentley)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The storms are ones that pop up on a moment&#8217;s notice and may last for about an hour, Bentley said, much like the one on Aug. 26, wherein </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2024-09-03/cardinal-elementary-reopen-richmond-public-schools-fire" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cardinal Elementary school</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Richmond was struck by lightning and caught fire around </span><a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/cardinal-elementary-school-fire-aug-26-2024" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">6:54 p.m.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Wakefield office of the National Weather Service, </span><a href="https://forecast.weather.gov/product.php?site=AKQ&amp;issuedby=RIC&amp;product=CLI&amp;format=CI&amp;version=30&amp;glossary=0" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">temperatures reached</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 93 degrees with a relative humidity of 93% that day. The storm formed at about 6 p.m. northwest of Richmond before rain fell at 6:10 pm. And temperatures cooled as the storm disappeared on the Southeast side of the city around 7 p.m. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Bentley said he wasn’t exactly sure exactly how pollution levels may have influenced it, he added, “I think it could have very well been associated” with the air quality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sam Wray, meteorologist with the Wakefield office of the National Weather Service, said he wasn’t able to speak to the findings of the research, but acknowledged that isolated storms like those popping up in the summer time generally “is not really an uncommon thing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The storms in Hurley and Whitewood in Southwest Virginia in 2021 and 2022, respectively, led to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/20/after-hurley-and-whitewood-floods-virginia-considers-state-relief-fund/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">devastating flooding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and are examples of quickly formed storms dumping inches of rain in a short period, Bentley acknowledged. Those storms were a few hours longer and located in rural areas with less traffic than an urban environment, but pollution in those areas can come from far away distances, like smoke from the fires in Canada did </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/06/12/as-smoke-from-canada-enters-virginia-research-links-climate-change-with-more-frequent-wildfires/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">last year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, leading to health warnings across the state. The toxins can then become trapped by the surrounding mountainous terrain, Bentley added, similarly to the smog issues mountain-bound communities in California’s Los Angeles County deal with. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The research on D.C.-area cities is similar to findings Bentley made in Kansas City and in Bangkok, Thailand; the common denominator is the pollution, Bentley said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You could probably go around the world where you have different particle sizes impacting the atmosphere, but if the content remains relatively the same, you might get this similar electrification for a thunderstorm.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s two ways to address the matter, Bentley said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/10/virginias-future-concerning-vehicle-electrification-is-bright-but-costs-are-a-challenge/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower pollution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> levels through multitudes of innovative technologies we&#8217;ve got,” Bentley said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also key: Helping hot cities cool off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And also put in more green space so that you make the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/10/research-shows-heat-exposure-disproportionately-affects-black-richmonders/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">heat island</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cooler.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In one sense, car travel can be traced all the way back to 3500 BC in the Middle East when Mesopotamians invented the wheel and axle to transport items. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flash forward through the advent of the horse and buggy and the Ford Model T, the U.S. and Virginia are undergoing the latest stage in four-wheel travel: the adoption of electric vehicles that run on rechargeable batteries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The process is happening, and it&#8217;s happening faster everyday,” said Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, an electric vehicle owner. “It’s part of the natural evolution of technology. It’s not an infringement on anybody. It is a phased-in process. It’s a transition of the kind we’ve experienced before.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, as the demand for reducing carbon emissions and purchasing electric vehicles grows, government and transit agencies in Virginia are facing questions about how they will meet such expectations. At the center of these charged efforts is the substantial costs of implementing the technology statewide, and how different levels of government are helping to support the transition through policy and funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The electrification of the transportation industry is an opportunity, and also a disruption, to the national power economy that the Governor’s All-American, All-of-the-Above energy plan contends with,” Christian Martinez, a press secretary for Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">High costs for everyone</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Localities across the commonwealth agree that the costs to pay for electric vehicles and chargers can add up quickly, even for some of the most affluent jurisdictions. Local leaders have said state and federal grants have become vital to the transition statewide, but they also believe there is a long-term benefit for the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2018, Fairfax County, one of the most affluent counties in the commonwealth, organized its Operational Energy Strategy, which included goals to electrify its fleet and have a 100% carbon-free fleet by 2035.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, Fairfax has 12  electric buses in its transit connector fleet with four more in production, two electric trash trucks, and an electric box truck to move supplies, all purchased through grants from the Environmental Protection Agency. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_36067" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/08/23/dominion-dulles-break-ground-on-nations-largest-renewable-energy-project-at-an-airport/img_0518/" rel="attachment wp-att-36067"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-36067 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_0518-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_0518-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_0518-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_0518-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_0518-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_0518-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_0518-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  An electric bus used by the city of Alexandria on display as an example of one Dulles Airport would use.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Morrill, director of Fairfax’s Office of Environmental and Energy Coordination, said Fairfax’s “inclination to pursue the goal of electrification and the goal of carbon neutrality was perhaps facilitated by the county having staff already working in this area toward environmental goals, the external funding is absolutely critical.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to Fairfax County, affluent Alexandria adopted a goal in 2019 of transitioning the city’s vehicles to full electric by 2040, but it’s falling short of its aim to convert 25% of the fleet by the end of this fiscal year, June 30,  because of delays, including the pandemic when funding was scarce. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, the city has acquired 65 electric vehicles, 45 hybrids, 6 plug-in hybrids and 42 hybrid electric buses, said Ursula Ramos, a spokesperson for the city’s transportation and electrification office. The costs for the passenger vehicles have ranged from $25,000 to $55,000, as costs for some heavy duty trucks and buses have ranged from from $500,000 to $1.8 million per vehicle, Ramos said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The locality is working on a study, expected to be completed by the end of the year, to fully evaluate how much transitioning a vehicle may cost in the long term, which will present a perspective beyond the sticker shock.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We anticipate getting some savings over the life of the vehicle through maintenance and fuel costs, and we are also taking advantage of the IRS’s direct pay incentives that provide some incentives for the purchase of any alternative fuel vehicles,” said Amy Posner, electric vehicle planner for Alexandria. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keith Harless, town manager of Pennington Gap in Lee County, said the town partnered with Virginia Clean Cities to promote electric vehicles in rural areas three years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said one of the challenges for rural areas with charging stations is being patient on the revenue return. The town manager said rural areas “most likely” won’t have day-to-day users compared to more densely populated areas like  cities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that is not stopping the town of approximately 1,600 people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harless said the town has a charging station and two others expected to be available this month, thanks to grant funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We recognized years ago that even though we are a small town, we still want to be able to prepare for the future, regardless of what comes &#8230; we would still like to accommodate anybody that’s visiting our town,” Harless said.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How Virginia is participating in the transition</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Virginia has dedicated millions to clean transportation projects following the 2016 </span><a href="https://www.deq.virginia.gov/topics-of-interest/volkswagen-settlement-agreement" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volkswagen settlement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which required the major car maker to make payments toward environmental remediation because of allegations of cheating on emissions tests, the state’s vehicle electrification transition has included some proposals from lawmakers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the policy goals were intended to drive the public toward purchasing electric vehicles, and to help localities with funds. However, those efforts have been mostly unfruitful, as the state legislature and governor’s administration have collided on the matter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Democratic members of the legislature pushed for new electric vehicle sales by passing a law in 2021 that tied Virginia’s tailpipe emissions to the stringent “Clean Car” standards passed by California, which takes periodic steps toward ultimately banning the sale of new gas-powered cars in 2035. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though gas-powered cars could still be used and bought from the used car market under the standards, Republican legislators and Youngkin have opposed the policy, arguing that people should transition to electric vehicles at their own pace. In June, despite the 2021 legislation, Youngkin </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/05/youngkin-says-virginia-wont-follow-californias-clean-car-standards-anymore/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">decided</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to take up the only other option: following the federal standards next year. It was a move that some legislators opposed and others embraced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have no doubt that those intent on mandating what citizens are allowed to drive will have the inclination to challenge this, but I&#8217;m hopeful we ultimately recognize we are better off when we make our own policies and decisions as a Commonwealth — not be forced to tie our yolk to a state like California,” said Del. Tony Wilt, R-Rockingham, in a July statement.  Still, Wilt acknowledged  both air pollution improvements and cost concerns with the standards.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin and Attorney General Jason Miyares held an event at a Richmond-area Toyota dealership to announce Virginia would no longer follow California&#8217;s clean car standards.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Clean Cars policy had been seen as the best way to curb the </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">country’s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.deq.virginia.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/19685/638411885888070000" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state’s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> largest source of emissions, those coming from transportation, which are causing climate change’s increasing storm intensities. But to offset the costs of electric vehicles, the federal government has been the only provider of government-based point-of-sale rebates or tax breaks in the amount of $7,500 through the Inflation Reduction Act, which funds many of its initiatives through a tax on corporations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those incentives have been </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/05/14/1251096758/biden-china-tariffs-ev-electric-vehicles-5-things" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tough</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to use, because of federal requirements mandating electric vehicle components be made in America that come with them, yet Virginia’s government  hasn’t funded  a $2,500 </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title45.2/chapter17/article8/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rebate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program through Virginia Energy, which could help offset costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do I wish that had been and was being funded? The answer to that is yes,” said Sullivan. “I await the day when Virginia, both the legislature and the governor, make the decision to fund that program.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to The Mercury’s query on how much interest there has been in the rebate program, the Virginia Department of Energy sent a statement from Director Glenn Davis, a former Republican lawmaker, that said “bipartisan consensus has remained to this day” on deciding the program “was not worthy of funding.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Martinez, with the Youngkin administration, didn’t address costs directly in his statement, but said that with federal funding available, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">state agencies across Virginia … are pursuing opportunities aligned with the Governor’s vision to foster innovation and ensure Virginians have access to reliable, affordable, and increasingly clean energy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state government is grappling to gauge  the cost of electric vehicles for its own use,  by way of legislation that passed in </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/06/17/under-new-law-virginias-government-fleet-is-poised-to-go-electric/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2022</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to fully assess the cost of transitioning state vehicles to electric. Similar to Alexandria’s study in evaluating maintenance and fuel cost for purchasing an electric or gas vehicle, the state is supposed to purchase a gas vehicle only if the assessment “clearly indicates” it&#8217;s the cheaper option when looking at the lifetime of the costs instead of the sticker price.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Department of General Services, which oversees the state’s facilities and cars, said 99% of their vehicles are gas powered, with less than 1% being electric or hybrid. Those percentages are the same breakdown for vehicles bought in 2024, said Killeen Wells, deputy director of communications, when “only 1% of purchases showed an electric vehicle as being more affordable and operationally viable.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides cots, there are other factors for the state to contend with when purchasing EVs, Wells said, including “limited electric vehicle availability to government fleets” and lack of infrastructure at our state agencies and cost.” There’s no defined timeline to transition the state’s fleet fully to electric vehicles, Wells added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Electric vehicles are purchased when the electric vehicle meets the commonwealth&#8217;s operational and financial criteria,” she said.</span></p>

(NBC12)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Transportation launched an electric vehicle pilot program last year after purchasing a number of trucks for the agency. However, like others, VDOT has faced a significant delay in acquiring and using electric vehicles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christopher Berg, assistant director of VDOT’s environmental divisions, said the agency is deploying them across the commonwealth in different use cases to determine the feasibility of bringing electric vehicles into the agency’s fleet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re really in the early days of looking at how to bring electric vehicles into our VDOT fleet,” Berg said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has also put $39.9 million toward the purchase of battery-electric buses from the state’s share of the 2016 Volkswagen settlement.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How federal EV funding is being put to use statewide, from schools to law enforcement </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With local support and the overwhelming amount of federal funding, schools in Virginia have been the most notable groups to benefit from the transition from diesel to electric. In addition, local governments have also started to convert their fleets of vehicles but are still facing challenges with costs and charging.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;White House unveils $1 billion for electric and low-emission school buses&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/08/white-house-unveils-1-billion-for-electric-and-low-emission-school-buses/embed/#?secret=bumLCKvEv3#?secret=t6PQ3gO7QS" data-secret="t6PQ3gO7QS" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Fairfax, the school division purchased 73 electric buses, most of which were paid for by the U.S. </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/cleanschoolbus" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental Protection Agency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a competitive grant from Dominion Energy. The Fairfax County Joint Environmental </span><a href="https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/environment-energy-coordination/joint-environmental-task-force" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Task Force</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a group that worked to address climate change and environmental sustainability, provided assistance in purchasing three electric buses. Currently, there are 1,625 school buses in the division’s fleet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“FCPS School Board and Administration recognize the importance of protecting our children and community by eliminating emissions into the atmosphere and reducing our dependence on fossil fuels,” said Steven Brasley, a spokesman for Fairfax schools, adding that the county plans to convert school buses and other fleet vehicles to electric or zero-carbon alternatives by 2035.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brasley said Fairfax would advise other school divisions interested in switching to electric to work with their local utility provider to ensure infrastructure and agreements are in place and to take their time. Training drivers, maintenance technicians, and supervisors are critical to success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some schools are still working to reduce emissions through alternatives to purchasing electric buses. Others have tabled the idea. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the southeastern part of Virginia, Newport News Public Schools </span><a href="https://sbo.nn.k12.va.us/news/archive/2024-01-08_NNPS-receives-government-grant-for-propane-school-buses.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in January that it would be using other alternative fuel sources, such as propane, for buses. The school division announced it was awarded a grant of $525,000 from the EPA to replace 15 diesel school buses with propane buses. The acquisition would bring the city’s total of propane buses to 168 out of a total fleet  of 318.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rappahannock County Public Schools Superintendent Shannon Grimsley said her division has not purchased any electric buses. She said until the infrastructure is available, it does not make much sense for the district to switch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grimsely said the school division also faces challenges with meeting the qualifications for grant funding, terrain and the lack of available charging resources presently. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We researched and even collaborated with other districts on available grant programs to purchase electric buses, but the partial rebates and up front infrastructure costs associated with these programs made the concept cost prohibitive for us to pursue further,” Grimsley said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Law enforcement is also considering converting its fleet, but in smaller steps, as the technology continues to develop for electric patrol vehicles. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39947" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/20231101_165645000_ios/" rel="attachment wp-att-39947"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-39947" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20231101_165645000_iOS-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1875" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20231101_165645000_iOS-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20231101_165645000_iOS-300x220.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20231101_165645000_iOS-1024x750.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20231101_165645000_iOS-768x563.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20231101_165645000_iOS-1536x1125.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20231101_165645000_iOS-2048x1500.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A view of an electric vehicle owned by the Fairfax County Police Department. (Photo Courtesy of Fairfax County Police Department)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fairfax County Police Department has acquired five electric vehicles through a procurement process as part of its fleet with over 1,200 vehicles. The vehicles, which range in costs between $25,000 to $75,000, are used for recruitment primarily by administrative staff, but are being considered for other uses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The department said one of the keys was having the infrastructure in place before receiving the electric vehicles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its 2019 </span><a href="https://www.government-fleet.com/324588/va-police-gets-ev-for-response-at-public-events" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announcement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Virginia Capitol Police has been operating a six-seat electric vehicle, which was purchased from Global Electric Motorcars (GEM), a subsidiary of Minnesota-based Polaris Industries using grant funds from the U.S. Department of Justice. In 2021, Polaris sold GEM to Waev Inc. based in Anaheim, California.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spokesman Joe Macenka said the Capitol Police’s six-seat GEM, licensed for use on city streets and capable of traveling 25 MPH with a range of 35 miles, helps to transport people around the 13-acre Capitol Square. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, Col. Anthony S. “Steve” Pike, former Capitol Police chief, announced that the GEM could reach all state properties the division is assigned to protect in Richmond. He said GEM would be less expensive to operate than a traditional police vehicle and have less of an impact on the environment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the impact transportation use has on climate change and direct </span><a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/transportation" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">air quality</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> benefits, Posner, with Alexandria, said the transition to electric vehicles is “pretty critical to meet our overall environmental and climate action goals.”</span></p>

(Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drill down far enough into the earth, and you will hit hot rocks. Energy companies have used this heat to generate carbon-free electricity for </span><a href="https://web.mit.edu/nature/archive/student_projects/2009/bjorn627/TheGeothermalCity/History.html#:~:text=In%201904%2C%20Prince%20Piero%20Ginori,This%20plant%20is%20still%20operating." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than a century</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s an elegant concept, but it worked only where pockets of heat lay close to the surface, accompanied by steam ready-made to turn turbines. Those limitations confined geothermal power plants to geologically active areas like Iceland, parts of Indonesia, and a few locations in the American West. As of 2023, geothermal energy made up </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/geothermal/use-of-geothermal-energy.php" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">less than half of 1%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of U.S. electricity generation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, that is changing. </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/apr/02/geothermal-energy-electricity" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New technology</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> derived from oil and gas fracking methods is allowing energy companies to drill deep into the earth in places far from geologic activity. Wells can reach miles beneath the surface before branching out horizontally and creating fissures in hard, hot rock. Water injected into the wells comes back to the surface as steam to generate electricity. The steam is recaptured and re-injected to take up heat again, in a virtuous cycle powered by the earth itself. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The benefits</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These “enhanced geothermal” systems can produce 24/7 baseload electricity or fill in around variable sources like wind and solar. They can even be used like batteries to store energy, including for long durations.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike drilling for fossil fuels, geothermal companies avoid the shale formations that hold hydrocarbons, instead targeting non-porous rock. And since the product is not fossil fuel but steam, the technology produces zero-carbon energy without toxic or radioactive waste. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freed from geographic limitations and using the same technology and workforce as the oil and gas industry, geothermal energy is ready to take off fast. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) sees it spreading across the country to provide </span><a href="https://liftoff.energy.gov/next-generation-geothermal-power/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">as much as 125 gigawatts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (GW) of electricity by 2050. A global estimate suggests the industry could eventually produce </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306261920312551#:~:text=Potential%20of%20enhanced%20geothermal%20systems,256%20GWe%20in%202050." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4,600 GW</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of electricity at a cost of 50 euros (around $55) per megawatt-hour or less.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022 DOE launched an “</span><a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/geothermal/enhanced-geothermal-systems" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earthshot Initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” to reduce the cost of enhanced geothermal energy in the U.S. to $45 per megawatt-hour (MWh) by 2035. If successful, that would put it </span><a href="https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Lazard-LCOE-Levelized-Cost-of-Energy-renewable-energy-version-17.png" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">at or below</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the cost of any other new, dispatchable energy source. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is this technology the answer to the surging demand for electricity from data centers and artificial intelligence? And could it allow Virginia to keep adding data centers without blowing up its climate goals?</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The challenges</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do have to keep in mind that not all silver bullets prove to be sterling. Small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) are </span><a href="https://ieefa.org/resources/small-modular-reactors-still-too-expensive-too-slow-and-too-risky#:~:text=SMRs%20still%20are%20too%20expensive,coming%2010%20to%2015%20years." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">evidence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that some highly-anticipated technologies don’t follow the rosy timelines and price projections their boosters promise. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike SMRs, though, enhanced geothermal systems have already achieved commercial deployment. After </span><a href="https://eartharxiv.org/repository/view/5704/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">successfully demonstrating</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the technology with a 3.5 MW pilot facility,  </span><a href="https://fervoenergy.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fervo Energy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> signed a contract last year with </span><a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/google-fervo-geothermal-energy-partnership/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to provide electricity for its data centers from a 115-MW enhanced geothermal power plant in </span><a href="https://fervoenergy.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevada</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Fervo will deliver the power to the local utility, NV Energy, which will then charge a slightly higher price to Google via a </span><a href="https://ob.nv.gov/PUC/api/Document/AUVtXfg9PCPGv6AN5IUcwlkqU2FOoopJ88kv9f6OWMnjzuFpY1bQJgc%C3%89Pfmr%C3%89og%C3%81qn0Ejg4YBd7GEPUO%C3%89aDWxjE=/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> new </span><a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/google-fervo-nv-energy-nevada-puc-clean-energy-tariff/719472/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“clean transition tariff.”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Fervo has also signed a deal for an even bigger project that will deliver 400 MW to California utilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using a different fracking-based technology it calls a “Geopressured Geothermal System,” Houston-based </span><a href="https://www.sagegeosystems.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sage Geosystems</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently </span><a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/geothermal/sage-geosystems-and-meta-sign-150mw-geothermal-power-agreement" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">agreed to supply 150 MW</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of power for Meta’s data centers beginning in 2027. Sage says it can make electricity not just by extracting heat but also by using pressure, an add-on technology that allows it to offer energy storage independent of steam production. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Fervo and Sage say their methods can be used almost anywhere, and both cite advantages over established energy sources. Like wind and solar, geothermal is renewable and carbon-free, but it isn’t dependent on weather. It also doesn’t require fuel sources like coal and gas that are highly polluting and sometimes </span><a href="https://rmi.org/reality-check-keeping-the-lights-on-in-extreme-winter-weather/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unreliable in extreme weather</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, with a small physical footprint relative to the energy produced, geothermal facilities could be located in urban areas or next to data centers and other large customers without the need for major new transmission lines. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But of course, the fact that geothermal technology can be used </span><a href="https://www.nrel.gov/geothermal/anywhere.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">anywhere</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> does not mean it can be deployed profitably everywhere, or at least not yet. A </span><a href="https://www.nrel.gov/geothermal/resource-assessment-mapping.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">map</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> compiled by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory shows the most ideal areas are still in the West, where hot rocks lie within a few kilometers of the Earth’s surface. In most of the eastern U.S., deeper wells would be needed to reach the same temperatures. For this reason, DOE sees the technology proving out in the West first before spreading east.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Use in Virginia?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But favorability is not purely a function of geology, according to Ben Serrurier, manager of government affairs and policy at Fervo. I wanted to know how soon geothermal systems could start providing electricity to the world’s largest concentration of data centers, in Northern Virginia. He said the biggest impediment for the industry is not location, but the high cost of capital and the paucity of government support compared to SMRs, hydrogen, and other new technologies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In spite of these challenges, Serrurier predicted geothermal would be deployed in Virginia by the latter part of the 2030s, noting that his company is already ahead of DOE’s projected timeline for the technology’s maturation. Eastern data centers present an especially attractive market, he said, because demand is increasing so quickly, and utilities have limited options for carbon-free energy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alas, observers of the data center industry know that while renewable energy is nice to have, cheap energy is even nicer. So I wanted to talk about cost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Serrurier told me Fervo’s first project will deliver power to NV Energy at a price of $107 per MWh, and Google will pay slightly more than that to the utility. That is twice DOE’s target cost for 2035, yet it still puts the price below the U.S average of 13.1 cents per kilowatt-hour ($131 per MWh) for commercial customers, and competitive with the average Nevada commercial rate of 10.92 cents, </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.php?t=epmt_5_6_a" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Energy Information Agency data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That price is, however, more than the 9.54 cents/kWh that the average commercial customer in Virginia pays for electricity derived primarily from fossil fuels. And Fervo’s price is for drilling in the West, not in the less favorable geology of the East.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But heck, anywhere in the country, 10.7 cents for zero-carbon baseload power — with no waste to be cleaned up and no added healthcare costs from pollution — still sounds compelling. Google may have chosen to be a first mover in order to show leadership and promote a new technology, but it is also locking in a solid deal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sage does not make its costs public, but Lance Cook, the company’s chief technical officer, told me their process is competitive with combined cycle gas plants when the cost of fossil gas is above $6 per thousand cubic feet. (According to the Energy Information Agency, the price of gas is </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/ng_pri_sum_a_EPG0_PEU_DMcf_a.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">currently</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> below that level in most states, though gas prices are famously volatile.) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An additional benefit, said Cook, is that a geothermal plant could be co-located with a data center, foregoing a grid connection and obviating the need for transmission lines. “We can turn electricity into data,” he told me. “It is much easier to connect data than to wait for a grid connection.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Cook and Serrurier are confident that geothermal will beat new nuclear  price-wise, which today sounds like a safe bet. </span><a href="https://www.woodmac.com/press-releases/nuclear-needs-to-be-cost-competitive-with--alternative-power-generation-to-enable-net-zero/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts warn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that cost continues to be a significant issue for the nuclear industry. </span><a href="https://www.lazard.com/research-insights/levelized-cost-of-energyplus/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Current projections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the cost of electricity from SMRs start at $142/MWh. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cook noted that Sage’s technology can also provide long-duration energy storage that isn’t dependent on the heat of the earth. This approach can be used anywhere to turn solar and wind power into baseload energy. Sage’s website claims it can achieve this for less than the cost of batteries or pumped hydro. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With all this promise, enhanced geothermal has been slow to catch the attention of Virginia utilities and policy-makers. The Virginia Code includes geothermal energy in its definition of renewable energy, but enhanced geothermal is not on the list of energy sources that qualify for the state’s renewable portfolio standard (RPS). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The General Assembly did pass </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=Sb508" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this year from Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, to include a similarly-named, but quite different, kind of geothermal energy – geothermal heating and cooling systems, also known as ground-source heat pumps – in the RPS. </span><a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/geothermal-heat-pumps" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Geothermal heat pumps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> use the near-constant temperature of the ground just a few feet under our feet to help heat and cool buildings, much as air-source heat pumps do but with greater efficiency. A working group under the auspices of the State Corporation Commission is currently trying to figure out how to award renewable energy certificates (RECs) for a technology that does not produce electricity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But drilling down two miles or more and generating electricity at the utility level is quite another thing. Making enhanced geothermal systems eligible for the RPS would be essential to putting the technology on an even footing with other renewables for use in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an email, Surovell told me, “I have read about the Google geothermal project and believe there is significant potential in Virginia.I understand it is different, but we need to do all we can to try to meet the demand for energy created by data centers without upsetting the carbon-free goals we set with the Virginia Clean Energy Act.” He added, “Geothermal also has the potential to create thousands of well-paying trade jobs in drilling and pipefitting in the Commonwealth.”  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also contacted Dominion Energy Virginia to gauge the utility’s level of interest. Dominion is facing an enormous challenge to meet the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/28/virginia-explained-data-center-expansion-with-all-its-challenges-and-benefits/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">explosion of demand</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from data centers. Its </span><a href="https://cdn-dominionenergy-prd-001.azureedge.net/-/media/pdfs/global/company/2023-va-integrated-resource-plan.pdf?la=en&amp;rev=8e5047ba283b4b9bb5e17c41b3544564" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2023 integrated resource plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (IRP) proposed building new gas plants as early as 2028 and an SMR in 2034, but no geothermal energy. The plan </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/05/10/law-what-law-pandering-to-the-governor-dominions-new-plan-ignores-virginias-climate-law/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">failed to meet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the carbon-cutting requirements of Virginia law, so the company ought to see the need to up its game for its 2024 IRP, due in October. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion’s answer was not encouraging. Aaron Ruby, Dominion’s director of Virginia and offshore wind media, responded with an email that made reference to the working group for geothermal heat pump RECs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re certainly looking at the potential for geothermal in Virginia. The SCC is leading a geothermal working group, and there are lots of knowledgeable experts taking a close look. Most of the potential in Virginia appears to be geothermal heat pumps, with maybe less potential for power generation. The process is ongoing, so still more to learn.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Echoing Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/19/youngkin-speaks-about-energy-plan-ahead-of-update-in-coming-weeks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rhetoric </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">on energy, he added, “As you know, we’re experiencing an unprecedented growth in power demand. Reliably serving that growth requires an ‘all of the above’ approach, including offshore wind, solar, battery storage, next generation nuclear and natural gas. Emerging technologies like clean hydrogen, longer-duration storage and geothermal could also play a role.”</span><b> </b><b> </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not a great sign that Dominion ranks geothermal dead last. The company seems quite content to keep adding data centers to its customer base with no plan to meet its climate commitments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data center developers, on the other hand, could vote with their metaphorical feet. If Dominion will not bring geothermal technology to Virginia data centers, maybe the data centers will go to the geothermal technology. Why, after all, should they face public opposition and rising electricity rates in Virginia when they can go to Utah, Nevada or Texas to access low-cost, zero-carbon energy delivered 24/7 from a source that might even be located onsite? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Especially since, in so doing, they would provide the capital and demand required for enhanced geothermal to achieve DOE’s goals ahead of time, and hasten the day when Dominion presents an IRP with a real zero-carbon plan.  </span></p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Abortion</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the only state in the South that hasn’t restricted abortion access since the Supreme Court overturned Roe. v Wade in 2022, which made abortion a federal right, Virginia is a key player in the country’s reproductive health landscape. By dismantling Roe v Wade, the nation’s highest court laid the groundwork for each state to restrict or enhance access to abortion; a spate of state bans on abortion have since emerged, with 14 states making the procedure illegal. Abortion remains legal in Virginia and state Democrats will push to enshrine it as a right in the commonwealth’s constitution next year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Republican candidates in Virginia’s congressional races assert that abortion access should be determined at the state level. In District 2, Republican incumbent U.S. Rep. Jenn Kiggans, a Navy veteran, nurse and former member of the state senate, has “consistently advocated for women to choose life, but respects exceptions for rape, incest, and life of the mother,” according to her campaign </span><a href="https://jenforcongress.com/issues/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Democratic challenger Missy Cotter Smasal, who is also a Navy veteran as well as the director of a nonprofit focused on women veterans, </span><a href="https://fb.watch/uhpo6DTiSN/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declared herself</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “the only pro-choice Navy veteran in this race.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 7, anchored in Prince William County but also spanning rural parts of the state, Spotsylvania attorney and former Green Beret Derrick Anderson, a Republican, is challenging career military officer and Democrat Eugene Vindman for the seat currently occupied by Abigail Spanberger, who is running for governor next year. Anderson has expressed support for the overturn of Roe and </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/DerrickAndersonforVA/videos/my-life-story-is-pro-life-and-thats-how-i-will-serve-in-congress-my-mother-got-p/414067620643367/?locale=ms_MY" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">called himself “pro-life” while sharing on social media</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that his mother had him as a single parent at 17 years old. Vindman plans to support </span><a href="https://vindmanforcongress.com/issues/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">access to abortions and contraception along with in vitro fertilization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 10, anchored in Loudoun County, Democratic state Sen. Suhas Subramanyam is running against Republican Mike Clancy to fill Rep. Jennifer Wexton’s seat. Wexton will not seek reelection due to a health issue, and endorsed Subramanyam during his democratic primary. He has supported an effort to </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SJ255" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">enshrine abortion protections into Virginia’s constitution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and plans to support federal protections. Clancy said that he “does not support federal action on abortion.” His campaign website lists “respect life” as a campaign issue and notes his support for resources for pregnant people and families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 9, incumbent Rep. Morgan Griffith faces Democratic challenger Karen Baker, a lawyer-turned-nurse. Griffith has voted against congressional efforts to protect abortion access and </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=402684" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Roe v. Wade had “produced decades of tragedy.” Baker wrote on her campaign website that “women’s choices must be respected.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, who is seeking reelection, has co-sponsored the </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/kaine-others-reintroduce-reproductive-freedom-for-all-act/article_f6cbd514-a8a7-11ed-8ac8-e388ae499856.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reproductive Freedom For All Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would protect access federally, now that Roe has been overturned. His Republican challenger, retired Navy veteran Hung Cao, told Virginia Mercury this summer that he </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/17/they-dont-like-abortion-but-kaines-gop-challengers-say-they-wont-seek-a-federal-ban/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">won’t support a federal abortion ban</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He has also </span><a href="https://www.hungforva.com/right-to-life/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">called himself “pro-life.” </span></a></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Housing </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing is an issue people experience practically and constantly, amid paying rent or mortgages. Local governments handle approvals or rejections of developments and craft zoning laws that guide development potential. But state and federal lawmakers have roles to play as well — largely through funding mechanisms or taking action where housing intersects with other policy platforms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While many congressional candidates this year don’t have housing policy outlined on their websites, some have been talking about how they plan to help states and local governments from the federal level. The Mercury reached out to others for more details on what they would do to help with housing supply and affordability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 2, Incumbent Rep. Jen Kiggans did not respond to inquiry for more details on housing policy by the time of this publication, though during her time in the state legislature as a senator, she voted in favor of the </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+vot+SV0271HB1889+HB1889" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her challenger, Democrat Missy Cotter Smasal, acknowledged the Mercury’s request for comment but did not follow through with a response in time for this publication. Her website touches on housing policy while addressing the economy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We need to stop the price gouging on groceries, and stop massive corporations from buying up houses and raising rent,” she wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 7, Democratic candidate Eugene Vindman expressed support for building more homes that middle-class families can purchase and “support programs that help first-time homebuyers buy a house.” He added that he’s concerned about out-of-state corporations buying homes that they then sell or rent at higher prices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Congress, I will work to take on these speculators who are putting regular people&#8217;s American dream out of reach,” he said in an email. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican candidate Derrick Anderson said he’s going to focus initially on how Congress can help reduce inflation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The first thing I’d do is pass a federal balanced budget amendment – ridiculous inflationary spending drove up housing prices (and grocery costs, gas costs, etc),” he said in an email. “Let’s stop the spending and get inflation down for the sake of Virginians who are struggling to get by.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 10, Republican Mike Clancy could not be reached for comment by the time of this publication. His campaign website doesn’t include housing policy, but it does stress his goal of helping to reduce inflation and stimulate the economy by “unleashing American innovation” and energy as well as reducing regulations on small businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Suhas Subramanyam’s campaign replied to The Mercury’s inquiry but did not follow through with his housing policy plans should he become a congressman before publication. He has supported affordability measures as a state senator: This year he </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB597" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">co-sponsored a bill </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to allow more Virginian localities to utilize Low Income Housing Tax Credits when approving developments, but it was vetoed by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 9, Democratic challenger Karen Baker supports expansion of tax credits that can help spur construction of affordable housing available to various levels of area median income. She also wants to</span><a href="https://www.bakerforva9th.com/affordable-housing" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “work on tailored solutions that address the specific needs of rural communities,”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like the Southwest Virginia ones she seeks to represent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his tenure as representative, Morgan Griffith has </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=402287" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">supported funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> appropriations to his district meant to help with affordable housing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine has cited his early-career experience as a fair housing lawyer before he went into politics. As a member of congress, he pointed to a bill he co-sponsored, the </span><a href="https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/klobuchar-kaine-introduce-legislation-to-address-nationwide-housing-shortage" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing Supply and Affordability Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would create a grant program for state and local governments to tap into. He’s also been involved with the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/2797" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low-Income First-Time Homebuyers Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would establish fixed-rate 20 year mortgages for first-time buyers whose income doesn’t exceed a certain amount. Both bills have been introduced multiple times but have yet to become law. Kaine also supports expansions to Low Income Housing Tax Credits, which helps increase affordable housing supply. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine’s opponent, Hung Cao, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/how-kamala-harris-new-policy-plan-could-impact-housing-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">echoes a stance of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump that ties housing issues to the U.S.-Mexico border</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“First and foremost, we need to secure the border,” Cao said in an email to The Mercury. “Everything that’s going wrong in our country right now is a direct result of our wide-open southern border. Housing costs are at an all-time high because there&#8217;s millions who were not here a few years ago for which we need to provide housing.” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Guns</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congress remains at a standstill as lawmakers fiercely debate the future of gun rights in America, with proponents of stricter gun control measures clashing with staunch defenders of the Second Amendment. Amid a surge in mass shootings and growing public outcry, both sides are digging in, setting the stage for what will likely be another defining battle over gun laws as the nation is headed toward the 2024 presidential election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Senate, U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., who was governor of Virginia when the deadly mass shooting at Virginia Tech took place in 2007, co-sponsored the Virginia Plan to Reduce Gun Violence, which he said would enact the same gun safety provisions passed by the Democratic-controlled Virginia General Assembly in 2020 at the federal level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hung Cao, Kaine’s Republican opponent, strictly opposes further legislation that he believes would infringe Second Amendment rights. Instead, Cao proposes that gun-related violence to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Prosecutors who refuse to enforce the law must be held accountable, the retired U.S. Navy captain said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia’s 2nd Congressional District, U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, in 2023 received a 100% rating by Gun Owners of America (GOA), a national gun rights organization, and a 92% rating by the National Rifle Association (NRA) in the previous year. While in the Virginia legislature, Kiggans has voted against universal background checks, expanding red flag laws that take guns out of the hands of domestic abusers and those who pose a threat to Virginians, and against prohibiting guns in schools and childcare centers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Missy Cotter Smasal, Kiggans’ Democratic opponent, states on her campaign website that she is committed to legislation seeking to prevent gun violence, create safer communities, and prevent veteran suicide. Smasal said that there are “commonsense measures supported by large majorities of Virginians” that can make Virginia’s neighborhoods safer while also protecting individual rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 7, Derrick Anderson, the Republican nominee, has stated that Second Amendment rights are sacred and shall not be infringed upon. As a former special forces Green Beret, Anderson vows to be “a strong advocate for gun owners in the halls of Congress.” Earlier this year, the Republican turned to the social media platform X, where </span><a href="https://x.com/DerrickforVA/status/1774127722647687559" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">he said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Americans have to “stand up for and protect our 2nd Amendment rights.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eugene Vindman, a former career military officer and the Democratic nominee, supports gun safety measures such as background checks and red flag laws to keep guns out of the hands of criminals, the mentally ill, and others who might cause harm. While he believes in the right of law-abiding gun owners to own firearms, Vindman also pushes for more legislation ensuring public safety. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, the incumbent in District 9, is a strong advocate for Second Amendment rights. Griffith said in a statement to The Mercury that he does not support government-mandated registrations of guns but that he backs harsher penalties for offenders who “abuse the right to have guns” by committing felonious crimes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Karen Baker, Griffith’s opponent and a gun owner, said she backs rigorous gun safety training for children in school. She is also pushing for enhanced gun safety laws, including tax credits for trigger locks, and she has called for enhanced mental health services for troubled individuals, and a legal mechanism to manage early reports of suspicious behaviors involving non-imminent ideation of shootings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the state in District 10, constitutional lawyer Mike Clancy, the Republican nominee, has vowed to defend Americans’ constitutional rights without exception, including the Second Amendment right to bear arms. Instead of regulating gun ownership. Clancy is pushing for legislation to fully fund law enforcement to ensure law enforcement has the training and equipment to protect Virginia’s communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his time in Virginia’s state legislature, Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, Clancy’s opponent, has actively supported several gun safety laws, including </span><a href="https://www.suhasforvirginia.com/press-and-media/key-gun-violence-prevention-bills-from-senator-subramanyam-vetoed-by-gun-lobby-backed-governor" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">several measures which passed the General Assembly just this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, two of which were signed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican. Suhas told The Mercury he believes America can achieve serious progress on this issue while respecting the Second Amendment, and without undermining the rights of responsible gun owners.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Education/Project 2025</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With divergent calls from some to eliminate the U.S. Department of Education and from others to improve teacher pay, public education is a top matter for voters in Virginia and across the nation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a Pew Research Center </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2024/04/23/what-are-americans-top-foreign-policy-priorities/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published in April, half of the Americans surveyed said that public K-12 education is going in the wrong direction. Some believe that schools should spend more time on core academic subjects. At the same time, communities, including those in Virginia, are sparring over what is taught in schools, particularly history, and gauging if students are falling behind in their studies and how to address that challenge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schools are also facing confrontation from parents over social issues, such as the types of books that are allowed in schools and the treatment of transgender students. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of these education issues and recommendations to address them are outlined in </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/04/what-could-project-2025-mean-for-education-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Project 2025</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — a conservative plan for how the country should operate if a Republican wins the White House. Some support the plan and others fear it could derail previous efforts to improve public education in Virginia.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="AKFt5DoOMp"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/04/what-could-project-2025-mean-for-education-in-virginia/">What could Project 2025 mean for education in Virginia?</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the state’s District 2 congressional race, Republican nominee and incumbent Jen Kiggans has publicly supported</span><a href="https://jenforcongress.com/issues/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> prioritizing students&#8217; safety and security</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and equipping teachers with tools and resources to improve student outcomes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She voted for the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/5" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parents Bills of Rights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a measure to “ensure the rights of parents are honored in public schools” and stands against critical race theory, a graduate-level framework that focuses on racial inequity and has not been found in Virginia curricula.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like the authors of Project 2025 and Kiggans, the Republican nominee for the District 10 seat Mike Clancy said he supports school choice. </span></p>
<p>Democratic nominee Eugene Vindman, in District 7, said he opposes book bans and the project, which he <a class="c-link" href="https://dailyprogress.com/opinion/column/eugene-vindman-project-2025-is-a-threat-to-democracy/article_709f3f3a-6a2a-11ef-927e-b310eb440bd5.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://dailyprogress.com/opinion/column/eugene-vindman-project-2025-is-a-threat-to-democracy/article_709f3f3a-6a2a-11ef-927e-b310eb440bd5.html" data-sk="tooltip_parent">sa</a>id his opponent and Republican nominee Derrick Anderson has failed to denounce.</p>
<p>Anderson said Vindman is “lying” and denied supporting the project&#8217;s proposal to eliminate the U.S. Department of <span class="c-mrkdwn__highlight">Education</span>.</p>
<p>He said he supports helping students in his home district “succeed” and will advocate for ensuring that “test scores go up and conflicts go down.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 9, Karen Baker, the democratic nominee, said she supports strengthening public schools, much like Vindman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Baker’s </span><a href="https://www.bakerforva9th.com/issues" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">campaign website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, she supports making universal preschool “a reality for all families” in Southwest Virginia. She also supports investing in vocational education and making it accessible to the area. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, the Democratic nominee in District 10, said if elected, he will work to expand Pre-K, access to “critical“ job training into apprentice programs, and support providing resources to local schools to close the pandemic, learning loss gap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He told the Mercury that if the recommendations for Project 2025 were implemented, it would “devastate” Virginia’s public education system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We must do the opposite: invest in our schools, support our parents and teachers, and make college and postgraduate education affordable,” Subramanyam’s campaign said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Environment/Climate</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic candidates in Virginia’s congressional races largely have expressed the desire to address climate change by transitioning to zero-carbon generation sources. Some candidates differentiate themselves, like District 3 incumbent U.S. Rep. Bobby </span><a href="https://www.bobbyscottforcongress.com/the-scott-record" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who’s advocated for funding Norfolk’s flood wall to reduce sea level rise damage. District 6 contender Ken </span><a href="https://www.kenmitchellforvirginia.com/issues" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitchell</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> highlighted a need to “transition public investments away from propping up fossil fuel companies” on his campaign site, while District 11 incumbent U.S. Rep. Gerry </span><a href="https://gerryconnolly.com/issues/environment/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connolly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has said he’s an advocate for environmental justice, an environmental lens that amplifies the voices and needs of overlooked and overburdened communities during development that could impact their area. District 9 candidate Karen </span><a href="https://www.bakerforva9th.com/coal-miners" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baker </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">doesn’t address climate change on her website, but highlights a need to protect coal miners’ health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the aisle, Republican congressional candidates also mostly fall in line with each other’s environmental policy views by advocating for  </span><a href="https://www.mikeclancyforcongress.com/services-5" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reducing regulations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.hungforva.com/enviornment/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">energy independence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or promoting energy sources stemming from </span><a href="https://cline.house.gov/issues/energy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fossil fuels</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://sitkaforcongress.com/on-the-issues" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nuclear</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some candidates don’t take clear positions about their environmental policy plans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking unique approaches on the GOP side are District 2 incumbent U.S. Rep Jen Kiggans, who signed onto a letter with other House Republicans earlier this year asking for House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana to </span><a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/some-house-republicans-warn-against-climate-law-repeal/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">not repeal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tax credits of the IRA, which have helped incentivize a burgeoning offshore wind </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2024/07/09/south-korean-company-plans-to-build-681-million-offshore-wind-submarine-cable-plant-in-chesapeake/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">development</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> industry in the Hampton Roads region.

Some environmental groups say the bill includes some concessions for continued natural gas use. Whichever party gains majority control of Congress could determine the fate of that bill.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Election integrity</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concerns over election integrity and the potential for voter fraud have sparked a renewed focus in Congress, as lawmakers from both parties debate how best to safeguard the democratic process. With allegations of fraudulent voting making headlines in recent election cycles, the issue has become a political flashpoint. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some legislators call for stricter voting regulations to prevent potential abuse, others argue that such measures could suppress voter participation. As the 2024 election approaches, members of Congress are crafting new policies aimed at ensuring fair elections while addressing public concerns over security and accessibility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the U.S. Senate, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., has carried legislation such as the Freedom to Vote Act, which would implement provisions like automatic voter registration, same-day and Election Day voter registration, online voter registration, and no-excuse mail voting. Kaine has also co-sponsored the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which seeks to restore and update crucial protections against voting discrimination that were weakened by recent Supreme Court decisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine’s Republican opponent Hung Cao, a retired U.S. Navy captain who is backed by former President Donald Trump, has proposed few legislative means to secure the electoral process beyond a universal requirement for providing a voter ID in order to cast a ballot. But he said in a statement to The Mercury that “the only way to have election integrity is to have people watch the polls.” Cao has also suggested that the U.S. hold elections like the ones he witnessed in Iraq and Afghanistan, where people vote with their finger and blue ink. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In July, U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, who represents House District 2, voted in support of the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr8281/BILLS-118hr8281rh.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which passed in the House of Representatives by a 221-198 vote. Advocates of the SAVE Act say it would ensure that only citizens can vote in federal elections, partly by making it mandatory for states to obtain proof of citizenship to register voters and also requiring states to purge noncitizens from voter rolls. But President Joe Biden has vowed to veto the measure, stating that it would make it more difficult for eligible voters to register and increase “the risk that eligible voters are purged from voter rolls.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiggans’ Democratic challenger Missy Cotter Smasal, who previously mounted an unsuccessful campaign in Virginia’s 8th Senate District, has talked little about election integrity legislation. But the U.S. Navy veteran has attacked her Republican opponent for being  a “big supporter of President Trump” for backing “Big Lie” conspiracy theorists in Virginia’s state legislature by being one of </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/02/24/virginia-youngkin-tax-cuts-house-senate/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">only four Senators to vote for an audit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the 2020 election that would have cost Virginia taxpayers $70 million.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Derrick Anderson, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">former special forces Green Beret and the Republican nominee in District 7, has talked little publically about election integrity and he offers no clues about his views on his campaign website, but in </span><a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/government-politics/elections/derrick-anderson-talks-biden-the-border-and-inflation-ahead-of-tuesdays-gop-primary/article_a009bd2a-2837-11ef-9cbd-0f478e969dbd.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with The Daily Progress he acknowledged that Joe Biden is the legitimate president.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If elected, Anderson’s Democratic opponent Eugene Vindman, the twin brother of anti-Trump whistleblower Alexander Vindman, has vowed to work to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and strengthen protections for election workers, “so that anyone who threatens a poll volunteer or election official in an attempt to undermine our vote is held accountable.” Vindman, whose family emigrated to the United States from the former Soviet Union, has also warned against downplaying the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, which he blamed on a pro-Trump movement that did not recognize the nation’s norms of peaceful transfer of power and that he said undermines elections across the country to this day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, the incumbent in District 9, in 2023 sponsored the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/4460" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No Vote for Non-Citizens Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, seeking to ensure only eligible American citizens may participate in federal elections. The bill, which is still moving through the House, withholds some federal dollars that go to localities that allow non-citizens to vote in their elections. Griffith also voted for the SAVE Act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Karen Baker, Griffith’s opponent, told The Mercury that Republicans have failed to provide any evidence of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election and therefore there is no reason to believe that this year’s election will be different. Baker also stated that fears of undocumented immigrants voting are generated to induce distrust of election integrity but are absolutely without basis, and she has criticized Griffith for refusing to state that he will accept the outcome of the 2024 presidential election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Mike Clancy, an attorney from Loudoun County and the Republican nominee in District 10, does not list election integrity as one of his legislative priorities on his campaign website, he has been outspoken on social media about strengthening election laws. “Congress must pass the SAVE Act,” Clancy </span><a href="https://x.com/MikeClancyVA/status/1811031488923586986" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said on X</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in July. “Only U.S. citizens should be voting in our elections.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, Clancy’s opponent and a strict opponent of the SAVE Act, believes that “democracy is under attack” in America. The son of Indian immigrants, Subramanyam has vowed to continue to fight against “restrictive voter ID laws that are designed to suppress the vote, protect early voting to ensure greater access to the polls, and combat political gerrymandering.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Immigration</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Americans find that more migrants are turning to the United States for employment opportunities or to escape violent conflict in their home countries, among other reasons, they are increasingly interested in candidates&#8217; views on immigration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">America has become one of the most prominent destinations for migrants. However, over several years, many migrants have entered the country illegally, prompting backlash. At the same time, migrants have also been a staple of America’s workforce, including in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the </span><a href="https://map.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/locations/virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Immigration Council</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, immigrants comprised about 12.6% of Virginia’s total population in 2022, and 16.2% of Virginia&#8217;s labor force.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Hr7omrdD9o"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/08/convention-delegates-virginia-voters-reflect-on-immigration-policy-ahead-of-presidential-election/">Convention delegates, Virginia voters reflect on immigration policy ahead of presidential election</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the District 9 race, Republican nominee and incumbent Morgan Griffith said immigrants are welcome to come to the United States “legally” and share in the “American dream,&#8221; but supports “cracking down” on illegal immigration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While criticizing the House for ducking its responsibility, Democratic nominee Karen Baker in District 9 said Congress needs to pass comprehensive immigration reform. She said she supports the Senate&#8217;s template for more border control agents and asylum officers and advocates for a DACA bill to protect children who have lived in the U.S. their entire lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the District 2 race, Jen Kiggans’ campaign said the Republican nominee and incumbent voted for legislation to increase security at the U.S. border by ensuring that federal immigration officials have the training and resources to stop the influx of illegal immigration, drugs and crime into the U.S. The measure has remained in the Senate since last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiggans supports strict enforcement of existing federal immigration laws and holding President Joe Biden’s administration accountable. She also backed legislation to prevent the administration from using National Parks to house illegal immigrants.</span></p>
<p>Derrick Anderson, the Republican nominee for the District 7 seat, said he <a class="c-link" href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/government-politics/elections/derrick-anderson-talks-biden-the-border-and-inflation-ahead-of-tuesdays-gop-primary/article_a009bd2a-2837-11ef-9cbd-0f478e969dbd.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/government-politics/elections/derrick-anderson-talks-biden-the-border-and-inflation-ahead-of-tuesdays-gop-primary/article_a009bd2a-2837-11ef-9cbd-0f478e969dbd.html" data-sk="tooltip_parent">supports</a> shutting down the border.</p>
<p>“It’s clear that the crisis at the border is hurting people right here in Virginia’s 7th District,” Anderson said in a statement. “Drugs, fentanyl, human trafficking – we need a serious change. We need to secure the border.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, the Democratic nominee in District 10, said with the U.S. immigration system being “broken,” he supports the country taking a comprehensive approach to the problem by starting with securing the border and ensuring that people who are doing “the right things the right way and contributing to our economy“ have a path to citizenship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said the country must also fix its “broken” asylum system.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Foreign policy (Israel-Hamas conflict, China, Ukraine)</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Virginia voters are following their congressional candidates&#8217; views on common issues in the U.S., they are also considering their responses to global conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a Pew Research Center </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2024/04/23/what-are-americans-top-foreign-policy-priorities/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that was completed in April, two of the most important issues to Americans are limiting the powers of China and finding a solution to the Israel-Hamas conflict.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Americans are also interested in limiting Russia’s powers following its invasion of Ukraine in Feb. 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said he takes pride in the fact that he is among a wide slate of lawmakers President Vladimir Putin of Russia permanently banned from visiting Russia in response to his record of standing against Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine two years ago. Kaine has voted for aid to Ukraine, and earlier this year he helped pass a supplemental package that included support for the country to defend its sovereignty. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine also said he views the U.S.-China relationship as the most consequential bilateral relationship of the century. Kaine voted to pass the </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/09/fact-sheet-chips-and-science-act-will-lower-costs-create-jobs-strengthen-supply-chains-and-counter-china/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CHIPS and Science Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> designed to outcompete China by shoring up domestic supply chains and bringing manufacturing back to America. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Hamas terrorists attacked Israeli territories on Oct. 7, 2023, Kaine has worked with Democrats, Republicans, and the Biden administration to ensure that Israel has defensive support. But Kaine has also called for a reduction of civilian casualties, supported the safe and swift delivery of humanitarian assistance to civilians in Gaza and the West Bank, and for long-term solutions to allow Palestinians and Israelis to live alongside each other in peace.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine’s Republican opponent and former U.S. Navy captain Hung Cao in a statement criticized the Biden administration and Congress for giving “blanket amounts of money” towards Ukraine’s defense effort, alleging the financial support instead helps fund Ukraine’s retired workers pension plans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cao considers China an “existential threat” to the United States, and he has further called for the continued support of Israel, which he considers one of the United States’ closest allies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Jen Kiggans’ campaign, the District 2 Republican nominee and incumbent supports legislation to impose sanctions against China for its responsibility in the fentanyl crisis and </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/22/cosponsors" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prevent selling any petroleum to Chinese Communist Party-controlled entities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her campaign also said she prioritizes protecting American jobs and intellectual property from being stolen by the CCP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Derrick Anderson, the Republican nominee in District 7 and a former special forces Green Beret with six tours of duty overseas, including Afghanistan, Iraq, and various countries throughout the Middle East, told the </span><a href="https://jewishinsider.com/2024/04/virginia-congressional-candidate-derrick-anderson-military/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Jewish Insider”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in an interview in April that Congress needs to move quickly to provide additional aid to the Jewish state in its war against Hamas. He added that he was skeptical of sending more U.S. funds to the Palestinians, noting that other countries are providing aid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Anderson, his Democratic opponent Eugene Vindman, also a veteran, called for continued support for Israel, while asking that the U.S. continue to ensure that all the hostages — including Americans — are returned safe and sound to their families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman has also pushed for the continued support of Ukraine in both military and economic terms, and for taking on China&#8217;s state-directed economic system, which he said unfairly competes in the market and compromises America’s national security. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, voted for the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2022, which allowed the lending and lease of American defense material to the country in its defense of the Russian invasion, he also also voted to block similar legislation last year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griffith </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=403045" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has called</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> China a “dangerous, power-hungry actor” over the country’s territorial claims in the South China Sea, as well as its escalating efforts to control Taiwan, while </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=403086" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criticizing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> President Joe Biden’s decision to hold an arms shipment to Israel last spring. Griffith also said that America’s dealings with other countries must be driven by a careful analysis of what best serves the United States and its citizens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In relation to the conflict between Israel and Hamas, Karen Baker, Griffith’s Democratic opponent, has pointed out that while she acknowledged Israel’s right to exist, there are “bad acts on both sides.” Baker has also endorsed the continued financial and military support of Ukraine by the United States, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, the Democratic nominee in District 10, said he supports the U.S. in opposing Russia leader Vladimir Putin&#8217;s territorial ambitions in Europe and standing up to China, which is “violating international law and illegally dumping goods to prop up their economy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also supports the CHIPS Act, which helped to boost domestic research and manufacturing of semiconductor chips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the Israel-Hamas war, Subramanyam said he supports the U.S. returning hostages, especially  American citizens, and helping to rebuild communities affected by the war.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also supports a two-state solution, adding that Hamas cannot be one of the states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The human lives lost in this conflict have been devastating for all sides,” Subramanyam said in a statement. “I have visited the region, including the areas of Israel that were attacked, and made good friends there. I want to see an end to the war and a long-term path to peace.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Aug. 16, the Distributed Solar Alliance filed its latest </span><a href="https://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/80xf01!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">petition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> seeking injunctive relief with the State Corporation Commission, which regulates Virginia’s utilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result of newer requirements under the highly technical rules, some projects could be facing up to 3.5 years of delay before coming online, with project costs possibly ballooning by $450,000 or more, as opportunities to apply for federal tax credits go away, the DSA argued in its petition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s having a profound negative impact for Virginia, not only in terms of job losses, lost investments to the state, and the health impacts of not pursuing the aspirations of the Virginia Clean Economy Act,” said Tony Smith, chair of the Distributed Solar Alliance and founder of Secure Solar Futures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Dominion, in its </span><a href="https://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/815m01!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">response</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the latest petition, said the rules have already been “litigated and fully addressed” when the SCC granted temporary authority to impose them in November, and remain in compliance with state regulations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The utility reiterated that the SCC has regulatory authority over Dominion, but it’s the company’s ultimate responsibility to ensure “safe and reliable operation of its system.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Commission should be highly skeptical of a request for injunctive relief which would second-guess and overrule the Company’s judgment in doing so,” wrote Joseph Reid, a McGuire Woods attorney representing the utility.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Repeated requests</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The solar developers had previously </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/01/utility-regulators-suspend-dominions-rules-for-connecting-solar-projects-to-grid/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">won</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a case last August that forced Dominion to stop enforcing the rules for projects able to produce up to 3 megawatts of electricity.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="1XVKMU9971"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/01/utility-regulators-suspend-dominions-rules-for-connecting-solar-projects-to-grid/">Utility regulators suspend Dominion&#8217;s rules for connecting solar projects to grid</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Utility regulators suspend Dominion&#8217;s rules for connecting solar projects to grid&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/01/utility-regulators-suspend-dominions-rules-for-connecting-solar-projects-to-grid/embed/#?secret=tzNqhvLn5C#?secret=1XVKMU9971" data-secret="1XVKMU9971" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/21/solar-developers-continue-to-fight-dominions-solar-interconnection-rules/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">November</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the SCC granted Dominion the authority to temporarily reinstate the rules for a narrower set of projects, those that range from 250 kw to 1 mw, as a stakeholder group worked to make final decisions on what the interconnection rules should be. That work is ongoing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The solar developers also introduced a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/21/bill-to-shift-grid-upgrade-costs-for-small-virginia-solar-projects-fails/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this past legislative session to shift some of the cost of the rules’ requirements onto the utility. But Dominion pointed out that would’ve passed the costs onto customers who weren’t necessarily benefiting from the projects, since the utility is allowed to recover expenses from ratepayers. The bill failed.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The newer rules</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The initial rules called for a dedicated transmission line, known as a dark trip transfer (DTT) cable, which connects the solar project to the grid so that the connection for that source can be turned off in the event of a failure and the broader system isn’t overloaded when excess power is returned to the utility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rules also required a relay panel to efficiently shut off the power in those events, which the solar companies say are more costly than traditional, more affordable inverters that they say are sufficient.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The narrowed, temporary rules allowed for a less costly cellular fiber cable to be used as the DTT line, but now require that Verizon or AT&amp;T sign on to using the cable, the solar developers state in their petition. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The temporary rules also have begun to ask for shunt trip breakers and a recloser,  technological upgrades for grid protection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With those new requirements, the solar companies contend the utility is imposing a pilot program outside of the authority granted through the temporary rules, for projects that are less than half the 2.08 megawatt average size of ones Dominion interconnected prior to the creation of the December 2022 rules.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some projects have not been granted  permission to operate within the 30 to 60-day deadlines required by regulation. One developer, Madison Energy, has had  32 projects experience an average of 246 days and counting of delays since their application was submitted, the DSA stated. The utility also hasn’t been issuing waivers explaining why the deadline’s been missed, according to the petition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cliona Robb, a DSA attorney, wrote that Dominion has been “imposing greater equipment </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">requirements and costs than approved by the ruling.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That imposition has been reframed, “as a pilot project to continuously change the ground rules for interconnection at Dominion’s sole discretion, all without Commission authority,” Robb wrote.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Dominion response</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion argued the temporary rules “fit squarely within applicable law and regulations and are necessary for the Company to fulfill its duty to provide safe and reliable electric service to the public.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The majority of projects prior to the creation of the December 2022 rules were smaller than 250 kilowatts, the utility stated, and projects that could produce between 500 kw and 1 megawatt did require some upgrades then, including the shunt trip breaker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the changes stemming from the Virginia Clean Economy Act — a 2020 law that seeks to decarbonize the grid by mid-century, which expanded the size of projects eligible to sell electricity back to the grid — have led to an increase in the number of projects requesting interconnection that “necessitated a change to the review process,” the utility stated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the increased need for the technological upgrades, Dominion said, the delays come from working with third-party vendors to attain actual cost estimates for protective enclosures, sometimes two for certain substation upgrades, beyond what was tested in its Dominion Energy Relay Laboratory. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Verizon or AT&amp;T need to use the DTT  to keep the cable active in the event electricity is cut off from it, Dominion stated, and some project applications also are missing information necessary before they can be considered complete.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Company acknowledges that the process of addressing and resolving these technical issues and cost concerns have taken time and resulted in some delays,” Reid wrote in Dominion’s response, but the delays aren’t reason enough to grant the group’s requests because doing so “would compromise the Company’s grid and the safety of its customers and employees.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Broader delay?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest injunction request comes as the stakeholder group working on final rules for the SCC prepares to </span><a href="https://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/80_c01!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">receive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> evidentiary information from Dominion by Nov. 15. That will be followed by a full hearing on the evidence and insight from experts to testify on the effectiveness of the requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The workgroup has already proposed a change to the current “</span><a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/07052024/virginia-connecting-renewable-energy-to-grid/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">last man in</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” concept that forces the last project to interconnect to a smaller circuit of the grid to pay for the technology because that project  could potentially overload the system. Instead, a clustered approach, to review multiple projects together, is being considered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But an order on the evidentiary hearing may not come until August of 2025, the DSA contended, depending on how the process proceeds after Dominion submits its evidence later this year. Because projects typically take a year to develop, some proposals may not come online until August 2026, the group said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in that timespan, another case on new rules for </span><a href="https://www.scc.virginia.gov/DocketSearch#caseDocs/145038" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">net-metering</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is set to take place, which could further change the rules for projects, Smith said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In this line of work, things change very dynamically because of supply chain and other issues,” Smith said. The delays mean that a project that makes sense economically this year may not add up next year, Smith added.  “It&#8217;s causing menacing chaos.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares signed onto a letter</span><a href="https://consumersresearch.org/documents/analysis-are-asset-managers-blindly-following-iss-on-esg/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> citing research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Consumers’ Research, a nonprofit organization, that highlighted large asset managers voting for recommendations by Institutional Shareholder Services on climate-related shareholder proposals. ISS is a proxy advisory firm that investment companies can use for recommendations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The attorneys general asked the companies if they consult or rely on recommendations of proxy firms, such as ISS or other third parties, when voting on shareholder proposals relating to environmental issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are concerned that the [the companies] may have outsourced their voting in this area to ISS or another third party and are failing to carry out their fiduciary duties,” the joint letter to 25 of the nation’s top asset managers read.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares’ inquiry comes after he joined </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/23/va-attorney-general-miyares-challenging-heavy-truck-emissions-rule-and-other-federal-proposals/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">challenges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to other emission reduction policies and joined an </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/virginia-joins-multistate-investigation-into-major-banks-net-zero-commitments/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">investigation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into other banks’ net-zero goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Consumers’ Research is critical of ESG investing and has a “</span><a href="https://consumersresearch.org/wokealert/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">woke alert</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” feature on its website. </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/esg-investing/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ESG is an umbrella term </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">used to describe companies’ consideration of environmental, social and governance factors like climate change and diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in their business dealings. The ESG investing lens has prompted</span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/business-fights-back-republican-state-lawmakers-push-anti-esg-agenda-2023-04-22/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pushback</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB2335" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lawmakers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and attorneys general in several states in recent years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The letter, sent last week and seeking answers from the asset managers by next month, is led by Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen. Miyares is joined by his counterparts in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, and Wyoming. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sound economics should take priority over social fads,” Miyares said in a press release announcing he’d joined the letter. “Asset managers have a fiduciary responsibility to be proper custodians for their investors, not to have those resources pocketed by those driven by irresponsible social and political agendas.”</span></p>

Two seats on the air board, one of which was Cupit’s, have also been filled by former federal government workers associated with the Republican party, with appointments by Gov. Glenn Youngkin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cupit, CEO of SERCAP, a group advocating on behalf of low-income communities in Southwest Virginia, ended her term on the Air Pollution Control Board on June 30, before she and Tyree were appointed to the EJ council by Youngkin on Aug. 16. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aimed at raising awareness of minority, low-income, tribal and other communities often overlooked during development of energy projects, the EJ council was created by executive order under the administration of former Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe, and codified by the legislature during the era of Democratic trifecta control of state government, amid the Northam administration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attempts to reach Cupit and EJ council chair Karen Camplin for comment were unsuccessful, but Tyree said her relevant experience for her role includes her being a county supervisor, and “t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he mere fact of standing on the principle of ‘treating people the way I would like to be treated.’” She also views her role as “being a voice for those that are not able to speak for themselves.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m committed to addressing the systemic inequities that disproportionately affect marginalized communities and am eager to bring that focus to the Council,” Tyree said, adding that she plans to foster, “transparency and inclusivity throughout our processes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the two seats on the air </span><a href="https://www.deq.virginia.gov/laws-regulations/citizen-boards/air-pollution-control-board" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">board</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that opened up with the expiration of Cupit and Lornel Tompkins’ terms was filled by Emily Domenech, a senior vice president at the policy consultancy Boundary Stone Partners. The other seat was filled by Daniel Jorjani, chief operating officer and principal deputy general counsel for Citizens United, a conservative advocacy group. Citizens United in 2010 won a landmark  court case against the Federal Election Commission that ”tilted political influence toward wealthy donors and corporations,” according to the </span><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/citizens-united-explained" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brennan Center for Justice.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The air board is charged with overseeing air quality protection regulations, while </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/02/07/republican-bills-aim-to-limit-power-of-citizen-environmental-boards/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">permit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> approvals lie with the Department of Environmental Quality.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">James Patrick Guy II, chairman of the air board, said in an interview he didn’t know the two new appointees personally but said that they have “relevant experience” and are “imminently qualified,” after working in the energy and environment sphere for “quite a while.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for their commitment to environmental justice while serving on the air board, Guy said, generally, “there’s probably room to bring environmental justice into consideration in any matter,” adding that developers and utilities “have learned they’re going to have to do that.” Still, Guy noted that the board is only tasked with  approving </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/bill-stripping-citizen-air-and-water-boards-of-permitting-power-headed-to-governor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">regulations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which sometimes come with stipulations from the  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that are beyond their control.</span></p>

On Aug. 28,, Youngkin press secretary Christian Martinez said the latest appointments to both the EJ Council and the air board, “reflect a variety of communities and stakeholders across Virginia who are dedicated to furthering our shared commitment to protect our natural resources and vulnerable communities throughout the Commonwealth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bill this past session would’ve forced Youngkin to make appointments to the EJ Council, had he not </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/14/gov-youngkin-vetoes-bill-mandating-state-environmental-justice-council-vacancies-be-filled/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it the day prior to making his previous additions. After enough members were added to attain a quorum to vote on items, the council approved its 2023 report earlier this year, which provided an update on environmental justice initiatives for the state to take up as mostly incomplete.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secretary of Natural and Historic Resources Travis Voyles recently presented to the board in person on the state&#8217;s efforts to fund flood resiliency projects, which members of the Hobson Village in the Hampton Roads area have consistently called for at EJ council meetings. A representative for VDOT also discussed public engagement opportunities for roadway projects.</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A third-party report commissioned by Mountain Valley Pipeline developers has found the cause of a test failure in May was due to a manufacturer defect and not corrosion issues, a concern environmental advocates have continuously raised about the project that took about a decade to complete before coming online earlier this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://elibrary.ferc.gov/eLibrary/filelist?accession_num=20240829-5151" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, from DNV GL USA, found that a manufacturing “buttwelding” for the .7-inch thick elbow fitting installed in June 2018 blew before the hydrostatic </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/08/mountain-valley-pipeline-segment-ruptures-during-test/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">testing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reached desired pressure, weeks before the project went into service. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“From a manufacturing perspective, the failed fitting had a &#8216;sister&#8217; fitting in the same test section that was proactively removed from the pipeline and used to provide material for a portion of the mechanical testing aspect of the failure analysis,” wrote Justin Trettlel, in an letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission accompanying the report. “There were only two fittings with matching pedigree, neither of which remains in the pipeline.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 303-mile Mountain Valley Pipeline went </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/14/mountain-valley-pipeline-goes-into-service-starts-delivering-gas-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in June with the capacity to deliver up to 2 billion cubic feet of natural gas from the Marcellus and Utica Shales of West Virginia into Pittsylvania County in Southwest Virginia. First announced in 2014, the project faced mounting legal troubles over environmental issues until West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin included in a federal spending plan a provision to greenlight the project to completion and end any legal disputes until it is built.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental groups said those delays caused possible corrosion issues with the pipe, as a result of laying out of the ground and exposed to the elements for years. But, the analysis from DNV that involved visually inspecting the pipe and  metallurgical tests found that the failure was “a result of ductile overload,” meaning the pipe’s strength was exceeded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There was no evidence of external or internal corrosion,” the report states underneath a picture of the ruptured pipe. “The external coating was adhered except for some portions adjacent to the fracture surfaces that disbanded due to the rupture.”</span></p>

(Courtesy of DNV GL USA report)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time of the test failure, a Mountain Valley Pipeline spokeswoman said that “disruption of this one hydrotest does, in fact, demonstrate that the testing process is working as designed and intended.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Russell Chisholm, co-director of the Protect Our Water, Heritage, Rights Coalition (POWHR), a group staunchly opposed to the project, said in a statement the report comes after “four months of waiting.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a pathetically predictable outcome; we know the MVP has used shoddy materials for their rushed construction job on this massive methane pipeline project,” Chisholm said. “This is yet more evidence of the threat MVP poses to everyone along the route, and why the government never should have greenlit this corrupt project.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pipeline had received a consent </span><a href="https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/sites/phmsa.dot.gov/files/2023-10/PHMSA%20Consent%20Agreement%20and%20Order%20-%20Equitrans%20Midstream.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">agreement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Material Administration over safety concerns prior to starting service, but the agency said it had “no objections” if FERC approved the project starting.

<p>We’re <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6jEKlrQAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">ocean</a> and <a href="https://handlos.eas.gatech.edu/research/" target="_blank">atmospheric scientists</a> who study this type of climate phenomenon. It’s rare to see both Niñas at the same time, yet in August 2024, <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/event-tracker/atlantic-nina-verge-developing-heres-why-we-should-pay-attention" target="_blank">both appeared to be developing</a>. Let’s take a closer look at what that means.</p>
<h2>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">La Niña and its cousin, Atlantic Niña</h4>

	</h2>
<p>La Niña is part of the <a href="https://www.climate.gov/enso" target="_blank">El Niño–Southern Oscillation</a>, a well-known climate phenomenon that has widespread effects on climate and weather around the world.</p>
<p>During La Niña, sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific dip below normal. Easterly trade winds then strengthen, allowing more cool water to well up along the equator off South America. That cooling <a href="https://theconversation.com/la-nina-is-coming-raising-the-chances-of-a-dangerous-atlantic-hurricane-season-an-atmospheric-scientist-explains-this-climate-phenomenon-228595" target="_blank">affects the atmosphere in ways that reverberate</a> across the planet. Some areas become stormier and others drier during La Niña, and the wind shear that can tear apart Atlantic hurricanes tends to weaken.</p>
<p>La Niña and its warmer opposite, <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/ninonina.html" target="_blank">El Niño</a>, oscillate <a href="https://www.pmel.noaa.gov/elnino/lanina-faq" target="_blank">every three to four years or so</a>.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="El Niño and La Niña Explained" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wVlfyhs64IY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>A similar climate phenomenon, <a href="https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/atlantic-nina-on-the-verge-of-developing-heres-why-we-should-pay-attention/" target="_blank">Atlantic Niña</a>, occurs in the Atlantic Ocean but at a much smaller scale and amplitude. It typically peaks around July or August and tends to have a shorter duration than its Pacific cousin, and much more modest and local impacts. Atlantic Niñas generally have the <a href="https://cpaess.ucar.edu/sites/default/files/meetings/2020/presentations/kim-presentation.pdf" target="_blank">opposite effect</a> of <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/event-tracker/atlantic-nina-verge-developing-heres-why-we-should-pay-attention" target="_blank">Atlantic Niños, which tend to</a> reduce <a href="https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/the-atlantic-nino-el-ninos-little-brother/" target="_blank">rainfall over Africa’s Sahel</a> region and increase rainfall in Brazil and the countries that surround the Gulf of Guinea, such as Ghana, Nigeria and Cameroon.</p>
<p>While much weaker than their Pacific counterpart, Atlantic Niñas can, however, partially counteract La Niñas by weakening summer winds that help drive the upwelling that cools the eastern Pacific.</p>
<h2>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Why are both happening now?</h4>

	</h2>
<p>In July and August 2024, meteorologists <a href="https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/atlantic-nina-on-the-verge-of-developing-heres-why-we-should-pay-attention/" target="_blank">noted cooling</a> that appeared to be the development of an Atlantic Niña along the equator. The winds at the ocean surface had been weak through most of the summer, and sea surface temperatures there were <a href="https://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/product/5km/index_5km_ssta.php" target="_blank">quite warm until early June</a>, so signs of an Atlantic Niña emerging were a surprise.</p>

<p>Getting a Pacific-Atlantic Niña combination is <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/event-tracker/atlantic-nina-verge-developing-heres-why-we-should-pay-attention" target="_blank">rare but not impossible</a>. It’s like finding two different pendulums that are weakly coupled to swing in opposite directions moving together in time. The combinations of La Niña and Atlantic Niño, or El Niño and Atlantic Niña are more common.</p>
<h2>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Good news or bad for hurricane season?</h4>

	</h2>
<p>An Atlantic Niña may initially suggest good news for those living in hurricane-prone areas.</p>
<p>Cooler than average waters off the coast of Africa can suppress the formation of African easterly waves. These are <a href="https://glossarytest.ametsoc.net/wiki/African_Easterly_Wave" target="_blank">clusters of thunderstorm activity</a> that can form into tropical disturbances and eventually tropical storms or hurricanes.</p>
<p>Tropical storms <a href="https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/facts/hurricanes.html" target="_blank">draw energy from the process of evaporating water</a> associated with warm sea surface temperatures. So, cooling in the tropical Atlantic could weaken this process. That would leave less energy for the thunderstorms, which would reduce the probability of a tropical cyclone forming.</p>
<p>However, NOAA takes all factors into account when <a href="https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/outlooks/hurricane.shtml" target="_blank">it updates its Atlantic hurricane season outlook</a>, released in early August, and it still anticipates an extremely active 2024 season. <a href="https://climatecenter.fsu.edu/topics/hurricanes" target="_blank">Tropical storm season typically peaks</a> in early to mid-September.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" id="lcaEc" class="tc-infographic-datawrapper" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/lcaEc/2/" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>Two reasons are behind the busy forecast: The <a href="https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/outlooks/Slide4.JPG" target="_blank">near record-breaking warm</a> sea surface temperatures in much of the North Atlantic can strengthen hurricanes. And the expected development of a La Niña in the Pacific tends to weaken <a href="https://theconversation.com/what-is-wind-shear-an-atmospheric-scientist-explains-how-it-can-disrupt-air-travel-and-tear-apart-hurricanes-213527" target="_blank">wind shear</a> – the change in wind speed with height that can tear apart hurricanes. La Niña’s much stronger effects can override any impacts associated with the Atlantic Niña.</p>
<h2>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Exacerbating the problem: Global warming</h4>

	</h2>
<p>The past two years have seen <a href="https://climatereanalyzer.org/clim/sst_daily/" target="_blank">exceptionally high ocean temperatures</a> in the Atlantic and around much of the world’s oceans. The two Niñas are likely to contribute some cooling relief for certain regions, but it may not last long.</p>
<p>In addition to these cycles, the global warming trend caused by rising greenhouse gas emissions is raising the baseline temperatures and can <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/earth/climate-change/a-force-of-nature-hurricanes-in-a-changing-climate/" target="_blank">fuel major hurricanes</a>.</p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion Energy decided last week to build its proposed natural gas plant at its former coal-fired Chesterfield Power Station in Chesterfield County, instead of at an entirely new site, but community concerns remain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, Dominion spokesperson Jeremy Slayton said the utility made the decision to move the Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center proposal from the initial James River Industrial Park location on Battery Brooke Parkway after receiving community feedback. The power station site will “limit construction and operations to the existing industrial footprint and minimize impacts to wetlands and cultural resources,” wrote Slayton, adding the existing site already has needed infrastructure in place and will meet air quality protection requirements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For these reasons, we are confident the project meets all site suitability requirements under Virginia law,” Slayton said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project is being put forward alongside several of Dominion’s renewable energy projects to meet surging energy demands from extreme weather events, the proliferation of data centers and increasing electrification of everyday life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in light of the Virginia Clean Economy Act — a law requiring Dominion to transition to renewable energy sources by 2045 unless there is a concern over grid reliability — and after Democratic </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/15/democratic-legislators-oppose-dominions-proposed-chesterfield-natural-gas-plant/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislators</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> spoke out against it, local residents continue to be opposed to the 1,000 megawatt project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community members have said they want more energy efficiency and storage projects developed. Residents also want a public hearing for the Chesterfield Board of Supervisors to take a formal vote to determine if the location meets “</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/05/dominion-chesterfield-county-weigh-site-suitability-for-natural-gas-plant-proposal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">site suitability</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” requirements, which hasn’t happened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, county staff  decided a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/18/chesterfield-county-decides-to-not-take-up-zoning-appeal-for-dominions-natural-gas-plant/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">conditional use permit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> issued in 2010 for the existing Chesterfield Power Station on Coxendale Road would be applicable to the new plant, meaning the county won’t need to make further approvals or hold public hearings on the matter.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="gl0rB7CiH4"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/18/chesterfield-county-decides-to-not-take-up-zoning-appeal-for-dominions-natural-gas-plant/">Chesterfield County decides to not take up zoning appeal for Dominion&#8217;s natural gas plant</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Chesterfield County decides to not take up zoning appeal for Dominion&#8217;s natural gas plant&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/18/chesterfield-county-decides-to-not-take-up-zoning-appeal-for-dominions-natural-gas-plant/embed/#?secret=NhvKLtisUP#?secret=gl0rB7CiH4" data-secret="gl0rB7CiH4" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion referenced that decision in their statement about the plant’s location change and  provided that zoning determination to the state’s Department of Environmental Quality as part of the air permit approval process, but “a site suitability determination has not yet been made,” agency spokeswoman Irina Calos said in an email Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Friends of the Chesterfield, a group formed to oppose the plant, sent a letter on Tuesday to the county supervisors  asking for an on-the-record vote of site suitability by its Sept. 25 meeting. Otherwise, the group will hold its own “People’s Hearing” on Oct. 29 to gather testimony to be submitted to DEQ and the State Corporation Commission, the state’s utility regulators, in future approval processes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Board has the right and responsibility to solicit, interpret and honor the perspectives of your constituents,” the Tuesday letter states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nicole Martin, president of the Chesterfield NAACP, said in a joint statement with the Southern Environmental Law Center, also on Tuesday, that “Dominion’s decision-making thus far has taken place in back rooms with little to no input from community members that will have to live with pollution from this facility every day.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How it has handled this is not good. It’s unethical,” Martin continued. “It gets to the heart of how environmental injustice starts and persists – locking people and communities out of decisions that greatly impact all aspects of their lives.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Next steps</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plant’s location change prompted Dominion to modify its air permit application with DEQ, which is expected to release a draft version by the end of the year. It’s unclear how the new location may impact the amount of pollution the plant is expected to produce. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since there was no permit actually drafted for the initial location, Calos, with DEQ, said “w</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e are unable to determine how it would differ.” Mike Dowd, director of DEQ’s air and renewable energy division, previously told the Mercury modeling “might change.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the initial permit </span><a href="https://www.deq.virginia.gov/topics-of-interest/dominion-chesterfield-energy-reliability-center-project" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">application</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the plant, with four natural gas combustion turbines, was projected to emit 2.2 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalents, 81.6 tons of particular matter and 344.9 tons of nitrous oxides annually, among several other pollutants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brennan Gilmore, executive director of Clean Virginia, a group that was formed to oppose Dominion’s influence in the state legislature and that has been organizing opposition to the project alongside the Chesapeake Climate Action Network, said,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Halting this project is crucial to keeping utility bills in check and protecting Chesterfield residents from decades of dangerous air pollution.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The release of the new permit by DEQ will be followed by a public comment period and multiple public hearings, as well as an application with the SCC early next year to get final approval for the project. Dominion said it will also hold at least two additional public meetings, “in the coming weeks and months.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The utility, aware of the fierce opposition to the project, countered that it will be a necessary and reliable source of electricity for local residents and Central Virginians.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We respect their views and will continue working as hard as we can to address their concerns,” said Slayton.</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin / Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A do not drink water advisory is in effect for customers of the Rapidan Service Authority that serves the central Piedmont area of the state, including Orange County, because of an odor emanating from the water. But the question remains: what’s causing the smell?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On </span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/drinking-water/wilderness-water-treatment-plant-contamination/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wednesday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Virginia Department of Health and RSA had initially issued a do not use water advisory, including a ban on swimming in the Rapidan River, out of an abundance of caution, after residents reported the odor in their tap water.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The odor, reported to smell like diesel, lead to a concern that oil had leaked into the Rapidan, which flows into the Rappahannock River and is the source of water treated at the Wilderness Treatment Plant before it&#8217;s sent out to customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, following “comprehensive water sampling,” VDH had found that there were no volatile organic compounds — those found in fuel and household products — causing the concerning odor and that drinking water remains in compliance with federal and state drinking water standards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the do not drink advisory will stay in place “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">until the odor of concern is lessened to a greater level,” said Brookie Crawford, risk communications manager at VDH on Monday. “The comprehensive lab sampling performed to date (does) not indicate a public health risk.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brent Hunsinger, director of advocacy and coastal programs of the Friends of the Rappahannock, an environmental nonprofit focused on conservation of the Rappahannock River, said there haven’t been any dead fish observed or discoloration of the water. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That lack of ecosystem impact means the source of the odor could be coming from infrastructure within the wastewater treatment plant itself, but no source or chemical has been identified there either, Hunsigner said, based on his conversations with those familiar with the response.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s kind of a vexing problem,” said Hunsinger, adding that the time it&#8217;s taking to solve the mystery is due in part to a 48-hour test period needed for the water.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VDH planned another inspection of the facility on Monday, Crawford said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“RSA advises customers who still detect an odor to flush their taps,” said Dwayne Roadcap, director of the office of drinking water. “The investigation to identify the source of the odor and what is causing the odor continues.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Residents who smell the odor in their water may report it using </span><a href="https://www.rapidan.org/contact-us" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this form</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on RSA’s website. </span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion Energy is spending $17.65 million for another piece of the ocean to expand its offshore wind energy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s largest utility was the lone bidder for the lease of 176,506 acres about 35 miles off the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay in a Bureau of Ocean Energy Management auction Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The win means Dominion Energy has the potential to produce up to another 4 gigawatts of electricity, enough to power up to 1.4 million homes, directly adjacent to its $9.8 billion Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind (CVOW) project currently being </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/24/as-offshore-wind-installation-rises-dominion-showcases-environmental-economic-benefits/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">built</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The additional lease area also means Dominion is closer to — and could actually satisfy — part of its requirements of the Virginia Clean Economy Act to produce a total of 5.2 gigawatts of offshore wind electricity by 2035. The 2020 law seeks to decarbonize the electric grid by mid-century.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new area also joins a 40,000-acre area, renamed CVOW South, off the coast of the Outer Banks in North Carolina that the utility announced in </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/08/dominion-to-purchase-second-offshore-wind-lease-area-off-coast-of-north-carolina/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">July</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it would purchase to produce up to 800 megawatts of electricity as part of an effort to meet increasing power demands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That demand is coming from data centers proliferating in Virginia, surrounding states retiring fossil fuel sources, localities in Virginia pushing back against solar and battery storage sources, and problems with the regional grid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As questions shroud the viability of lofty small modular nuclear reactors to provide around-the clock, carbon-free electricity generation, the ability for offshore wind to provide power by cranking its spinning turbines has become increasingly appealing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Offshore wind is critical to our all-of-the-above approach to meet the unprecedented growth of our customer electric demand over the next decade,&#8221; said Robert M. Blue, chair, president and chief executive officer of Dominion Energy. &#8220;Winning this lease area gives us another low-cost option to meet that growing demand while providing our customers with reliable, affordable and increasing clean energy.&#8221;</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The bidding</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion spent about $1.7 million in 2013 for the 113,000-care area about 27-miles off the shore of Virginia Beach being used for the CVOW project, which will consist of 176 wind-turbines — the points of which will be 836 above the water — on monopile foundations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final price for the second area is a good one, said Eileen Woll, offshore wind energy program director at the Virginia Chapter of the environmental non-profit Sierra Club, after some predicted the sale could go for as much as $200 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A reason for the price concern is because the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which runs the auctions for the areas it designates as suitable for offshore wind development, whittled the options down to two. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second lease area auctioned Wednesday, a 101,443 acre spot off the coast of Maryland and Delaware, had five opening bids at the minimum $10,144,300 price, but escalated to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a $75,001,001 offer from Equinor Wind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That price, $17 million is a bargain</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” said Woll in an interview, adding third party developers saw an opportunity in the northern Maryland and Delaware area. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think it’s real legit for us to push [for a goal of] 8 gigawatts [of offshore wind] and it’s very realistic.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the most recent legislative session, Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Bath, introduced a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/01/virginia-bill-to-let-non-utilities-supply-offshore-wind-energy-pushed-back-to-2025/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to allow Dominion to procure its offshore wind electricity from a third-party developer, which argued the steep competition for the limited sites could escalate bids, but the legislation was pushed to 2025.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The argument centered around the idea that if Dominion was forced to buy electricity from one of those developers, the third-party providers would have to compete to keep their bids low as part of an overall effort to keep electricity costs down when entering into an agreement with the utility, instead of allowing Dominion to increase its bid to an exorbitant amount that is recoverable by ratepayers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the third party developers ended up not bidding on the area Dominion won and instead focused on the northern area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evan Vaughan, executive director of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mid-Atlantic Renewable Energy Coalition (MAREC) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Action, in a statement said, the results show that policy and electricity demands are “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">attracting major interest from our growing industry</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It isn&#8217;t surprising to see the different level of competition between [the Virginia area] and [Maryland/Delaware] area, as Virginia&#8217;s policies do not allow for non-utility developers to sell electricity directly into the Virginia market,” he added.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What’s next</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The utility will have to submit an application to the State Corporation Commission for a certificate of public convenience and necessity for the second offshore wind project before constructing its own facility. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this time, the company does not have an estimated timeline or cost for development of either CVOW South or the new leasehold,” Dominion’s release stated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion has attributed the “on-time and on-budget” work underway currently at CVOW to regulated oversight from the SCC that required the utility to lock up contracts years ago before inflation and supply chain issues led to third-party projects in New England states closing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The utility announced on Monday the 50th monopile of CVOW had been installed for the project that is expected to cost ratepayers $4 a month over the life of the 35-year project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lawsuit from conservative and fossil-fuel funded groups challenging the CVOW project, alleging a harm to the North Atlantic right whale that scientists dispute, is still proceeding in District of Columbia U.S. District Court. </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virgnia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s Tobacco Region Revitalization Commission is considering how to spend $12 million for energy projects as part of a legislative mandate to revitalize the economy of two regions no longer reaping the economic benefits of the tobacco industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a meeting last week, the commisisons’ Energy Ingenuity Committee discussed applications it has received for two rounds of the funds that opened up this year. A third round is expected to open after the next meeting in September.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We rolled it out earlier this year,” said Jerry Silva, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">director of regional energy development and innovation at the commission, during the meeting</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “We really did not know what the application level would be.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Energy Ingenuity </span><a href="https://revitalizeva.org/2024/06/24/6-24-25-tobacco-commission-launches-second-round-of-energy-ingenuity-fund/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was recently created by the commission to spur economic activity around energy development projects, and join a suite of other funding programs for Southside and Southwest Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The commission was formed in 1999 with 28 legislative and citizen members who represent the two regions and allocate funds from what is called the 1998 Master Settlement, which forced tobacco companies to compensate localities in several states for the health and economic costs associated with smoking, but also sparked the demise of the industry’s footprint in the two Virginia regions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Energy Ingenuity Fund allocated $6 million to each region and solicited projects. Requirements include applicants be a government entity or nonprofit, have one-for-one matching funds and identify the number of jobs that could be created. Private companies can apply for the funds as long as it partners with a locality to create economic incentives. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The applications</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fund works with a “pre-application” phase, in which applicants present ideas to Silva on what funding could go toward, before staff determine what needs more information and what can be submitted as a full application.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In round one, announced in January, Silva said he received 17 pre-applications requesting a total of $27 million. Three moved forward for a full commission vote in May.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Agricultural Technology Innovation Partnership Foundation (ATIP), an agricultural group focused on technology development, was awarded $50,000 to plan for future </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/03/06/does-virginias-renewable-future-have-space-for-alternative-forms-of-gas/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">biomass</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> operations in Southwest Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The commission also awarded a $2 million loan to Hitachi, which manufactures transformers in South Boston and had submitted the application to upgrade equipment and avoid outsourcing. The company, which in </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2022/october/name-940967-en.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2022</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announced a $37 million investment that included other commission funds, said 30 jobs would be created in its application.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hitachi Energy has a long and productive relationship with the Commonwealth of Virginia and we are grateful for this collaboration,” said Hitachi spokesperson Kurt Steinert, who declined to share more specifics and if the offer was accepted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the applicants that didn’t advance to a commission vote in round one, was Appalachian Voices, an environmental nonprofit that’s been staunchly opposed to the Mountain Valley Pipeline delivering natural gas into Pittsylvania County and is a proponent of renewable energy development. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In round </span><a href="https://revitalizeva.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/FINAL-FY25-Southern-VA-Energy-Fund-RFP-6-18-2024.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 11 organizations put in requests for a total of about $4.5 million. About four projects, including an electric vehicle charging demonstration and a  waste to energy proposal are expected to be passed to the commission on Thursday, which will vote in September after the public has had an opportunity to review proposals, Silva said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The waste to energy proposal, from ATIP again, is a $1 million request for a live demonstration of mobile technology that could convert cow manure into natural gas, similar to what Roanoke Gas Company is doing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We go into regions, we help educate,” said Wes Jurey, president and CEO of ATIP, in an interview on his organization&#8217;s work to study what’s needed for a biomass industry in the regions.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What type of energy?</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of the funds come amid concerns that there are not enough sources of energy generation as demand from data centers and electric vehicles grow. At the same time, the state’s decarbonization goals, including the Virginia Clean Economy Act, is leading to the retirement of fossil fuel generation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can’t stress enough the importance of what we’re going to face in the Commonwealth in the coming five to 10 years,” said James Campos, executive director of the commission, during the meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of a transition to electric vehicles, Downtown Wytheville, a community development organization, is seeking a $30,000 grant to continue the EV charging demonstration plans it had as part of a downtown revitalization. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The town is also seeking a $50,000 planning grant for a contractor who can evaluate energy efficiency improvements, ranging from potential upgrades of sewer pumps, creation of a town electric grid or activating an old landfill to capture </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/01/federal-government-awards-150-million-to-reduce-emissions-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">methane gas</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">said Charlie Jones, administrative and events coordinator with Downtown Wytheville. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those efforts could combat the town’s rising Appalachian Power Company electricity bills. The bills were about $900,000 in 2021 to 2022, increased to about $1.2 million the following year and had already reached that amount in the July 1, 2023 to March 2024, timeframe, Jones said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There&#8217;s a lot of Inflation Reduction Act [money coming] into rural areas now,” Jones said. “We’re trying to set us up,” to be “intentional.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silva said projects sought after are those fitting an “All of the Above” approach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These are projects that we’re trying to help bridge opportunities that would normally not be opportunities unless we helped them,” Silva said. “We’re trying to make sure we’re the best stewards of the commission&#8217;s money and dollars. We want to fund viable projects.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview, Del. Thomas Garrett, R-Goochland, who chairs the Energy Ingenuity Committee, said his work on the committee is not about “favoring” an energy project “over another.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My job on the commission is to create jobs and economic opportunity inside the footprint,” Garrett said, referencing the historical downturn of other industries in the region including furniture and coal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In general, the fund’s dollars provide “an opportunity to further enhance the energy infrastructure and supply chain across the Commonwealth,” said Braden Croy, program director at The Dominion Energy Innovation Center, which hosted a </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRSAsw6UcRw&amp;fbclid=IwY2xjawEoeo9leHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHWDOZwavjA34MDcAa6gim3Hou4TkHyk7GWB5xvGrWi8bYaP9GlOwhZvMPA_aem_BbEfO_hJv0XFJATrnMfPWA" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">webinar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about the process with Silva.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As an organization focused on helping Virginia achieve a net-zero carbon economy, we&#8217;re pleased that the Tobacco Commission has earmarked funding to high-impact energy projects, and we&#8217;re looking forward to seeing the community benefits from this program,” Croy said.</span></p>

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON —  The U.S. Department of Agriculture plans to embark on a year-long study beginning next month that will test samples for evidence of highly pathogenic avian influenza from former dairy cattle moved into meat production.</p>
<p>Emilio Esteban, the under secretary for food safety at the USDA, told reporters on a call Tuesday the new testing program follows three studies undertaken during the spring and summer that all found beef in the nation’s food supply is safe to eat.</p>
<p>“However, we want to move forward with an additional step,” Esteban said. “And what this means is that when those carcasses are tested, they are held and are not going to go into commerce until we get the results back.”</p>
<p>The virus, also referred to as bird flu or H5N1, has been found in wild bird and domestic poultry flocks within the United States for years. But the ongoing outbreak in dairy cattle has forced animal and human health experts to establish testing for a new community of agriculture workers and livestock.</p>
<p>The news of additional testing for the country’s meat supply came alongside the results of a study from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that reinforced the safety of pasteurized dairy products.</p>
<p>Steve Grube, chief medical officer for the FDA’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, said that the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/alerts-advisories-safety-information/updates-highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza-hpai#secondtesting" target="_blank">most recent round of dairy product testing</a> included 167 foods that were processed in 27 states in June and July.</p>
<p>“None of the product samples contained viable H5N1, reaffirming that pasteurization is effective,” he said. “The second survey was intended to address geographic and product gaps from the initial sampling of the commercial milk and dairy product supply that the FDA conducted during April and May.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Testing milk in bulk tanks</h4>

	
<p>Federal officials have also launched a voluntary program for farmers to test the milk in bulk tanks for H5N1, a step that’s intended to make it easier for them to move their cows between states without having to individually test each one.</p>
<p>Eric Deeble, deputy under secretary for marketing and regulatory programs at USDA, said the department’s Farm Service Agency has approved 23 of the 35 applications it has received so far to help ease the financial burden on dairy farmers who take their herds out of production after testing positive.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/disaster-assistance-program/emergency-assist-for-livestock-honey-bees-fish/index" target="_blank">program</a> — known as Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-raised Fish — has approved more than $1 million in payments.</p>
<p>The price paid to farmers is based on a formula that includes the price of milk from the preceding month as well as the number of dairy cattle that contract H5N1.</p>
<p>Deeble said on the call with reporters that of the approved applications, a dozen are from Colorado, which has seen a sharp increase in the number of positive H5N1 tests within its dairy industry.</p>
<p>Deeble argued the uptick is due to certain factors within the state and cautioned people against assuming that if testing was increased in other areas of the country, the number of positive H5N1 tests for dairy cattle would spike.</p>
<p>“I don’t think that it is accurate necessarily to extrapolate from the situation in Weld County, Colorado,” Deeble said. “Weld County and Colorado dairy in particular is rather unique in the degree to which the dairies are all closely associated with one another; both spatially and the way in which there is a lot of movement between the facilities.”</p>
<p>“It is a tightly integrated dairy community that’s isolated from much of the rest of the state, and there is a lot of connectivity between the premises in the way in which they use vehicles, support services, milk trucks,” Deeble added.</p>
<p>During the last 30 days, five states have had dairy cattle test positive for H5N1, including Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, South Dakota and Texas.</p>
<p>Colorado holds a disproportionate number of cases with 26 of the <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/hpai-confirmed-cases-livestock" target="_blank">dairy herds to test positive</a>, while the other four states combined hold a total of six herds.</p>
<p>Other mammals <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/mammals" target="_blank">diagnosed</a> with H5N1 during the last six weeks are overwhelmingly in Colorado, which has found the virus in house mice, deer mice, domestic cats, a desert cottontail and a prairie vole.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Effect on cats</h4>

	
<p>Public health officials said during the call Tuesday they are beginning to look more closely at when and why cats are being affected by the spread of H5N1.</p>
<p>Barn cats as well as those that hunt outside, coming into regular contact with wild birds that hold a reservoir of H5N1, have tested positive for the virus before.</p>
<p>But a <a href="https://www.colovma.org/cvma-news/influenza-a-highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza-h5n1-in-domestic-cats/" target="_blank">report</a> from the Colorado Veterinary Medical Association earlier this month noted that two of the six cats diagnosed with H5N1 in that state this year “were indoor only cats with no direct exposures to the virus.”</p>
<p>Public health officials on the call were unable to answer a question about how indoor-only cats would have come into contact with H5N1.</p>
<p>Experts on the call cautioned that as fall approaches, wild birds will begin migrating and dairy farmers will likely ship their cattle at higher rates, both of which could lead to an uptick in the number of positive cases of H5N1 being reported in dairy cattle as well as other animals.</p>

<p>The 71 acres of the Nansemond Indian Nation’s Mattanock Town near Suffolk, VA, can invoke something different for each visitor. Some people admire the woodlands by the Nansemond River. Chief Keith F. Anderson sees echoes of his ancestors’ crops and villages. People working to restore the land point to many years of damage. But, like Anderson, they envision the land’s potential.</p>
<p>The Nansemond nation has been working on <a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/13935b3635d447cebeda6e7c827c9347" target="_blank">environmental restoration projects</a> for this piece of ancestral land for over a decade under a special agreement with the city of Suffolk. In July, when the city transferred the deed to the tribe, the Nansemond became its official steward. Now, larger efforts to improve water quality and reconnect Native citizens to the land are underway.</p>
<p>“We know we need clean water, air and land to survive,” Anderson said. “It’s an honored stewardship that we have ingrained in our minds and souls and also to honor our ancestors who did that for thousands of years.”</p>
<p>With more than a mile of shoreline and about 21 acres of tidal wetlands, the land is important to the Nansemond because it provides access to their namesake river. The tribe named it Mattanock Town after a nearby ancestral settlement, although there is no town at the site.</p>
<p>Ancestors of the contemporary Nansemond have been around the river and surrounding land for at least 12,000 years, when the Paleo-Indian period began.</p>
<p>In the 1600s, the Nansemond and the British colonists were engaged in a series of wars. They eventually signed the <a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/primary-documents/articles-of-peace-1677/" target="_blank">Treaty of Middle Plantation</a> in 1677. As settlers continued moving into the Nansemond River area in the 1700s, the Nansemond were increasingly separated from their land and the treaty became void after colonists rejected British rule. Much later, the <a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/racial-integrity-laws-1924-1930/" target="_blank">1924 Virginia Racial Integrity Act</a> worked to further obscure their identity.</p>
<p>When the Nansemond people won f<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/984/text%22%20/l%20%22toc-HB6D8EE50FB084C07A138BD19786BC760" target="_blank">ederal recognition in 2018</a>, they also gained capacity to manage land and take on bigger projects to improve and protect both land and water.</p>

(Keith F. Anderson/Nansemond Indian Nation)</p></figure>
<p>And the Nansemond River needs help. The Nansemond River Preservation Alliance, a local nonprofit, released a <a href="https://www.cleanmyrivers.com/new-page-3" target="_blank">report</a> in May that classified the river as “impaired.” According to the report, phosphate levels are 3.5 times higher than the recommended threshold. Plus, oxygen levels have been declining throughout the river for the past six years.</p>
<p>Beth Cross, president of the alliance, said that human impacts have taken a toll. More than 50 years ago, the headwaters of the river were dammed to provide other cities with water. That makes the water stagnant, without enough current to flush out contaminates from stormwater runoff like fertilizer and pet waste.</p>
<p>Cross pointed out that the Nansemond nation is literally in a good position — halfway up the river — to help improve water quality.</p>
<p>The land at Mattanock Town needs attention too. Beginning in 1926, the <a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/13935b3635d447cebeda6e7c827c9347" target="_blank">Lone Star Cement Corporation</a> operated 11 mine soil pits that ran from the river inland for about 2.5 miles. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency shut down the company in 1971. Two of the 11 pits that were within Mattanock Town were left to sit. As vegetation grew around them, invasive plants moved in. Water quality suffered, and the connection between the forest and marshes was fractured.</p>

Anderson of the Nansemond Indian Nation plants native trees with volunteers in Mattanock Town in Virginia on April 2, 2024. (Chesapeake Bay Foundation)</p></figure>
<p>Cameron Bruce, the environmental program manager with the Nansemond nation, said they finished the first round of invasive plant removal last September. The Virginia Department of Forestry, Chesapeake Bay Foundation and volunteers from the nation planted 450 native trees like witch hazel and hackberry in March. Anderson said the trees are “doing phenomenal.”</p>
<p>Bruce also said their oyster garden is far along after four years of collaborating with the Bay Foundation. Overharvesting, pollution and disease contributed to the collapse of the oyster population in the river by the 1980s, reaching less than 10% of historic levels. Because oysters are filter feeders, their restoration will help improve water quality.</p>
<p>Each year, the Bay Foundation gives the tribe baby oysters, or “spat on shell,” to grow. Then, the tribe plants the adult oysters on a sanctuary reef owned by the Nansemond River Preservation Alliance in Chuckatuck Creek, a few miles upstream from Mattanock Town.</p>
<p>Bruce said having full jurisdiction of the land opened the door for the tribe and its partners to tackle bigger restoration projects there.</p>
<p>The Suffolk City Council voted 7–0 with one abstention on May 15 to transfer the land to the Nansemond nation. A conservation easement will protect the land from development. And the tribe agreed to provide public access to the site, providing a new outdoor resource for the community.</p>
<figure id="attachment_39601" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:225px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/14/nansemond-indian-nation-aims-to-heal-land-water-along-their-namesake-river/66b64bd704d94-image/" rel="attachment wp-att-39601"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-39601" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/66b64bd704d94.image_-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/66b64bd704d94.image_-225x300.jpg 225w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/66b64bd704d94.image_.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Volunteers plant native trees at Mattanock Town in Virginia on April 2, 2024. (Chesapeake Bay Foundation)</p></figure>
<p>“We want to be able to have community kayaking and canoeing down that area to actually provide a person opportunities who really may be new to outdoor recreation, and also to spur some life on the Nansemond River and Cedar Creek and especially to kind of give the feel or vibe of how it would have been a thousand years ago,” Anderson said.</p>
<p>Now that the tribe is resuming its role as steward of the land, it can start the heavy lifting. The biggest project will be creating small and large “living shorelines” that provide habitat and protection from erosion, along with planting streamside trees. Both will help filter runoff as it flows toward the river.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot of work to do, and so we would like to transform [Mattanock Town] from how it currently is left over from Lone Star [Cement] into … a case study for how land can be restored from really poor conditions into something beautiful,” Bruce said.</p>
<p>Bruce and Anderson would like to create a tribally owned oyster hatchery in the river and an educational walking trail. They also want to host demonstrations that show how the Nansemond have lived in connection and reciprocity with nature for thousands of years.</p>
<p>For now, they’re focused on securing more funds for the living shorelines and removing dead trees this summer. They hope to open trails by 2025.</p>

(Courtesy of John Tippet)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think back to being a kid, and imagine how cool it would have been to find a shark tooth in the sand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One island in Virginia with a collection of those fossils from the ocean’s top predator may be gone in a matter of decades, preventing future generations from making such discoveries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I started going to Shark Tooth Island when I was 12 years old, hunting shark teeth,” said John P. Tippett, an adjunct professor at the University of Mary Washington. “I&#8217;ve seen that island disappear over my lifespan. It&#8217;s a dramatic change from what it was like when I was younger.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tippett and Kate Stoneman, a rising junior and research assistant at UMW, are trying to predict when the island in the Potomac River — formally named Hollis Island but colloquially called Shark Tooth Island — will disappear, and why. They say climate change is a key factor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a local landmark that people love to visit,” said Stoneman. “I want to show them that climate change is going to affect you on this personal level, whether you like it or not, because it&#8217;s what’s happening.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Barrier islands</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About an hour east of Fredericksburg near Westmoreland State Park, the private Shark Tooth Island is a barrier island, much like the Outer Banks and northeastern parts of Virginia’s Eastern Shores. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barrier islands are formed by tides and wind patterns pushing sand in certain areas that build up into a sandbar that eventually becomes big enough to be an island. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sand that forms the island picks up the teeth lost by smaller sharks, which in the Potomac River can include dogfish and bull </span><a href="https://potomac.org/blog/2024/1/2/how-the-potomac-shapes-local-wildlife" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sharks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, hence the island’s nickname.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39562" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:709px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=39562" rel="attachment wp-att-39562"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-39562" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/shark-teeth.jpg" alt="" width="709" height="945" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/shark-teeth.jpg 709w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/shark-teeth-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 100vw, 709px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A collection of teeth on Shark Tooth Island. (Courtesy of John Tippet)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of the drifty nature of how barrier islands are formed, they can quickly disappear. If the island vanishes, then a natural resource that serves as a recreation spot and can also  maintain water quality and coastlines by absorbing wave energy to prevent tides from causing erosion, will be gone, too. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unfortunately, barrier islands are disappearing at an alarming rate,” according to the </span><a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/barrier-islands.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2021.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The causes</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tippett and Stonemen are looking at the loss of the island from two angles: sea level rise and the land subsidence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Humans burning fossil fuels that release heat-trapping greenhouse gasses are heating up global temperatures and contributing to rising waters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is going to melt our land ice, melt our glaciers,” Stoneman said. “Also, heating up our atmosphere, it&#8217;s going to warm up our oceans. As water heats up, it starts to expand. That&#8217;s also going to increase the volume in the ocean.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the land sinking aspect, humans are involved, too: they pull water out of the Potomac Aquifer, the pool of groundwater below the earth&#8217;s surface in the region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sediment is now compacting down into that space that water used to be in,” Stoneman said. “This is coming from industries, agriculture, coastal wells all sucking water out of our aquifers faster than the recharge rate.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, last but not least, the sinking  island is a phenomenon of glacial isostatic adjustment, “kind of a mouthful term,” Stoneman said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“During the last ice age, there was a giant ice sheet covering northern North America from Canada down into around Pennsylvania, not where the island is itself,” said Stoneman. He explained that the heavy ice sheet pushed land in the north down, which forced land on the coast up. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When that ice sheet eventually melted, the land in the north then wanted to readjust back to where it used to sit,” Stoneman continued. “The land where the island is on the coast is now going to sink back down.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The research</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tippet and Stoneman’s research included compiling previous findings, figuring out how much land has already been lost and conducting their own field work, which involved tromping around the island in waders. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/cir1392" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2013</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the United States Geological Survey found that Shark Tooth Island was being lost to sea level rise at a rate of about 1.8 millimeters a year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additional data from that USGS study, which examined the water levels of the Potomac Aquifer, found that the land Shark Tooth Island sits on was subsiding at a rate of 2.1 millimeters a year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Combining those two figures equals a total water level increase of about 3.9 millimeters a year, or “1.5 inches every 10 years,” Stoneman said.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39573" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:628px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=39573" rel="attachment wp-att-39573"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-39573" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-shark-tooth-video-pic-COLLAGE.jpg" alt="" width="628" height="628" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-shark-tooth-video-pic-COLLAGE.jpg 628w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-shark-tooth-video-pic-COLLAGE-300x300.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-shark-tooth-video-pic-COLLAGE-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 628px) 100vw, 628px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Photographs of Shark Tooth Island in 2024 in the top left, 2013 in the top right, 2009 in the bottom left and 1994 in the bottom right. (Courtesy of Kate Stoneman)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As verification of the land loss, Stoneman added she reviewed pictures of the island from 1994 to 2024, calculated how much vegetation each one had and found that in those 30 years, the island lost about 32.4 acres.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That was kind of the big start for our project to really show that the island is getting so much smaller,” Stoneman said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, to calculate the year when the island will be fully submerged, Stoneman and a classmate went out on the island for three hours in October and then with another classmate for one hour in May, armed with a theodolite, the surveying tool that can usually be seen along roadways, and a long poll to find the highest point of the island.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39564" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:709px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=39564" rel="attachment wp-att-39564"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-39564" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/phragmites.jpg" alt="" width="709" height="945" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/phragmites.jpg 709w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/phragmites-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 100vw, 709px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Kate Stoneman and another student walk into Shark Tooth Island. (Courtesy of John Tippett)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But unlike surveying flat, paved roadways, the two students had to walk into the vegetation consisting of the invasive species phragmites that they needed to  push down with the collapsible pole. Then they had to deal with pollen, avoid an old hunting blind and an old building and make their way out of the tree line before getting to a clearing to take the measurements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I asked for a machete. Mr. Tippet did not provide me with one,” Stoneman said. “It was a lot, but it was important. It was important to what we were doing, so it was going to get done</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">So what’s the answer?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re crunching the numbers,” Tippet said, adding that the highest points of elevation they found were a “few inches” above mean high tide, the highest point the water rises to before receding back into the ocean. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And…we&#8217;re looking at a relative sea level rise rate of an inch and a half every 10 years,” he continued. “So you can kind of get a sense from that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A complicating factor is the dynamic nature of barrier islands. Increasingly intense rainfall may push more dirt out into the ocean that will “maybe” allow the island to shoal back up, but the sea level rise rate may increase and consume the island at a faster rate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But clearly, looking at the data right now, the island&#8217;s losing,” said Tippett. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State officials are aware of the loss of barrier islands, marshes and dunes. Prior to the creation of a Chief Resilience Officer this past legislative session to better coordinate flooding matters, the state produced The Virginia Coastal Resilience Master Plan, which is due to be updated at the end of this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By 2080, the loss of beach and dune features, including those in the Eastern Shore region, is “projected to reach 3,800 acres, a 38% loss of existing habitat,” according to the </span><a href="https://www.dcr.virginia.gov/crmp/document/virginiacoastalresiliencemasterplan-print.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the research isn’t quite intended to influence policy at the moment, Tippet said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There&#8217;s a whole lot of misinformation, a whole lot of folks who believe [climate change isn’t] not real, or not that bad,” Tippet said. “What we&#8217;re doing here is trying to address that part. We can&#8217;t make change at the policy level until the people who vote actually are behind it.”</span></p>

(Leonard Nelson/Natrx)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022, </span><a href="https://www.riseresilience.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RISE, the Norfolk-based nonprofit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that creates challenges seeking innovative solutions to the climate crisis, issued a call for new approaches to dealing with mud, the spoils of dredging.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia&#8217;s Middle Peninsula Planning District Commission and the Eastern Shore had $20 million in ready projects, the challenge noted, which would yield an enormous amount of spoils (one study concluded there will be 100,000 cubic yards of dredging material annually in coastal Virginia). While there is an overwhelming demand for clean sand from dredging to replenish beaches, the dirtier spoils dominated by clay have been considered worthless and expensive to dispose of.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RISE asked competitors to re-imagine how that material could be recycled in economically sustainable ways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leonard Nelson, co-founder of </span><a href="https://natrx.io/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natrx</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a technology company focused on coastal resiliency, thought he had the answer: examine how the mud could be used as a concrete substitute for printing barriers to protect the shoreline or create oyster reefs. But when the Raleigh-based company began using the $200,000 grant funded through RISE by</span><a href="https://govirginia.org/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Go Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to analyze the mud in the Middle Peninsula, they found it was rich in clay, too rich to be used in that way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For an answer, the company turned to the wisdom of the ancients – the recipe for Roman concrete.       </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Converting clay to concrete</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent decades, researchers have probed samples from Roman concrete structures like tombs, aqueducts, and breakwaters to uncover why they endure when modern concrete may crumble after only a few decades. They haven’t been successful, but they have developed an understanding of its composition, which includes clay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natrx tested and validated converting the clays from dredging in the York River into a substitute for some of the cement in concrete, lowering its carbon footprint by nearly half and the cost by nearly two-thirds. Not only is it cheaper, but it is also stronger than traditional concrete. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nelson and Natrx co-founder, Matthew Campbell, collaborated with an East Carolina University researcher to </span><a href="https://easychair.org/publications/paper/bXMN" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">publish a paper </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">earlier this year with the proof. Two other </span><a href="https://kuleuven.limo.libis.be/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=lirias1727560&amp;context=SearchWebhook&amp;vid=32KUL_KUL:Lirias&amp;lang=en&amp;search_scope=lirias_profile&amp;adaptor=SearchWebhook&amp;tab=LIRIAS&amp;query=any,contains,LIRIAS1727560&amp;offset=0" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">studies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> previewed their findings.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This process has been around for a long time and unfortunately hasn’t been industrially adopted,” said Nelson, who has a chemical engineering degree.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The solution, Nelson noted, is an opportunity for cash-strapped rural areas which may have to pay a tipping fee to landfills to deposit the spoils, which could cost millions of dollars.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://natrx.io/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natrx</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> plans to supplement the concrete with dredging spoils in its patented custom </span><a href="https://natrx.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Natrx-Exoforms.Overview.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ExoForms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, structures that protect shorelines from erosion and create a habitat for oysters and fish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Raleigh-based company won a 2020 coastal resilience competition through </span><a href="https://www.riseresilience.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RISE</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a $280,000 loan to purchase a 3-D printer to create the forms, which can be fabricated in a variety of shapes and sizes. They have been deployed in two dozen projects from the Chesapeake Bay to the Gulf of Mexico. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In contrast to walls or riprap, they can be installed in days instead of months. They use about one-tenth the tonnage of traditional riprap transported from inland at less than 45% of the cost, according to an economic analysis commissioned by the company. Creating the concrete supplement locally would decrease the need to import cement; the United States is by far the </span><a href="https://arijco.com/top-cement-suppliers/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">world&#8217;s largest cement importer.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There&#8217;s an obvious circular economy play there to replace some of that imported, high transportation-intensive cement that&#8217;s high carbon with a low-carbon clay that is derived from these dredge sediments,&#8221; Nelson said.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recipe for modern concrete created two centuries ago in Great Britain is a mix of several materials: water; fine aggregates or sand; coarse aggregates or gravel; chemical additives; and Portland cement, which binds the ingredients. Creating that cement requires using fossil fuels to heat a clay and limestone mixture to more than 2,500 degrees, releasing about 1,300 pounds of carbon dioxide for every 2,200 pounds produced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modern concrete production </span><a href="https://climate.mit.edu/explainers/concrete" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">is second only to water as the world&#8217;s most consumed material and studies show it accounts for about 7 % of greenhouse gas emissions. </span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supplementing concrete with dredge spoils fights climate effects in multiple ways. The Natrx concrete process reduces emissions, which slows global warming. Deploying the material in ExoForms helps protect shorelines and slow erosion heightened by the climate crisis. Reducing erosion and the resulting sediment disposition could save rural communities millions by extending the years between dredging.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ExoForms imitate nature, providing structure for grasses and habitat to develop, unlike floodwalls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are big advocates in Virginia, in particular, for building with biomimicry,&#8221; Nelson said. &#8220;We should build lighter, smarter, more biological. And the public sector, in particular, shouldn&#8217;t be doing these giant monstrosities (like riprap and walls).&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lewie Lawrence, the executive director of the </span><a href="https://mppdc.com/index.php" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Middle Peninsula Planning District</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, learned about Natrx at a climate conference some years ago and realized the company had a cost-effective and aesthetically pleasing </span><a href="https://www.ncbiwa.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Session-4-3-Campbell.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">solution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to slow flooding and reduce the costs of dredging, an economic lifeline helping to keep the local fishery industry healthy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He shepherded a </span><a href="https://natrx.io/more/case-study-east-river" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">project on the East River</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to protect a private residence with custom ExoForms that used a 3-D simulation created with a drone so the homeowners could envision the result. Then he collaborated with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Fish and Wildlife Administration to fund a much larger $1 million project protecting</span><a href="https://natrx.io/more/case-study-hog-island?utm_content=294966701&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=linkedin&amp;hss_channel=lcp-20329056" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Hog Island</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Gloucester, which NOAA had targeted for habitat restoration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Hog Island, Natrx custom designed 972 feet of interlocking ExoForms for high-wave energy areas and 122 feet for low-energy oyster reefs, providing surface area for potentially 14 million oysters. The company said the project will prevent 40,000 tons of eroding sediment from flowing into the Bay.</span></p>

<p><em>This video shows an ExoForm breakwater at Hog Island (Mobjack bay / York River), a project in partnership with Biogenic Solutions Consulting LLC.

(Leonard Nelson/Natrx)</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While those forms were manufactured with traditional concrete, Natrx is moving forward with plans to mass-produce concrete with the dredging spoils. It’s looking to build plants and is partnering with Titan America, a Norfolk company that recently was </span><a href="https://www.titan-cement.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/22042024_TITAN_America_has_been_selected_by_the_us_Department_of_Energy_for_funding.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">awarded a $61.7 million grant by the U.S. Department of Energy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to develop a plant outside Roanoke using clay dredging spoils to manufacture the more environmentally-friendly cement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;It&#8217;s great when you can find the win, win, win,&#8221; said <a href="https://www.vims.edu/about/directory/faculty/hartley_tw.php" target="_blank">Troy Hartley</a>, director of the Virginia Sea Grant program, which partners with RISE and has been working with Natrx.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Looking ahead</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hartley sees the market for dredging concrete limited only by imagination. It could be used to 3-D print the walls of buildings to grow plants, cooling urban heat islands. Builders could print the foundation of a raised house with the expectation it will be moved in a couple of decades as sea levels rise. When that happens, the foundation left behind would become an oyster reef. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s that forward-thinking innovation about future opportunities with this technology that&#8217;s got to be the core of our innovation ecosystem,&#8221; he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bringing Natrx&#8217;s green concrete to the Middle Peninsula and elsewhere, though, will require navigating the maze of manufacturing and permitting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has raised $6.2 million </span><a href="https://silverstrand.substack.com/p/investment-notes-why-we-invested-af4" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">from investors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including a seed round led by</span><a href="https://www.ponderosavc.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ponderosa Ventures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a firm co-founded by former presidential candidate and hedge fund manager Tom Steyer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re well capitalized. We&#8217;re growing relatively quickly,&#8221; Nelson said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got just shy of 50 projects in the water.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nelson envisions a series of plants creating concrete with spoils near where dredging takes place and shoreline resilience is needed. He pictures one on the site of the Middle Peninsula Regional Airport in West Point. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To promote that project, the company commissioned a feasibility study by </span><a href="https://www.mangumeconomics.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mangum Economics. </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natrx, its employers, and suppliers would support 183 jobs, over $10 million in pay and benefits, and almost $107 million in economic activity in the Middle Peninsula, according to the report. Because Natrx plans to purchase  supplies from Virginia companies, it would also support an additional 89 jobs, more than $10 million in pay and benefits, and more than $34 million of economic activity in Virginia, beyond the Middle Peninsula.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our next step is we need to resource a study to figure out how long is this going to take,&#8221; Nelson said, noting the process that will likely span years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Lawrence, who has been working on the airport site project, Natrx fits into the planning district’s </span><a href="https://fightthefloodva.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fight the Flood</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program and the goal of turning flooding threats into economic opportunity as a laboratory and landing spot for innovative companies. Turning trash into treasure by converting spoils into useful material is symbolic of that mission. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For years, it has always been referred to as a waste product,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And now it&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s a raw material with incredible value.&#8221;</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The regional electric grid that supplies power to Virginia during times of extreme weather announced a 1,400% increase in some electric costs after its most recent capacity auction. But Dominion officials were quick to assure customers that they would not see an increase in their bills before the end of next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PJM Interconnection, which oversees the electric grid serving several mid-Atlantic states, including Virginia, announced the increase for its capacity market. Dominion buys electricity off of capacity markets during peak, or emergency, demands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a news release, PJM blamed the increase on the need to meet surging electricity demand, which is coming from data centers, and electrification of vehicles and home appliances. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those needs also come amid the retirement of generation sources, PJM officials noted. State’s around the region have implemented policy goals to take offline older, fossil fuel sources to decarbonize electric grids. Virginia has a target to do so by mid-century as a way to combat increasing storm intensities caused by climate change. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding the capacity market begins with knowing that Dominion owns generation sources to provide the electricity it transmits and distributes throughout its grid. Dominion also purchases electricity from a separate wholesale market, which is where third-party power producers sell the electricity they create.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But when the grid experiences high demands of electricity, such as winter and summer when either heaters or AC systems are cranking, the utility may have to purchase electricity from the capacity market to meet its obligations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The auction prices, which are set for future periods to give the third-party power producers an idea of how much they could make and whether it’s feasible to keep their sources online, were recently set for the broader PJM region at $269.20 for 2025-26. For sources within Dominion territory, they were set at $444.26 per megawatt, and in Baltimore Gas and Electric territory at $466.35 because of a limited number of them and transmission constraints. </span><a href="https://www.pjm.com/-/media/about-pjm/newsroom/2023-releases/20230227-pjm-capacity-auction-procures-adequate-resources.ashx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previously</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the price for the PJM region, which then included Dominion’s territory, was $28.92 per megawatt. The highest cost for other constrained areas, those with limited generation sources and transmission lines, in the previous auction was $96.24.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The significantly higher prices in this auction confirm our concerns that the supply/demand balance is tightening across the RTO,” said PJM President and CEO Manu Asthana in a </span><a href="https://www.pjm.com/-/media/about-pjm/newsroom/2024-releases/20240730-pjm-capacity-auction-procures-sufficient-resources-to-meet-rto-reliability-requirement.ashx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “The market is sending a price signal that should incent investment in resources.” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The costs to customers</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion, on its investor earnings </span><a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/08/01/dominion-energy-d-q2-2024-earnings-call-transcript/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">call</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last week, said that the utility shouldn’t be impacted too much by the capacity market increase because those purchases only account for about 1% of current customer bills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Current rates, which on average are about </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$128</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a residential customer, are locked in until Dominion undergoes its next rate review next year. That means Dominion will bear any increased capacity market costs from June until rates change at the end of 2025, said Steven D. Ridge, executive vice president and chief financial officer on the earnings call. And, since Dominion sells power it produces into the wholesale market, any capacity market purchases has a “natural hedge” by those sales.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;ll have offshore wind come in, we&#8217;ll have the Chesterfield [natural gas combustion turbines] come in,” said Ridge, speaking to generation sources that could come online. “But demand is growing. So as that persists, we&#8217;ll think about ways to become effectively self-sufficient as we have been in the past as we catch up on demand. But from a financial impact, it truly is just a temporary item.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concern over grid reliability is why Dominion is proposing the 1,000 megawatt natural gas plant in Chesterfield County, as well as a natural gas storage tank to supply other </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/business/dominion-energy-plans-500-million-liquid-natural-gas-storage-facility/article_18d5e3b0-3f8e-11ef-a4bf-336255a2a35d.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">facilities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://www.loudoun.gov/ArchiveCenter/ViewFile/Item/13796" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">transmission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> line projects to deliver power from various sources. It is also seeking proposals to design a small modular nuclear reactor. Those developments come alongside Dominion’s continued buildout of offshore wind, some solar projects and long duration energy storage devices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia needs more reliable power generation and new transmission infrastructure to reliably serve the growing needs of our customers,” Dominion spokesperson Aaron Ruby told the Mercury after the earning’s call, while adding that additional generation sources, “will be evaluated in our 2024 [Integrated Resource Plan] this October.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One environmental group, the Natural Resources Defense Council, </span><a href="https://www.nrdc.org/press-releases/cost-slow-walking-clean-energy-pjm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">says</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it&#8217;s the unreliability of natural gas that contributed to the rising prices in the capacity market auction. That concern stems from natural gas delivery systems </span><a href="https://stateline.org/2023/11/23/a-year-after-devastating-winter-storm-power-plant-problems-still-likely-in-extreme-weather/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">freezing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during Winter Storm Elliot in 2022, said Claire Lang-Ree, advocate, sustainable FERC project, climate &amp; energy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[Natural gas] actual added value is kind of diminished, considering some constraints,” said Lang-Ree. “I think it also points to the benefits of a diverse resource mix — being able to have not only storage, but also onshore and offshore wind. Offshore wind has a really high capacity factor and can provide reliability when there&#8217;s big winter storms or places where the rest of the grid is experiencing outages.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PJM has been criticized for a large backlog of solar generation sources waiting to come online across the grid. The approval process has undergone reforms, but elected officials said PJM should also adopt some cost-saving measures outlined in a recent order from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission aimed at improving regional planning for transmission lines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is no time to waste in planning for the transmission system to support our future energy needs,” said a </span><a href="https://www.ncelenviro.org/app/uploads/2024/07/FINAL-Sign-on-Letter-for-Transmission-Planning-at-PJM.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the officials, which included Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, and Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But while Virginia’s regulators have noted a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/03/dominion-gets-approval-for-solar-projects-regulators-discuss-data-center-demand/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gap</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the capabilities of solar to provide electricity generation to meet capacity needs, since the amount of electricity a solar panel produces isn’t always at its fullest potential, Lang-Ree acknowledged there are other steps Dominion can also take to add capacity. Those include pursuing more power purchase agreements with third party generators, which environmental groups say Dominion should do more of because of their lower cost to provide electricity, in addition to allowing some buildings to </span><a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/07052024/virginia-connecting-renewable-energy-to-grid/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">interconnect</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> solar panels to alleviate their strain on the grid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When prices are this high, small amounts of [megawatts] can make huge cost differences,” Lang-Ree said.</span></p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: This story has been updated to reflect that the average Dominion customer&#8217;s bill is $128, not $133 as previously reported.</em></p>

(Photo courtesy of John Bateman via Wetlands Watch)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As more intense rainfall has allowed pollution to flow into the James River through Richmond’s overwhelmed city sewer system, the state has introduced draft proposals for septic systems used in more rural areas, to tackle another aspect of climate change that impacts pollution controls: rising sea and groundwater levels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, Virginia began its early discussion on draft regulations for septic systems, which are a typical method of treating waste in areas not privy to public infrastructure, as part of a 20-year regulatory review that kicked off in </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/10/20/amid-climate-change-pressures-virginia-reexamines-septic-regulations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2022</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time of opening up the regulations for review, there were about 1.1 million septic systems in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A majority of the systems are conventional, meaning wastewater from a residence is sent to a tank on the property before it is filtered through a distribution box that sends it throughout the property. The waste eventually breaks down as it is dispersed into the environment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternative systems, which include creating mounds that add more dirt for waste to filter through and chemical treatments, also exist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, pollution protections include setbacks, which require conventional systems be at least 70 feet away from waters with shellfish. Ideally, the setbacks allow  flooding to occur without overwhelming the system, so waste doesn’t back up onto properties or immediately feed into larger bodies of water where shellfish are living.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is not just a public health problem, it’s an economic problem,” Skip Stiles, former director of environmental nonprofit Wetlands Watch, said in a previous interview with the Mercury, referencing how the spreading of pollutants can harm aquaculture, or the raising of shellfish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new </span><a href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/GetFile.cfm?File=meeting%5C58%5C40105%5CMinutes_VDH_40105_v1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> call for the Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences, VIMS, to create a map of a “critical impact area” that is more susceptible to sea level rise and groundwater flooding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within those areas, among other setback requirements, conventional systems would have to be 100 feet away from shellfish waters, unless alternative measures can be incorporated to allow for treatment with more flexibility when siting systems on smaller properties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During last month’s meeting, no member of the subgroup consisting of state, regional and local government employees and environmental groups objected to the proposals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, Stiles, speaking on behalf of Wetlands Watch, raised the question of how to identify critical impact areas with rising water tables, which delineates where groundwater begins to pool in deeper parts of the Earth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some areas, sea level rise and groundwater flooding cause that water table to rise, but the soil hasn’t formed into conditions to mark out water tables.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We run into the same problem with wetlands delineation; it requires vegetation inundation of </span><a href="https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/conservation-basics/natural-resource-concerns/soil/hydric-soils#:~:text=A%20hydric%20soil%20is%20a,conditions%20in%20the%20upper%20part." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hydric soils</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” Stiles said. “But in some of the newly created wetlands, because of sea level rise, the hydric soils haven&#8217;t formed yet. We have some tidal wetlands that are not tidal wetlands, because they are waiting for the hydric soils to form.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lance Gregory, director of the Virginia Department of Health’s Division of Onsite Water and Wastewater Services, acknowledged “there’d be a lot of difficulties in making that determination,” but that he was “open to ideas…that could be done consistently.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group is expected to meet again Aug. 22 to continue working on the initial ideas.</span></p>

The agency said 408 farmers in Virginia will receive a total of $28,451,840.</p>
<p>“While this financial assistance is not compensation for anyone’s losses or pain endured, it is an acknowledgement,” U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said last week in a call with reporters.</p>
<p>The payments are the result of a program — the Discrimination Financial Assistance Program — created by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 that was meant to aid farmers, ranchers and forest landowners. President Joe Biden said it was the result of his promise “to address this inequity when I became president.”</p>
<p>The USDA received more than 58,000 applications from people who claimed discrimination based on race, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, age, marital status, disability and retaliation for “civil rights activity.”</p>
<p>Vilsack could not immediately say what type of discrimination was most often indicated by the applicants, but the bulk of the payments went to farmers in southern states with higher percentages of Black residents.</p>

<p>The National Black Farmers Association, based in Baskerville, Va., has been a leading advocate for Black farmers for decades and was at the forefront of previous efforts for federal recognition and redress of discrimination African American farmers long faced.</p>
<p>John Boyd, Jr., a fourth generation Black farmer in Mecklenburg County who founded the organization 40 years ago, called the USDA&#8217;s $2 billion payout &#8220;historic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, a July 31 release from the NBFA and Boyd said, challenges persist for Black farmers, including &#8220;banks denying them access to operating funds and farm ownership loans, as well as recent allegations of racial discrimination by companies like John Deere.&#8221;</p>
<p>Payments <a href="https://22007apply.gov/award-distribution.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were awarded</a> to people in every state and three of its territories, but residents of Alabama and Mississippi alone received almost half of the money.</p>
<p>More than 43,000 people will be paid, Vilsack said. The payments range from $3,500 to $500,000, depending on the circumstances and effects of the discrimination.</p>
<p>The department could not immediately supply a summary of those claims, but Vilsack said the discrimination resulted in loan denials, loan delays, higher interest rates and an overall lack of assistance.</p>
<p>“We’ve made significant strides in breaking down barriers to access, and my hope is that people will begin to think differently about USDA, so that we can better serve all who want to participate in agriculture in the future,” Vilsack said.</p>
<p>Specifically, Vilsack said the department’s Farm Service Agency, which administers farm loans, now has a more diverse leadership and loan assessment processes that rely less on human discretion.</p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is the recipient of two federal grants to capture climate changing emissions, one focused on methane and another on promoting natural solutions to capture carbon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The funds, about $150 million, are from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Climate Pollution Reduction Grant program, created by the Inflation Reduction Act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nvestments such as this are paramount to ensuring communities across the region who are impacted the most have access to reduced climate and air pollution,&#8221; said EPA Mid-Atlantic Regional Administrator Adam Ortiz. “We need our partners to help us in tackling climate challenges.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s funding is funneled through the Department of Environmental Quality, which is primarily working with Virginia Energy to use about $99.9 million towards methane capture from mined lands, and the Department of Wildlife Resources, to use $50 million on the land preservation component. The awarding to DWR is also part of a collaborative effort with the state of North Carolina that received a total of $421 million, with about $47.2 million going to The Nature Conservancy’s operations in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DEQ said the state’s methane capture component could reduce 25 million tons of greenhouse gasses by 2050. The Nature Conservancy estimates about 28 million tons of GHGs — the same amount produced by about 6.6 million cars — will be captured between 2025 and 2050 through regional partnership.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These are intended to achieve immediate emission reductions in the short term,” said Tom Ballou, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">air data analysis &amp; planning </span>director<span style="font-weight: 400;"> at DEQ.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Minimizing methane</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About $80 million of the methane capture funding will boost efforts already underway by current mining operations and abandoned mined lands project developers  to remove the most potent greenhouse gas, which is 28 times more powerful than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea of capturing methane — which is released during active mining operations to relieve pressure during underground digging to prevent explosions, and that naturally emanates from closed down sites — has been </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/20/new-report-says-virginia-could-incentivize-methane-capture-from-coal-mines/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">discussed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Virginia for at least a couple years. The EPA lists nine projects in the coalfields region of Southwest Virginia that can include capturing the methane and turning it into natural gas and flaring, or burning it.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="QrYd2b89TH"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/20/new-report-says-virginia-could-incentivize-methane-capture-from-coal-mines/">New report says Virginia could incentivize methane capture from coal mines</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;New report says Virginia could incentivize methane capture from coal mines&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/20/new-report-says-virginia-could-incentivize-methane-capture-from-coal-mines/embed/#?secret=49rkzrk9Xu#?secret=QrYd2b89TH" data-secret="QrYd2b89TH" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental nonprofits have pushed back against using methane as an energy source for the broader electric grid, beyond manufacturers using it to power their operations. The groups say  converting methane to sellable natural gas would create a revenue stream for mining operations to continue and wouldn’t be a clean, zero-emissions source of electricity, like solar and wind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, with 80% of Vrignia’s coal being mined for ongoing metallurgical production of steel, the CPRG funding provides opportunities to “look at better ways” to mine, said Daniel Kestner, economic development manager at Virginia Energy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We know there&#8217;s a safety aspect around degassing those mines, as those workers are undergoing work, but also [an] opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create jobs in these communities that have been impacted by the downturn in the coal economy,” said Kestor, adding that requests for proposals to use the funding could go out early next year. “It&#8217;s a pretty lofty goal, but we think it can be achieved with the use of technology.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The remaining $20 million in grants for methane capture will go toward a potential of one to three projects at landfills in the central or Southwest Virginia regions to meet LIDAC requirements. One example of a landfill capturing methane is the Southeastern Public Service Authority landfill in Suffolk, which unveiled a $25 million renewable natural gas </span><a href="https://www.whro.org/2023-10-18/spsa-landfill-renewable-natural-gas-facility" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">facility</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year that collects and sells it as natural gas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A portion of the $20 million will also fund food waste prevention at 15 to 20 Virginia universities, to divert food sources that are typically thrown out, despite not having expired, from ever getting to landfills and emitting methane in the first place.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A more natural approach</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to funding that will go toward the Virginia Port Authority and a Virginia Native American tribe yet to be chosen, the Department of Wildlife and The Nature Conservationy are leading Virginia’s effort to sequester carbon using forests, wetlands and peat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To maintain wildlife habitat, DWR will  embark on eight projects that include shoring up about 6,000 acres of wetlands by installing breakwaters to reduce the flow of energy that can crash into and erode shorelines. Several animal species, including the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/30/frisky-little-songbird-needs-protection-from-sea-level-rise-environmental-group-tells-feds/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saltmarsh Sparrow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, use coastal wetlands to migrate around the Chesapeake Bay, explained Becky Gwynn, deputy director at DWR. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agency will contract workers to restore about 2,500 acres of forestland in the coastal and Eastern Shore regions by removing invasive plant species and growing the Atlantic White Cedar, a tree that has long been harvested for shingles production, prior to the wood pellet industry staking a claim in the region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was a win-win-win all around. It addresses clearly the overall goals of the grant program by facilitating natural carbon capture, but it also really is value-added and accelerates a lot of this important habitat enhancement and restoration,” said Gwynn. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Nature Conservancy, an international environmental nonprofit, is also setting out to acquire land and place development-blocking easements across about 36,000 acres of forestland in Southwest Virginia, including Warm Springs Mountain in the Allegheny Highlands. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TNC will also preserve Longleaf pine across 7,750 acres on the East Coast, and about 150 acres of tidal wetlands that contain peat, a dirt that can sequester twice the amount of carbon that forests can. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The effort involves an analysis from Duke University and a third-party, VERRA, to validate the carbon that is stored. The TNC projects will not produce carbon credits, which companies can purchase to offset their other operations that emit greenhouse gasses, but may not result in funding going back to those communities producing the credits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bettina Ring, Virginia state director at the TNC, touted her organization’s respect for local communities and its “shared vision” of partnership with other groups to reach sustainability goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our entire organization is watching this project, we’re really excited about it, knowing it&#8217;s a game changer for biodiversity.”</span></p>

<p>As global temperatures have risen, major sporting events like the Olympics and FIFA World Cup <a href="https://basis.org.uk/resource/rings-of-fire-2/" target="_blank">have had to adapt</a> to high heat and extreme storms to keep athletes and fans safe and allow the games to go on.</p>
<p>Olympic organizers have moved events such as marathons <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/paris-2024-summer-olympics-heat-records-athletes-risk/" target="_blank">to early mornings</a> and <a href="https://olympics.com/en/news/tokyo-2020-olympic-marathon-course-sapporo-finalised" target="_blank">even to cooler cities</a>. FIFA, the governing body for world soccer, pushed the 2022 Men’s World Cup back from its usual time in June to late November so it could be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/11/sports/soccer/fifa-world-cup-qatar.html" target="_blank">held in Qatar</a>.</p>
<figure class="align-center "><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>The heat risks and the environmental impact of major sporting events have led some people to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/16184742.2022.2096661" target="_blank">question whether these events</a> should be held at all. But as someone who studies sport management and sustainability in an area I coined “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1123/jsm.2019-0294" target="_blank">sport ecology</a>,” I believe that radical approach misses the benefits, including the Olympics’ ability to promote sustainable actions to the public worldwide.</p>
<h2>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How rising global heat affects the Olympics</h4>

	</h2>
<p>Sports have good reason for caring about sustainability: Climate change can put athletes’ and fans’ health at risk and even put the future of some sports in doubt.</p>
<p>Winter sports <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/13683500.2014.887664" target="_blank">face the greatest threats</a> from climate change as temperatures rise and precipitation changes, dramatically shortening winter sports seasons in many areas. In 2022, the Beijing Winter Games had to <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2022.944764" target="_blank">artificially create snow</a> so it could have ski runs at all. The <a href="https://olympics.com/ioc/news/future-host-commission-studying-landscape-of-winter-sport-with-a-view-to-the-olympic-winter-games-2030-and-beyond" target="_blank">International Olympic Committee has delayed its decision</a> to select Winter Games host cities for 2030 and beyond because of the uncertainty of winter sports.</p>

They also delayed competitions during the Games to avoid <a href="https://doi.org/10.1265/ehpm.21-00024" target="_blank">extreme heat</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/57980885" target="_blank">excessive rain</a>.</p>
<h2>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Olympic progress toward sustainability</h4>

	</h2>
<p>Any large event like the Olympics can produce vast carbon emissions through its construction, transportation needs and energy use.</p>
<p>That impact, and the risks it creates for sports and their athletes, are why sustainability has been <a href="https://stillmed.olympic.org/media/Document%20Library/OlympicOrg/Olympic-Studies-Centre/List-of-Resources/Official-Publications/Olympic-Charters/EN-1996-Olympic-Charter.pdf" target="_blank">a pillar of the Olympic charter</a> since 1996 and is a focus of its <a href="https://stillmed.olympics.com/media/Document%20Library/OlympicOrg/IOC/What-We-Do/Olympic-agenda/Olympic-Agenda-2020-5-15-recommendations.pdf" target="_blank">planning for the future</a>. In 2012, the London Olympics pioneered a new <a href="https://www.iso.org/news/2012/06/Ref1598.html" target="_blank">international certification standard</a>, ISO2012, which provides guidelines for any large event to make more sustainable choices, from construction to catering.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" id="NXfD9" class="tc-infographic-datawrapper" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/NXfD9/1/" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>The 2024 <a href="https://olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-receives-iso-20121-certification-for-sustainability-performance-at-corporate-events" target="_blank">Paris Games</a>, from July 26 to Aug. 11, and Paralympic Games, Aug. 28 to Sept. 8, are certified to the latest standard, and organizers are taking many steps to reduce their climate impact.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://medias.paris2024.org/uploads/2024/07/Paris2024-Sustainability-and-legacy-report.pdf" target="_blank">organizers plan</a> to power the events’ operations with <a href="https://olympics.com/en/paris-2024/our-commitments/the-environment/renewable-energy" target="_blank">100% renewable energy from wind and solar</a>. They are using existing venues when possible, had new ones built with low-carbon concrete and recycled materials, and brought in thousands of <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/culture/lean-green-paris-olympics" target="_blank">seats made of recycled plastic</a>.</p>
<p>All furniture and temporary buildings approved for the Games also must have a <a href="https://medias.paris2024.org/uploads/2024/07/Paris2024-Sustainability-and-legacy-report.pdf" target="_blank">contractually guaranteed second life</a>, rather than going into a landfill. All of the competition venues are on public transportation, allowing for fewer vehicles in the streets. Even the food is targeted for a 50% emissions cut compared with the average meal by increasing the use of plant-based foods. The Paralympics will use the same venues and housing in the weeks that follow.</p>
<figure class="align-center zoomable"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>That doesn’t mean the 2024 Olympics won’t have a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-021-00696-5" target="_blank">large carbon footprint</a>, however, particularly <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE8BB0C3/" target="_blank">as many spectators and athletes arrive by plane</a>. But the organizers are aiming for the <a href="https://medias.paris2024.org/uploads/2024/07/Paris2024-Sustainability-and-legacy-report.pdf" target="_blank">construction and operations emissions to be half</a> those of the London and Rio Games in 2012 and 2016.</p>

(Courtesy of Virginia Department of Forestry)</p><p>The Virginia Department of Forestry is changing how it warns people about a state fire safety law that makes burning anything before 4 p.m. illegal, by removing the physical burn ban signs along roadways and posting digital notices on the information highway of the internet, instead.</p>
<p>During the spring wildfire season each year Feb. 15 to April 30, the law forbids open air burning within 300 feet of the woods or dry grass which could carry fire to the woods, except between 4 p.m. and midnight. That information is printed on two-foot by three-foot metal signs posted along roadways statewide. Now, foresters are taking the signs down and spreading the word via informational posts on Facebook, X and the neighborhood chat forum Nextdoor.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s a very specific change in methods, but nothing to do with the overall mission or importance of the message,” said State Forester Rob Farrell.</p>
<p>The signs, which began coming down this spring, were first installed about 75 years ago: on one side, there are instructions in red lettering spelling out the periodic burn ban; on the other side are the words “Keep Virginia green,” in emerald letters.</p>
<p>Before the transition to digital messaging, every year on the first day of burn ban period, a local forrester from one of the department’s field offices needed to drive around to the signs, undo two bolts, flip the sign over to the red-lettered side, clean it and make sure it’s legible. On April 30, when the burn ban period ended, a forester flipped the sign back to the other side.</p>
<p>“Every DOF local office has a map in a file, and they have a little ‘X’ where each of their signs are, so they can help themselves to remember where all the signs are. Every year, a new forester will come to an area and have to go and find where all the signs are on February 15,” Farrell said. “A county could have a dozen signs, and then you have 100 in some localities across the state. It certainly could be over 1,000 of these signs around the state.”</p>
<p>All of that flipping takes time, which Farrell said “could be better spent assisting landowners, assisting loggers, doing all of the other work that our field staff do across the state.” The practice also presented safety concerns for the foresters, Farrell said.</p>
<p>“They&#8217;re flipping metal signs on the side of rural roads, which are getting busier and busier and busier, and traffic is going faster and faster.”</p>
<p>So, why does the spring burn ban lift at 4 p.m.?</p>
<p>“There&#8217;s nothing magical about four o&#8217;clock,” said Farrell. “You just got to pick a time, but [at] four o&#8217;clock, things are starting to turn in our favor. Temperatures are going down, humidity is coming up, and wind is a little bit lighter in the evening.”</p>
<p>The digital messaging also allows the department to use a more immediate, targeted approach to deliver messages to residents of areas whose fire risk is increasing.</p>
<p>“Frankly, I think we&#8217;re all used to driving by signs every day, and they may cease to get our attention as they used to,” said Greg Bilyeu, director of communications at the department. “Also, there&#8217;s often local burn bans that are put into effect by the localities. Those can change on a dime. We can share that via NextDoor and really push that right into the community that we need to.”</p>

<p>The change comes ahead of the fall fire season Oct. 15 to Nov. 30, and as Virginia encounters wildfires that ravage a greater number of acres. Nearly 20,000 acres went up in a blaze this <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/22/fires-have-consumed-thousands-of-acres-in-virginia-this-spring-that-could-be-a-good-thing-for-the-environment/">spring</a> in Virginia, while last <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/22/all-virginia-wildfires-except-matts-creek-contained-say-officials/">fall</a> saw 12,500 acres burned. Historically, the annual average of Virginia acres burned by wildfire had been about 9,500.</p>
<p>“That is the challenge we&#8217;re facing,” Farrell said. “There are more people in the way of these fires than ever before,” Farrell said.</p>
<p>Although they are a destructive and captivating force, forest management officials have said the blazes in Virginia’s wetter climate have not been as detrimental as those in western and northern parts of the continent <a href="https://washingtonstatestandard.com/2024/07/26/firefighters-in-oregon-battle-biggest-blaze-in-country-with-thousands-facing-evacuation-orders/" target="_blank">this year</a> and last year.</p>

<p>The department will keep taking the signs down but it may be a while before they can get them all.</p>
<p>“I will not be surprised that we&#8217;ll continue to find signs here and there around the state that haven&#8217;t been taken down yet,” Farrell said during a phone interview, as he gazed at one of the signs. “I was a forester for seven years, so I spent my time switching signs. I have a nostalgic connection to these signs as well.”</p>

(Getty Images) </p><p class="p1">Attorneys general in 25 states, including Virginia&#8217;s Jason Miyares, have sent an emergency appeal to the United States Supreme Court asking it to immediately halt a Biden administration rule that they say threatens to shutter the country’s remaining fleet of coal-fired power plants.</p>
<p class="p1">The emergency appeal to stay the Environmental Protection Agency’s plans to require strict greenhouse gas emissions standards is pending before Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts because the states say the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals is sitting on a number of lawsuits without a decision, and that more time is needed before implementing a decision about technologies like carbon capture and storage. Roberts, having appeal jurisdiction over the D.C. Circuit on what is commonly referred to as the “shadow docket,” could deny the request, send it along to the full court, or issue a brief temporary stay while the matter is further briefed on an expedited schedule.</p>
<p>“These new EPA regulations hinder American energy production, risking the reliability of our power grid and the livelihoods of countless workers,” said <span class="il">Miyares in a July 24 statement</span>. “We are seeking relief from the Supreme Court to ensure that American energy needs are met without jeopardizing economic stability.”</p>
<p>As The Mercury&#8217;s Charlie Paullin previously reported, the federal rules for the coal plants could come into play for the Clover Power Station that is co-owned by Old Dominion Electric Cooperative, the electricity supplier for the state’s more rural  electric cooperatives, and Dominion Energy, Virginia’s largest utility. Under the VCEA, the Clover plant is mandated to close by 2045, unless there’s a reliability concern.If it were to stay open up until then, it would need to adopt the carbon capture technology the federal rules are requiring that industry associations are challenging because of sequestration measures being in its nascent stage.&#8221;</p>

<p class="p1">The appeal, led by Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita and West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, said that the EPA has overstepped its authority, taking away Congress’ power, as it mandates greenhouse gas regulations that are impossible to meet because the technology either currently doesn’t exist, or would be so cost prohibitive that it would make using coal impossible.</p>
<p class="p1">The appeal to the nation’s highest court also says that because of future pollution targets, energy companies need to make investment and permitting decisions in advance and that the EPA cannot meet those timelines itself, risking millions of sunken or lost costs for public utilities that would be passed along to consumers.</p>
<p class="p1">The lawsuit said that the only way to keep coal-fired power plants open is through carbon capture and storage, but that technology has never been proven on an industrial scale, and furthermore the limited tests require heavy subsidies.</p>
<p class="p1">Attorneys argue that if the Biden administration’s rule is allowed to continue, it will mean that hundreds of megawatts will be forced offline, leading to power shortages during critical weather during the summer and winter.</p>
<p class="p1">“Among other things, the rule imposes inadequately demonstrated technologies on unworkable timeframes, effectively squeezing plants into retirement,” the appeal said. “Relatedly, it causes serious immediate harms by either pushing plants into binding commitments for retirement or pressing them to start spending large sums to hit compliance dates.”</p>
<p class="p1">The rule would force 90% of carbon dioxide from the plants to be captured and stored by 2032 and 40% of the plants to establish co-firing with natural gas by 2030.</p>
<p class="p1">“(The rules) are really a backdoor avenue to forcing coal plants out of existence — a major question that no clear congressional authority permits. The rule cannot stand,” the legal brief said.</p>
<h4 class="editorialSubhed">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Carbon capture and storage</h4>

	</h4>
<p class="p1">Many states have invested in the promise of carbon capture and storage as one way to mitigate the greenhouse gases produced by burning coal. The idea is to capture the flue gas and then pipe it either to underground storage or sell it, thereby reducing the amount of greenhouse gases released into the environment.</p>
<p class="p1">However, the states argue that even though the EPA has adopted standards and rules that embrace the carbon capture and storage technology, the technology has not been proven successful or economically feasible.</p>
<p class="p1">“The EPA recites a list of CCS projects and operations, saying there are ‘at least 15 operating CCS projects in the U.S., and another 121 that are under construction or in advanced stages of development,’ but this recitation is quantity over quality,” the brief said. “Nearly all named CCS operations are from the industrial rather than the energy sector — an important difference because the energy sector has unique demands like reliability. These facilities are all a fraction of the size of power-generating units; none of them are close to scale.”</p>
<p class="p1">Furthermore, the states warn that new power plants that have carbon capture systems will more than double the construction costs as well as increase operational costs by 35%.</p>
<p class="p1">“This expense could double energy prices,” the states warn. “Installing CCS reduces plants’ sellable energy by up to 36% — instantly slashing plants’ ongoing profitability.”</p>
<p class="p1">The emergency appeal also said that the carbon capture technology will require plant owners to buy more fuel, increasing the cost to run a plant, and that the start-up times will be affected. They claim the new units will have a hard time operating at low loads.</p>
<p class="p1">“The National Center for Carbon Capture estimates the first CCS demonstration projects won’t go online until 2030 to 2032,” the legal filing said.</p>
<p class="p1">Carbon-capture technology would also call for thousands of miles of pipeline to transport the carbon for storage or usage. Citing a survey by Princeton, it estimates that 66,000 miles of pipeline are needed, while the EPA said it estimates 5,000 miles. Using the more conservative EPA estimates, the states point out that power companies would have to invest more than $12.5 billion for the pipelines.</p>
<p class="p1">Finally, the states question the market for carbon dioxide generated from the power plants. For example, they note that one of the largest uses for captured carbon dioxide is in enhanced oil recovery, but many states and counties have restrictions on that. According to the briefs, 95% of the captured carbon market is for enhanced oil recovery, leading the states to question if the market for the product even exists.</p>
<p class="p1">“The EPA has no idea how strong that demand is,” the lawsuit said. “It seems imprudent to suppose that many plants will be able to sell carbon. But the sequestration is not much better.”</p>
<p class="p1">The appeal said that even the EPA has said that 19 states have no underground storage capacity or very little.</p>
<h4 class="editorialSubhed">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Time is running out</h4>

<p class="p1">Though many of the goals and targets have deadlines reaching years into the future, the states’ attorneys general say that the permitting, planning and investment needed to comply with the EPA’s rules will take years, and cost states millions (the EPA often delegates regulation and enforcement of federal rules to the states).</p>
<p class="p1">In the lawsuit, they say that complying with the rule and enforcing it will eat up staff time on a task that is scientifically as well as economically impossible. Furthermore, the states will have no ability to recover the costs, and any costs public utilities will sink into the mandate could be passed along to consumers.</p>
<p class="p1">“It forces producers to decide between launching a Hail Mary bid to squeak by under a painful new regime or just bowing out of the game entirely,” the attorneys general conclude.</p>
<p class="p1">The EPA did not comment prior to publication of this story.</p>

(Photo by Scott Bauer/USDA Agricultural Research Service)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is on track to implement updated </span><a href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/ViewXML.cfm?textid=18507" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rules</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for animal waste created by certain farming operations, despite disagreement on how to regulate older earthen lagoons that pose a greater risk of releasing pollutants into groundwater.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wednesday, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin </span><a href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/viewstage.cfm?stageid=10398&amp;display=documents" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">approved</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the regulation changes for farmers who confine cows, pigs and more for 45 days or more within a year for dairy, eggs and meat production, as well as slaughtering. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s approval comes after the citizen-member State Water Control Board OK’d at a June 25 meeting the general permit for 108 animal feed operations in the state, meaning the rules in the one permit applies to all the operations. The current general permit is set to expire Nov. 15, so the revisions will take effect Nov. 16 for another 10-year period. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waste from the animals can be stored in containers, concrete structures, or earthen lagoons, which are ponds of manure that use natural and chemical processes to treat it. The operators </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/admincode/title9/agency25/chapter192/section20/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">can</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> treat the waste, recycle it or apply to their land as compost, among other purposes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rules are part of the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality’s program to regulate pollution discharges to prevent harm to the environment. One concern with animal waste is a potential to release nitrogen into groundwater that can feed into waterways leading to the Chesapeake Bay, which state and federal partners are struggling to clean up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are focused on nitrogen discharges to groundwater, but bacteria would also be of concern,” said Patrick Fanning, Virginia staff attorney with the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, in an email to the Mercury.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are also new requirements for nutrient management plans, an analysis for nitrogen and tools to determine a 100-year flood plain, or areas where groundwater can get inundated following heavy rain from intense storms likely to happen once every century and can lead to more groundwater connections that may flow up to the surface.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some farmers had raised concerns over costs to any changes, said Betsy Bowles, DEQ animal feeding operations inspector. But other farmers were in support of the new rules, which incorporate previously less enforceable guidance on conditions for closing a waste storage device. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After receiving feedback from farmers and environmental groups, which primarily wanted more monitoring, DEQ didn’t make any changes to the rules, which were presented to the public in their final form for the first time at the June 25 meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Farm Bureau spoke at that meeting in support of the rules. The only other commenter, Fanning, with the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, called DEQ’s decision to not make one change, &#8220;a bad take and a bad interpretation of the law.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bay Foundation, on behalf of several other organizations, submitted 10 requests, including requiring one groundwater monitor above and two groundwater monitors below earthen lagoons that were made before 1998. Those lagoons were grandfathered into regulations, and made without the more stringent requirements in place now, Fanning said, meaning “these are the lagoons that are most likely to be discharging to groundwater.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bowle’s said DEQ interpreted the law to mean that monitoring can only be required if there is already monitoring in place, Bowles added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our understanding of the law, for being able to require more groundwater monitoring is if they are already monitoring but there is a change that we need to increase from one every three years to more frequent,” Bowles said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Fanning, in his comments to the board said DEQ’s interpretation “is simply not true,” pointing out the </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title62.1/chapter3.1/section62.1-44.17:1/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> states DEQ “may include in the permit or nutrient management plan more frequent or additional monitoring of waste, soils or groundwater as required to protect state waters.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, he added: “How would DEQ ever know if there is a problem if they’re not requiring monitoring?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fanning sought guidance from the Attorney General’s office, but Ross Phillips, senior assistant attorney in the OAG, sided with DEQ, and certified the rules.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tony Banks, senior assistant director of the agriculture, development and innovation department with the Virginia Farm Bureau, said in an interview with the Mercury, his organization is supportive of DEQ’s interpretation of the law and that the older lagoons were built to engineering standards of the time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If we had an issue that would’ve become apparent at this point,” Banks said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DEQ spokeswoman Irina Calos added the agency is “unaware of any complete lagoon failures at permitted farms in Virginia.” One time, during the 2004 Hurricane Gaston, floodwaters overtopped a lagoon that was in compliance with the permit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In general, DEQ does visual site inspections of waste storage structures to include lagoons every three years but can and does inspect sites more frequently as needed,” Calos said, adding that if there are concerns with noncompliance DEQ can require a permittee to obtain an individual permit with groundwater monitoring requirements.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The College of William &amp; Mary announced Wednesday it received the gift from philanthropist Jane Batten to rename its School of Marine Science at the Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences to the Batten School of Coastal &amp; Marine Sciences and bolster its resources to study a range of topics including sea level rise, increased storm intensity, loss of agricultural land and impaired water quality, issues that especially impact Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This gift propels us forward toward great promise and progress,” Batten said in a statement. “I am confident that this will spark significant change, building resilience in coastal communities in the Commonwealth and across the globe for generations to come.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Award will fund climate change, coastal resilience education</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s tidewater region, consisting of wetlands, marshes and seawater environments has continuously experienced some of the highest </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2023/04/05/for-the-fifth-year-in-a-row-norfolk-takes-the-top-spot-for-sea-level-rise-on-the-east-coast/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of sea level rise along the East Coast, at about .2 inches per year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The overhauled school would join a collection of several other programs around the county offering marine science disciplines, but would provide a unique focus on the impact of climate change impacting coastal communities with its location on the York River in Gloucester Point, Virginia, the university says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, the school offers a minor, master’s degree and two research degrees in the discipline that </span><a href="https://www.vims.edu/academics/wm_undergrad/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">studies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> marine ecosystems and what shapes them. In May, William &amp; Mary’s Board of Visitors approved creating an undergraduate marine science degree that is awaiting approval from the State Council for Higher Education in Virginia and would be offered at the Batten school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dean of the Batten School and Director of VIMS Derek Aday said in a statement the school has a “geographical advantage, expertise advantage and historical presence in this area.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We also have the breadth and depth in coastal and marine systems to allow us to take on very significant challenges that other places aren’t equipped for,” said Aday. “With this unprecedented gift, we will not only advance critical research and inform policy but also train the next generation of scientists, thought leaders and engaged citizens, preparing them to navigate the complexities of global change in this century.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The funding will enable “infrastructure” improvements at the VIMS campus by constructing an outreach and education center alongside previously laid plans to build a new Chesapeake Bay </span><a href="https://www.vims.edu/newsandevents/topstories/2022/new_research_building.php" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hall</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a sea water lab. The monies would also go toward attracting scientists, researchers and students, and creating both new positions and public and private partners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The improvements made to the school, it says, will build on the university’s Vision 2026 water initiative, which included </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/04/07/william-mary-unveils-details-of-plan-to-replace-virginia-coastal-policy-center/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unveiling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the policy-focused Virginia Coastal Resilience Collaborative, formerly known as the Virginia Coastal Policy Center before its director resigned, last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is “no specific link between the gift and the Virginia Coastal Resilience Collaborative,” Aday said, but the gift “does strengthen our focus on coastal science, and ensures that we will be at the forefront of educating leaders equipped to take on future challenges related to coastal resilience in the face of global change.”</span></p>

Amazon owns more data centers here than anyone else, and data center energy demand is driving Dominion Energy Virginia’s plan to renege on its climate commitments, keep dirty coal plants online and build expensive new gas plants and transmission lines.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, Amazon’s announcement is so full of asterisks it looks like a starry night. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start with the good news. Amazon’s claim that it has purchased enough renewable energy to “match” its energy use is likely true, though its </span><a href="https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/2023-sustainability-report.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sustainability report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> doesn’t reveal essential details like how much energy the company uses. Amazon also says it is the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy in the world, an impressive achievement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of that renewable energy is in Virginia, so it is reasonable to say it serves the company’s data centers here. A map on Amazon’s </span><a href="https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/climate-solutions/carbon-free-energy?energyType=true" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows the company has invested in 19 solar farms in Virginia, with a capacity that totals around 1,386 MW  – about a quarter of all </span><a href="https://www.seia.org/state-solar-policy/virginia-solar" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">solar installed in Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to date. That’s terrific. If every company operating in Virginia did as much, we’d be rolling in solar, figuratively speaking. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what am I complaining about? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One problem is that the energy appetite of Amazon’s data centers in Virginia far outstrips the output of all of its solar farms here. The other problem is that producing renewable energy in the middle of the day can only very loosely be said to “match” energy used at other times of the day and night. Meeting energy demand on a 24/7 basis is harder, and Amazon isn’t even trying. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start with the numbers. Because the sun doesn’t shine all the time, a large solar array produces, on average, 22-25% of what it produces on a cloudless day at noon. (That percentage is known as the facility’s capacity factor.) At a 25% capacity factor, Amazon’s 1,386 MW worth of solar panels produce enough electricity to “match” about 347 MW of demand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon keeps its energy demand in Virginia a secret, but we can be pretty sure its </span><a href="https://baxtel.com/data-center/virginia" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">110 data centers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> here use way more than that. A 2019 </span><a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/news/greenpeace-finds-amazon-breaking-commitment-to-power-cloud-with-100-renewable-energy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greenpeace report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> estimated Amazon’s Virginia data center demand at 1,700 MW in operation or under construction, an amount that would call for 6,800 MW of solar. Amazon rejected Greenpeace’s estimate at the time, but it didn’t supply a better one. </span><a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/environment/data-centers-virginia-amazon-environment/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More recent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> estimates suggest Amazon’s energy appetite in Virginia is on its way to 2,700 MW, enough to require the output of around 11,000 MW of solar.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luckily for us, Virginia is part of </span><a href="https://www.pjm.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PJM</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a regional transmission grid that covers all or parts of 13 states plus Washington, D.C. Generation sources located anywhere in the region can serve a Virginia customer, and Amazon’s map shows it has utility solar and wind projects in several PJM states. By my count, these add up to as much as 4,000 MW of additional renewable energy that could be allocated to Virginia data centers, if Amazon had no other operations in those states that it wanted to power. (Which, however, it does.)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adding together its solar in Virginia and elsewhere in PJM still leaves Amazon short of what it likely needs. So, if the company is correct that it has secured enough renewable energy to match all of its demand, a lot of those facilities must be in other regions or other countries. Yet the climate benefit of Amazon’s solar farms in (for example) Spain, which gets </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/spains-share-electricity-generated-renewables-rose-508-2023-2023-12-19/#:~:text=MADRID%2C%20Dec%2019%20(Reuters),Teresa%20Ribera%20said%20on%20Tuesday." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 50%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of its electricity from renewable energy, is significantly less than the climate benefit of solar in PJM, where the percentage of wind and solar combined still hangs in the </span><a href="https://www.monitoringanalytics.com/reports/Market_Messages/Messages/2022-som-pjm-press-release.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">single digits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will – almost – give Amazon a pass on this point. PJM has been so </span><a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/pjm-interconnection-queue-solar-battery-gas-columbia-report/715620/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">appallingly slow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to approve new generation that Amazon could well have as many projects in the “queue” as online. PJM claims it will catch up in the next year and a half, and when that happens, perhaps Amazon won’t feel the need to obfuscate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if Amazon were “matching” all its energy needs with wind and solar in PJM, though, it’s the second problem that troubles me more. Building solar and wind is cheap; Amazon very likely makes a profit on it. Actually ensuring renewable energy provides all the juice for the company’s operations every hour of every day, on the other hand, would require a heck of a lot of expensive energy storage. And Amazon is not doing that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without energy storage, solar delivers electricity only while the sun is shining. The rest of the time, Amazon’s data centers run on whatever resource mix the local utility uses. In both Virginia and PJM’s territory, fossil fuels make up the great majority of the mix. Building more Amazon data centers in Virginia increases the burning of fossil fuels, causing more pollution and raising costs that are borne by the rest of us. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The self-styled climate hero turns out to be a climate parasite, harming people to make itself look good.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Combining renewable energy with storage to achieve true carbon neutrality isn’t prohibitively expensive. Other leading tech companies seem to be making that extra effort, with Google notable for its </span><a href="https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/cleanenergy/#:~:text=Now%2C%20as%20we%20enter%20our,every%20grid%20where%20we%20operate." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">commitment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to meeting its energy demand with renewable energy and storage on a 24/7 basis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon’s failure to rise to this challenge explains why, in spite of its massive investments in wind and solar, the company’s carbon footprint actually</span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/10/24195707/amazons-carbon-emissions-fell-last-year" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rose by 34%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> since the launch of its Climate Pledge in 2019, when it set a target of net zero carbon emissions by 2040. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That explains why, a year ago, the </span><a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Science Based Targets initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a U.N.-backed organization that monitors corporate net-zero plans, removed Amazon from a list of companies taking action on climate goals. According to </span><a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-08-14/amazon-carbon-emissions-climate-change#:~:text=Amazon%20is%20removed%20from%20key,up%20about%2040%25%20since%202019." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">press reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Amazon failed “to implement its commitment to set a credible target for reducing carbon emissions.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among those least impressed with the company’s efforts are its own workers. Last year, Amazon Employees for Climate Justice </span><a href="https://amazonemployees4climatejustice.medium.com/amazon-is-failing-its-own-climate-pledge-c6ff60fceccd" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accused the company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of failing in its climate commitments, and the group released its own report this month alleging </span><a href="https://techxplore.com/news/2024-07-years-amazon-climate-pledge-workers.html#:~:text=Amazon%20Employees%20for%20Climate%20Justice%20said%20in%20its%20report%20that,other%20%22dirty%22%20energy%20sources." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple climate failures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including using “creative accounting” to inflate its achievements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Virginia is serious about meeting the climate challenge, we can’t blindly accept rosy claims from corporations whose central goal is not sustainability, but growth. Data centers whose energy demand isn’t met on a 24/7 basis from zero-carbon sources located on the same grid are not part of the climate solution, they are part of the problem. And currently, Amazon’s data centers are making the problem worse.</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, the Southern Environmental Law Center filed a petition with federal regulators that raises pollution concerns stemming from Virginia&#8217;s issuance of an air permit to an AdvanSix Resins and Chemicals manufacturing plant in the city of Hopewell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On July 19, the SELC filed the </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2024-07/advansix-petition_7-19-24.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">petition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on behalf of several other environmental groups including the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mothers Out Front, the Sierra Club, Falls of the James Group and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Interfaith Power &amp; Light.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The petition highlights what the groups say is a lack of information on the facility’s emissions and barriers to public involvement in the process to issue a <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/50232-106-AdvanSix-Title-V-Renewal-final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/50232-106-AdvanSix-Title-V-Renewal-final.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1721841945290000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3M63_6Mc97Qm4xdGl2UZf5">Title V air permit.</a> A Title V air <a href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/GetFile.cfm?File=C:/TownHall/docroot/GuidanceDocs/440/GDoc_DEQ_2183_v11.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/GetFile.cfm?File%3DC:/TownHall/docroot/GuidanceDocs/440/GDoc_DEQ_2183_v11.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1721841945290000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0bzLiSyt5KwLdREsprv8Uo">permit</a> is used for facilities with the potential to emit pollutants beyond state limits, and allows facilities to consolidate existing permit documents, regulators to evaluate reporting and the public to provide input.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Considering the amount of pollution that this plant emits into the surrounding community, the public should have had access to the information it needs to ensure that permit is sufficiently protective,” SELC staff attorney Patrick Anderson said in a statement. “Our air pollution laws and environmental justice require more than this permitting process provided.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AdvanSix is a plastics maker with manufacturing facilities in the Virginia cities of Hopewell, and Portsmouth and Chesterfield County and outside the state in Pennsylvania and Alabama. The Hopewell facility produces ammonium sulfate for fertilizer and caprolactam for several products, including carpets. The </span><a href="https://www.advansix.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AdvanSix-2023-Sustainability-Report.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has reported emitting nitrogen oxides, sulfuric oxides, volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, particulate matter and hazardous air pollutants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1974, the facility in Hopewell that became an AdvanSix operation was responsible for a Kepone incident, which released the toxic insecticide into the James River that feeds into the Chesapeake Bay. More recently, the facility has been found to have 66 violations under both the federal Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, according to reporting from the </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/business/hopewell-advansix-honeywell-allied-chemicals-epa-pollution/article_b986e9a6-c994-11ed-a02c-4f9e79a157db.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond Times-Dispatch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The petition states that a lack of specific emission data makes it difficult for the public to review the draft air permit, and that there’s a lack of effective monitoring requirements. DEQ also decided </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/advansix-hopewell-chemical-plant-permit-deq-kepone/article_37bbb50c-e20f-11ee-a833-8fab48b90264.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to hold a public hearing about the facility’s permit, despite requests and comments from the public to do so, the petition states. According to the EPA’s </span><a href="https://ejscreen.epa.gov/mapper/ejscreen_SOE.aspx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EJ Screen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a tool for determining the socioeconomic profile of areas, 48% of the people who live there are considered low-income and 57% are people of color. </span></p>
<p>According to a March 26 <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AdvanSix-TV-Public-Hearing-Memo-final-PRO-50232.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AdvanSix-TV-Public-Hearing-Memo-final-PRO-50232.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1721841945290000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2ZNuFjyoNp8Ug3HnVZPUro">memo</a> from DEQ in response to comments previously submitted by the SELC, this issuance of the permit, &#8220;does not result in an increase in emissions or allow any new impacts on the Hopewell Community,&#8221; and that &#8220;extensive [potential to emit] calculations are not necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>DEQ sent an email notification of the public comment period for the Title V air permit to people who signed up for a public meeting over a water permit for the facility in September 2023, the memo adds. Since the permit would not affect or alter the facility&#8217;s existing permits or operational requirements including emission limits, &#8220;DEQ believes that additional public engagement pursuant to [the Virginia Environmental Justice Act] is not required and would not be beneficial at this time,&#8221; the memo also stated. Criteria to hold a public hearing had not been met, the memo continued.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AdvanSix, in a statement, said it wants to maintain  “an engaged and transparent working relationship” with community members, and state and federal regulators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Throughout the regulatory review process, AdvanSix made all emission data from the Hopewell facility available to the DEQ,” read the statement, which also stated data is publicly available with the EPA. “The air emission limits for the regulated emission units are listed in the permit along with monitoring equipment, which the DEQ makes available for the public to view.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SELC’s petition asks the EPA to object to the permit and direct DEQ to make information available and offer a new opportunity for public comments. The federal agency has 60 days to respond to the petition.  DEQ spokeswoman Irina Calos said this is the first time one of the agency&#8217;s Title V permits has been appealed to the EPA. Permit documents, Calos said, are &#8220;part of the record, and as such, they are available upon request.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DEQ is also reviewing what has been deemed a “controversial permit” under Virginia Pollution Discharge Elimination System </span><a href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/GetFile.cfm?File=meeting%5C103%5C39951%5CAgenda_DEQ_39951_v4.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">regulations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the Hopewell facility that would be in effect for a period of five years. Approval is expected later this year, after the company agreed to speed up the timelines for compliance as environmental groups raised concerns over the length of time the facility would have initially been given and several other issues.</span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Supreme Court’s recent decision to overturn the Chevron doctrine could impact environmental protections in Virginia — or not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the exact implications are unclear, attorneys with environmental organizations say the overturning could influence Virginia’s tailpipe emissions, but rules around keeping waterways clean appear to be on firmer ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s no question you&#8217;re going to see more industry group challenges,” said Trip Pollard, a senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The doctrine</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chevron doctrine stems from a ruling that’s been in place for decades and gives deference to agencies to interpret laws as they see fit when writing regulations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Last month, SCOTUS overturned that ruling by saying when a law doesn’t clearly delineate authority, it’s up to the courts to decide how to interpret its meaning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course, when faced with a statutory ambiguity in such a case, the ambiguity is not a delegation to anybody, and a court is not somehow relieved of its obligation to independently interpret the statute,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority opinion.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Tailpipe emissions</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the environmental front, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s federal tailpipe emissions standards, expected to apply to Virginia next year, are one example of how protections could change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia was set to follow California’s tailpipe regulations after Democrats passed a law in 2021 tying the state to those standards, which are stricter than the federal rules. But in </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/05/youngkin-says-virginia-wont-follow-californias-clean-car-standards-anymore/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">June</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin and Attorney General Jason Miyares announced that Virginia will revert back to the federal regulations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both the federal and California rules aim to cut down on tailpipe emissions by transitioning drivers to use electric vehicles, but environmental groups have said California’s faster pace of transition was needed to combate change. Republicans have pushed back against the transition because of the cost and lack of charging infrastructure concerns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal rules could be scaled back even more though with a pending lawsuit against them, and Pollard said that the removal of the Chevron doctrine impact is “immediate.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview with </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/biden-tailpipe-emission-rules-shakier-ground-after-supreme-court-ruling-2024-07-01/#:~:text=In%20a%20decision%20released%20on,like%20the%20Clean%20Air%20Act." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, David Pettit, senior attorney for climate and energy with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said challengers will argue the EPA, “did not have the legal ability to decide that the Clean Air Act covers [greenhouse gas] emissions from mobile sources, because it doesn&#8217;t say that in the Clean Air Act.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Water protections</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal legislation on protecting waterways is the Clean Water Act, which gives Virginia the authority to administer regulations alongside its own laws.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s unclear how the authority </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/compliance/memorandum-agreements-between-epa-and-states-authorized-implement-national-pollutant" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">delegated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Virginia under the CWA may be impacted without the Chevron doctrine, said Patrick Fanning, Virginia staff attorney with the Chesapeake Bay Foundation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But one way the CWA applies to Virginia is through enforcement of total daily maximum loads (TMDLS) or plans to clean up polluted waterways. The </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2020/01/22/why-stormwater-poses-an-increasing-challenge-for-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TMDLS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are seen as crucial components toward cleaning up rivers and streams that feed into the plagued Chesapeake Bay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Clean Water Act clearly states that once a waterway is listed as impaired, the EPA is able to impose clean up requirements, Fanning added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course there’s less specificity in the Clean Water Act than in the TMDL regulations, but the authority to do that is clear in the Clean Water Act,” Fanning said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, Virginia has its own State Water Control </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodepopularnames/state-water-control-law/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is intended to be consistent with the federal laws, but doesn’t appear to be in jeopardy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two previous cases in Virginia, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manassas Autocars, Inc., v. Couch and Commonwealth v. American Radiator &amp; Standard Sanitary Corp. in. 1960,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> give  deference to DEQ to impose regulations from that law through the rulemaking process, Fanning added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Supreme Court of Virginia basically said construction of statutes by public officials, the state agencies that are charged with administering them, is entitled to deference from the court,” Fanning said, while referencing the 1960 case.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Future changes</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result of the removal of the Chevron doctrine, Pollard and Fanning say future federal laws will likely have specific stipulations, which may pose a challenge given Congress’ difficulty to pass a bill in general. Also, including specific regulations for toxic emissions limits may be hard if the level of toxic emissions is unknown</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When congress passes something they don’t and can’t spell out every detail,” Pollard said. “That’s why we have these agencies with expertise in particular subject matter. They have their process for public input.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of legal challenges to regulations could also skyrocket, because a six-year statute of limitations was also changed with the loss of the Chevron doctrine. Previously, new rules could only be challenged within six years of their adoption. But now, a new business entity may be able to challenge a regulation that was crafted more than six years prior.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think it creates a lot of uncertainty about things that had otherwise been well settled,” said Fanning. </span></p>

Glenn Youngkin speaks in Virginia Beach Friday, July 18, 2024 with Virginia Manufacturers Association Brett Vassey sitting to his left. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Friday leaned into his All-of-the-Above energy plan that calls for continued use of natural gas, despite scientists stating human use of fossil fuels is causing climate change’s increasingly intense storms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We need more gas. We need more solar and wind and we need nuclear and we are going to lead the nation here and that is going to be a wonderful thing to see,” Youngkin said. “I get frustrated by people who talk about ‘either-ors.’ Small minded people, in my mind, constantly drive us into the ‘either-or. We can either do this or do that.’ I firmly reject that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s comments came during a speech at the third annual Virginia Energy Summit, sponsored largely by gas companies, in Virginia Beach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the event, Youngkin’s speech was presented to the public as an update to his energy plan, released in October 2022. State </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title45.2/chapter17/article4/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> dictates a new plan needs to be released every four years, with updates coming by Oct. 1 in the third year of a governor’s term. No formal update was provided at Friday’s event, but one is expected in the coming weeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Governor’s revision to the 2022 Energy Plan will reiterate the vision he outlined two years ago and chart a path forward for Virginia to meet the unprecedented needs of Virginia&#8217;s power economy,” said spokeswoman Macaulay Porter in a statement, while touting the state’s economic activity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The speech came after Youngkin, previously discussed as a former vice presidential candidate, regained national attention this week by speaking at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It’s not clear if Youngkin is continuing to pursue any higher office, but in the same time period North Dakota governor, </span><a href="https://northdakotamonitor.com/2024/07/17/burgum-emphasizes-energy-dominance-during-convention-speech/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greg Burgum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has been floated as a potential appointee to an energy position within the administration of Republican presidential nominee Donald J. Trump, if he were to win.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s support for natural gas is a familiar message, recently shared in Louisiana with a suite of other Republican governors who </span><a href="https://lailluminator.com/2024/06/03/republican-governors-energy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">attacked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the energy policy of current Democratic President Joe Biden, who is also the presumed Democratic nominee for president. Biden has reiterated his commitment to the race, despite mounting calls for him to step aside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin unveiled his first energy </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/10/04/youngkins-energy-plan-calls-for-reevaluation-of-clean-economy-act/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2022, which calls for using natural gas, nuclear and a revaluation of the Virginia Clean Economy Act, the 2020 landmark law that seeks to decarbonize the state’s electric grid by mid-century. His  plan also called for restoring authority to the State Corporation Commission to adjust rates, such as reducing rate adjustment clauses, or the fees tacked on to bills so Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power Company can recover costs for generation sources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental and ratepayer advocates criticized his  plan, saying it&#8217;s unrealistic because it incorporated unproven technologies and inaccurately attributed electric bill increases to renewable energy sources that are needed to combat climate change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislatively, Youngkin’s negotiations were instrumental in providing ratepayer protections, and restoring authority to the SCC to set rates as it sees fit, in </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/02/25/general-assembly-deal-sets-dominion-profits-for-two-years-while-overhauling-regulatory-system/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Dominion initially introduced to increase its profits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But critics also point to his desire to leave the California clean car standards, which aims to transition drivers to electric vehicles, and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a market that requires electricity producers to purchase allowances for each short ton of carbon they emit. The proceeds from those allowances had led to almost $800 million in revenue being returned to the state for flood resiliency and energy efficiency programs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m a conservationist,” said Youngkin, who told the Associated Press in 2022 he thinks climate change is a threat. “We have done more investing in our last two-and-a-half years in promoting the long-term interests of the Chesapeake Bay and rivers and streams and air quality in the commonwealth of Virginia than any other administration in the history of the state, in my view.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walton Shepherd, Virginia policy director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said after the speech that Youngkin&#8217;s “refusal to bring even a single practical idea for tackling Virginia&#8217;s catastrophic climate change, and instead doing his best to ensure Virginia does nothing at all about it, is the epitome of narrow minded hyperpartisanship.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lee Francis, deputy director with the Virginia League of Conservation Voters, responded to Youngkin’s speech by saying “It’s bold to call people who are working to solve our largest environmental threat — climate change — ‘small minded.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“‘Small minded’ is pretending this isn’t a problem,” Francis added. “I’m glad Youngkin thinks he’s a conservationist. Maybe he’ll start to act like one one of these days.”</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chesterfield County has denied an appeal to overturn a land use decision for Dominion&#8217;s proposed natural gas plant, but community members </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">say they aren’t giving up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friends of Chesterfield, the group fighting the project, was appealing the county administrator’s determination that a natural gas plant at Dominion’s old coal-fired Chesterfield Power Station on Coxendale Road would comply with local zoning requirements because of a 2010 conditional use permit that allows an electric power plant to go there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion initially proposed the 1,000 megawatt natural gas peaker plant, called the Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center, for the James River Industrial Park on Battery Brooke Parkway, but began looking into using the Chesterfield Power Station as part of its due diligence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That diligence includes evaluating existing transmission infrastructure at the Coxendale Road site and two natural gas combustion turbines that remain after the utility </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/weather/dominion-to-deactivate-last-2-coal-units-in-chesterfield/article_55180370-fbc0-11ed-af93-4b12c6d63f68.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">retired</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the coal units there. The retired coal units also would need to be </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">decommissioned and demolished, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">said Dominion spokesperson Jeremy Slayton.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friends of Chesterfield had argued that the conditional use permit relied on circumstances for the former coal plant that are different from what the new plant may consist of. They also argued the new plant could potentially need 170-foot high smokestacks, which would be 20 feet above the county’s 150 foot height limit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In denying the appeal, the Chesterfield County Board of Zoning Appeals <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/July-8-BZA-appeal-denial.pdf">wrote</a> without a site plan for the former coal plant site being submitted, “the actual height of the proposed smokestacks is speculative.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friends of Chesterfield see that statement as a victory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By its own admission, the county&#8217;s position that the Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center is consistent with applicable local ordinances is based on zero project specifics,” said Glen Besa, chairperson of the Friends of Chesterfield. ”As we consider future legal moves, Friends of Chesterfield will continue to push for a public hearing and a formal decision from the Board of Supervisors on the suitability of the project.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The local approvals are needed as part of the air permit approval process with the Department of Environmental Quality, which is currently under <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=39340">review</a>, and that process has provided Friends of Chesterfield with an ally.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Southern Environmental Law Center sent DEQ <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SELC-June-14-letter-to-DEQ.pdf">letter</a> stating the zoning approval for the former coal site shouldn’t apply to the air permit application Dominion has submitted because the utility’s request is for a different site, though the two are adjacent to each other. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview, SELC Staff Attorney Rachel James said applying the local zoning compliance and site suitability determinations for an air permit application at the former coal plant site that hasn’t been submitted yet would be “premature,” since no specifics of what may constitute the plant, such as the height of the smoke stacks that determine how emissions impact the immediate surrounding community, are known.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can’t consider that if you don’t know what it is,” James said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to a question about that concern, DEQ spokeswoman Irina Calos said, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoning compliance and a site suitability determination are required components of a complete air permit application.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If necessary, there may be a need to remodel the air permit for a different site,” Calos also said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion is proposing the natural gas plant alongside a suite of renewable sources as part of its latest integrated resource plan, a non-binding long term plan to meet future energy demands, which are expected to grow by 5% each year for the next 15 years because of data center development. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plant would fire during peak demand for electricity, giving it the “peaker plant” name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the state follows the Virginia Clean Economy Act, a 2020 landmark law seeking to decarbonize the grid by mid-century, a provision allows Dominion to ask its regulators, the State Corporation Commission, to keep a fossil fuel generation source online out of concern to reliably provide power to the grid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don’t have an exact timeframe, but we will make a decision soon,” Slayton said.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time is of the essence.”</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><em>This is Part 3 </em><em>of a three-part series on efforts to develop on abandoned mine lands in Southwest Virginia. Read Part 1 <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/01/bipartisan-infrastructure-law-aiding-virginia-energys-abandoned-mine-cleanup/">here</a> and Part 2 <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/03/virginia-energy-leveraging-federal-funding-to-diversify-southwest-regions-economic-profile/">here</a>. </em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under federal regulations, mine companies begin operation in Southwest Virginia, dig for their coal and then return the land close to its natural condition or in a state that can be built on for a future use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, renewable energy developers are looking for just such land where they can construct their projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can get in the middle and put the right partners together,” said Will Payne, a managing partner at Coalfield Strategies and advisor to the Southwest Virginia DELTA lab. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Southwest Virginia Energy </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/energy-tech-testbed-to-develop-projects-on-65k-acres-in-virginias-wise-co/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DELTA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lab is aiming to create the Data Center Ridge project, to be composed of several of the energy-intensive warehouses that hold computers processing the increasingly-used internet. The power-hungry data centers will require new electricity generation sources to be built to provide that power supply. The project’s developers are planning for the building of the generation sources to spur long-term jobs, held by employees who will operate and maintain them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don&#8217;t think you can do that anywhere else in Virginia,” said Payne. “There is a coordinated strategy where we’re thinking about all the projects, how there is synergy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The initiative has been met with several questions, particularly whether the abandoned mine land to be built on is stable, as past mining operations could have created hidden underground wetlands. There’s also the question of how effectively &#8220;mine water,&#8221; pools of rainwater that collects in formerly mined sites before reaching the aquifer, from the site can be used to keep the processors cool. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One group, Southwest Virginia Nuclear Watch, said they would prefer the power for the centers to come from renewable energy and not a nuclear source like a small modular reactor, a technology that continues to pique development interests. SMRS haven’t been deployed stateside, but could provide more readily available power than renewable while also not emitting the planet-warming greenhouse gasses released by burning fossil fuels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re not totally against data centers right now, but we do have lots of questions,” said Sharon Fisher, a member of SWVA Nuclear Watch and the grassroots environmental group The Clinch Coalition. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The project</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data center development has exploded in the rest of the state, particularly Northern Virginia, creating debates over whether the tax revenue the centers inject into local coffers are worth the clear-cutting of forests, draw on water resources, obstructed views and noise disruptions that come with them. Southwest Virginia hasn’t seen much data center development, according to a map from the Piedmont Environmental Council.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What makes the region appealing for data center development, proponents say, is that they could be sited on abandoned mine lands, the properties that were left unrestored after mining companies finished digging for coal, prior to requirements in the 1977 Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act that imposed penalties on companies for doing so. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Data Center Ridge site has been identified in Wise County, at an unspecified location due to some incomplete mining operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pitch for the project includes the potential to host about 10-12 hyperscale data centers on a 400-acre site. Hyperscale data centers can compute at speeds faster than traditional data centers, to meet the needs of complex artificial intelligence programs. </span></p>
<p>To prevent overheating without drawing on natural resources, mine water from the previously mined property will be circulated to the facility. The mine water&#8217;s temperature is 55 degrees or below, about 10 to 15 degrees cooler than a river that may be relied on to cool data centers in other parts of the state.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lower tax rate of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">24 cents per $100 in assessed value — compared to $3.70 in </span><a href="https://www.princewilliamtimes.com/news/prince-william-supervisors-back-big-data-center-tax-hike/article_545eed52-fcb1-11ee-89c4-6b12f7b12ebe.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prince William County —</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can pad local budgets, adding to the appeal.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Renewable energy</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discussions about converting the regional economy to focus on renewable energy have been occurring for a couple </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2021/09/20/can-southwest-virginia-remake-itself-as-a-laboratory-for-renewables/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">years</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but it’s the one gigawatt of electricity that Data Center Ridge could demand that is furthering discussion to deploy solar, nuclear and potentially blue hydrogen from natural gas in the region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To avoid taking up coveted prime farm and forestland, and other reclaimed abandoned mine lands that may be suitable for traditional economic revitalization projects, Data Center Ridge developers are looking at the already disturbed sites in more remote areas. The Nature Conservancy has taken that </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/in-appalachia-a-massive-forest-is-conserved-but-mining-can-still-proceed-beneath-its-roots/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">approach</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a Cumberland Forest Project that mixes mining with conservation.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39289" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/15/data-centers-proliferating-statewide-could-soon-be-built-on-mined-lands-in-southwest-virginia/img_1978/" rel="attachment wp-att-39289"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-39289 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_1978-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_1978-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_1978-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_1978-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_1978-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_1978-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_1978-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A gas well in Dickenson County.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solar that is behind-the-meter, meaning it serves only the facility and not the grid like a front-of-the-meter project does, could supply the needed power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A small modular reactor, which could produce up to 300 megawatts of electricity compared to a traditional reactor, could be part of the mix, despite the technology’s </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/11/dominion-seeking-small-nuclear-reactor-proposals/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nascent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> nature.

Morgan Griffith, who represents the area, has requested </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/uploadedfiles/energy_delta_lab_financial_disclosure_and_federal_nexus.pdf?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR32hxGkip7VpcTJxxG8GYQLkzcfMkEOmQg241wndV2qOVat4SIvQa43lEo_aem_AaFzUKzY4odnm1pWFhhvXw" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1.4 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the federal government in order to explore how mine water could support an SMR. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there&#8217;s more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Playing a part in the region’s economy as coal has dwindled and renewables have yet to fully take off: natural gas, which had a market value of </span><a href="https://www.energy.virginia.gov/geology/NaturalGas.shtml" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$217.1 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2023. The Energy DELTA Lab could tap into existing natural gas infrastructure to create </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/10/31/states-are-vying-for-money-to-start-hydrogen-hubs-what-are-they/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hydrogen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an energy source derived from electrifying water. With natural gas as the power source and carbon capturing, the form of hydrogen made would be blue, which is different from the green hydrogen that environmental groups prefer by using emission free renewables.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is no way to do this without every form of energy,” said Will Clear, a former deputy director for Virginia Energy. “Every service that we have, technology wise, has an impact on the environment. …The key for us is to figure out the least environmental impact that we can possibly have and continue to live a modern life.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39288" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/15/data-centers-proliferating-statewide-could-soon-be-built-on-mined-lands-in-southwest-virginia/img_1954/" rel="attachment wp-att-39288"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-39288" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_1954-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_1954-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_1954-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_1954-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_1954-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_1954-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_1954-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  An anti-nuclear billboard near the Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Virginia Energy has hosted community meetings about their traditional AMLER projects and both Payne and Clear have presented to the state’s Virginia Council on Environmental Justice, Fisher says there’s a lack of community involvement happening. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We hear about most of these things through press releases, and we get tidbits,” said Fisher, whose concerns about the project include what to do with radioactive waste. “For us to try to dig into all of this, trying to get transparency, trying to understand what&#8217;s really going on, that&#8217;s the battle we&#8217;ve had for the last year and a half.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Workforce training</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The jobs created by Data Center Ridge could give students who graduate from evolving community school programs the jobs people in the area want, said Clear and Payne. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mountain Empire Community College, one of the higher education institutions in the area, is working to get students who graduate from high school and may need to find employment to support their family to continue learning by attaining what they call a “stackable &#8221; certification to get a job, said Kristen Westover, the college’s president.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students there can get a certification in a field that can be matched to meet the region&#8217;s potential industry needs, such as cybersecurity or HVAC work, and then add, or stack, additional classes on it to get a two-year degree, which could be used to attain a four year degree. The percentage of students who go on to pursue a four-year degree jumps from 19% out of high school to 24% after attending MECC, Westover said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whatever economy you&#8217;re in, with AI, with technology, the bar has been raised,” Westover said, noting the school isn’t advocating for the data center industry to come to the region like economic development proponents are, but is there to support the effort. “We need industry recognized credentials and post secondary education now.”</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>

(Getty Images)</p><p>The U.S. House Appropriations Committee voted last week to advance an appropriations <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/AP/AP07/20240627/117475/BILLS-118-SC-AP-FY2025-LaborHHS-FY25LHHSSubcommitteeMark.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bill</a> for the federal Department of Labor that contains a provision to block the implementation of a newly finalized <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/04/18/2024-06920/lowering-miners-exposure-to-respirable-crystalline-silica-and-improving-respiratory-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rule</a> meant to limit coal miners’ exposure to dangerous silica dust.</p>
<p>The bill <a href="https://westvirginiawatch.com/2024/07/01/its-criminal-advocates-decry-congressional-attempt-to-halt-new-silica-rule-meant-to-protect-miners/" target="_blank">previously passed</a> a subcommittee and, on Wednesday, passed the full Appropriations Committee 31-25 with no amendments that would affect the attempt to stop the silica rule. It now advances to the full House, where lawmakers will have the chance to amend it before passage.</p>
<p>The appropriations bill — which outlines how the Department of Labor will allocate its funding for fiscal year 2025 — contains one line of text that prohibits the use of any funding for the implementation of the new silica dust rule.</p>

<p>The federal rule to limit miners’ exposure to silica dust was <a href="https://westvirginiawatch.com/2024/04/16/msha-rule-to-limit-silica-dust-exposure-in-mines-will-be-finalized-this-week/" target="_blank">finalized in April</a> and most of it began to go into effect <a href="https://westvirginiawatch.com/2024/06/03/as-silica-dust-rule-goes-into-effect-experts-advocate-education-for-the-industrys-youngest/" target="_blank">in June</a>. The new rule — initially proposed in July 2023 — implements for the first time ever a separate exposure limit for <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/silica/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">silica dust</a> in mines, cuts the maximum exposure limit to 50 micrograms per cubic meter for a full-shift and creates an “action level” for when exposure comes at 25 micrograms per cubic meter for a full shift. It also establishes uniform exposure monitoring and control requirements for mine operators to follow.</p>
<p>“The new silica dust rule is not perfect, but it is an important step forward to protect the health and safety of hard-working miners,” said Brendan Muckian-Bates, a policy and advocacy associate with the nonprofit Appalachian Citizens’ Law Center, in a <a href="https://appvoices.org/2024/07/10/silica-rule-committee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">news release</a>. “This dangerous provision, however, is a dramatic leap backwards that would put lives at risk and allow the black lung epidemic to continue to spread in spite of decades of advocacy to tackle this crisis. We need every tool possible to protect the health of miners, and we urge every member of Congress — especially House Republicans — with coal miners and those with black lung as constituents to work with their colleagues in deleting this section from the final bill.”</p>
<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 20% of coal miners in Central Appalachia are suffering from black lung — the highest rate <a href="https://archive.cdc.gov/#/details?url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/updates/upd-07-20-18.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detected</a> for the disease in more than 25 years. One in 20 of those coal miners are living with the most severe form of the condition, and fatalities tied to black lung are <a href="https://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2023/02/27/mining-lung-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">steadily increasing</a> in central Appalachia faster than the rest of the country.</p>
<p>Younger coal miners in the region are also being diagnosed with the disease at rates unseen by their predecessors due to a lack of easily accessible coal and an increase in the amount of silica-rich sandstone they have to dig through to reach what remains.</p>
<p>“Miners with black lung and their families have been fighting for protections from deadly silica dust for years. We know that those in the mines are getting sicker faster than ever because of silica dust, and we’re grateful [the Mine Safety and Health Administration] finally took action to help,” said Vonda Robinson, who serves as vice president of the National Black Lung Association, in a news release Wednesday. “It’s very disheartening to see a handful of Washington politicians try and undo all this hard work on a whim. If this policy becomes law, it will put the lives of countless miners at risk. Mining families deserve better, and we urge Congress to throw out this dangerous policy and get to work helping miners, not making their lives much harder.”</p>

They house traditional nuclear reactors that each produce about 945 megawatts of electricity for a combined total of over 1,800 megawatts. On Wednesday, Dominion Energy announced its vision to build a scaled-down version of the reactors, called a small modular reactor, in the next decade, to produce up to 300 megawatts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Today, Dominion Energy Virginia is excited to announce that we have issued a request for proposals from leading SMR nuclear technology companies to potentially develop Virginia’s first SMR here at North Anna,” said the utility&#8217;s chair, president and CEO Bob Blue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blue made the announcement of the utility’s search for SMR design plans at Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s signing of </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/10/governor-amends-vetoes-and-signs-energy-environment-bills/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 454</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, legislation Sen. Dave Marsden, D-Fairfax, carried this past session that allows the utility to recover pre-construction costs for a small modular reactor, including the RFP process, from ratepayers.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/11/07/gov-youngkin-wants-a-small-modular-reactor-what-exactly-is-that/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SMRs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are what their name suggests: smaller generation sources that use a nuclear reactor to heat up water, creating steam that turns a turbine to make electricity that is delivered to the grid. While smaller than traditional reactors and touted to have increased safety measures, SMRs rely on high-assay low-enriched uranium as fuel that turns into radioactive waste through the process, which doesn’t emit planet-warming greenhouse gasses.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The push for SMRs in Virginia comes as a way to meet unprecedented load growth projected for Virginia’s electric grid — particularly in Dominion’s service territory of Northern Virginia, the Richmond region and the Hampton Roads area — over the next 15 years, as energy hungry data centers </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/28/virginia-explained-data-center-expansion-with-all-its-challenges-and-benefits/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proliferate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To also meet that demand, Dominion is pursuing offshore </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/08/dominion-to-purchase-second-offshore-wind-lease-area-off-coast-of-north-carolina/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wind</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and natural </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/05/dominion-chesterfield-county-weigh-site-suitability-for-natural-gas-plant-proposal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> generation sources to provide dispatchable energy when their </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/04/14/dominions-renewable-projects-approved-by-regulators-despite-cost-concerns/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">solar </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">generation sources may not be producing power and until battery </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/21/dominion-gets-approval-for-battery-pilots-appalachian-power-seeks-bids-for-renewable-projects/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">storage </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">technology is further developed.</span></p>

Dave Marsden, D-Fairfax, at the North Anna Power Station (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marsden’s bill allows Dominion to recover the preconstruction cost of an SMR through a rate adjustment clause, a fee that is tacked on to bills for project costs, for the design of an SMR, readying a site for one and licensing fees. The bill caps any recoverable amount to $1.40 a month for a typical residential customer for Dominion. The utility has said it would submit its filing to recover those costs with its regulators, the State Corporation Commission, in the fall with a “substantially” lower request.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of that pre-construction process is the issuance of the RFP, which is confidential, to seek designs to build an SMR at the North Anna site. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39239" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/img_3877/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-39239" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3877-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3877-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3877-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3877-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3877-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3877-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3877-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Republican Gov. Glenn Younkin speaks during a bill signing at Dominion&#8217;s North Anna Power Station. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin, who has pushed for nuclear and natural gas use as part of his “</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/10/04/youngkins-energy-plan-calls-for-reevaluation-of-clean-economy-act/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of the Above</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” energy plan to meet grid demand instead relying on renewable sources, said at the signing he is confident the SMR will be built because of Dominion’s experience running nuclear power and the utility’s responsible assessment of the technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think the process that Dominion and [Appalachian Power Company] are going through as they review small modular reactors is a very responsible one,” said Youngkin. “They will make a decision as to how to deploy that technology with the best engineering firms, the best construction firms and of course the best supply chain. … I think we have all of the advantages to make this a big success, but also a reliable and safe one as well.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blue noted that the RFP does not commit Dominion to building an SMR, but, “an important first step,” to evaluate the technology at the North Anna site.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If an RFP is chosen, then Dominion would seek a needed license from the Federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission and then begin the process for any other new generation facility, which includes approval from the SCC. A third license that Dominion already holds for the North Anna site would not be eligible for any new SMR that may be built. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael wasn’t waiting under a bus shelter as he headed home from a doctor’s appointment. Rather, he was sitting underneath a narrow sign that provided a sliver of shade as the sun beamed down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s very little shade right here,” said Michael, who added additional cooling centers would help alleviate heat stress in the city. “They don’t have cooling stations everywhere…it’s hot everywhere.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scientific journal </span><a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023GH000985" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GeoHealth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently published a report detailing the number of heat-related health emergencies and the inequitable effects of urban heat exposure in Virginia’s capital city. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers found Black people in Richmond have experienced disproportionate heat-related illnesses during the warmer months of the year, while communities they live in have historically received little investment to help them keep cool.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While human-caused climate change is driving average global temperatures to rise, some communities and neighborhoods in Richmond, Virginia experience hotter temperatures than others,” the research paper stated, largely due to a pattern of government disinvestment in Black and low-income neighborhoods. “Hotter, less resourced neighborhoods experience more heat-related health emergencies like heat stroke and heat exhaustion.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The research relied on Emergency Medical Services data reported to the Virginia Department of Health that found there were 492 heat-related incidents between May and September from 2016 to 2022. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of those, Black or African-American patients counted for 306, or 62% of the incidents, despite comprising only 39.9% of the city’s population. Conversely, white patients made up 32.9% of the incidents while comprising 42% of the population.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The research also mapped the city’s cooling centers, which include nine libraries, and three centers that are opened when temperatures rise above 95 degrees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 53.9% of the heat-related illnesses occurred within a 1.4 km, or .8 mile, walk of the centers, the report found — a distance that takes about 15 minutes for a fast walker to cover. Opening the city’s 24 community centers as additional cooling stations would put another 17% percent of the heat-related illnesses within that 1.4 km walking radius.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Spending just a few hours at a cooling center can help prevent heat-related illnesses, but a lot of Richmonders might not know these cooling centers exist or they might not have a safe way to get there,” said Peter Braun, one of the researchers and a built environment policy analyst with the Richmond and Henrico Health District. “In some neighborhoods, if you have to walk down a street without sidewalks or shade from street trees or if you have to wait at a bus stop without a shelter, you&#8217;re going to be exposed to extreme heat.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeremy Hoffman, another of the paper’s researchers and director of climate justice and impact at Groundwork USA, said having access to cooling options, “is a matter of life and death.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The research also reviewed the locations of the Greater Richmond Transit Company’s 1,618  bus stops, of which 5% have shaded shelter. Just under 200 of the heat-related incidents happened within 100 meters of a bus stop. The bus company is offering zero-fare </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/08/virginia-bus-riders-reap-benefits-of-zero-fare-and-new-services/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">service</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for their air conditioned buses, Hoffman noted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The findings build off work by Hoffman in </span><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/12" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that studied the effect of past housing policies on urban heat islands. Southside Richmond, an area Hoffman said lacks historical investment in sidewalks that could help people get to cooling centers, only has one such location on Hull Street. Last year, Hoffman had published research that found cooling centers around the state were </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/07/19/as-temperatures-rise-in-va-researchers-report-sparsely-located-cooling-centers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sparsely</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> located. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protections for people working outside have also gained attention this summer season. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration recently released draft rules that require companies to schedule breaks for people who are working outdoors. The Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental nonprofit, called the rules a “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">crucial </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">step forward.“</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Workers in our nation should not be denied something as simple as a water break or a few minutes to regroup in the shade,” said Juanita Constible, a senior advocate in the environmental health program with NRDC. “That’s just basic human decency. It shouldn’t be controversial.”</span></p>
