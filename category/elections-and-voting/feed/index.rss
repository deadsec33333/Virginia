Dozens of media outlets republished our stories, too, which helped us reach new readers inside and outside the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, our readers were especially hungry to learn more about blue catfish and the invasive species&#8217; culinary potential, the state&#8217;s most stately trees and why preserving them is vital, a local school board that made history as the first in the nation to re-name schools after Confederate figures and another that sued a special needs student&#8217;s parent for $600,000. Here&#8217;s a recap of those stories and our other most-read reports and commentary of 2024.</span></p>

However citizens of the commonwealth view Shenandoah County School Board’s recent decision, Virginia appears to be the first in the nation to restore Confederate school names, after years of vigorous community engagement, a controversial renaming process, and a change in board priorities related to race, diversity and inclusion. <strong><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/20/virginia-school-board-restores-confederate-names/">Read more.</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>From the story:</strong> Of the roughly 2 million Virginians who’d been enrolled in Medicaid before the COVID-19 pandemic, over 480,000 of them have been disenrolled as of this August. Typically eligibility determinations are made annually, but they’d been on pause nationwide amid the pandemic due to federal policy. That’s changed over the past year in what’s colloquially referred to as “Medicaid Unwinding” as provisions of federal law have expired. <em><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/nearly-500000-virginians-in-medicaid-have-been-disenrolled/"><strong>Read more.</strong></a></em></p>

Last Monday, Youngkin awarded a $250,000 grant to Sea Farms, a family-owned and -operated aquaculture and seafood processing business with operations in Gloucester and Mathews counties, that among other uses will pay for a blast freezer that will increase the amount of blue catfish the company can buy and sell. </span><em><strong><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/05/blue-catfish-are-invasive-in-virginia-the-state-is-paying-to-get-more-of-them-on-peoples-tables/">Read more.</a></strong></em></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>From the column:</strong> Data centers are making the transition (to zero-carbon energy sources) harder, but so is local resistance to building solar. General Assembly members mostly understand the connection, leading to a lively debate in last year’s legislative session over whether to override some local permit denials for solar projects – and if so, how to ensure the localities still have some say. Though none of the legislative proposals moved forward last year, the topic has become a central one for the recently revamped Commission on Electric Utility Regulation (CEUR). </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/03/data-centers-approved-solar-farms-rejected-what-is-going-on-in-rural-virginia/"><b>Read more.</b></a></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters in House District 26 and Senate District 32, many of whom had just cast ballots in last month’s presidential and congressional elections, are now being called back to the polls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Voters who support reproductive rights, you cannot sit this one out,” Repro Rising Virginia Director Tarina Keene told attendees at a gathering in Ashburn Wednesday morning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic control of Virginia’s House and Senate is seen as critical to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/06/national-democratic-group-boosts-srinivassan-singh-in-upcoming-virginia-special-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advancing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a proposed constitutional amendment to protect abortion rights. Securing both chambers would give </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats, who currently hold a slim 21-19 edge in the Senate and a 51-48 majority in the House, a stronger position to push forward the amendment in a state where Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin maintains veto power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While abortion is not strictly a partisan issue, it often divides lawmakers along partisan lines. During last year’s statewide General Assembly elections, many Republicans supported Youngkin’s proposal to restrict most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. In contrast, Democrats campaigned on preserving the state’s existing abortion laws, with a long-term goal of enshrining abortion protections in the state Constitution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, was elected to Congress in November, Del. Kannan Srinivasan, D-Loudoun, secured the Democratic nomination to succeed him in the Virginia Senate. To fill Srinivasan’s seat in the House of Delegates, first-time candidate J.J. Singh earned the Democratic nomination, positioning himself as a fresh face in the party’s push to maintain its legislative majority. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Residents of the 26th House District can cast their votes between now and Jan. 7, choosing between Singh and Republican challenger Ram Venkatachalam. Meanwhile, voters in Senate District 32 will decide  between Srinivasan and Republican Tumay Harding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Venkatachalam and Harding did not respond to requests for comment on their positions regarding abortion access as of publication, and Venkatachalam’s campaign </span><a href="https://ramforva.com/why-im-running/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> does not reference  reproductive health or abortion, leaving his stance on this issue unclear. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harding’s campaign </span><a href="https://tumayforva.com/issues/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> states that she believes life “begins at conception.” She also emphasizes the need for measures to support expecting parents and “reduce abortions.” Additionally, Harding acknowledges that most abortions later in pregnancy are already prohibited.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under current Virginia law, abortions are allowed for any reason through the second trimester, which lasts until about 26 weeks of pregnancy. In the third trimester, abortions are only permitted with the approval of three doctors. A proposed constitutional amendment would ease that requirement, allowing a single doctor to authorize a third-trimester abortion if it is deemed necessary to protect the pregnant person’s life or mental health, or if the fetus is deemed non-viable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With no universal definition of fetal viability — the point at which a fetus can survive outside of the womb — doctors typically assess it on a case-by-case basis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less than 1% of abortions occur after 21 weeks of pregnancy, according to the most recent </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/reproductive-health/data-statistics/abortion-surveillance-findings-reports.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Some abortions that occur within the second or third trimester have been the result of </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/two-women-two-pregnancies-two-agonizing-decisions/article_24e5d5fc-742d-11ee-984d-6befc702d5d0.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">severe fetal anomalies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, low</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/11/fatal-anomaly-exception-didnt-spare-alabama-mom-who-needed-an-abortion/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fetal viability</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or stem from </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/24/these-u-s-supreme-court-cases-could-affect-abortion-access-nationwide/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">medical emergencies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the only Southern state without strict abortion restrictions or a ban, Virginia has also become an important access point for people seeking abortions from neighboring states. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I cannot imagine what women are going through in those states, dealing with situations where politicians should not be interfering (and) should not be involved,” Srinivasan said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He and Singh also shared personal connections to reproductive healthcare laws.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Srinivasan shared a story about his wife, who was once told that her life would be at risk if she became pregnant. Singh, too, emphasized the importance of reproductive rights, especially for his young daughters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have two young daughters and I care about their access to reproductive health,” Singh said. “I don’t want politicians in the doctor’s offices with them as they make decisions about their own bodies.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee is putting a spotlight on Senate District 32 and House District 26. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After winning a Democratic primary, Del. Kannan Srinivasan, D-Loudoun, will face off against Republican Tumay Harding to be elected to the Virginia Senate. He could succeed Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, who was elected to the U.S. Congress last month.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, J.J. Singh, who won a Democratic primary for Loudoun County-based House District 26, could potentially succeed Srinivasan’s House seat. He faces Republican Ram Venkatachalam. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DLCC director Heather Williams issued a statement noting that protecting Democrats’ slim majorities will “position us to be competitive in November when the entire House of Delegates is on the ballot alongside a competitive </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/25/spanberger-and-earle-sears-tied-in-first-2025-gubernatorial-poll/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gubernatorial race</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats currently have a 21-19 edge in the Senate and a  51-48 lead in the House with Republican Glenn Youngkin as governor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She added that Virginia can be a key indicator of “what the fight ahead looks like” to build Democratic power in states amid the Republican majorities in federal government. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortifying the Democratic firewall in the states has never been more important, and that work starts in Virginia,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the DLCC “spotlight” program, Srinivasan and Singh will be assisted in fundraising and can tap into DLCC experts on staff for advice or help with organizing. The group has boosted legislative candidates around the country and focuses on seats that are crucial for protecting or making majorities, said Sam Paisley, an interim communications director with DLCC. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Democratic majority can jumpstart planned constitutional amendments</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While DLCC is watching key state elections around the country for how they can support Democrats’ ability to balance out federal GOP majorities, Virginia’s Democratic majorities will be a key part of advancing planned amendments to the state’s constitution.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="j6PDqB758w"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/13/va-house-panel-advances-amendments-on-abortion-rights-marriage-equality-and-voting-rights/">Va. House panel advances amendments on abortion rights, marriage equality and voting rights</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Va. House panel advances amendments on abortion rights, marriage equality and voting rights&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/13/va-house-panel-advances-amendments-on-abortion-rights-marriage-equality-and-voting-rights/embed/#?secret=SmIsD8zngc#?secret=j6PDqB758w" data-secret="j6PDqB758w" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The amendments would enshrine abortion access protections into the constitution, remove a prohibition on same-sex marriage from it, and create an automatic process for formerly incarcerated people with felony convictions to have their rights restored. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is the least-restrictive Southern state when it comes to abortion access. The matter was paramount in the 2023 state legislative elections as Democrats vowed to protect current law (and eventually enshrine it into the constitution) and many Republicans coalesced around a 15-week cap on most abortions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under current Virginia law, any abortion occurring in the third trimester requires approval from three doctors. The new amendment would reduce that threshold to one doctor, should a later stage abortion be deemed necessary to protect the life or mental health of the pregnant person or should their fetus be deemed not viable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With no national definition of fetal viability — which refers to the likelihood of a fetus being able to survive outside of the womb — doctors typically make the determination on a case-by-case basis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, people with felony convictions are all but permanently disenfranchised from various rights, even after they’ve completed prison sentences. Previous governors’ administrations had streamlined a restoration process. Then Youngkin’s administration made it petition-based with unclear criteria. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That meant that hundreds of applicants this year were rejected — and therefore </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/23/these-virginians-wont-be-able-to-vote-next-month/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unable to vote </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in presidential and congressional elections — without knowing why. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This amendment creates a process that is bound by transparent rules and criteria that will apply equally to everybody,” the bill’s sponsor Del. Elizabeth Bennett-Parker, D-Alexandria said last month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the third amendment would allow Virginia to continue recognizing same-sex marriages should federal protections be undone, as they were with abortion protections. Since a 2006 amendment, </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/constitution/article1/section15-A/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s constitution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> defines marriage between a man and a woman. Though it’s been rendered moot since a 2015 Supreme Court of the United States decision, some lawmakers and LGBTQ advocates have stressed the importance of removing the prohibition in case that precedent were to fall (as Supreme Court judge Clarence Thomas has </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/dem-lawmakers-want-to-put-same-sex-marriage-in-virginia-s-constitution/article_46aa7008-ab32-11ee-af3d-e79f1e61bf21.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expressed interest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in revisiting). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a Democrat-led panel was able to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/13/va-house-panel-advances-amendments-on-abortion-rights-marriage-equality-and-voting-rights/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all three amendments earlier this month, the marriage equality one saw bipartisan support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Placing these policies into the constitution would make them less subject to partisan shifts in the legislature or governors’ mansion — but it’s also a longer process than just passing one law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Constitutional amendments have to clear both chambers of the legislature two years in a row, with a House of Delegates election in between. From there, they can appear as ballot referendums for voters around the state to approve or reject. This means voters could weigh in by November 2026 — if the proposals pass in 2025 and earlier in 2026. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While acknowledging the findings of the inspector general report, Balmer said he plans to refute some of it as “inaccuracies.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city’s inspector general had launched a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/16/richmond-inspector-general-investigating-citys-elections-office/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">probe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into Balmer’s office earlier this year following allegations of nepotism and misuse of money. According to documents obtained by The Mercury through a Freedom of Information Act request, a former employee had shared unverified allegations of management issues, including “hiring family and friends,” along with questionable spending and other concerns within the office. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">​​Richmond Inspector General James Osuna’s report, released Nov. 26, verified 25 of 26 allegations against Balmer’s management of the office that included improper use of city-issued purchasing cards, overspending on items, purchasing a handgun so a worker could act as an armed security guard and spending public money on alcohol. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">City officials had suspended Balmer’s purchasing card access this past summer amid the investigation and as a </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/registrar-balmer-city-credit-card-investigation-elections-office/article_6be2d0e8-146b-11ef-971d-1f0b4090e555.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">records review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by The Richmond Times-Dispatch showed $70,000 in charges during 2023. The inspector general report revealed that roughly $500,000 in public funding has </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/26/investigation-finds-nearly-500000-in-waste-fraud-and-abuse-in-richmond-elections-office/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">been wasted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> overall. Balmer pushed back against the findings Wednesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s (Osuna’s) report,” he said. “My rebuttal is my report. A lot of what is in the report is absolutely true, but there are things I take issue with and I want the public to know that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Balmer plans to make both a rebuttal statement and his resignation letter publicly available, he told reporters on Wednesday afternoon. He added that his rebuttal will have documentation included that should show that “it&#8217;s more like administrative mistakes” than criminal actions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the alcohol use, he said he never drank on the job. He defended the gun purchase as something he felt was necessary following a violent altercation between two employees and concerns over violence against election workers leading up to the 2024 presidential election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked if there’s anything he would have done differently, Balmer said on day one of becoming registrar he would have made sure that he and his staff had training. He claimed that he was given paperwork to sign but no formal training and he relied on the assumption that more of his staff had been trained as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said that the next registrar should have deep knowledge of city codes, and be able to pair administrative leadership with their election worker experience. </span></p>

<p dir="ltr">Over 180 miles from Richmond, the winner of a Southwestern mayoral race in Roanoke was clear only the day before election results were officially certified.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Democratic Vice Mayor Joe Cobb clinched a 59-vote victory in a three-way race. The city’s former mayor, Republican David A. Bowers was ahead initially, and even <a href="https://www.wsls.com/news/local/2024/11/08/vice-mayor-joe-cobb-leading-race-for-roanoke-mayor-as-of-friday-night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.wsls.com/news/local/2024/11/08/vice-mayor-joe-cobb-leading-race-for-roanoke-mayor-as-of-friday-night/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1731786298014000&amp;usg=AOvVaw13g0FdoT0wAk9L-hU_igYH">declared</a> victory. However, absentee ballots later placed Cobb ahead.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The state deadline for mailed absentee ballots was noon on Friday, Nov. 8. There were also 1,223 provisional ballots to be tallied, according to Nicholas Ocampo, Roanoke’s director of elections and general registrar.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is the first mayoral race in Roanoke with same-day <a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/registration/same-day-voter-registration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.elections.virginia.gov/registration/same-day-voter-registration/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1731786298014000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0TYmRRhmjZir5I_5RL0J2p">registration</a>, Ocampo stated.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This process requires extra steps to verify each voter’s eligibility to vote in the polling location in which their ballot was cast. Our office will continue to carefully and meticulously follow election laws and state guidelines to review each same day registration application in preparation for [certification on Nov. 15],” he stated.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ocampo’s greatest takeaway of the 2024 election is “every vote counts.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bowers and Cobb <a href="https://enr.elections.virginia.gov/results/public/roanoke-city/elections/2024NovemberGeneral" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://enr.elections.virginia.gov/results/public/roanoke-city/elections/2024NovemberGeneral&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1731786298014000&amp;usg=AOvVaw33mkXPr576vaHi_yc1elwB">each</a> garnered just over 37% of almost 41,000 votes counted.

The candidate must request it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Cobb’s campaign priorities were listed as transportation, education, community safety, housing and jobs. He will also be the first LGBTQ+ mayor to lead Roanoke.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Another 200 miles to the east in Hampton Roads, Suffolk’s tight three-way race is also within the margin of a recount.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Incumbent Mayor Michael Duman maintained his lead over former Democratic Del. Clinton Jenkins with 164 votes, after all ballots were <a href="https://enr.elections.virginia.gov/results/public/suffolk-city/elections/2024NovemberGeneral" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://enr.elections.virginia.gov/results/public/suffolk-city/elections/2024NovemberGeneral&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1731786298014000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0dx09TxO2N1bmy0_iMCUME">counted</a>.

Glenn Youngkin's proposal to invest another $290 million for school construction needs during the upcoming legislative session which begins in January. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following Tuesday’s general election, in which Virginians sent two state senators to Congress, the commonwealth is preparing for special elections to fill the seats vacated by John McGuire, R-Goochland, and Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire, who is set to succeed U.S. Rep Bob Good, R-Farmville, in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District, and Subramanyam, who was elected in the 10th Congressional District, have left a void in the Virginia Senate that each party will urgently work to fill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These vacancies could have a significant impact on the state’s legislative balance, where Democrats currently hold a narrow 21-19 majority. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the governor calls special elections in Virginia during recess of the legislature, Christian Martinez, a spokesman for Gov. Glenn Youngkin, said in a text message that because the General Assembly remains in special session from last May, the authority to call special elections rests with the leaders of each respective chamber — which in the case of the Senate is Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, the body’s President Pro Tempore. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The governor strongly believes all Virginians should be represented during the legislative session and trusts that Democratic leadership will call those elections in time to ensure all Virginians are represented,” Martinez said. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title24.2/chapter2/section24.2-216/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">State law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requires that a date for a special election to fill a vacancy  be set within 30 days of the vacancy or receipt of notification of the latter, whichever comes first. If the vacancy occurs between Dec. 10 and March 1, “the writ shall order the special election to be held no more than 30 days from the date of such vacancy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Senate District 10, which includes 11 localities and extends from Lynchburg in the west to the Richmond suburbs in the east, former state senator Amanda Chase, who had served in the body for eight years and lost her 2023 GOP primary in her Chesterfield-based seat to Sen. Glen Sturtevant, has already announced her bid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the law requires state legislators reside in the district they represent, Chase has moved from her former home in Chesterfield County to Appomattox County. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shayne Snavely, Chase’s former aide who worked on her bid for the Republican nomination for governor three years ago, has also declared his intention to run. And so have Jean Gannon, a Powhatan County real estate appraiser and longtime Republican activist, and Duane Adams, the chairman of the Louisa County Board of Supervisors, who ran for the Republican nomination in the district in 2023 but lost to McGuire. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg, said that Chase may be the top contender among the Republican candidates in the 10th District.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Chase has made waves, but local GOP officials say she is no longer in the party, which would really complicate things,” Richards said, referring to an </span><a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/government-politics/is-amanda-chase-still-in-the-gop-intraparty-feud-risks-her-state-senate-ambitions/article_e36769a4-7f54-11ef-87ee-57ebfcd982f3.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">intra-party controversy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over allegations that the former senator had violated state party rules. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No Democrat has announced a bid in the Republican-leaning district to date. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 32nd District, Del. Kannan Srinivasan, D-Loudoun, formally announced his bid on Wednesday, along with Hurunnessa Fariad, the director of outreach at Multi-Faith Neighbors Network (MFNN) and the secretary of the board of directors at the Virginia Interfaith Center for Public Policy. Buta Biberaj, a former commonwealth’s attorney for Loudoun County, has also announced her bid for the seat, as well as Ibraheem Samirah, a former state delegate, also from Loudoun. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other Democratic candidates include Sree NagiReddi, an Ashburn-based IT professional and small business owner, and Puja Khanna, a Loudoun County mental health advocate who ran unsuccessfully for the county’s board of supervisors in 2023.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The name I see mentioned most often is Srinivasan, which would then involve a special election in House District 26 later on,” Richards said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lots of other Democrats are emerging in this blue district,” he added, “but I expect some Republicans to throw their names in after the relatively good showing of the GOP statewide last Tuesday. The GOP might be looking for a pickup here, not sure they will get it.”</span></p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: Ommair Butt, a Republican, announced his candidacy for the 32nd District state Senate seat on TV news station <a href="https://www.wjla.com/news/local/2024-special-elections-virginia-senate-district-32-lodoun-county-former-commonwealths-attorney-buta-biberaj-race-senator-suhas-subramanyam-delegate-kannan-srinivasan-republican-democrat-ibraheem-samirah-puja-khanna-sreedhar-nagireddi-governor-youngkin" target="_blank">WJLA</a> on the evening of Nov. 7, after the above story was reported.

(Ian Stewart/For The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday afternoon, standing next to outgoing Mayor Levar Stoney in front of City Hall, Dr. Danny Avula laid out his vision for Richmond and his administration, after emerging as the leading candidate in the city’s mayoral race. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avula racked up </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">44,832 votes, or </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">46%, the most of any candidate, and won in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 7th districts, according to unofficial results from the Department of Elections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avula, the former director of the Richmond and Henrico Health Districts, said he plans to assemble his transition team and, once in office, start a search to hire a new chief administrative officer. He added that he is looking forward to working with current elected officials as well as Richmond’s newly-elected city council and school board members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Almost everybody I&#8217;ve talked to in the last 24 hours have expressed such an amazing willingness to work together, to do whatever they absolutely can to protect the rights and freedoms of Richmonders,” he said. “I&#8217;m very, very excited to work with those bodies moving forward for the good of our city.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He referenced Tuesday’s presidential election, which resulted in Republican Donald Trump winning a second term in the White House, and how it may impact Richmond. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think many of us are concerned justifiably about what that means for our city moving forward,” Avula said. “Members of our LGBTQ plus community, our Black and Brown and immigrant families, for working families, there&#8217;s a lot of concerns about what the shifts at the national level mean for us.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concerning his planned national search for someone to replace current Chief Administrative Officer Lincoln Saunders, Avula said he’s looking for a person who understands complex administrations and can navigate possible issues with federal funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think the reality of what&#8217;s happening at the federal level will mean changes in the funding that may be coming to us,” he said. “It will mean us needing to work more closely than ever with the state and with our federal partners to make sure that we&#8217;re drawing resources into the city.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avula faced off against four other candidates. Michelle Mosby, who finished the race as his closest contender with 25.4% of votes, conceded and congratulated Avula Wednesday morning. Harrison Roday, who earned 13.03%, also conceded Wednesday morning. Candidates Adreas Addison and Maurice Neblett garnered 11.92% and 2.94%, respectively. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Elections has not finished certifying Tuesday’s election, and is still in the process of counting provisional ballots, according to their </span><a href="https://enr.elections.virginia.gov/results/public/richmond-city/elections/2024NovemberGeneral" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, has defeated Republican nominee Mike Clancy in Virginia’s 10th Congressional District race, according to The Associated Press. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subramanyam, a former tech policy adviser to former President Barack Obama, had said if elected, he will advocate for federal funding for Virginia infrastructure projects, which the district’s current representative, Democrat Jennifer Wexton, also pursued. Subramanyam has also vowed to help keep the federal government open to avoid shutdowns that impact federal government employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wexton, who endorsed Subramanyam, is </span><a href="https://wexton.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=854" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">retiring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the end of the year after being diagnosed with a severe neurological disorder.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I am honored and humbled that the people of Virginia’s 10th District put their trust in me to take on the toughest fights and deliver results in Congress,&#8221; said Subramanyam in a statement. &#8220;This district is my home. I got married here, my wife Miranda and I are raising our daughters here, and the issues our community faces are personal to our family. It is an honor to continue serving this district in Washington.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past three congressional elections, Democrats have maintained control of the district, even after it was redrawn to include the counties of Loudoun, Fauquier and Rappahannock, the cities of Manassas and Manassas Park, and parts of Prince William and Fairfax counties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the campaign, Clancy faced criticism for his alleged ties to  Project 2025, a conservative playbook for running the country that proposed eliminating the jobs of federal government workers and contractors. Although Clancy admitted to previously donating to the Heritage Foundation, which authored Project 2025, he denied that he supported the plan, and ran on issues with the economy, parental rights, and public safety.</span></p>

(Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Elections Commissioner Susan Beals confirmed Tuesday that no voters have been removed from the state’s voter rolls under Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/eo/EO-35-Comprehensive-Election-Security-Ensuring-Legal-Voters-and-Accurate-Counting---vF---8.7.24.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executive order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> since Oct. 15 — the deadline for Virginians to register to vote online or apply for absentee ballots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think the figure that has been out there is the figure that stands, there has not been any additional work done on that,” Beals said at an Election Day news conference at Richmond’s Capitol Square, referring to 1,600 individuals purged under Youngkin’s directive since August. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The last time that records were sent to registrars was October 14th, which is the close of books, and … that’s normally when we close out our maintenance practices,” Beals said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pause in removals comes amid a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/14/voter-purge-lawsuits-add-to-disenfranchisement-allegations-against-youngkin-administration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">high-profile legal battle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the state’s efforts to manage its voter rolls. The U.S. Supreme Court </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/30/u-s-supreme-court-grants-stay-in-challenge-to-youngkins-voter-purge-order-allowing-removal-of-thousands-from-rolls/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">granted a stay</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last week on a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/22/youngkin-blasts-doj-lawsuit-that-trust-virginias-voter-roll-removals-into-national-spotlight/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lower court’s ruling </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that would have required the commonwealth to restore the voting rights of the 1,600 removed Virginians. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares had already acknowledged the end of a voter purge in a court filing from Oct. 22,  without providing a date for the cut-off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The defendants have already ceased their allegedly unlawful removal process, as they always planned to do, which means there is no ongoing alleged violation,” the filing said.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the Youngkin administration has not said publicly that they were no longer removing individuals from the rolls — even after last week’s Supreme Court ruling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s order had instructed the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to send records of people thought to be non-citizens to local election registrars for potential removal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the order’s timeline became a point of contention, with critics arguing it led to eligible voters being mistakenly removed too close to Election Day, a  violation of the so-called 90-day quiet period before an election, which is mandated by the </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/national-voter-registration-act-1993-nvra" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Voter Registration Act of 1993</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals on Tuesday pushed back against allegations that Youngkin’s order prevented some citizens from exercising their right to vote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“First, in Virginia, we want every eligible voter to vote in this election,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals underscored that the removal process has been in place since 2006, when the law was signed by then-Gov. Tim Kaine, a Democrat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It has been managed and processed the exact same way by every administration since 2006 when the law was enacted. Nothing has changed in the way that that process is managed by the department,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Beals, the DMV sends information to the Department of Elections, where it is checked against the department’s list of registered voters. For any voters who marked on their DMV paperwork that they are not U.S. citizens, their information is forwarded to local registrars, who then send notifications by mail to these individuals, informing them they may be at risk of removal from the voter rolls, unless they provide proof of citizenship within 14 days. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If they return the form, nothing happens to the voter, (but) if they fail to return the form after 14 days, they are sent an additional notice where they are advised that they are being canceled because of non-citizenships status,” Beals said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Anyone who is canceled for non-citizenship status and feels as though it is in error can go to their polling location today on election day and same-day-register to vote and cast a ballot in this election.” </span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lynchburg resident Nadra Wilson was trying to be proactive this summer by renewing her driver’s license months ahead of its December expiration. As a longtime voter and Virginia resident of almost a decade, she never suspected she would be removed from the state’s voter rolls due to a paperwork error and caught up in a voter purge program that has booted 1,600 from voter lists and drawn two lawsuits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When people fail to indicate citizenship status on Department of Motor Vehicles paperwork, or initial a box indicating they&#8217;re not a citizen, that information used to be sent monthly to the Department of Elections to send to local registrars, who sort it out with people. Now, under Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s Executive Order 35, that information is sent daily. Registrars send notice to impacted voters, who receive it by mail and are supposed to respond within 14 days of its postmark. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was surprising for Wilson to receive a letter informing her that she had to prove her U.S. citizenship or have her voter registration canceled. It was also frustrating, since  the September-dated notification letter didn’t make it to her until October because it had previously been sent to an older address. By then, she had been purged from voter rolls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is all very concerning,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, she was able to go to her local registrar’s office to resolve matters and cast her vote early, but worries that others in her shoes may not have been able to do the same, in light of the ongoing lawsuits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s order to ramp up voter data reports from the DMV to the State Department of Elections from monthly to daily fell within a 90-day “quiet period” in the federal National Voter Registration Act law. Two lawsuits challenged this in court.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plaintiffs in the lawsuits and civil rights groups stressed that the purges affect both longtime citizens who’d made paperwork errors as well as those who’d become naturalized citizens since their last DMV visit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a federal court granted a preliminary injunction — ordering Youngkin’s administration to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/judge-orders-people-removed-from-voter-rolls-to-be-reinstated-gov-youngkin-to-seek-appeal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reinstate purged 1,600 voters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and halt continued purges — the United States Supreme Court’s conservative majority </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/30/u-s-supreme-court-grants-stay-in-challenge-to-youngkins-voter-purge-order-allowing-removal-of-thousands-from-rolls/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">granted </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Attorney General Jason Miayres’ request to block the lower court’s order. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chesterfield County resident Rina Shaw, who’d also been briefly removed from rolls over paperwork errors like Wilson, said the situation has been “worrying for me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When obtaining her learner’s permit, she’d forgotten to indicate her citizenship status. After calling her local registrar her registration has been restored because “they said they had made a mistake” and she was able to vote last week, she explained. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also disagrees with the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in the purge case. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s like they basically threw out rules,” she said of the National Voter Registration Act’s quiet period. “They were just like, you know, ‘to hell with that.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People who were caught up in the voter roll purge </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/think-you-might-have-been-mistakenly-purged-from-virginias-voter-rolls-heres-what-to-do/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">may utilize</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> same-day registration and a provisional ballot to vote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s what longtime Richmond resident Eric Terrell is going to do, although it won’t be as easy as the mail-in ballot he’d planned for due to his disabilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though a lifelong Richmonder, he’d moved earlier this year into the senior living facility where he lives now. He’d also updated his address through the DMV and his mistake of not checking the citizenship box is what kicked him off the rolls. When his mail-in ballot never came, he’d reached out to local officials to learn what went wrong. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terrell said that he was “highly pissed” when he found out, but he’s come to accept the situation. He plans to take an Uber to his polling location on Election Day and said that he’s grateful same-day registration exists to resolve the matter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Wilson didn’t end up needing to take the same-day registration and provisional ballot route, she said that she’s glad others have that option. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provisional ballots, another option for same-day registrants, are most often used in instances where someone forgot to bring their ID card or other form of identification, as well as when people utilize same-day voter registration. Virginia Public Access Project also has a tool to </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/local-politics/elections/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lookup</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a polling place based on someone’s address even if they aren’t technically registered yet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Henrico County’s registrar Mark Coakley said that in most cases where provisional ballots are used, as long as people are able to show identification they don’t need to follow up with their registrar. Should someone decline the day of or not have identification on them at the time they vote, they can come back to their registrar’s office before noon on Friday.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For provisional ballots, he said that registrars are able to research if someone is a citizen in order to count their ballot. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If they were canceled or not registered, provisional ballots are a fail-safe method,” Coakley said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, he stressed that anyone voting on Election Day should remember “if you’re in line before 7 p.m., you will get to cast your ballot.”</span></p>

(Samantha Willis/The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Department of Justice plans to </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-monitor-polls-27-states-compliance-federal-voting-rights-laws" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">monitor </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">compliance with federal voting laws in 27 states and 86 jurisdictions nationwide during Tuesday’s general elections. Six of those are in Virginia: Hanover, Henrico, Loudoun, and Prince William counties as well as the cities of Manassas and Manassas Park.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means that personnel from the department’s Civil Rights Division “will be available all day to receive questions and complaints … related to possible violations of federal voting rights laws,” according to a Nov. 1 DOJ news release. The agency will also “maintain contact with state and local election officials” throughout Election Day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Henrico’s registrar Mark Coakley said that representatives from the DOJ had reached out late last week to inform his office that officials “would be coming by.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They didn’t say (which specific polling places) they were going, just Henrico in general,” he said in a call on Monday. “I expect the DOJ will spend more time at the malls or eating at local restaurants than actually finding anything wrong or out of the ordinary at our polling places.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The department is monitoring complaints for possible violations of several laws including the Voting Rights Act, Help America Vote Act, Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, Civil Rights Acts, the Americans with Disabilities Act and the National Voter Registration Act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latter was central to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/14/voter-purge-lawsuits-add-to-disenfranchisement-allegations-against-youngkin-administration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two lawsuits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last month aimed at Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration for a voter purge program that has removed at least </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/over-1600-people-removed-from-voter-rolls-under-youngkin-order-groups-seek-court-injunction/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1,600 people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Virginia voter rolls. A DOJ suit and one from Virginia’s League of Women Voters and Virginia Coalition for Immigrants Rights allege roll purges were happening too close to election day in violation of a 90-day quiet period in the National Voter Registration Act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When people fail to indicate citizenship status on Department of Motor Vehicles paperwork, that information is sent monthly to the Department of Elections to send to local registrars, who sort it out with people. But an Aug. 5 executive order from Youngkin — at the start of the 90-day quiet period —  ramped up the reporting from monthly to daily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plaintiffs in the case and civil rights groups stressed that the purges affect both longtime citizens who’d made paperwork errors as well as people who’d become naturalized citizens since their last DMV visit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a federal court granted a preliminary injunction — ordering Youngkin’s administration to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/judge-orders-people-removed-from-voter-rolls-to-be-reinstated-gov-youngkin-to-seek-appeal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reinstate purged 1,600 voters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and halt continued purges — the United States Supreme Court’s conservative majority </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/30/u-s-supreme-court-grants-stay-in-challenge-to-youngkins-voter-purge-order-allowing-removal-of-thousands-from-rolls/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">granted </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Attorney General Jason Miayres’ request to block the lower court’s order. </span></p>
<p><b>Additional guidance from the DOJ: </b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For reports of potential violation of federal voting rights laws, reports may be made through the department’s website </span><a href="http://www.civilrights.justice.gov/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.civilrights.justice.gov</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or by calling toll-free at 800-253-3931.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Complaints related to disruptions should be reported to local election officials. Complaints related to violence, threats or violence or intimidation at a polling place should be reported to local police and also reported to the DOJ after local authorities have been contacted.</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court’s two-thirds majority of Republican-appointed justices (three by former President and current GOP nominee Donald Trump) granted a stay that Virginia’s Republican-led executive branch </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/28/virginia-asks-supreme-court-to-block-order-to-reinstate-1600-people-stripped-from-voter-rolls/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sought</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, after federal district and appellate courts temporarily </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/judge-orders-people-removed-from-voter-rolls-to-be-reinstated-gov-youngkin-to-seek-appeal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voided</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s order 90 days before the election to purge Virginia voter rolls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That means that the 1,600 people who failed to check the correct box on a Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles form and, in many cases, mistakenly identified themselves as noncitizens were excised from rolls of registered voters. Now, they bear the burden, if they’re lucky enough to find out about it in time, of re-registering at this late hour and </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/think-you-might-have-been-mistakenly-purged-from-virginias-voter-rolls-heres-what-to-do/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">casting provisional ballots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> subject to challenge after the polls close.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin has sought to position himself as a hero standing resolutely against hordes of swarthy outsiders corruptly seeking to influence American elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be clear, Youngkin is legally and morally right in asserting noncitizens have no business voting in U.S. elections. Yet he’s never shown proof that it happens.</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/10/09/youngkin-noncitizen-voters-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/10/09/youngkin-noncitizen-voters-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Washington Post, no noncitizen has tried to vote in Virginia since he became governor. What’s more, only three people were prosecuted since January 2022 for illegal voting of any kind in Virginia, the Post reported.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former top state election officials say that maintaining clean, up-to-date voter rolls is work that goes on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">almost</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> year-round as required under a 2006 state law — except in the three months before elections.</span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/national-voter-registration-act-1993-nvra" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> specifically bars states from systematically purging its rolls during a “Quiet Period” 90 days ahead of a federal election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of which imparts an unmistakable partisan odor — rooted in Trump-inspired election denialism and nationwide Republican</span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/election-officials-who-back-trumps-big-lie-stir-concern-swing-states-2024-10-08/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“election integrity” initiatives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — to Youngkin’s Aug. 7 order to take extraordinary, expedited steps to find and excise noncitizens during that exact 90-day pre-election period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s order is much more likely to disenfranchise actual citizens for paperwork snafus than to snare a foreigner hell-bent on voting. But then, this was always about political posturing, irrespective of bad operational outcomes or adverse consequences for legitimate citizen voters like lifelong Republican Christine Rabassa of Henrico County or </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rina Shaw of Chesterfield</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">County</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, both U.S.-born citizens and longtime registered voters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rabassa said in</span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l2NI-kh1V4H3No56j1X-BhMC99LUW1aU/view" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a sworn affidavit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in support of litigation filed in U.S. District Court against Youngkin’s Executive Order 35 that she discovered her registration was “canceled” after she showed up for early in-person voting. She said a Henrico election supervisor “took her into a separate room” and told her she was removed for failing to check a box indicating her citizenship when she renewed her driver’s license in August and that she would have to re-register. She was turned away from the polls that day without being offered a provisional ballot and required to return another day to vote, the affidavit states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shaw also had no idea that a DMV clerical error compromised her right to vote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I actually wasn’t notified by Virginia. I was notified by NPR,” the unemployed computer programmer told the Mercury on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Had the public broadcaster not sought an interview with her for</span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/29/nx-s1-5169204/virginia-noncitizen-voter-purge" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">its Oct. 30 story</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Youngkin’s order, Shaw said, she would have found out as Rabassa had — by being turned away at the polls. She said she called the Chesterfield registrar’s office and was told her removal was “a mistake,” though there was no explanation for it. She said she was assured that she was being reinstated and found when she</span><a href="https://vote.elections.virginia.gov/VoterInformation/Lookup/status" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">checked her registration status online</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Wednesday that she had.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From this columnist, however, Shaw learned to her dismay that the Supreme Court’s Republican majority prevailed  </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/DocketFiles/html/Public/24A407.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">6-3</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in granting Virginia’s request for a stay, halting enforcement of lower court orders to reinstate voters in situations like hers and Rabassa’s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s ridiculous,” she said, adding, “… and it was the same six votes that struck down Roe v. Wade, wasn’t it?” That decision in June 2022 ended 49 years of federal protection for abortion rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, Rina. It was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, five days and a wakeup until the nation decides whether Trump or Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris will lead the free world for the next four years, Youngkin and Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares are joining other Republican-led states in imposing restrictions that make voting harder, especially for those with the fewest resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://alabamareflector.com/briefs/alabama-secretary-of-states-office-posts-news-release-required-by-court-order/" target="_blank">Alabama’s</a> Republican secretary of state attempted a voter-removal program similar to Youngkin’s that was also struck down by a federal judge. It was unclear Wednesday whether the Supreme Court will rule similarly in Alabama’s case as it did in Virginia’s. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 2020 and 2024 battleground state of Georgia, a state judge struck down a rule approved Sept. 20 by the pro-Trump conservative majority of that state’s electoral board that would have required the hand count of millions of paper ballots. It’s a state Trump narrowly lost in 2020 despite his desperate, corrupt attempt to sandbag Georgia’s Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, “</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/trump-urges-georgia-secretary-of-state-to-find-votes/2021/01/03/aba64f5f-8c3c-490f-af34-618ccea732d7_video.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to find 11,780 votes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” the margin by which he trailed Democrat Joe Biden.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a bromide in politics about what motivates the two parties to vote, and there’s a lot of truth to it: “Democrats have to fall in love; Republicans just fall in line.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin recognizes that opposing Trump is lethal in today’s Trump-owned GOP where apostates are targeted for primaries and defeated. Just ask outgoing Rep. Bob Good or former Rep. Denver Riggleman, both Virginia Republicans who fell out of favor with Trump during their time in office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, Youngkin was hailed nationally as the GOP’s post-Trump path forward when he won the governorship on his first bid for elective office with a genial, pragmatic, avuncular style that played well in Virginia and ended a 12-year GOP drought in statewide elections. Now, mindful of his party’s current landscape and his own lofty national ambitions, he has Super Glued his lips to Trump’s ample derriere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He fell in line.</span></p>

The postcard was paid for by Article IV, an issue-advocacy nonprofit in Arlington, Virginia. (Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)</p><p><em>This story was originally published in <a href="https://southdakotasearchlight.com/2024/10/29/south-dakota-election-open-primaries-article-iv-nonprofit-outspends-groups-campaign/" target="_blank">South Dakota Searchlight</a>, a sister publication of The Virginia Mercury and an affiliate of States Newsroom.</em></p>
<p>An out-of-state nonprofit that hasn’t disclosed its donors is outspending in-state opponents and supporters of an open primaries ballot question ahead of South Dakota’s Nov. 5 election.</p>
<p>Article IV is an issue-advocacy nonprofit in Arlington, Virginia. It has spent $889,145 on large postcards and online advertisements for Amendment H, <a href="https://sdcfr.sdsos.gov/Search/FiledCommunicationExpenditures.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to reports filed with the South Dakota Secretary of State’s Office</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the postcards feature images of soldiers with tape over their mouths, along with a claim that Amendment H would “protect veteran voters” who “aren’t able to participate fully in our political process.”</p>
<p>That claim is related to South Dakota’s current primary election system, in which Republicans only allow Republicans to vote, while Democrats allow Democrats and independents.</p>
<p><a href="https://southdakotasearchlight.com/ballot-measures/amendment-h-open-primaries/" target="_blank">Amendment H</a>, one of seven statewide questions on South Dakotans’ Nov. 5 ballot, proposes opening up future primary elections and placing all candidates, regardless of party, on a single ballot open to all voters. The top two vote-getters would advance to the general election. In races with two winners, such as state House districts, the top four would advance to the general election.</p>
<p>Some veterans have <a href="https://www.dakotanewsnow.com/2024/10/18/south-dakota-veterans-upset-with-yes-amendment-h-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spoken out against</a> the Article IV postcards, saying they use veterans as props for a political agenda, and also saying veterans are currently able to register for a political party and participate in the party’s primary election. Some of Article IV’s other postcards are more generally supportive of Amendment H and do not mention veterans.</p>
<h4 class="editorialSubhed">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">More about Article IV</h4>

	</h4>
<p>Article IV is a 501(c)(4), a type of nonprofit sometimes described as a “<a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/dark-money/basics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dark money</a>” group because it’s allowed to engage in political campaigns and doesn’t have to publicly disclose its donors.</p>
<p>Nobody from Article IV returned messages from South Dakota Searchlight, and the <a href="https://www.articlefour.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">group’s website</a> reveals few details beyond a mission to “improve the health of American democracy by instituting reforms that align citizens’ interests with politicians’ incentives.” The website also describes a form of open primaries as a solution: “Top-4 and Top-5 nonpartisan primaries where everyone, regardless of party, can participate are better than the alternative.”</p>
<p>Some information about the group is available in public IRS documents that nonprofits are required to file. Article IV’s <a href="https://apps.irs.gov/pub/epostcard/cor/862820532_202212_990O_2023112922017017.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2022 filing</a> — the most recent one located by Searchlight — said the group had $11 million in revenue and made contributions to primary reform efforts across the country, such as a $12,600 donation to Open Primaries Inc., $342,000 to Oregon Ranked Choice Voting and $400,000 to Utah Ranked Choice Voting.</p>
<h4 class="editorialSubhed">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">In-state campaign finance data</h4>

	</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, in-state supporters and opponents of open primaries have formed ballot question committees, which are required to disclose donors and additional details about fundraising and spending.</p>
<p>A pro-Open Primaries ballot question committee spent $439,211 on advertising between May and Oct. 15, according to its latest campaign finance report, while opponents spent $18,481.</p>
<p><a href="https://sdcfr.sdsos.gov/Search/SearchResults.aspx?cid=1382&amp;rid=3321" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South Dakota Open Primaries</a> Chair Joe Kirby said his ballot question committee does not have direct contact with Article IV, nor does the committee have control of what the organization advertises.</p>
<p>That’s “the way the system works,” Kirby added.</p>
<p>“That happens to politicians, too: Outsiders spending money for or against them,” Kirby said, adding that there is a national interest in election reform. “There’s not much you can do about that. Outside interests have a big say in all elections, including the governor and congressional delegation. It’s not unique to our ballot issue.”</p>
<p>In another example of outside “dark money” influencing a South Dakota ballot question this year, supporters of an amendment that would restore abortion rights in South Dakota <a href="https://southdakotasearchlight.com/2024/10/24/anti-abortion-groups-campaign-finance-fundraise-spending-amendment-g-ahead-of-election/" target="_blank">received $540,000 in donations</a> from Think Big America, an issue-advocacy nonprofit in Illinois.</p>
<p>Article IV spent its own money directly on advertising rather than donating to the Open Primaries ballot question committee. The Open Primaries committee has raised over $750,000 since May, mainly from a group of business leaders in Sioux Falls, while opponents hadn’t broken $100,000 in fundraising a week before the election.</p>
<p>Three-fourths of the Open Primaries ballot question committee’s $777,225 in fundraising came from eight households in southeastern South Dakota.</p>
<p>Those eight are:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">$250,000 in total contributions from chair of the committee Joe Kirby and his wife, Jennifer, of Sioux Falls.</li>
<li aria-level="1">$110,000 from Dave Knudson, a Sioux Falls lawyer and former South Dakota lawmaker, and his wife Deanna, who serves as treasurer of the committee.</li>
<li aria-level="1">$103,400 from gas station and convenience store chain Heinz Inc. owner Tom Heinz and wife, Jane Heinz, of Dakota Dunes.</li>
<li aria-level="1">$50,000 from Matt Paulson, of Sioux Falls, owner and founder of MarketBeat.</li>
<li aria-level="1">$25,000 from Dana Dykhouse, of Sioux Falls, CEO of First PREMIER Bank.</li>
<li aria-level="1">$25,000 from Dan Kirby, of Kirby Financial in Sioux Falls and Joe Kirby’s brother.</li>
<li aria-level="1">$25,000 from Nathan Peterson, of Sioux Falls.</li>
<li aria-level="1">$10,000 from Kevin Schieffer, of Sioux Falls, former president of the South Dakota Board of Regents.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other major contributions include $100,000 from Marc Merill, co-founder and former CEO of Riot Games, in Santa Monica, California, and $25,000 apiece from Avera Health and First PREMIER Bank, both based in Sioux Falls.</p>
<p>Opponents to Amendment H formed the <a href="https://sdcfr.sdsos.gov/Search/SearchResults.aspx?cid=1580&amp;rid=3394" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vote No on H ballot question committee</a> and raised $90,276. The ballot question committee’s largest contribution was $35,000 from James Koehler, an Aberdeen businessman and namesake of the Northern State University Koehler Hall of Fame Field.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The situation has raised questions on whether state lawmakers should consider amending that law for additional clarity and to avoid future legal disputes over how Virginia confirms voter registration shortly before elections. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The 2006 law</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin has said repeatedly that his executive order was built on a 2006 state law for voter roll cleanups, which directs the Department of Motor Vehicles to send data to the State Board of Elections of people who failed to indicate U.S. citizenship in paperwork. There’s a process of notification and then purging of voters who fail to prove their citizenship, and in previous years, the process was done on a monthly basis. Youngkin’s order directed DMV and Elections Department officials to perform it daily.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuits the state and Youngkin face say Youngkin’s order ran afoul of the National Voter Registration Act, which institutes a “quiet period” on such actions 90 days before an election. Several state lawmakers have signaled they agree with that allegation, including House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, who </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/14/voter-purge-lawsuits-add-to-disenfranchisement-allegations-against-youngkin-administration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">previously told</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Mercury “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason that we have this 90-day rule is that we don’t want citizens to be accidentally removed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Privileges and Elections Committee chair Sen. Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach, called Youngkin’s order “reckless” and alleged that it’s being used to “fire up the (Republican) base.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you actually look at the issue of the matter, it’s the 90-day quiet period,” Rouse said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The courts will decide the matter concerning the legal challenges, John Aughenbaugh, a political science professor at Virginia Commonwealth University, said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But he added that the Youngkin administration “brought this on themselves” by issuing the order so close to the 90-day federal threshold.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Aughenbaugh said, “I can understand why <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/22/youngkin-blasts-doj-lawsuit-that-trust-virginias-voter-roll-removals-into-national-spotlight/">Youngkin told Fox News</a> ‘we didn’t think we were doing anything wrong,’” in citing the 2006 law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That measure was carried by former republican state Sen. Ken Cucinelli and signed by former Democratic Gov. Tim Kaine. At that time, Republican President George Bush’s Department of Justice had issued a memo that it didn’t object to the law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the time since, no one has challenged it, until the two suits against Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An argument in Attorney General Jason </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A407/330363/20241027231346621_Application%20for%20Stay%20SCOTUS%20vpf.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares’ Supreme Court filing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> notes confusion on when the federal 90-day law should overpower the 2006 state law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The current confusion surrounding the NVRA makes the rules anything but clear,” Miyares’ petition reads. “States are unaware of when, or whether, they can remove noncitizens from the voter rolls. They need to know with certainty whether they can remove noncitizens at any point, only outside of the Quiet Period, or never.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, the Republican National Committee and Republican Party of Virginia also </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/29/virginia-gop-calls-on-u-s-supreme-court-to-reinstate-youngkins-voter-purge-order/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filed a brief</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in support of the state’s SCOTUS request.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We haven&#8217;t had those conversations,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As to resolving any confusion, Sen. Bill Stanley, R-Franklin County, said that the state legislature broadly is always looking at ways past laws might need to be amended. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This might be one of those times,” he said. “The question then becomes ‘is there a bipartisan solution?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It might also come down to the question of how to prevent governors from overstepping or skirting federal law, as well as how to prevent presidential administrations from wading into state law, Aughenbaugh suspects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The debacle playing out on the national stage might prompt Virginia legislators to ask, “Did the Youngkin administration too broadly interpret the law? Do we want to rein-in gubernatorial administrations in the future?” Aughenbaugh posited. “Meanwhile, how do you revise the law so that future presidential administrations don’t single out a state for lawsuits two weeks before Election Day?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rouse said there’s valid reasons for those types of deliberations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s more of a bigger picture with Governor Youngkin in terms of inciting fear and undermining our elections,” Rouse said of conversations he’s having with his fellow lawmakers. “We understand that this administration has been known to make mistakes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rouse pointed to how the administration pulled out of ERIC, a multi-state data-sharing coalition meant to maintain voter roll accuracy — and how he </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/11/youngkin-blocks-democratic-bills-dealing-with-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> legislation prompting Virginia’s return to it this year, along with other voting-related bills. The administration also mistakenly canceled over </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/01/voting-rights-advocates-blast-youngkin-admin-over-error-affecting-3400/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3,000 people’s registrations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year, Rouse said. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Can same-day voter registration and provisional ballots fix it?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless of whether eligible voters were caught up in the recent purge or run into other election-access issues, registrars have said that use of same-day registration and provisional ballots </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/think-you-might-have-been-mistakenly-purged-from-virginias-voter-rolls-heres-what-to-do/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are an option</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would allow them to vote on Election Day. Provisional ballots require follow-up after voting to verify a person’s address, citizenship status or other factors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s an argument Republican national and state leadership is making as a reason Youngkin’s order and the subsequent voter purges should stand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even if a person entitled to vote were erroneously removed from the voter rolls and unable to respond to the Commonwealth’s outreach, they may still take advantage of same-day registration and cast a ballot,” the state’s request to the Supreme Court stated.  “No legal voters could or would be disenfranchised.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aughenbaugh doubts the nation’s highest court will grant Virginia’s request so close to the elections and  suspects people who have been purged may not have to resort to provisional ballots this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t think there are enough (Supreme Court) justices that have the appetite to wade into that dispute less than a week before elections,” he said. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares addressed the stay to Chief Justice John G. Roberts, after federal Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles on Oct. 25 ordered people stripped from Virginia’s voter rolls to be reinstated because eligible voters may have been included in the state’s voter roll purges. Youngkin’s executive order directed the state DMV to send lists of people who identified as noncitizens to the state Board of Elections for daily removal from voter lists. The </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+sum+SB313" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2006 state law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Youngkin’s order is based on called for this process to occur monthly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The League of Women Voters, the Virginia Coalition for Immigrants Rights and the DOJ have </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/over-1600-people-removed-from-voter-rolls-under-youngkin-order-groups-seek-court-injunction/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filed separate lawsuits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against the state for the ramped up removals, citing instances where eligible voters who had made errors on their DMV paperwork had been removed, as well as people who became naturalized citizens after they filed their DMV paperwork. The groups also said the removals are systematic and happened within 90 days of Election Day, a violation of federal law. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/22/youngkin-blasts-doj-lawsuit-that-trust-virginias-voter-roll-removals-into-national-spotlight/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Miyares, both Republicans, have argued that the executive order merely reinforces the 2006 law implemented under a Democratic governor, and that the removals were individualized. They, and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, have characterized the legal challenges to the removals as politically-motivated actions that hinder the state’s ability to bar noncitizens from voting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a federal crime for noncitizens to vote, and there is no evidence that it’s a widespread problem in America. A Brennan Center for Justice survey held after the 2016 presidential election found</span><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/noncitizen-voting-missing-millions" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> just 30 instances of noncitizens voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> out of  23.5 million votes cast. </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/12/nx-s1-5147789/voting-election-2024-noncitizen-fact-check-trump" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent voter data audits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in states like Georgia and Arizona have revealed negligible cases of noncitizens voting.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giles’ order would “irreparably injure Virginia’s sovereignty, confuse her voters, overload her election machinery and administrators, and likely lead noncitizens to think they are permitted to vote, a criminal (offense) that will cancel the franchise of eligible voters,” Miyares wrote in the stay, requesting the high court issue it by Tuesday. Giles mandated that the state comply with her order to reinstate purged voters by Wednesday.</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce/For the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Five Waynesboro voters have filed a lawsuit to prevent the majority of the Waynesboro Board of Elections from following through on their controversial pledge to refuse certification of the November 2024 election results, a move they argue would violate Virginia state law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plaintiffs — Jennifer Lewis, Ann Criser-Shedd, Greg Fife, Chris Graham and Andrea Jackson — are seeking a court order to compel the election officials to certify the city’s votes.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://advancementproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024.10.21-Waynesboro-Complaint-File-Stamped.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, filed in Waynesboro Circuit Court on Oct. 21, comes after two GOP officials from Waynesboro  filed </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/15/waynesboro-gop-officials-sue-over-va-s-voting-system-threaten-to-block-election-certification/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">their own lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> challenging Virginia’s voting system ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election while threatening to not certify the results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In their complaint, Curtis Lilly, the chairman of the Waynesboro Electoral Board, and Scott Mares, the board’s vice chair, expressed their concerns over the reliability of electronic voting systems, which they argue are prone to inaccuracies. Instead, they demanded that all ballots be counted by hand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, state law does not currently require a mandatory hand-count unless irregularities are proven, and all paper ballots are required to be counted by optical scanning machines, which help speed up the counting process and reduce the risk of human error. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before each election, the scanners undergo rigorous testing using a predetermined sample of votes to ensure accurate tallying before any real votes are counted. Additionally, it is illegal to connect ballot scanning machines to the Internet at any point, further safeguarding the integrity of the voting process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of the scanners used in Virginia’s elections are certified to meet both state and federal standards and are handled under a strict chain of custody to ensure security and accuracy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In their counter-suit, the five Waynesboro voters ask the court to require the election officials to certify the election results unless they prevail in their own suit. The plaintiffs further argue that the election officials’ stance violates the Virginia Constitution, which mandates that election results be certified in accordance with established procedures, including the use of legally authorized voting equipment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The chairman and vice chairman should do their job; instead they are purposely misinterpreting what they are charged to do. I cast my vote and have every right to expect that it will be counted on Election Day,” said Lewis, one of the plaintiffs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackson, another plaintiff, said that voting in the 2024 election was “very important” to her. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am frustrated that the election officials are not doing what they take an oath to do, which is to make sure the election runs smoothly and every vote counts. Instead they are distracting us from our local elections by filing nonsensical court cases,” Jackson said. </span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Santia Nance and Gin Carter said they haven’t washed a single dish since their partners were released from prison. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As both loathe the household chore, Nance’s husband Quadaire Patterson and Carter’s husband Taj Mahon-Haft have been more than happy to take it on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Carter is in her fourth year of veterinarian school, Mahon-Haft said doing the dishes is just one more way to support her after she emotionally supported him through his incarceration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The couples were part of a multi-group effort to change state law expanding pathways for early release of  incarcerated people who meet certain criteria. They also made friends along the way as people were released this past July through expansions to Earned Sentence Credits — a way that people with good behavior and who participate in educational advancements can trim some of their prison sentences. Despite initial opposition to its expansions in 2022, Gov. Glenn Youngkin </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/16/earned-sentence-credit-expansions-new-parole-board-operations-to-take-effect-this-year/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">allowed its implementation this year.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid navigating these new chapters in their lives, some have petitioned for a chance to vote in this year’s elections. Several of them say they have little hope they will be able to. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/constitution/article2/section1/#:~:text=Virginia%20Law,-Constitution&amp;text=No%20person%20who%20has%20been,his%20competency%20has%20been%20reestablished." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s Constitution,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> people with felony convictions are all but permanently disenfranchised unless a governor pardons them or restores their rights. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell, along with former democratic Govs. Terry McAuliffe and Ralph Northam, had streamlined the process and eventually made people </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210408122644/https://www.restore.virginia.gov/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">automatically eligible for rights restoration if their sentence was complete</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Then Youngkin </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/surovell-spruill-ask-if-youngkin-has-changed-rights-restoration-process/article_dd1232ba-c4fb-11ed-8b57-3723c72fb438.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">quietly adjusted the process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, requiring individuals to submit petitions to regain their rights, resulting in lower </span><a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/local/virginia/virginians-whose-rights-have-been-restored-drops-in-second-year-of-youngkin-administration-reports-show/291-fbe59fc9-c488-4449-be3e-ad4c0ba1c374" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">restoration numbers </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">compared to previous administrations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exact criteria the governor considers when granting or rejecting applications remains unclear. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s chapter of the NAACP took Youngkin’s administration to court last year to get answers but </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/judge-finds-for-youngkin-administration-in-naacps-foia-case/article_210d11ec-9936-11ee-a87e-138606562546.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a judge ruled that most details are exempt from being shared </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">through a provision in the Freedom of Information Act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what was shared in the administration’s FOIA response indicated that people who have completed probation and paid any due fines might be more likely to get a “yes” from him. An applicant disclosed in the FOIA who was classified “ineligible at this time” was still on probation and paying fines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then-spokeswoman for the governor, Macaulay Porter, told media at the time that the administration had acted “in good faith” in disclosing the information that it did provide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, applicants aren’t fully aware of what exact criteria they’d need to meet in order to be restored. In interviews with The Mercury, formerly incarcerated people shared their lingering </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">questions about whether their rights will be restored — including if their offense type matters as a disqualifier, if probation and fines are indeed a component, or if their potential good standing and public service to their community might be a factor in their favor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some also wonder if the “individual basis” petition review system the administration has reiterated over the past year is actually happening.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Copy-and-paste rejections</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the partially-filled FOIA, a “reentry resource packet” people are given when they leave prison includes a paper informing them to apply for their rights to be restored. Though there’s no indication of the time it would take in that packet, other materials in the FOIA show it can take two to three months as various state agencies are involved in the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About three months after applying for restoration, Newport News resident Justin Brown received an email with a rejection letter addressed “Dear applicant,” which didn’t describe why he was rejected. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The message was part of a mass email response the Youngkin administration sent to several hundred people who had applied for rights restoration; all of their email addresses were visible to everyone who’d gotten the message. The applicants began to chat in the email thread, revealing a series of concerns and questions about their access to the ballot box.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe each and every one of us has a right to know why we were denied,” said one of the respondents. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several speculated they were denied because of this year’s high profile federal elections. Some posited that the process isn’t handled on an individual basis, since they were all mass emailed with the same generic rejection letter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some respondents noted that like the governor, they are Republicans too.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One such would-be Republican voter called it an “insult to injury” to not be able to vote while, as a former felon, he also struggles to find work that would put the medic training he gained during his military service to use. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Once I started talking with everyone else and seeing that this is a pattern of this administration, I wanted to raise some alarm bells,” Brown said in an interview with The Mercury. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He reached out to his state lawmaker, Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, who said she contacted the Secretary of the Commonwealth, Kelly Gee. Price told The Mercury that she had a conversation with Gee wherein the secretary apologized for the email error and stressed that while the alert to Brown and others had been done in mass, the restorations are handled on an individual basis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown said that he filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Justice (which is also </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/14/voter-purge-lawsuits-add-to-disenfranchisement-allegations-against-youngkin-administration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">currently suing Virginia over a purge of voter registrations too close to Election Day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). He hopes the DOJ could investigate the restoration process to ensure that it’s indeed being handled on a case-by-case basis, which the mass email put into question for him.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Unclear criteria</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several other people with felony records told The Mercury they don’t recall getting mail or emails about their rejections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mahon-Haft, who has applied twice, discovered his latest rejection through checking an online portal. He doesn’t know why he was rejected, but he is still on probation. Patterson, who is also still on probation, hasn’t applied yet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our constitution has this antiquated language for a governor to determine your destiny,” Patterson said. “We’ve finished our sentences, but there’s this extra sentence that carries on.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jared Rose, a Roanoke resident who works for a </span><a href="https://www.vacares.org/subcontractors--caas.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state-funded nonprofit organization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.roanokeva.gov/2677/Gun-Violence-Prevention-Commission" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">serves on the city’s Gun Violence Prevention Commission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wonders if his probation status might result in a rejection. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He hopes to become a peer recovery specialist to help people overcome substance abuse disorders and plans to start a nonprofit to pair formerly incarcerated people as mentors with at-risk youth. When he checked his restoration status on the portal, he said there was no information, despite applying earlier in the year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I did a crime. I broke the law, you know, this is what I’ve got to deal with,” Rose said. “But somewhere along the line, there’s just so much red tape.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Looking forward</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mahon-Haft can’t vote for lawmakers yet, but he will frequent Virginia’s Capitol in the next legislative session to support their work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He and Carter had previously co-founded an organization called The Humanization Project, an advocacy group that also participates in educational programming. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40495" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:200px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/23/these-virginians-wont-be-able-to-vote-next-month/tandg/" rel="attachment wp-att-40495"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-40495" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/TandG-200x300.jpeg" alt="" width="200" height="300" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/TandG-200x300.jpeg 200w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/TandG.jpeg 562w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Taj Mahon-Haft (left) and Gin Carter (right) on their wedding day in August 2024. Image courtesy Mahon-Haft.</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s easy to hate a conviction, but it’s not very easy to hate somebody when you know seven layers of them,” Mahon-Haft said. “You might have one thing you don&#8217;t agree with, but you can see them as a human being. When you see people as human beings, you have more humane policy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’s grateful that Youngkin reversed his course on the Earned Sentence Credit law, for example. When announcing </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/youngkin-announces-efforts-to-support-formerly-incarcerated-people/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">his own efforts to support formerly incarcerated people with re-entry </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">this summer, Youngkin indicated that reversal was more about being in alignment with the state’s Supreme Court — which had ruled in favor of a man whose incarceration had been extended despite his earned credits that should have allowed him earlier release. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Supreme Court this past year was very clear on the current sentence credits, and so we’re fully complying,” Youngkin said at the time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as Mahon-Haft and Carter’s relationship helped spark an organization, Nance co-founded </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sistas In Prison Reform with other women whose loved ones were or are still incarcerated. And while she and Patterson are still planning a wedding to celebrate their union, they went ahead and eloped earlier this month. Mahon-Haft and Carter wed over the summer in Southwest Virginia, with some of their recently-released friends also part of the celebration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The couples plan to continue public engagement around the lived experiences of incarcerated people and their families, as well as advocate for laws that help people better reintegrate into society after time spent in prison.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mahon-Haft also plans to keep applying for restoration until he gets a &#8220;yes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And if Democrats in Virginia’s state legislature get their wish, automatic restoration for completed sentences could be enshrined in the state’s constitution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To do so, a constitutional amendment will need to pass the state legislature two years in a row, with an election in the House of Delegates in between, before appearing on statewide ballots for everyone else to weigh in on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Democrats plan to kickstart that process next year, with the potential for it to appear on statewide ballots by 2026. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown, the Newport News resident, is already excited about the prospect and plans to visit Virginia’s Capitol to engage with lawmakers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until then and beyond, Mahon-Haft will continue to wash his wife’s dishes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At some point years ago, when he was still locked up, I had a pile of dishes in my sink, and I joked ‘You never pull your weight in this relationship — why don&#8217;t you ever do the dishes?’” Carter recalled. She remembered that Mahon-Haft told her if she stuck by him through the end of his sentence, he’d do her dishes the rest of her life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He&#8217;s made good on that so far!” she said. </span></p>

Glenn Youngkin speaks to reporters outside the Capitol near the end of the 2024 General Assembly session. (Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By now, you probably know who will get your vote for mayor, for your congressional seat, for the U.S. Senate and for president. But do you know whether you’re still an eligible voter?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will you arrive at your neighborhood precinct on Nov. 5 and discover that you have been excised from the registered voter rolls weeks before election day without notice and with limited recourse?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voting used to be one of the easiest and most essential privileges we exercise as Americans. As it should be. But nothing in electoral politics is as simple or easy as it used to be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Americans once could take for granted now requires more vigilance and self-education by the voter and more work than ever by election officials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Voter ID laws in the commonwealth have swung like a pendulum over the last decade,” said Nikki Sheridan, who was a top official overseeing Virginia elections under Republican former Gov. Bob McDonnell. “Responsible administrations spent significant amounts of time and money for outreach and education about voter identification legislative changes, and citizens are saturated — with messages that swing as wildly and frequently as the law changed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This fall, in the stretch run of the bitterly contested election, there’s a new wrinkle: Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s 11th-hour order to have elections officials scour Virginia’s voter rolls hunting for noncitizens, an action that the U.S. Department of Justice filed a</span> <a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/media/1373371/dl" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Oct. 14 to halt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Voter Registration Act forbids removing voters within 90 days of federal elections, a time known as the “</span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-virginia-violating-federal-laws-prohibition-systematic-efforts" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quiet Period</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” Youngkin issued</span> <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/eo/EO-35-Comprehensive-Election-Security-Ensuring-Legal-Voters-and-Accurate-Counting---vF---8.7.24.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Executive Order 35</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> commencing the process on Aug. 7, exactly 90 days before the election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It marked the second time in a week the</span> <a href="https://www.lwv.org/newsroom/press-releases/lawsuit-challenges-recent-voter-roll-purges-virginia-preventing-eligible-us" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state was sued</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in federal court over Youngkin’s action. The League of Women Voters and the Virginia Coalition for Immigrant Rights allege in</span> <a href="https://www.lwv.org/newsroom/press-releases/lawsuit-challenges-recent-voter-roll-purges-virginia-preventing-eligible-us" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">their Oct. 7 complaint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the way Virginia purges its rolls violates the federal law’s protections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s order, in large part, restates ongoing and uncontroversial best practices and statutory requirements for safeguarding the security of ballots and those casting them. That includes the universal use of paper ballots to provide a lasting record of a voter’s intent, a strict chain of custody of early ballots and ensuring that computerized counting machines are not linked to the internet to avoid the possibility of remote hacking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then the order directs extraordinary efforts to bar noncitizens from voting, a step an ambitious Republican politico like Youngkin would take as a matter of course to stoke a favored paranoia among his party’s base.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor has boasted of removing 6,303 people from Virginia’s voter rolls since he took office. On its face, that’s a good thing. Cleansing the voter rolls of noncitizens is required by a 2006 state law signed by then-Gov. Tim Kaine, a Democrat. Evidently, the law works.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/10/09/youngkin-noncitizen-voters-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Washington Post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, no noncitizen has attempted to vote in Virginia since Youngkin became governor. The Post also reports that only three people have been prosecuted in the commonwealth for illegal voting of any kind from January of 2022 through July of this year. That’s hardly massive election fraud.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enforcing laws that reserve voting in U.S. elections exclusively to U.S. citizens has been a year-round pursuit, according to Chris Piper, who was Virginia’s commissioner of elections from 2018 to 2022 and is now executive director of the Virginia Public Access Project, a nonprofit and nonpartisan data source about state politics and government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia was among the states whose election legislation required Justice Department preclearance under the</span> <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/voting-rights-act" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voting Rights Act of 1965</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> until 2013 when it was ended by a</span> <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/court-cases/shelby-county-v-holder" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Supreme Court decision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Congress passed the law during the Civil Rights Era to prevent state and local governments, mostly in the South, from erecting barriers to Black Americans’ right to vote. Piper said the Justice Department approved Virginia’s 2006 statute with the unwritten understanding that it would not apply during the Quiet Period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s order echoes the persistent drumbeat of former President and Republican nominee Donald Trump’s pre-emptive and baseless election fraud assertions. They’re rooted in his</span> <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/big-lie-trump-stolen-election-inside-creation" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big Lie</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and subsequent legal challenges based on it that got bounced out of courthouse after courthouse —</span><a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jan/08/joe-biden/joe-biden-right-more-60-trumps-election-lawsuits-l/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">63 in all</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — following his re-election defeat four years ago. But it remains a battle cry among Trump’s deluded disciples.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most vexing consequence of Youngkin’s order, which its critics call a “purge,” is that it’s much more likely to harm legitimate voters, regardless of party, through paperwork errors and bureaucratic snafus than it is to block illicit interlopers from voting. All it takes is for a bona fide citizen to fail to check the right box on a Department of Motor Vehicles form to trigger their removal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once that error is in the system, as Markus Schmidt and Charlotte Renee Woods of The</span> <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/14/voter-purge-lawsuits-add-to-disenfranchisement-allegations-against-youngkin-administration/?emci=5a2745fb-738a-ef11-8474-6045bda8aae9&amp;emdi=a352fb9f-e48a-ef11-8473-0022483029fa&amp;ceid=338091"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mercury reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there is no obligation by either the State Department of Elections or local elections officers to vet and validate the information before a voter’s registration is terminated. Often, a voter isn’t aware of it until she or he tries to cast a ballot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By then, the remedy is to re-register (which, thankfully, is possible up to Election Day) and cast a</span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/casting-a-ballot/in-person-voting/#provisional-ballot" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">provisional ballot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that is subject to scrutiny and perhaps a challenge after the polls close, said Piper and Sheridan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond that, Sheridan noted, is the increasingly rancorous process of counting (and sometimes </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">re</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">counting) the results. What used to be a dispassionate mathematical exercise  has become snarled in partisan gamesmanship and bizarre conspiracy fantasies, a product of Trump’s toxic and unrelenting election denialism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Prince William County, for instance, a prosecution led by Virginia’s GOP-led attorney general’s office against the county registrar over alleged 2020 election improprieties disintegrated once it reached local courts and was dismissed. Yesterday, the former registrar, a professional election administrator named Michele White,</span> <a href="https://protectdemocracy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sued Attorney General Jason Miyares</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and others in his office in U.S. District Court alleging malicious prosecution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A major shift apparent to me is a lack of civility, often accompanied by an operating assumption that our election officials lack integrity or credibility,” said Sheridan, now a fulltime mom to 5-year-old twins and a volunteer for civic causes in Fluvanna County. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Numerous recent recounts affirm that election results in Virginia are accurate and rarely change the outcome of an election. Infrequent mistakes are human, and allowances must be made. A new registrar, or a seasoned registrar adjusting to a legislative change, is neither a conspiracy participant nor the devil,” Sheridan said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To illustrate her point, she contrasted two recounts in which she was involved, both in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District. One, in 2008, affirmed Democrat Tom Perriello’s thin general election victory over Republican incumbent Virgil Goode. The other was this June’s vicious GOP primary battle in which Trump-supported challenger John McGuire ousted House Freedom Caucus leader Bob Good by 366 votes out of 62,802 cast.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an observer in the 2008 recount, Sheridan eventually struck up a friendship with a Democrat who was part of Perriello’s team, she said. In this summer’s recount, she was the target of withering vituperation from fellow Republicans that included a cyberbullying effort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is unfortunate, but I observed the process primarily to defend it mightily against those who may deny the outcome because they do not like it,” she said. “That is not how electoral democracy works.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even so, Virginia elections are clean, fair and secure. </span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/registration/view-your-info/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check your registration status</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before you head to your polling place.

But whatever you do, exercise your right as a citizen: vote.</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><strong><em>Editor&#8217;s note:</em></strong> <em>On Wednesday, Oct. 30, the United States Supreme Court granted a stay blocking a lower court&#8217;s order for Virginia to pause its voter removal program, allowing additional purges through Election Day. Find more details on the decision <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/30/u-s-supreme-court-grants-stay-in-challenge-to-youngkins-voter-purge-order-allowing-removal-of-thousands-from-rolls/">here</a>, and read below to find out how you can still vote if you were wrongly removed from Virginia voter rolls.</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though state law allows people who didn’t indicate citizenship status when filling out forms at the Department of Motor Vehicles to be removed from voter rolls, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/14/voter-purge-lawsuits-add-to-disenfranchisement-allegations-against-youngkin-administration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two lawsuits have alleged that Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration is violating federal law </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">by continuing removals within 90 days of Election Day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For anyone who became a citizen since their last DMV visit, or who suspects they made an error filing out their paperwork that would have booted them from voter lists, there are still ways to cast a ballot in next month’s elections. </span></p>
<p>Registrars and election workers won&#8217;t turn eligible voters away from polls if they wish to utilize same-day registration or a provisional ballot, according to Henrico County Registrar Mark Coakley.</p>
<p>“So if they were canceled or not registered, provisional ballots are a fail-safe method.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provisional ballots, most often used in same-day voter registration, are also used when people run into paperwork or registration issues that might need to be resolved. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a provisional ballot, voters will still need to follow up with their local registrar office to provide additional documents that can help verify their identity or other facts, like if they are residents of Virginia and the city or county they voted in, and whether they are U.S. citizens or have had their voting rights restored after a previous felony conviction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can research to make sure they are citizens or became citizens or had their rights restored,” Coakley explained. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coakley said that when using a provisional ballot, voters are also given instructions to help with the follow-up procedures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They&#8217;ll get a letter attached to their provisional ballot, giving them all the information of ‘This is the reason why (you may have this ballot)’ and ‘Here&#8217;s the ways to get hold of us to present evidence if you choose to do so,’” he said.  </span></p>
<p>Chesterfield County Registrar Missy Vera stressed that same-day registration can happen at any early voting location as well as on Election Day, which is Nov. 5.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coakley also suggested that anyone who might be concerned they could have been mistakenly caught up in the recent voter roll purges check Virginia Department of Elections’ </span><a href="https://vote.elections.virginia.gov/VoterInformation" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online citizen portal </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to see their voter status. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrea Gaines, a communications manager at the Department of Elections, also said that people “can always reach out to their local registrar if they have questions about their registration status.”</span></p>
<p>Vera, from Chesterfield County, concurred.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyone may call our office to inquire about their registration or inquire as to their options,&#8221; Vera said. &#8220;We are happy to help.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/voter-guide/2024-virginia-voter-guide/"><b><i>Early voting — by mail, ballot drop boxes, and at select locations — runs through Nov. 2.  Election Day is on Nov. 5.</i></b></a></p>

John McGuire. (Photos courtesy of respective congressional campaigns) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a significant fundraising boost, Democrat Gloria Witt for the first time has outpaced her Republican opponent, state Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland, in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District, with only weeks until the Nov. 5 election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Witt’s campaign reported having pulled in $218,627 in the third quarter ending Sept. 30, as opposed to McGuire, who raised $198,577 during the same time, according to the latest finance disclosure data released by the Federal Elections Commission Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In total, Witt has raised $276,755 since launching her campaign in March. McGuire, who was engulfed in a vicious primary battle with U.S. Rep. Bob Good, R-Farmville, for much of the year, has raised $1.15 million during this election cycle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But after McGuire’s expensive recount following the June 18 primary, where he narrowly defeated Good by just 366 votes out of 62,792 cast, his campaign funds have dwindled to $121,562. For the first time, Witt has surpassed him, reporting $163,905 in cash on hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic Party of Virginia Chairwoman Susan Swecker said in a statement Wednesday that while “Republicans are in disarray” in the 5th District, Witt is “laser-focused on running a winning” campaign. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Her impressive surge in fundraising is proof that Virginians in the 5th District know that she will stand up for them. There’s a reason John McGuire isn’t raising money — he still doesn’t have the support of his own party.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokesman for McGuire’s campaign did not respond to a text message seeking comment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fifth District Republicans have been grappling with </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/30/four-top-5th-district-gop-officials-ousted-for-not-supporting-mcguire/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">internal divisions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as infighting intensifies ahead of the upcoming election. The close primary race, followed by the recount in August, has deepened rifts within the party, with factions backing either McGuire or Good’s hardline conservative platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These internal struggles have raised concerns about the GOP&#8217;s ability to present a united front against Witt, leading to anxiety among some party insiders that the lingering tensions could weaken McGuire’s campaign and give Democrats an opening in a district which Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, won with 53% of the votes in 2016 and 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg, said that Democrats have been raising “a lot of cash” statewide during the 2024 election cycle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Witt seems to have benefitted from this, possibly also the fact that her odds, although long, seem better in the 5th than Karen Baker’s do in the 9th District,” Richards said, referring to the Democratic nominee who is </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/27/in-the-fightin-ninth-baker-seeks-to-end-griffiths-13-year-tenure/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seeking to unseat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, who has represented the district since 2011.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lack of national money being directed at McGuire “is not surprising,” since the 5th District is seen as a safe GOP seat, Richards added. “But if the GOP is fractured enough in the 5th, Witt may squeak in. I’m still not betting rent money she does win, but her odds are better than before.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite running a strong ground game in the neighboring 9th District, Baker has been struggling to catch up to the Republican incumbent in the money race. According to the latest FEC filings, she  raised $93,503 in the third quarter, and a total of $174,419 during this election cycle, with just $78,727 cash on hand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griffith, however, raised $164,299 between July and September, bringing in a total of $907,204, mostly from corporate donors. His campaign currently has $559,895 cash on hand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats, however, have kept their cash advantage in other competitive House districts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/10/tight-race-in-virginias-7th-congressional-district-as-derrick-anderson-eugene-vindman-face-off/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">7th District</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Democrat Eugene Vindman has significantly out-raised Republican Derrick Anderson during the third quarter, bringing in $6.4 million compared to Anderson&#8217;s $781,321. Overall, Vindman has raised $13.8 million for his campaign and holds nearly $3 million in cash on hand, while Anderson has raised a total of $1.9 million, with just over $1 million in cash reserves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And in the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/30/northern-virginias-10th-congressional-district-race-pits-clancy-against-subramanyam/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">10th District</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, state Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, out-raised Republican nominee Mike Clancy between July and September, bringing in $1.1 million compared to Clancy&#8217;s $205,219. Subramanyam has raised a total of $2.4 million for his congressional campaign, with $674,396 in cash on hand. Clancy, meanwhile, has raised $793,748 this election cycle and holds $563,699 in cash reserves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/07/kaine-faces-off-against-gop-challenger-cao-in-high-stakes-u-s-senate-race/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia&#8217;s U.S. Senate election</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Republican nominee Hung Cao out-raised incumbent democratic U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine in the third quarter with $3.3 million compared to Kaine’s $3 million, despite trailing the senator </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/harris-kaine-ahead-in-virginia-by-comfortable-margins-new-poll-says/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">by double digits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the polls. However, Kaine still leads in overall fundraising, with a total of $13.1 million raised this election cycle and more than $7 million cash on hand. In contrast, Cao has raised $6.2 million in total, with $2.2 million available.</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce for the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two GOP officials from Waynesboro have filed a lawsuit challenging Virginia&#8217;s voting system ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election while threatening to not certify the results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In their complaint, Curtis Lilly, the chairman of the Waynesboro Electoral Board, and Scott Mares, the board’s vice chair, are raising concerns about the validity of future results while echoing unmerited claims that the 2020 election, in which Democrat Joe Biden defeated then-President Donald Trump with more than 7 million votes, was stolen.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Filed on Oct. 4 at the Waynesboro Circuit Court against Virginia Department of Elections Commissioner Susan Beals and State Board of Elections Chairman John O’Bannon, the suit alleges that the voting machines used in the state are unverifiable and could potentially be manipulated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plaintiffs further claim the machines may be connected to the internet, allowing for external tampering, though this is illegal under state law and no evidence has been provided to support this allegation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When reached by phone Tuesday, Lilly declined to be interviewed for this story. Mares did not respond to several calls seeking comment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lilly and Mares argue that under the current legal regime, local electoral board members are unable to personally review and verify that the voting machine program being used to count the ballots “is keeping and recording a true and accurate count,” and that the device’s record tape accurately represents the ballots cast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Consequently, the plaintiffs believe that the voting machine is counting the votes in secret, because neither the program counting the votes recorded on the ballots nor the ballots themselves can be examined,” the complaint says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lilly further stated in an affidavit attached to the complaint that he “cannot ensure that the machines do not connect to the internet, allowing for vote counting algorithm manipulation, nor can I ensure with any certainty that the electronic ballot scanners are presenting results which are consistent with the contents of the ballot box.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Henry Chambers, a professor for constitutional law at the University of Richmond School of Law, said in a phone interview Tuesday that the lawsuit appears to be based on long debunked conspiracy theories circulating after the 2020 presidential election that claimed vote counting machines had been programmed to get votes wrong and to flip votes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s not really a serious thing, but some people have bought into it and it sounds like these folks have bought into it, too,” Chambers said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Their notion is that vote counting that is done by a machine is done in secret, and therefore you have to hand-count the votes, presumably in public, in order to have a real tally of the actual vote count,” Chamber continued. “That would suggest that voting that is not done by hand and in public qualifies as counting in secret, which in theory would violate the state Constitution.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, voters cast paper ballots, which are then counted by optical scanning machines — as required </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title24.2/chapter6/section24.2-626/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">by state law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — to expedite the process and avoid human error. Ballot scanning machines are certified to meet both state and federal standards and are maintained under a controlled chain of custody.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before every election, the scanners are tested using a predetermined sample of votes to ensure they are tallied accurately before any actual votes are cast, and it is against the law to connect a ballot scanning machine to the Internet at any point. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals, who was appointed as Virginia’s top elections official in March 2022, did not respond to text messages seeking comment Tuesday, and a spokeswoman for the Department of the Elections said in an email that the department does not comment on pending litigation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/08/08/virginias-top-elections-official-says-shes-confident-about-the-accuracy-of-results/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in July, Beals said that hacking the scanning machines was impossible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Period. They cannot be,” she said, adding that after the testing of the devices ahead of the election and on Election Day, officials also conduct risk-eliminating audits, which she called the back-end check.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So we have three different checks throughout the system just to make sure that the machines are reporting accurately.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chambers, the UR professor, called the plaintiffs’ argument that the machine counting of ballots happened in secrecy “an odd thing,” because the machine itself is doing the counting in a public space, supervised by election officials. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The problem with counting being done in public is that one can’t necessarily explicitly see what’s going on. But the fact is, we have lots of things that count things and we just agree that it’s being counted correctly, like ATM machines,” Chambers said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No one would say that the ATM machine is spitting out money in secret, but it’s spitting out money in response to a request. Here, a voting machine is counting votes in response to a ballot being fed through a machine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By asking for ballots to be hand-counted instead of being tabulated by machines, the plaintiffs could really be asking for a slow-down of the count, Chambers added, which “can introduce additional problems with a valid count — and that is the whole point of feeding the ballots through during the day and having a continuous count is so that you can have results in a reasonable and fair time. Hand counting is used only when necessary when you&#8217;re talking about things like absentee ballots or ballots that can’t be read by the machine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also remains unclear why the GOP election officials who filed the suit would threaten to not certify the presidential election, in a county that leans Republican and where Trump won with 51-46% in 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rich Anderson, the chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia, underscored that the lawsuit was a lone effort by a small group of GOP officials from one locality. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As far as I know it’s only happening in this one jurisdiction out of 133, but it’s all going to get settled in the courts anyway,” Anderson said in a phone interview. “What they’re asking is the court to render its opinion, which it will do, and the opinion will likely be on the side of Virginia law, which says that ballots are counted through the optical scanners, not by hand.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The counting of ballots by optical scanning machines has been proven as safe and reliable, Anderson said. </span></p>

Thanks to the Electoral College, that has happened <a href="https://history.house.gov/Institution/Electoral-College/Electoral-College/" target="_blank">five times</a> in the country’s history. The most recent examples are from 2000, when Al Gore won the popular vote but George W.

<p>The Founding Fathers <a href="https://theconversation.com/who-invented-the-electoral-college-147083" target="_blank">did not invent</a> the idea of an electoral college. Rather, they <a href="https://www.archives.gov/boston/featured-documents/kennedy-1960.html" target="_blank">borrowed the concept from Europe</a>, where it had been used to pick emperors for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>As a <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vXXZBEkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao" target="_blank">scholar of presidential democracies</a> around the world, I have studied how countries have used electoral colleges. None have been satisfied with the results. And except for the U.S., all have found other ways to choose their leaders.</p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The origins of the U.S. Electoral College</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dhm.de/archiv/ausstellungen/heiliges-roemisches-reich/index_3.html" target="_blank">Holy Roman Empire</a> was a loose <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/confederation-politics" target="_blank">confederation</a> of territories that existed in central Europe from 962 to 1806. The emperor was not chosen by heredity, like most other monarchies. Instead, <a href="https://www.holyromanempireassociation.com/list-of-holy-roman-emperors.html" target="_blank">emperors</a> were chosen by electors, who represented both secular and religious interests.</p>
<p>As of <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/memory-world/golden-bull-all-seven-originals-and-king-wenceslaus-luxury-manuscript-copy-osterreichische" target="_blank">1356</a>, there were <a href="https://brill.com/display/title/18769?language=en" target="_blank">seven electors</a>: Four were hereditary nobles and three were chosen by the Catholic Church. By <a href="https://www.holyromanempireassociation.com/reichstag-of-the-holy-roman-empire.html" target="_blank">1803</a>, the total number of electors had increased to 10. Three years later, <a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/70699377" target="_blank">the empire fell</a>.</p>
<p>When the <a href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/founding-fathers" target="_blank">Founding Fathers</a> were drafting the U.S. Constitution in 1787, the <a href="https://www.senate.gov/civics/common/generic/Virginia_Plan_item.htm" target="_blank">initial draft proposal</a> called for the “National Executive,” which we now call the president, to be elected by the “National Legislature,” which we now call Congress. However, Virginia delegate <a href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/founding-fathers-virginia#mason" target="_blank">George Mason</a> viewed “<a href="https://www.consource.org/document/james-madisons-notes-of-the-constitutional-convention-1787-6-2/" target="_blank">making the Executive the mere creature of the Legislature</a> as a violation of the fundamental principle of good Government,” and so the idea was rejected.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania delegate <a href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/founding-fathers-pennsylvania#wilson" target="_blank">James Wilson</a> proposed <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/10714/plain-honest-men-by-richard-beeman/" target="_blank">that the president be elected by popular vote</a>. However, many other delegates were adamant that there be an <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-electoral-college-system-isnt-one-person-one-vote-150342" target="_blank">indirect way of electing the president</a> to provide a buffer against what Thomas Jefferson called “<a href="https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-06-02-0174" target="_blank">well-meaning, but uninformed people</a>.” Mason, for instance, suggested that allowing voters to pick the president would be akin to “<a href="https://www.consource.org/document/james-madisons-notes-of-the-constitutional-convention-1787-7-17/" target="_blank">refer(ring) a trial of colours to a blind man</a>.”</p>
<p>For 21 days, the founders debated how to elect the president, and they held more than 30 separate votes on the topic – <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/706046/tyranny-of-the-minority-by-steven-levitsky-and-daniel-ziblatt/" target="_blank">more than for any other issue</a> they discussed. Eventually, the complicated solution that they agreed to was an early version of the electoral college system that exists today, a method where neither Congress nor the people directly elect the president. Instead, each state gets a number of electoral votes corresponding to the number of members of the U.S. House and Senate it is apportioned. When the states’ electoral votes are tallied, the candidate with the majority wins.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/founding-fathers-virginia#madison" target="_blank">James Madison</a>, who <a href="https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed19.asp" target="_blank">was not fond of</a> the Holy Roman Empire’s <a href="https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/debates_725.asp" target="_blank">use of an electoral college</a>, later recalled that the final decision on how to elect a U.S. president “<a href="https://bcuassets.blob.core.windows.net/docs/BJALS-Issue-2.pdf" target="_blank">was produced by fatigue and impatience</a>.”</p>
<p>After <a href="https://prologue.blogs.archives.gov/2020/10/27/amending-the-electoral-college-the-12th-amendment/" target="_blank">just two elections</a>, in 1796 and 1800, problems with this system had become obvious. Chief among them was that electoral votes were cast only for president. The person who got the most electoral votes became president, and the person who came in second place – usually their leading opponent – became vice president. The current process of <a href="https://constitution.findlaw.com/amendment12.html" target="_blank">electing the president and vice president on a single ticket</a> but with separate electoral votes was adopted in 1804 with the passage of the <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-12/" target="_blank">12th Amendment</a>.</p>
<p>Some other questions about how the electoral college system should work were clarified by federal laws through the years, <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/RL/RL32717/12" target="_blank">including in 1887 and 1948</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://theconversation.com/pro-trump-rioters-storm-u-s-capitol-as-his-election-tantrum-leads-to-violence-149142" target="_blank">After the 2020 presidential election</a> exposed additional <a href="https://theconversation.com/an-unseen-problem-with-the-electoral-college-it-tells-bad-guys-where-to-target-their-efforts-236470" target="_blank">flaws with the system</a>, Congress further tweaked the process by passing <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/4573/text" target="_blank">legislation</a> that <a href="https://theconversation.com/congress-passes-legislation-that-will-close-off-presidential-election-mischief-and-help-avoid-another-jan-6-196204" target="_blank">sought to clarify how electoral votes are counted</a>.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Other electoral colleges</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>After the U.S. Constitution went into effect, the idea of using an electoral college to indirectly elect a president <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/706046/tyranny-of-the-minority-by-steven-levitsky-and-daniel-ziblatt/" target="_blank">spread</a> to other <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/republic" target="_blank">republics</a>.</p>
<p>For example, in the Americas, <a href="https://constitutionnet.org/sites/default/files/1821-grancolombiana.pdf" target="_blank">Colombia</a> adopted an electoral college in 1821. <a href="https://ciaotest.cc.columbia.edu/wps/klg/0028440/f_0028440_23119.pdf" target="_blank">Chile</a> adopted one in 1828. <a href="https://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Argentina/arg1853.html" target="_blank">Argentina</a> adopted one in 1853.</p>
<p>In Europe, <a href="https://www.presidentti.fi/en/presidency/election-of-the-president/" target="_blank">Finland</a> adopted an electoral college to elect its president in 1925, and <a href="https://www.elysee.fr/en/french-presidency/electing-presidents-of-the-french-republic" target="_blank">France</a> adopted an electoral college in 1958.</p>
<p>Over time, however, these countries changed their minds. All of them abandoned their electoral colleges and switched to directly electing their presidents by votes of the people. Colombia did so in 1910, Chile in 1925, France in 1965, Finland in 1994, and Argentina in 1995.</p>
<p>The U.S. is the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1057/9780230522749" target="_blank">only democratic presidential system</a> left that still uses an electoral college.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" id="iSxqP" class="tc-infographic-datawrapper" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/iSxqP/1/" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A &#8216;popular&#8217; alternative?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>There is an effort underway in the U.S. to <a href="https://theconversation.com/what-could-replace-the-electoral-college-138769" target="_blank">replace the Electoral College</a>. It may not even require amending the Constitution.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nationalpopularvote.com/written-explanation" target="_blank">National Popular Vote Interstate Compact</a>, currently agreed to by 17 U.S. states, including small states such as Delaware and big ones such as California, as well as the District of Columbia, is an agreement to award all of their electoral votes to whichever presidential candidate gets the most votes nationwide. It would take effect once enough states sign on that they would represent the 270-vote majority of electoral votes. The current list reaches 209 electoral votes.</p>
<p>A key problem with the interstate compact is that in races with more than two candidates, it could lead to situations where the winner of the election did not get a majority of the popular vote, but rather more than half of all voters chose someone else.</p>
<p>When Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Finland and France got rid of their electoral colleges, they did not replace them with a direct popular vote in which <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/plurality-system" target="_blank">the person with the most votes wins</a>. Instead, they all adopted <a href="https://theconversation.com/a-brief-history-of-georgias-runoff-voting-and-how-this-years-contest-between-two-black-men-is-a-sign-of-progress-194775" target="_blank">a version</a> of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0217650" target="_blank">runoff voting</a>. In those systems, winners are declared only when they receive support from more than half of those who cast ballots.</p>
<p>Notably, neither the U.S. Electoral College nor the interstate compact that seeks to replace it are systems that ensure that presidents are <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0262026" target="_blank">supported by a majority</a> of voters.</p>

(Photos courtesy of candidates' campaigns)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The election in Virginia’s 7th Congressional District is shaping up to be a tight contest, with two political newcomers vying for the support of swayable voters in one of the state’s most competitive districts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Eugene Vindman is taking on Republican Derrick Anderson in a race to succeed U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Prince William, who announced last year that she is not seeking reelection in favor of a 2025 gubernatorial bid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The district, anchored in Prince William County and stretching west to Madison County and south to Caroline County, has a history of narrow victories in past elections. With this being Vindman’s inaugural run for office and Anderson’s second foray into the 7th District race, both are working hard to connect with undecided voters who may swing the election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to their shared ambition to represent the district in the U.S. Congress, both candidates bring a strong record of military service to the table — a key theme in their respective campaigns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel and attorney, has emphasized his commitment to defending democracy and advocating for national security. Anderson, also a veteran, served as a Green Beret in the Army Special Forces and has focused his campaign on conservative values, including strengthening national defense and supporting law enforcement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was a troop leader paratrooper in the 82nd, and when we jumped out of airplanes, it didn&#8217;t matter who was to the left or right of us, who was Democrat, Republican or independent, or whether you’re Black, Hispanic, what part of the country you came from,” Vindman told The Mercury in a recent interview. “We’re focused on the mission, and that’s my mindset in everything that I do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson did not respond to repeated interview requests for this article. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Republican has aligned himself with former President Donald Trump’s Make America Great Again agenda and has expressed his support for at least some proposals in the conservative policy roadmap known as Project 2025, which outlines plans to reshape government and policy under a future Republican administration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Energy policy has also emerged as a significant point of debate between the two candidates, with each offering contrasting visions for the future of Virginia’s energy sector.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, both have taken clear stances on abortion and immigration. Vindman has emphasized the need to protect reproductive rights and seek comprehensive immigration reform, while Anderson has focused on more restrictive immigration policies and has voiced support for overturning federal protections for abortion.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Candidates’ backgrounds </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman’s family immigrated to the United States from Ukraine in 1979 when he was 3. He joined the Army’s 82nd Airborne division as a paratrooper before rising to lieutenant colonel and Judge Advocate General,,the highest-ranking uniformed lawyer in the military. He later joined the White House’s National Security Team. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman’s twin brother, Alex Vindman, became nationally known as a whistleblower who leaked details about a phone conversation betweenTrump and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine during his presidency, which led to Trump’s impeachment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman was </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/07/politics/alex-vindman-donald-trump-impeachment/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fired</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">by Trump in 2020. He was investigating war crimes in Ukraine when Spanberger announced her gubernatorial bid last year. Vindman dominated the Democratic nomination contest, garnering more than 50% of the vote in a seven-way </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/18/subramanyam-vindman-win-democratic-primaries-to-succeed-wexton-spanberger/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">primary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I thought to myself, I really care about which direction this country is going in,” Vindman explained as his primary reason for running.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson, who traces his beginnings to working at his mother’s restaurant, served in the Middle East in Afghanistan, Bahrain, Jordan, Israel, and Lebanon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He went on to work at the White House’s Office of National Drug Control Policy during the Trump administration and became a lawyer, before witnessing the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, which he said was “botched.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was upset with the lack of accountability for this administration,” Anderson said during an Oct. 2 candidates </span><a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?538743-1/virginia-7th-congressional-district-debate" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">debate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with Vindman at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">District profile</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger has represented the 7th District since 2019, after ousting U.S. Rep. Dave Brat, D-Henrico, by 50.3%-48.4%</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent Cook Report </span><a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/analysis/house/house-overview/house-rating-changes-close-races-nj-07-and-va-07-shift-toward" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has moved the district from “lean Democrat” to “toss up.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By June, Vindman had raised $7.4 million — over five times as much as Anderson, who raised $1.4 million. The Democratic National Committee recently backed Vindman’s effort with another $50,000. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The national support for candidates in the 7th District underscores the race’s significance in the broader political landscape. With Republicans holding a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives — 220 to 211 over Democrats — the outcome of this race could have far-reaching implications. Control of Congress will be pivotal in advancing or obstructing the agenda of the next president, whether it’s Trump or Harris.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The economy</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A September Pew Research </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/09/09/issues-and-the-2024-election/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> revealed that the economy is the top issue on voters&#8217; minds this election season, and both candidates offer contrasting approaches to addressing economic concerns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman has expressed worries about Trump’s policies and the potential impact of Project 2025 on the district’s workforce, which includes nearly </span><a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47716" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">60,000 federal employees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In contrast, Anderson has focused his campaign on energy policy, emphasizing the need for a strong energy sector to bolster the economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump’s own policy plan, Agenda 47, would remove about 100,000 of those jobs. George Mason University professor Terry Clower </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/30/trump-government-cuts-could-cost-house-republicans-majority-.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">estimated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the eliminated positions would equal a $27-28 billion loss from Virginia’s economy annually.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson, like Trump, publicly denies supporting Project 2025, which calls for major overhauls of the federal government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Folks, I did not know what Project 2025 was until this individual kept talking about it over and over again. But I can tell you that it’s not my plan,” Anderson </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtWw7ZqEkTI" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at a recent candidate’s forum at a Manassas middle school, referring to his opponent   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman has said he opposes Project 2025 because he doesn’t want to see it replace about 50,0000 “Schedule F” non-partisan federal employees with loyalists to whichever political party is in power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eliminating those jobs would literally devastate the economy in this area. It’s profoundly unfair, and it’s also damaging to national security,” Vindman said. “These are people that have spent decades in government, understanding threats, understanding Russia, China, or law enforcement, and (Project 2025 calls for) replacing them with partisan political hacks.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help people’s pocketbooks, Vindman suggested building off the work of Democratic President Joe Biden to cap medication prices, including insulin, by placing limits on a broader range of medications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Anderson, who said he understands that “there is climate change,” underscored that businesses have named electricity bills as their top expense, and that the economy could get back on track by prioritizing domestic production of energy. Anderson falsely claimed about 35 minutes into the UMW </span><a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?538743-1/virginia-7th-congressional-district-debate" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">debate</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that the country is a “net importer rather than a net exporter of oil.” According to the Energy Information Agency, a federal government tracker of energy trends, the U.S. in 2023 imported about 8.51 million barrels per day of oil from 86 countries, </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=727&amp;t=6" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">compared</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to exporting about 10.15 million barrels per day of oil.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Abortion</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abortion rights are another major issue for voters nationwide, and the candidates in the 7th District reflect opposing views. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman has called for restoring Roe v. Wade, advocating for federal protections for abortion rights. Anderson, on the other hand, has stated that while he does not support a national ban on abortion, he believes the decision should be left to individual states, allowing them to determine their own abortion laws.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are two fundamental questions in this race: Will you restore women’s right to reproductive health care, as it was under Roe v. Wade?” Vindman asked. “And will you stand against a national abortion ban? I will restore Roe v. Wade, and I will stand against the national abortion ban.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson, in the UMW debate, denied supporting a federal abortion ban, or taking away reproductive rights to in vitro fertilization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson also said he would support over the counter contraceptives, but in a previous </span><a href="https://starexponent.com/news/local/government-politics/elections/article_a5197e3e-7609-11ef-8e03-2bb78dfa980f.html#tncms-source=login" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">forum </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">for both the 7th and 10th congressional districts, he stopped short of saying if he would support a woman’s right to choose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I support the states to be able to make those decisions that best fits those states,” Anderson said at the time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson has falsely stated that former Gov. Ralph Northam supported infanticide, which is illegal in all 50 states. Northam was talking about </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/13/virginia-democrats-do-not-support-infanticide-but-heres-why-trump-keeps-saying-they-do/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">palliative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> care for babies born with complications during a 2019 interview that has been widely misquoted in every election cycle since.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Immigration</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On immigration, both candidates acknowledge issues at the U.S. southern border, but their approaches differ.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman has proposed reviving the Border Act of 2024, a federal measure aiming to address border security and immigration reform that nearly passed before </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/border-immigration-senate-vote-924f48912eecf1dc544dc648d757c3fe" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">being blocked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by congressional Republicans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In contrast, Anderson has emphasized the need for strong immigration and foreign policies to enhance community safety, but he has not offered a specific plan or proposal to address the issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with several other measures, the Senate proposal would have given the Department of Homeland Security emergency authority to shut down the border if daily migrant encounters reached 4,000 over a one-week span. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If those crossings rose to over 5,000 on average per day in a given week, DHS would be required to close the border to migrants crossing through ports of entry. Some migrants could stay if they proved they were escaping torture or prosecution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman said he would have supported the bill, which “would have been the toughest bill in decades, and we&#8217;re badly in need of comprehensive immigration reform.” </span></p>

Vance and Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will face off Tuesday night for a vice presidential debate, the final scheduled in-person exchange between the campaigns as polls continue to show a tight race just over five weeks out from November’s election.</p>
<p>The debate, hosted by CBS News, is scheduled to begin at 9 p.m. Eastern and last for 90 minutes. The event will air live on local CBS affiliate stations and stream on the CBS News app, CBSNews.com, YouTube and Paramount+.</p>
<p>The matchup between the running mates of former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris brings together two men who both claim congressional records and previous service in the U.S. armed forces.</p>
<p>The debate also comes as the southeastern U.S. <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-pledges-federal-help-states-southeast-stricken-catastrophic-storm" target="_blank">reels</a> from the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, which barreled inland as a tropical storm that brought record-breaking flooding and claimed more than 100 lives — a third of them in North Carolina, a swing state in the 2024 presidential election.</p>
<p>Republican National Committee and Trump campaign officials said Monday that Vance, Ohio’s junior senator, plans to attack Walz during the debate on several fronts, including tying Walz to the Biden administration.</p>
<p>“No amount of Minnesota nice is going to make up for the fact that Walz embodies the same disastrous economic, open-border and soft-on-crime (record) Harris has inflicted on our country over the last four years,” said Minnesota GOP Congressman Tom Emmer, who has been standing in as Walz during Vance’s debate prep.</p>
<p>“J.D. Vance is prepared to wipe the floor with Tim Walz and expose him for the radical liberal he is,” Emmer told reporters on a Monday morning call.</p>
<p>But Jason Miller, senior adviser for the Trump campaign, warned “Walz is very good at debates. I want to repeat that Tim Walz is very good in debates, really good. He’s been a politician for nearly 20 years.”</p>
<p>Trump <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/113227471530921481" target="_blank">posted</a> Monday on his Truth Social platform that he will be doing a “personal play by play” of the debate.</p>
<p>The Harris campaign has not revealed details about Walz’s debate preparation. CNN <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/28/politics/tim-walz-vice-president-debate/index.html" target="_blank">reported</a> that Walz is nervous and has been practicing with Department of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg as a stand-in for Vance.</p>
<p>Walz spent Saturday in Ann Arbor at the University of Michigan Wolverines vs. University of Minnesota Golden Gophers football game, where he was greeted by local elected officials and rallied students about the importance of the youth vote, according to the campaign.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Military service, China</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Trump campaign surrogates said debate watchers are guaranteed to see Vance attack Walz on his military service.</p>
<p>Vance touts his own four years in the U.S. Marine Corps from 2003 to 2007, during which he was <a href="https://www.armytimes.com/news/your-military/2024/08/06/jd-vance-represents-veterans-on-ballot-but-some-ask-at-what-cost/" target="_blank">deployed</a> to Iraq in 2005 as a military journalist.</p>
<p>The Trump campaign maintains Walz retired to avoid being deployed to Iraq. Trump campaign officials featured two veterans on Monday’s call who slammed Walz for being a “turncoat.”</p>
<p>“He deserted his post and his unit after 24 years of military service,” said Tom Behrends, a retired Command Sergeant Major for the Minnesota National Guard.</p>
<p>Walz, a former six-term congressman who represented the state’s 1st Congressional District, served in the Army National Guard for 24 years prior to running for office. He deployed to Italy between 2003 and 2004 to support Operation Enduring Freedom, a non-combat post.</p>
<p>A fact check by PolitiFact <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/aug/09/jd-vance/jd-vance-attacked-tim-walz-on-military-record-his/" target="_blank">found</a> he filed his candidacy paperwork in February 2005, a month before the Walz battalion was notified of possible deployment within two years. Walz filed retirement paperwork five to seven months before the deployment notification, according to the fact check.</p>
<p>Walz led a U.S. House resolution in 2007 to honor the Minnesota service members for their deployment to Iraq, <a href="https://www.nationalguard.mil/News/Article/573070/guard-unit-recognized-for-record-deployment/" target="_blank">according</a> to the National Guard.</p>
<p>Walz carries the distinction of being the highest-ranking enlisted soldier to ever serve in Congress, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/115/meeting/house/105558/witnesses/HHRG-115-HA00-Bio-WalzT-20170215.pdf" target="_blank">according</a> to his congressional biography published in 2017.</p>
<p>Walz suffered hearing loss and tinnitus after specializing in heavy artillery for two decades, according to Department of Veterans Affairs records he shared with journalists when running for governor in 2018.</p>
<p>He wrote in a 2013 benefits application that blasts “would knock us down and after firing I had ringing in my ears,” <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2018/10/03/tim-walz-national-guard-career-minnesota-governor-race" target="_blank">according</a> to the records reviewed by Minnesota Public Radio. Eventually Walz underwent surgery to improve his hearing loss.</p>
<p>Retired Sgt. 1st Class Tom Schilling, who joined the RNC call Monday, also attacked Walz’s trips to China and how the governor handled “the George Floyd thing,” referring to protests that rocked Minneapolis following the murder of Floyd, a Black man, by police.</p>
<p>“He had 30 trips to China that really haven’t been answered. As a governor, he let Minneapolis burn,” said Schilling, who served in the Minnesota National Guard.</p>
<p>Walz has said he’s proud of the way local, state and federal officials handled the protests in Minneapolis and St. Paul. Walz ordered full National Guard mobilization roughly three days into the protests. However, Democratic Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and state Republican officials both criticized parts of the response by Walz, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/walz-george-floyd-riots-minnesota-national-guard-2b9b0bf883828e0429c379843f16005d" target="_blank">according</a> to a review by The Associated Press.</p>
<p>Walz taught for a year in the southern China city of Foshan. As a public school teacher in Minnesota he then took students on annual trips to China. In the past he said he visited China <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXqY0Eb_QAI&amp;t=415s" target="_blank">30 times</a>. When pressed for documentation of the trips by <a href="https://www.apmreports.org/story/2024/09/30/tim-walz-experience-in-china" target="_blank">APM Reports</a>, the Harris campaign said his visits totaled “closer to 15.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump visits Helene’s destruction in Georgia</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Trump <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?538811-1/fmr-pres-trump-remarks-georgia-hurricane-helene" target="_blank">delivered</a> remarks Monday in front of a damaged furniture store in Valdosta, Georgia, wearing his signature red “Make America Great Again” hat.</p>
<p>“We’re here today to stand in complete solidarity with the people of Georgia, with all of those suffering in the terrible aftermath of Hurricane Helene,” Trump said, standing alongside American evangelist Franklin Graham, who was coordinating the delivery of supplies.</p>
<p>Trump also said the presidential campaigns should take a backseat to the storm response. “We’re not talking about politics now, we have to all get together and get this solved.”</p>
<p>Moments later he stated falsely that Biden had not taken calls from Georgia’s Republican Gov. Brian Kemp. Biden had spoken with Kemp by phone Sunday.</p>
<p>Journalists traveling with Harris in Las Vegas, Nevada, reported in the wee hours of Monday that the vice president was canceling her campaign events to return to Washington. D.C., to be briefed on the response to Helene.</p>
<p>Harris issued a statement Saturday saying that her “heart goes out to everyone impacted by the devastation unleashed by Hurricane Helene.</p>
<p>“Doug and I are thinking of those who tragically lost their lives and we are keeping all those who loved them in our prayers during the difficult days ahead. President Biden and I remain committed to ensuring that no community or state has to respond to this disaster alone,” she continued.</p>
<p>At his campaign rally Sunday in Erie, Pennsylvania, Trump criticized Harris for being in San Francisco “at fundraising events with her Radical Left lunatic donors, when big parts of our country have been devastated by that massive hurricane and are underwater, with many, many people dead.”</p>

<p>President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-pledges-federal-help-states-southeast-stricken-catastrophic-storm" target="_blank">delivered</a> remarks from the White House early Monday and pledged federal support to the affected areas. Biden has already issued <a href="https://www.fema.gov/disaster/declarations?page=0" target="_blank">emergency declarations</a> for Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia. He also said he would visit the storm-ravaged areas as soon as his motorcade would not get in the way of response efforts.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Republicans for Harris</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The Harris campaign continues to tout its growing endorsements from Republicans.</p>
<p>Former conservative Sen. Jeff Flake, of Arizona, announced his endorsement of Harris over the weekend.</p>
<p>“I’ve served with Kamala in the U.S. Senate. I’ve also served with Tim in the House of Representatives. I know them. I know first hand of their fine character and love of country,” Flake <a href="https://x.com/JeffFlake/status/1840347576823902338" target="_blank">wrote</a> on X Sunday.</p>
<p>Republican Voters Against Trump also announced on Sunday a new multi-million-dollar ad blitz in swing states.</p>
<p>The group launched a $5.8 million ad campaign in Pennsylvania’s Philadelphia, Harrisburg and Pittsburgh media markets. The ad launch is part of a $15 million campaign that will also reach <a href="https://azmirror.com/briefs/anti-trump-gop-group-hopes-to-convince-arizona-republicans-to-back-harris/" target="_blank">Arizona</a>, Michigan and Wisconsin, according to a press release.</p>
<p>“Many swing voters are going to be making up their minds in the coming weeks, and it’s critical that we let them know what’s at stake,” Sarah Longwell, the political action committee’s executive director, said in a statement.</p>
<p>“You can repudiate him without renouncing your deeply held conservative values. We’re here to help establish a permission structure for right-leaning swing voters to do the right thing and vote their conscience,” the statement continued.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Ahead on the campaign trail</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Trump is scheduled Saturday to <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/election-2024/trump-to-hold-rally-at-pennsylvania-site-where-he-survived-assassination-attempt/" target="_blank">return</a> to Butler, Pennsylvania — the location of the first attempt on his life, during which he suffered a non-life-threatening ear injury and one spectator was killed by gunfire while two others were severely injured.</p>
<p>Trump also plans to hold a town hall Thursday in Fayetteville, North Carolina, well east of the devastation caused by Helene.</p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce for The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal judges in the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond on Tuesday appeared sympathetic to the plaintiffs in a case challenging Virginia’s disenfranchisement of people with felony convictions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a federal district judge </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/18/judge-rules-suit-against-virginia-felon-disenfranchisement-rule-can-proceed/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">allowed the challenge to move forward</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> earlier this year, alleging that </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/youngkin-voting-rights-aclu-virginia/article_90a9275e-e565-11ee-8466-3ff35b49eb1c.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has been out of compliance with a Reconstruction-era federal law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the 4th Circuit had a hearing on the state’s attempt to toss the case. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deputy Solicitor General Kevin Gallagher, in defense of the state, said the “unique” and old federal statute “is not something that people are trying to enforce.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defendants include Gov. Glenn Youngkin, the Secretary of the Commonwealth — who was Kay Coles James when the suit was first filed — and several election officials. Tuesday’s hearing was part of their interlocutory appeal limited to whether Virginia is entitled to sovereign immunity — basically, whether or not the state and its agents can be found to have done wrong or not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An interlocutory appeal is a type of appeal that can be filed while a case is active and before a final judgment. Neither the interlocutory appeal nor the Readmission Act case have been ruled on yet. And though the appeal was the point of Tuesday’s meeting, discussion veered into the Readmission case. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latter is focused on the 1870 Virginia Readmission Act, a federal law that allowed Virginia, a former Confederate state, to rejoin the U.S. Congress. Similar laws were also employed as other formerly Confederate states rejoined, with the condition that states’ constitutions could not be used to deprive anyone of voting rights, “except as punishment for such crimes that are now felonies at common law.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Common law” felonies were defined as a limited set of crimes, whereas today people with any felony conviction in Virginia permanently lose the right to vote unless a governor restores it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our claim is that essentially, Virginia made a promise when it was brought back into the United States Congress. It’s now time to keep that promise and to abide by the Virginia Readmission Act,” said ACLU attorney Vishal Agraharkar in a call with The Mercury on Monday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the defendants’ filing argues that Congress lacks the power to prohibit states from disenfranchising people with felony convictions under the Fourteenth Amendment in the U.S. Constitution and that states could choose to permanently disenfranchise people with felonies of all types, not just those in common law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the Tuesday hearing, Judge Roger Gregory noted Congress’ intent when using the Readmission Acts following the Civil War. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“(Congress) knew what (formerly-Confederate states) were going to do to newly-freed persons — they didn’t trust them,” Gregory said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gallager argued that the act was more limited to that time as a “contract between Congress and Virginia” to reenter the Union. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ACLU is working on the case with the WilmerHale law firm and a voting rights group called Protect Democracy. Plaintiffs are Virginians with felony convictions who have tried to have their rights restored by Youngkin without success. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while it’s Virginia’s constitution which grants governors purview over restoration of rights that is at the core of the Readmission Act case, Youngkin has been at the center of legal challenges to restorations under his administration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A once automatic process, Youngkin’s administration adjusted it last year to a petition-based one. As </span><a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/local/virginia/virginians-whose-rights-have-been-restored-drops-in-second-year-of-youngkin-administration-reports-show/291-fbe59fc9-c488-4449-be3e-ad4c0ba1c374" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">restoration numbers have dropped</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> under his tenure as governor, </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/judge-finds-for-youngkin-administration-in-naacps-foia-case/article_210d11ec-9936-11ee-a87e-138606562546.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">various lawsuits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have sprung up </span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/virginia-news/judge-rejects-lawsuit-but-compares-youngkins-power-to-restore-voting-rights-to-a-kings/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seeking answers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about criteria for restorations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a case by a man who sought answers about his restoration rejection was dismissed, the judge presiding over that case opined that “much like a monarch, the governor receives petitions for relief, may or may not rule upon them, and, when he does rule, need not explain his reasons.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judge Gregory was curious about criteria Tuesday as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do we know what the governor’s role is, really?” he posited. “Do we have facts, depositions about how that works and ‘how does he filter them out?’” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then suggested that a deposition would be the “best way” to glean information “for the only person that can restore rights.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court made no decision on the merits of the interlocutory appeal. From there, the Readmission Act case could potentially continue to be discussed and advance closer to a ruling. </span></p>

<p dir="ltr">Richard Keech is deputy director of elections for Loudoun County, where 224,862 <a href="https://historical.elections.virginia.gov/elections/view/144567/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://historical.elections.virginia.gov/elections/view/144567/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1727200847642000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1eUAeX-9172P0ESKRZSMN0">votes </a>were cast for president in the 2020 November election, according to state election results. Keech has worked in elections for 16 years and been in his current position since March 2011, he stated.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Two Loudoun voters previously took claims of election fraud to <a href="https://www.loudountimes.com/news/government/trump-supporters-file-suit-claiming-loudoun-uses-illegally-certified-electronic-voting-machines/article_82fa846c-5af2-11ed-beba-5bfaf62d1b30.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.loudountimes.com/news/government/trump-supporters-file-suit-claiming-loudoun-uses-illegally-certified-electronic-voting-machines/article_82fa846c-5af2-11ed-beba-5bfaf62d1b30.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1727200847642000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0h7sHgaLCd9r1ius4MrUZa">court</a>, but the lawsuit was dismissed. The allegations were that the voting machines were not certified and not secure. There was no evidence to substantiate the claims, according to Keech.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A lack of voter knowledge about how elections operate has caused anxiety and fear in the general population, according to Keech.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“There comes a point where we have to tell our story,” Keech said. “We have to tell the truth. We have to be transparent. We have to be up front about what we’re doing to provide safe, secure and efficient elections.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Loudoun officials worked to combat this dynamic and make voters feel confident. Election officials shared more behind the scenes videos, and hosted walk-throughs of their office for the public, according to Loudoun communications manager Samantha Shepherd.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Repeat election volunteers can get specialized training in courses such as technology, help desk training and advance precinct management, according to Keech.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The lack of education around how elections occur is mind boggling to me,” Keech said. “There’s this vision that it’s all occurring on the internet and all these various actors are involved, and the reality is that it’s your friends and your neighbors [who volunteer].”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Citizens are encouraged to ask questions and look at their locality’s website for more information, Keech said.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">CITY OF RICHMOND</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Keith Balmer is the general registrar of the City of Richmond, where 111,159 votes were cast for president in the 2020 November election. Virginia has an election every year, so officials are experienced with the procedures, he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The way we prepare for this election is really no different than any of the elections,” said Balmer, who has 14 years of experience in this field and three years serving as general registrar.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Preparation includes testing, hiring and training &#8212; and more testing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We test a lot of ballots,” Balmer said. “We are talking hundreds, and this election we&#8217;re talking thousands of test ballots to get tested into our machines.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">A test election is run with filled-out ballots to certify the machine is counting correctly, Balmer said. This process occurs for every election.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Any citizens concerned about the validity of the electoral process should volunteer, so they can get a front row seat of the process, Balmer said. Possible positions include pollbook officer, ballot officer and overseeing the voting equipment and booths.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“You get to see there&#8217;s so many checks and balances here in place, that you&#8217;re going to walk away convinced that there&#8217;s zero fraud going on around here,” Balmer said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The city will need about 1,200 officers, or about 15 per precinct, according to Balmer. Staffing is important to help avoid long lines and ensure a smooth process, he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Getting poll workers has always been challenging because of the long 16 to 18-hour shifts, Balmer said. He pushed for a stipend increase for volunteers, from $120 to $200.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Election officials are focused on the process, not the results, Balmer said. The doubt cast toward election officials in recent years has been “deeply hurtful” and caused people to leave.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">YORK COUNTY</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Walter Latham is the general registrar of York County, where 38,787 votes were cast for president in the 2020 November election.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Voters have questioned the electoral process since at least 2000, according to Latham. That election, between candidates George W. Bush and Al Gore, resulted in a Florida vote recount that ultimately went to the U.S. Supreme Court. Latham does think maybe it became “more intense after 2020.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It’s a public process, the elections belong to the people of the country,” Latham said. “They have a right to have questions and they have a right to have them answered.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Candidate certification deadlines could be set earlier to allow for more time to proof, print and test ballots, he said. The state <a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/media/candidatesandpacs/2024-president-candidate-and-party-docs/2023-11-05-Presidential-Independent-and-Third-Party-Candidates-Bulletin_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.elections.virginia.gov/media/candidatesandpacs/2024-president-candidate-and-party-docs/2023-11-05-Presidential-Independent-and-Third-Party-Candidates-Bulletin_FINAL.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1727200847642000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3ReLts-I_FjhlObHVM18k1">deadline </a>for changes for third-party presidential candidates was Sept. 6, two weeks before early voting began.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Standard election preparation includes proofing ballots to ensure all candidate names are spelled correctly and in the correct order, per the Virginia Board of Elections, according to Latham. Then machines are programmed and tested for accuracy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Election officer training is state mandated, with training held in person no more than 30 days before the election and no less than three, according to Latham.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Latham said they are “blessed” to have a good number of volunteers for Election Day, many who are returning to the role.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We try to rely on the ones we have because we appreciate their knowledge and skill and dedication,” Latham said. “Because they work a long day for not a lot of money.”</p>

With the outcome expected to be close, these “swing states” may decide the future of the country.</em></p>
<p>It’s been a wild few months in the presidential race: President Joe Biden dropped out and Vice President Kamala Harris captured the Democratic nomination. Former President Donald Trump survived an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania and was targeted again at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida.</p>
<p>Despite the historic lead-up to Election Day, the race has now settled into familiar territory: Much like 2020’s contest, top political strategists on both sides of the aisle expect control of the White House could come down to just a few thousand votes in a handful of battleground states.</p>
<p>“This is not going to be an election where you will see a landslide. It’s going to be won in the margins in six to seven swing states,” Democratic strategist Donna Brazile told a crowd of state lawmakers from across the country last month.</p>
<p>Brazile, who ran Al Gore’s 2000 presidential campaign, shared the stage with Republican strategist Kellyanne Conway, who managed Trump’s 2016 campaign and advised him in the White House.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the pair disagreed on much.</p>
<p>But while speaking at the National Conference of State Legislatures in Kentucky, the two senior strategists framed the race similarly to the 2020 contest, when <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/11/25/937248659/president-elect-biden-hits-80-million-votes-in-year-of-record-turnout" target="_blank">fewer than 50,000 votes</a> in Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin separated Biden and Trump from an Electoral College tie.</p>
<p>“It is a different race. It has turned in very short time, but the issue set hasn’t changed at all,” Conway said. “And I think that’s what’s important here.”</p>
<p>Like last cycle, the two campaigns are pouring millions into Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p>
<p>In “The Deciders” series, States Newsroom, the nation’s largest state-focused nonprofit news organization, explores the political issues and groups of voters that could make the difference in those seven states and, consequentially, in the race for the White House.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, economic issues <sub>—</sub> namely, stubbornly high prices — are proving central for many voters across the swing states. But voters also are concerned about immigration, abortion access and the future of the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>In states such as Michigan and Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, labor unions could prove instrumental for Harris after years of significant gains by organized labor.</p>
<p>In Georgia and North Carolina, Black voter turnout could make the difference, while Latino voters are closely divided in Nevada after helping propel Biden to victory there four years ago. In every swing state, campaigns are focused on all-important suburban voters.</p>
<p>The election’s outcome also could be shaped by the work of officials who have been debating who can vote and which votes should count since the mayhem of the last presidential contest.</p>
<p>Four years ago, a false narrative that questioned the security and integrity of elections took hold in some legislatures. New laws changed ballot-counting practices and made it more difficult to vote in many states, including swing states. In states such as Michigan and Wisconsin, there is broad concern that despite the checks and balances built into the voting system, local Republicans tasked with certifying elections will be driven by conspiracy theories and refuse to fulfill their duties if Trump loses again.</p>
<p>Fears that these efforts could sow chaos and delay results is not unfounded: Over the past four years, county officials in the swing states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada and Pennsylvania have refused to certify certain local elections.</p>
<p>With such a close race, voter turnout and motivation will be key in all the battleground states.</p>
<p>As in other swing states, North Carolina’s 16 Electoral College votes could hinge on how political independents vote, said Carter Wrenn, a longtime Republican strategist who has worked on many campaigns.</p>
<p>And those independents can be unpredictable in North Carolina: Their votes helped both Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper and Trump carry the state in the last two general elections.</p>
<p>“It’s the independents that are up for grabs, and they don’t mind splitting a ticket at all,” Wrenn said. “Ultimately, in the general election, that’s the key group.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The economy</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In every state this year, the economy is a central issue.</p>
<p>As Trump tries to fault Harris and Biden for the high costs of everyday living, polling shows voters blame Harris less for the situation than they did Biden — though likely voters profess more confidence in Trump’s ability to manage the economy.</p>
<p>For her part, Harris has unveiled plans to <a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2024/08/16/harris-unveils-plan-to-curb-price-gouging-boost-child-tax-credit-tackle-rent-hikes/" target="_blank">lower prices of rent, homebuying and groceries, </a>arguing she will remain focused on the middle class from Day One, contrasting her ideas with what she characterizes as Trump’s catering to billionaires.</p>
<p>In Georgia, Republicans and Democrats alike have found success in recent statewide campaigns by highlighting similar kitchen table issues. After attending a Harris rally in Savannah last month, Georgia voter Sarah Damato said she doesn’t believe Trump will fight for the middle class.</p>
<p>At the event, the vice president told listeners she would lower costs by fighting corporate price-fixing and touted her proposal for a “care economy,” a set of progressive proposals including benefits for parents of newborns and credits for first-time homebuyers.</p>
<p>“Kamala Harris made it very evident today that the American family is the most important thing on her mind these days, and she’s going to make it easier for each one of us to have a brighter future,” Damato said.</p>
<p>In Kenosha, Wisconsin, meanwhile, Republican Party volunteer Sharon Buege said she supports the GOP ticket because she sees the race as a matter of “good versus evil.” Speaking outside a news conference by Trump running mate J.D. Vance, Buege said she opposed “the whole left agenda,” adding that her top issues in the race were border security, the economy, human trafficking, homelessness and “indoctrination” in public schools.</p>
<p>At that same news conference, a man who would only give his name as “John” said the economy and inflation mattered most: “I don’t need a reminder of why to support Trump. I can get that every time I go to the gas station or grocery store.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Groups of voters</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>With Republicans looking to run up margins in rural parts of the battleground states and Democrats banking on big leads in cities, the suburbs remain pivotal.</p>
<p>In Georgia, diverse and growing suburbs have helped move the state from reliably red to purple.</p>
<p>In the state’s two largest suburban counties of Cobb and Gwinnett, Biden picked up more than 137,000 votes in 2020 over 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, according to data from the Georgia Secretary of State’s office. The same year, Trump boosted his total by just under 32,000 votes over his 2016 performance.</p>
<p>The Trump campaign boasts a mighty in-state operation: nearly 15,000 volunteers signing up between mid-July and the end of August, nearly 300 events scheduled for September, and 4,000 neighborhood organizers and canvassers — known as Trump Force Captains — joining the cause in July and August.</p>
<p>But Team Harris says they are running the largest Georgia operation of any Democratic presidential campaign cycle, with more than 200 campaign staff in 28 offices. Harris’ recent visit to the more conservative south side of the state marked her 16th trip to Georgia since becoming vice president and her seventh trip this year.</p>
<p>Harris is hoping to fire up the young, diverse Democratic base, but her team also is hoping she can hang onto or expand on Biden’s coalition of older, affluent, educated and largely white suburbanites.</p>
<p>“Those are the people who are actually kind of pivotal and who will modify or change their behavior,” said University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock.</p>
<p>“These people are largely Republicans, but they can’t bring themselves to vote for Donald Trump or for Republicans who are closely associated with him,” Bullock said.</p>
<p>Larry Ceisler, a Philadelphia public affairs executive and political analyst, said the four suburban Philadelphia counties surrounding Pennsylvania’s largest city are key to winning that state. Once a Republican bastion, the so-called collar counties of Bucks, Chester, Delaware and Montgomery have swung strongly in the other direction since 2016.</p>
<p>That complicates messaging for both campaigns, Ceisler said. Trump’s anti-abortion stance and Harris’ effort to back away from her earlier statements against fracking — both positions that appeal to rural and western Pennsylvania voters — are potential liabilities in suburbs.</p>
<p>Democrats have a 343,000-voter registration advantage over Republicans in Pennsylvania. But the state has been decided by narrow margins in the last two presidential elections.</p>
<p>Daniel Mallinson, an associate professor of public policy and administration at Penn State Harrisburg, noted that the Trump campaign has paid attention to Black and Latino voters.</p>
<p>“One of the weaknesses that Biden had as a candidate was he had weakening support among African American voters. And then Trump has actually done fairly well, particularly in some other states, like in Florida, with Latino voters,” Mallinson said, adding that Harris’ nomination changes the equation somewhat.</p>
<p>After Democrats seemingly all but wrote off Arizona for Biden, the contest there is proving more winnable for Harris. Biden narrowly won Arizona in 2020, but he had been hemorrhaging Latino support this year.</p>
<p>In the manufacturing-heavy upper Midwest, labor unions could prove consequential in not only persuading voters but also motivating them to the polls.</p>
<p>Biden was the first sitting president to visit a picket line when the United Auto Workers last year took on the “Big Three” Detroit automakers — Ford, General Motors and Stellantis — by going on strike. That effort led to significant increases in pay and benefits for workers.</p>
<p>The UAW, which in August announced <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/2024/08/14/uaw-kamala-harrris-campaign-money/74799278007/" target="_blank">a national campaign</a> to motivate its 1 million active and retired members to vote for Harris, says its membership accounted for 9.2% of Biden’s 2020 votes in Michigan alone.</p>
<p>“To me, this election is real simple,” UAW president Shawn Fain <a href="https://michiganadvance.com/2024/08/08/in-detroit-harris-and-walz-talk-about-the-midwest-the-middle-class-and-voters-in-the-middle/" target="_blank">told a crowd</a> of about 15,000 people last month at a rally in Detroit for Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. “It’s about one question. It’s a question we made famous in the labor movement: Which side are you on?”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Political weaknesses </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>While Democrats are more motivated than when Biden was the presumptive nominee, they still face internal conflicts, the most high-profile of which has been about the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.</p>
<p>Dee Sull, a Las Vegas attorney who works in immigration and family law, is a registered Democrat who said she would never vote for Trump. Yet she doesn’t really want to vote for Harris, leaving her “very torn” this election.</p>
<p>“I believe our foreign policy in Gaza is completely ridiculous. I’m very disturbed,” she said of U.S. military aid to Israel. “If we’re going to spend money, I want it spent on my kids here — on my neighbors’ kids here.”</p>
<p>Sull said both parties have silenced the voices of those who protest the death and destruction in Gaza. And she was irritated that Palestinian American activists were not allowed to speak at the Democratic National Convention last month.</p>
<p>Sull won’t sit out the election, but said she would prefer to vote for a third candidate with a viable shot at winning.</p>
<p>“Probably like a lot of Americans would if they had that opportunity,” she said.</p>
<p>For Trump, voters’ overwhelming support for abortion rights could prove a huge liability in swing states.</p>
<p>While Trump has wobbled in recent months on whether he would veto a national abortion ban, the Supreme Court justices he appointed dismantled abortion access across the country in 2022 — an unpopular position even in red states such as Kansas, Kentucky and Ohio that since have voted to expand abortion rights.</p>
<p>In Wisconsin, Planned Parenthood stopped offering abortions at its health clinics after the court’s Dobbs decision because of an 1849 “trigger” state law that immediately took effect. Wisconsin women lost all abortion services there for a year and a half, until a court re-interpreted the state law.</p>
<p>This summer’s shakeup has reset the race, said Amy Walter, publisher of The Cook Political Report, an independent, nonpartisan newsletter that analyzes elections. So far, likely voters in the swing states view Harris more favorably than Biden, she said. But with Trump benefiting from an electorate skeptical of the state of the economy, the newsletter characterized the race as “a battle of inches.”</p>
<p>The campaigns both face a lot of voters who are disenchanted with politics altogether, or else unhappy with their options.</p>
<p>Amy Tarkanian, a conservative television commentator who once lauded Trump to national audiences and was chair of the Nevada State Republican Party in 2011-12, said she’s at “a complete loss” this year. She remains a Republican, even after the state party heavily criticized her when, two years ago, she endorsed a pair of Democratic candidates for state offices.</p>
<p>“I’m not happy, or necessarily sold on Kamala,” Tarkanian said. “… But I absolutely do not want to vote for Donald Trump.”</p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commissioner of Elections Susan Beals on Wednesday expressed concerns with the operational performance of the U.S. Postal Service ahead of the 2024 presidential election in Virginia, warning that mail-in ballots may not be processed in time to be counted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Election officials depend on the U.S. mail service to deliver ballots to voters and to return ballots to election officials,” Beals told members of the Virginia House of Delegates Privileges and Elections Committee at a meeting in Richmond. “What I am hoping to change is the expectation of voters, that if I put my ballot in the mail five days before election day that it is going to get there. You need to plan further out than that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals, who was </span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/virginia-news/youngkin-appoints-susan-beals-as-virginias-new-elections-commissioner/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">appointed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as Virginia’s commissioner of election by Gov. Glenn Youngkin in March 2022, responded to a question by Del. Phillip Scott, R-Fredericksburg, who had asked what she considered “the biggest threat” to the upcoming election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals said since before the 2023 election cycle, the Department of Elections has seen issues with mail-in ballots cast by voters who had been living in the same house for decades.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For example, the registrar tries to mail you a ballot and it gets mailed back to the registrar with one of those yellow stickers,” Beals said. “We had some cases where voters were trying to mail their ballot to an elections office and it’s being returned to the voter. We’ve had long delivery times and we’ve had examples of ballots that were sitting in the processing centers for days.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Postal Service has faced significant challenges in delivering mail-in ballots on time since the 2020 presidential election. The surge in mail-in voting due to the COVID-19 pandemic strained the postal system, leading to delays and concerns about the timely counting of votes. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week during a </span><a href="https://www.newsweek.com/postal-service-outlines-plans-mail-ballots-1946552" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">news conference</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Postal Service outlined its preparations for the “secure and successful delivery of election mail” in the Nov. 5 general election and briefed U.S. House and Senate committee staff of its preparedness to deliver the nation’s ballots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our letter carriers and facilities teams across the country, the 640,000 women and men of the Postal Service, are fully focused on the critical mission of delivering the nation’s election mail — just as we have done so excellently through this current primary season and as we have done in the past,” Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But despite these efforts to improve operations, issues such as staffing shortages, operational changes, and the sheer volume of ballots have continued to cause problems during more recent elections in many states — including in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals told the committee on Wednesday that her department first started raising concerns with the Postal Service prior to the 2023 election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia was a little bit of a canary (in a) coal mine on the issue of USPS and their performance because we had that statewide election in 2023, and a lot of other states did not, that’s their off-year,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the department started hearing from registrars about issues with mail ballots not being delivered to voters, not receiving them back in time, and ballots coming back as being undeliverable to voters who had not changed their address in years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We immediately reached out to USPS, we had an in-person meeting prior to the November election, and another in-person meeting after the election,” Beals said. But when the concerns remained, Beals requested to meet with members of Virginia’s congressional delegation and with representatives of both U.S. Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, D-Va., on Capitol Hill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They sent me immediately to their committees to detail the types of issues that we were seeing in Virginia,” Beals said, adding that she additionally flagged the mail delivery problems with the National Association of State Election Directors </span><a href="https://www.nased.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(NASED)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the U.S. Postal Regulatory Commission, an independent agency overseeing the operations of the Postal Service.</span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s been frustrating for us because every time we’ve raised these issues we were assured that they were going to be addressed, and then the subsequent elections weren’t necessarily seeing them get addressed, we’re still seeing some of the same issues,” Beals told the committee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokesman for the Postal Service in Virginia did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment Wednesday. But according to </span><a href="https://about.usps.com/newsroom/national-releases/2024/0829-election-mail-webinar.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data released</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the agency last week, nationally, the Postal Service in 2022 delivered 99.89% of ballots from voters to election officials within seven days. The 2022 midterm elections saw a similar level of on-time performance, with 99.93% of ballots delivered within the same timeframe. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Del. Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax, a member of the committee, cautioned against drawing conclusions before more data on mail-in voting in Virginia is available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think it’s important that we don’t scare the voters into thinking that this is not a safe and valid way to vote, because absentee balloting has been a hallmark of our democracy,” Krizek said in a brief interview Wednesday. “I think it’s a very important form of voting and I’d hate to see it go away or people be afraid to do it.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals’ message to Virginians planning to vote by mail this year is to not wait until the last minute to request and mail back their ballot — and to stay on top of the process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Make sure that once you request your ballot and it’s been a week or two, go ahead and call your registrar’s office and ask where it is. And as soon as you receive it, turn it around and put it back in the mail, don’t let it sit,” Beals said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know folks sometimes get their ballot and sometimes let it marinate and think about it, but you can’t do that this year. You need to make sure that you mail it back or you can drop it at a dropbox at your registrar’s office or at a polling location on Election Day.” </span></p>

Bob Good, R-Campbell, speaks at a campaign rally in Powhatan County. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even after an additional review of the recount results in the GOP primary in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District last week </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/28/outcome-of-5th-district-gop-primary-unchanged-after-further-review-of-ballots/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">confirmed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> state Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland, as the winner, some Republican hardliners in the district refuse to accept the former Navy SEAL who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump as their party’s nominee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, they have vowed to write in U.S. Rep. Bob Good, R-Farmville, the incumbent, who lost what has been deemed one of the most expensive and viciously fought nomination battles nationwide this year by a mere 366 votes out of more than 62,000 cast.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Outcome of 5th District GOP primary unchanged after further review of ballots&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/28/outcome-of-5th-district-gop-primary-unchanged-after-further-review-of-ballots/embed/#?secret=pft4Xcx0mI#?secret=m3uVfZfHcX" data-secret="m3uVfZfHcX" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Anyone with the right moral conviction would write in Bob Good, one of the 10 true conservatives left in Congress,” said Rob Reese, owner of the Virginia Archery Center in Goochland County and a member of a group of self-described “real conservatives” who are encouraging fellow Republicans in the district to write in Good on Nov. 5.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a phone interview Tuesday, Reese painted McGuire as a RINO, a​​ derogatory moniker meaning “Republican In Name Only,” who was handpicked by the GOP establishment in Washington, D.C., as part of an effort to replace true conservatives in Congress. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The swamp has been trying to get rid of every conservative that they can get their hands on,” Reese said. The Republican Party — in Virginia and on the national level — “pulled the same garbage in District 5 that the Democrats pulled” when they replaced President Joe Biden with Vice President Kamala Harris as their presidential nominee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They just hid it better. You don’t primary the most conservative Congress member and replace him with a uni-party yes-boy,” Reese said, adding that the number of Republicans who insist on making Good their nominee has continued to grow despite the incumbent’s failed recount challenge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s thousands of us, enough to cause McGuire to lose the election unless he ponies up and talks to the people,” Reese said. “This isn’t a we-win game to me, it’s about the republic, and people taking the republic back from D.C., and I think they are more in a panic than they can believe.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the district’s Republicans air their differences on social media — like the Facebook group </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/Va5thDistrictGOP/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia&#8217;s 5th Congressional District GOP Voters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and even Good’s own campaign account on the platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Responding to </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/17EToxdKG3/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a post from Good</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from last week in which he thanked </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the judges for their efforts to “address some mistakes that had been identified after the recount,” several of his supporters chimed in, thanking him for his service and encouraging others to join the write-in effort.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Folks … write in Good for Congress! Express your anger, don’t vote McGuire, write in Bob! Mount the write in campaign, don’t let McGuire win that seat,” one commenter wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another told Good to “keep up the good work … and folks, please write Bob Good in come November, he’s the only choice we have for America First conservative constitutional representation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The comment prompted a response from a McGuire supporter: “Why do you keep telling people to write Bob in, are you trying to get a Democrat control? Cause that will happen if McGuire doesn’t receive all Republican votes. Bob Good lost, don’t have our state lose.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire will face Democrat Gloria Witt, a businesswoman and native of Amherst County, in the Nov. 5 election. Witt is fighting an uphill battle in a heavily Republican district where  Trump won twice with 53% of the vote in 2016 and 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a significant amount of write-ins splitting the Republican vote could potentially put the district in play for Democrats, said David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The 5th is a tricky district, it is clearly Republican-leaning, but the margin of the win has been all over the place. And in 2008 the Democratic Party won it by 800 votes, so I don’t think the McGuire campaign can just ignore a write-in effort on behalf of Bob Good,” Richards said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And McGuire is facing several headwinds in his general election campaign, Richards added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is the write-in campaign, ill-will left over from the primary, a small but vocal </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/03/va-republican-voters-officials-press-for-harris-over-trump/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans for Kamala Harris</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> effort, a muted campaign so far from McGuire, a very active campaign from Democrat Gloria Witt, and general national excitement among Democrats that may elevate Democratic turnout. It is not clear that all of this will add up to enough to swing the district, but it certainly makes it more likely.”</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="GKuITNBkSL"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/03/va-republican-voters-officials-press-for-harris-over-trump/">Va. Republican voters, officials press for Harris over Trump</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It remains unclear if the write-in effort by Good supporters would trigger Virginia’s so-called </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/27/2023-elections-bring-new-scrutiny-of-virginias-sore-loser-rule/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sore loser law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which was designed to ensure that when a candidate is defeated in a Republican or Democratic primary, they can’t drop their party affiliation and appear on the general election ballot next to the person who beat them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rich Anderson, the chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia, said in a phone interview Tuesday that under state party rules, “any member of a subunit of RPV who supports a candidate against a nominated Republican” is deemed to have resigned from the Republican Party and is prohibited from engaging in any party activity for a period of four years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That is a rule that I must and will enforce stringently in this or any future election cycle,” Anderson said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sean Brown, a spokesman for McGuire’s campaign, said while  McGuire “is working hard to deliver Virginia for Donald Trump and build a conservative majority in the House and Senate,” Good and a “very small handful of his supporters” continue to undermine Trump. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For the sake of the country, Bob should put his personal ambitions and hard feelings towards President Trump aside, and work to elect Trump and Trump-backed candidates,” Brown said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Good himself has not mounted a write-in campaign, and he has remained silent on the ongoing effort by his supporters. His campaign spokeswoman Diana Shores on Tuesday echoed Anderson’s remarks about the party rules and code of conduct. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Individuals who are members of their local units are bound by the party plan to support the nominees. I am urging all Republicans to stay engaged with their Republican committees to do the work that needs to be done,” Shores said in a text message. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin has also vowed to step up and rally in support of McGuire in the 5th District, where the two will be joined by Anderson and Hung Cao, the Republican nominee for U.S. Senate in Virginia, at four events in Amherst, Bedford and Pittsylvania counties and the town of Altavista on Monday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matt Moran, the executive Director of Youngkin’s Spirit of Virginia PAC, said in a statement that the governor is “committed to bringing Republicans together around our nominees so we can win in November,” but he stopped short of singling out the grassroots write-in campaign for Good in the 5th District as a concern for McGuire’s bid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He’s campaigning with Republicans across Virginia on why we need strong leadership back in the White House and in Congress,” Moran said of Youngkin. “We are confident that Republicans are united as our campaigns gear up for the fall.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the governor’s efforts will likely fall on deaf ears among some of Good’s most loyal supporters who have long made up their minds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among them is Russ Simpson, owner of the Apple Shed &amp; Chapel in Lovingston, who said that McGuire lost his vote because he did not debate Good during his primary campaign. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you’re running for office to represent me, you damn well better be a fighter. If you’re not willing to fight and to debate, then I’m not interested in supporting you, whether you’re a Republican or whatever,” Simpson said in a phone interview. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While he doesn’t support the policies of the Democratic Party, he is not willing to vote for a candidate just because he has an R by his name, Simpson added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s going to be a lot of people who will write in Bob Good, you’re looking at a significant amount of people, and that could play heavily into him losing. I don’t like being in this position but (McGuire) has put the whole district in a conundrum, and I wish there was a remedy to this situation,” Simpson said. </span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland, remains the winner in a highly contested GOP primary in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District, following an unexpected additional review of ballots from five of the district’s 24 localities almost one month after a full recount that did not significantly change the outcome of the election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working with the registrars from Amherst, Cumberland, Halifax and Mecklenburg Counties and the city of Danville, who had </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/26/court-summons-back-five-localities-for-new-hearing-in-5th-district-gop-primary-recount/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">been summoned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the Goochland County Circuit Court Wednesday afternoon, a three-judge panel corrected some minor reporting errors that resulted in incumbent U.S. Rep. Bob Good, R-Farmville, picking up four more votes, bringing down McGuire’s winning margin down to 366 votes.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court also reviewed a petition filed by Good’s attorney Brad Marss objecting to some of the recount-related expenses billed to the congressman’s campaign. The court agreed to some of the objections, resulting in a reduction of the total cost from $104,000 to $88,918 — less than the $96,500 that Goochland’s Chief Judge Claude Worrell, who headed the recount panel, had estimated at a preliminary hearing in July. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve reviewed, and reviewed, and reviewed,” Worrell said at the conclusion of Wednesday’s hearing. “We asked the representatives of the different areas to come in to show us what we were looking at, but in the end it got a little bit more complicated than that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During their review the judges identified some reporting methods by the registrars that differed slightly from the court’s initial instructions, resulting in numbers that didn’t line up correctly with the final tally. But the differences were too small to impact the outcome of the recount or the election overall. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jason Corwin, the general registrar in Mecklenburg County, said in a phone interview earlier this week that his staff discovered several minor math errors made during the recount in two of the county’s 22 precincts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we took the original recount certification sheet, we put down a couple of wrong numbers. One was 36 and should have been 37, and one was for early voting where we put down 283 and 128, and they were both off by one vote,” Corwin said in the interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good’s campaign  </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/07/10/good-files-recount-petition-in-highly-contested-5th-district-gop-primary-race/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filed a petition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a district-wide recount eight days after the election </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/07/02/state-elections-board-certifies-congressional-primaries-cementing-mcguires-victory-over-good/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">was certified</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the State Board of Elections in early July. The chairman of the powerful House Freedom Caucus told supporters in an email at the time that he was seeking a “complete recount,” including a hand-count and paper ballot match to the reported machine results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bernard Goodwyn, the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Virginia, then appointed the three-panel recount court, consisting of Worrell, Judge J. Christopher Clemens of Salem and Judge Christopher Papile of Newport News. Initially, Worrell ordered the recount for July 31, but later pushed it back by a day due to scheduling conflicts. </span></p>

(Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the recount, McGuire’s lead over Good was 0.6%, which put the incumbent within the 1% margin allowing him to request a recount at his campaign’s expense, but above the 0.5% threshold that would require localities to pay for it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Candidate-funded recounts are rare in Virginia, because of the high cost and because they rarely change the outcome of elections. And after the court reviewed the recounted election returns that election officials from across the district had delivered to the Goochland County Circuit Court on Aug. 1, Good picked up a mere four votes, bringing down McGuire’s winning margin to 370 and effectively ending Good’s bid for a third term in office. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court on Wednesday agreed to honor some, but not all, of Good’s objections to the cost assessed by the court in the days after the recount. For example, it sustained a motion by Marss to toss out a $2,800 bill by Lunenburg County for its county attorney, agreeing that this expense was “undocumented” and not “reasonably necessary to the proceedings.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the court ruled other expenses billed by the localities as justified, including mileage and other travel expenses filed by election officials and sheriff’s deputies, who escorted registrars carrying ballots to Goochland on Aug. 1. The court also kept in place its order that Good’s campaign pay for meals and catering expenses incurred by election workers during the process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking with reporters inside the courtroom on Wednesday, Marss — Good’s attorney — said that the court’s decision to hold another hearing weeks after the conclusion of the recount was highly unusual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Having a hearing like this one I haven’t heard of before,” Marss said. “I consider it unfortunate that it happened that way. Had it not been for the discrepancies from the localities, this would have not been done in a hearing but by way of written memos.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good said in a text message after the hearing that his campaign will pay the cost determined by the court as required within 21 days. He also thanked the court for correcting the irregularities in the final tally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I appreciate the efforts of the judges to address some mistakes that had been identified after the recount,” Good said.</span></p>

John McGuire, R-Goochland, prevailed in a recount of votes. (Good campaign)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sean Brown, a McGuire spokesman, said that the changes that the court reviewed Wednesday were “all clerical errors” by either the registrars or the court on recount day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The court sustained Good’s objections to costs for the Lunenburg County Attorney, Albemarle Clerk, and sheriff’s deputies. The court said that since it considered the recount to be a court proceeding, those costs shouldn’t be imposed on the parties. The court overruled all of his other objections,” Brown said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire, who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump three weeks before the primary election, had made his campaign a referendum on which candidate is a more loyal supporter of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Trump’s support likely helped push him over the edge — McGuire won the election by a mere 374 votes out of 62,792 cast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within days of losing the recount, Good squashed persistent rumors that he would be seeking the GOP nomination for lieutenant governor in Virginia by filing a formal “statement of candidacy” with the Federal Election Commission declaring that he will once again run in the 5th District in the 2026 election.</span></p>

Bob Good, R-Va, has been sent a cease and desist letter from former President Donald Trump for including his name on signs, despite his endorsement for Good's opponent John McGuire. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly four weeks after the recount in the GOP primary in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/08/01/recount-in-5th-district-gop-primary-still-underway-thursday-evening/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">confirmed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland, as the winner, the court has called back election officials from five of the district’s 24 localities to another hearing in Goochland County Wednesday to resolve some minor discrepancies in their reporting of votes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court will also review a petition filed by Brad Marss, an attorney representing U.S. Rep. Bob Good, R-Farmville, and the incumbent, objecting to some of the expenses billed to Good’s campaign for the recount. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goochland’s Chief Judge Claude Worrell, who heads the three-judge panel presiding over the recount, said at a hearing in July that the cost would amount to about $96,500. But Diana Shores, a spokeswoman for Good, said on Monday that the campaign had been billed $103,000 and was disputing some of the charges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election officials from Amherst, Cumberland, Halifax and Mecklenburg counties and the city of Danville were summoned to appear at Wednesday’s hearing, but the additional review of ballots is not expected to change the outcome of the election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jason Corwin, the general registrar in Mecklenburg County, said in a phone interview that after the recount, his office reached out to the court after his staff discovered several minor math errors made during the recount in two of the county’s 22 precincts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we took the original recount certification sheet, we put down a couple of wrong numbers. One was 36 and should have been 37, and one was for early voting where we put down 283 and 128, and they were both off by one vote,” Corwin said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the total number of votes cast in his locality remains accurate and did not change after the recount, Corwin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We saw that we had made a mistake on our end, which almost forced the judges to make one, but they were willing to have another look, because we wanted the order to accurately reflect what we had done.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corwin said that the court has since asked his office to bring all the hand counted ballots back to Goochland for the upcoming hearing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We went over to the clerk&#8217;s office and packed everything up, and it’s been locked and secured there until I’ll leave on Wednesday.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Danville’s General Registrar Peggy Petty said that she was summoned back to Goochland after her team found that a ballot initially counted as an undervote — which is a ballot not counted because of unclear marking by the voter — had been marked for Good. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This was reported on our original paperwork, but the court did not pick it up for whatever reason,” Petty said. “It was a very clear vote for Mr. Good, it was taken to the court and for whatever reason they did not account for it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Petty said that she wasn’t too happy about having to make the 130-mile road trip from Danville to Goochland Wednesday to deliver a single ballot. “It’s definitely an inconvenience,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Richards, a politics professor at the University of Lynchburg, said it was “very unusual” for the court to hold another hearing almost one month after the recount concluded. “I think it speaks to how careful the court and the registrars are being.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the new hearing is not indicative of any major discrepancies with the vote count itself, Richards said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The count was done by scanning the votes, and from what I know, the scans have been tested and shown to be 100% correct. However, undervotes are examined by hand carefully. If there is a question about a singular ballot and how it was counted, it is probably because the recount court is making sure every vote is counted that can be legitimately counted.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia election officials are trained professionals who take their job very seriously, Richards said. “I feel certain that the court is making absolutely sure that if anyone comes behind them, that each vote is clearly counted in the proper manner.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/good-to-seek-recount-after-officials-certify-results-showing-mcguire-won/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">requested</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the recount in the June 18 primary election after losing to McGuire by a mere 374 votes out of 62,792 cast. Under Virginia law, the localities involved cover the cost of a recount when the margin of victory is 0.5% or less, or if the candidate who petitioned for the recount is declared the winner. But because McGuire led the incumbent by 0.6%, Good had to raise money to pay for the recount. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the recount wrapped up shortly before midnight on Aug. 1, Good had picked up just four more votes, reducing McGuire’s winning margin to 370.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shores, Good’s spokeswoman, said that the campaign was “surprised to learn” that officials from five localities had been called back to Goochland for another hearing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Never before had we heard of a case where counties or cities were recalled to the court after a recount was conducted,” she said. “We trust the three judge panel is doing its due diligence to ensure that every vote has been legally counted and we look forward to finalizing this process on behalf of the voters of the district.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shores added that the campaign has the funds to pay for the recount. “We had almost 600 people donate to the efforts. About $103,000 was billed, but depending on what the judge outlines as acceptable billing on Wednesday, that number could change.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his petition, Marss, Good’s attorney, objected to “mileage or other travel expenses beyond those contemplated” being assessed to the campaign. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia law only allows for payment of the sum of $10 and mileage “only to officers of election, and only for each time (an officer of election) delivers poll books and ballots to the polling place, and each time he delivers returns and ballots to the appropriate official after the polls close,” the petition said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unfortunately, with only one exception (Campbell County), every other locality has sought to assess Good for the mileage expenses paid to officers of election for merely commuting to and from their place of work. Commuting expenses are not generally compensable in the law.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good also objected to any attempt to assess him for any allocated portions of salaries of sheriff’s deputies or other law enforcement officers who performed duties during the recount proceedings, such as escorting election officials carrying ballots to Goochland. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The expenses of such officers’ salaries did not increase due to their involvement in this particular judicial action, and such expenses are not assessable as costs, whether in this recount matter, or in any other civil action,” the petition said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other contested expenses include catered meals for election officials, technical support for voting machines, and portions of the salaries that some local officials had billed to the campaign. Good’s petition further argued that the five localities summoned back to Goochland for Wednesday’s hearing “should have to absorb all expenses their errors may generate.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire on Monday did not respond to calls and text messages seeking comment, but Sean Brown, a campaign spokesman, said that if Good’s campaign “has the money as they claim, they should pay what they owe to localities, instead of short changing registrars, law enforcement officers, and all those that facilitated Bob’s failed recount effort.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wednesday’s hearing has been set for 1 p.m. at the Goochland County Circuit Court. </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charlottesville’s about to become the second Virginia city to adopt ranked choice voting</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charlottesville’s city council approved a draft ordinance this week that will allow the use of ranked choice voting next year — when primary elections will be held for some council seats. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the measure will still need to formally pass at the next council meeting on Sept. 3 (as ordinances must pass twice), it’s slated for the consent agenda at that meeting. The city’s registrar, Taylor Yowell, also </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15lGat6ain7NSIz5BAtHA2U5GA1IP8ZLq/view" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recommended its passage in a memo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to council. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ranked choice voting lets people select candidates on their ballot in the order of preference. Should a candidate win more than half of the first choice votes, they win the election, just as they would have in traditional voting. Should no one get more than half of the votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated. If you voted for that person, then your vote goes to the next choice and counts are tallied again. </span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/casting-a-ballot/ranked-choice-voting/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process is repeated until there’s a candidate with enough votes to win. </span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But unlike traditional voting, ranked choice voting means that voters have more input and potential to be satisfied should their top pick not win. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A push for ranked choice voting stems locally from Charlottesville as its former state delegate, Sally Hudson, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/ranked-choice-voting-may-be-coming-to-local-elections-in-virginia-heres-how-it-works/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">carried legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that former Gov. Ralph Northam signed into law four years ago. Now localities can adopt ranked choice voting for city council and board of supervisor elections. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://dcist.com/story/22/12/19/arlington-ranked-choice-voting-primary/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arlington</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> first adopted the method last year, following a change in state law granting local governments permission to do so. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond could have been the first Virginia locality to adopt the method in 2022, but councilors were still too uncertain about it at the time and ultimately </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/09/13/how-uncertainty-sank-richmonds-plan-to-be-first-to-adopt-ranked-choice-voting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voted it down</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A key sticking point was that the law could not be applied to school boards or city-wide contests like Richmond’s mayor — which unlike most Virginia localities is a separately-elected official, rather than member of council. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s just a more complicated conversation in Richmond,” Hudson said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A subsequent effort to allow the law to be used for any local election was </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/11/youngkin-blocks-democratic-bills-dealing-with-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2021/05/10/virginia-gop-picks-glenn-youngkin-as-its-nominee-governor-heres-what-we-know-about-him/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ranked choice voting during the 2021 GOP gubernatorial convention</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> propelled him to the general election that year where he went on to become governor. But his ranked choice victory didn’t hinge on expansions to Hudson’s law because conventions are party-run contests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Hudson said that seeing ranked choice voting’s adoption and use locally is “a reminder that big changes are a series of small steps.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ranked choice voting is becoming more widely implemented nationwide. It’s currently allowed in 14 states and last year there were over 100 bills concerning it in 38 states, </span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/wnet/preserving-democracy/2023/12/18/ranked-choice-voting-coming-to-more-statewide-ballots-in-2024/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PBS reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hudson noted that local, state and federal elections in Virginia in recent years have seen crowded candidate pools ahead of primaries and conventions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Democracy thrives when voters have options between lots of candidates — but right now, our ballots just are not built to let voters vote for who they really like when a lot of people run,” Hudson said. “Ranked choice voting solves that problem.” </span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two years ago, the late Lois Dedeaux McClellan voted for her daughter Jennifer to become the first Black woman to represent Virginia in Congress, but there had been a period in her 91 years of life when the law prevented her from voting at all. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the suffrage movement granted white women the </span><a href="https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/19th-amendment" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">right to vote by 1920</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, women of color had to wait to cast their ballots until the federal </span><a href="https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/voting-rights-act" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voting Rights Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was signed into law, 45 years later. Now on the 59th anniversary of that landmark legislation, Lois’ daughter U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Virginia, is still pressing Congress to ensure fair access to voting for all. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The fight since day one is who gets to participate,” McClellan said in an interview this week. “We’ve made a lot of progress, but every time we make progress, we face a backlash. It’s up to all of us to really demand that Congress step up and protect and expand voting rights.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That quest led McClellan to co-sponsor  the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/14" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/11?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22freedom+to+vote+act%22%7D&amp;s=1&amp;r=1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freedom to Vote Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2023. The former would restore provisions that have since been removed from the Voting Rights Act of 1965, while the latter would expand voter registration and designate Election Day as a federal holiday. Both bills have been introduced but not progressed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McClellan said she doesn’t think they will get far unless more Democrats are elected into Congress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the Voting Rights Act of 1965 prohibited racial discrimination in voting, </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/shelby-county-decision" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a 2013 U.S. Supreme Court ruling undid parts of the law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ,striking down in a 5-4 ruling provisions that gave the federal government oversight when states with histories of racial discrimination sought to change their voting laws.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the decade since, a number of states have adjusted their voting laws in ways that some advocacy groups say disenfranchise Black voters or other minority groups. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such has been the case in</span><a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2023/10/13/georgias-controversial-2021-voting-law-overhaul-survives-preliminary-legal-challenge/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Georgia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where a 2021 law included restrictions on absentee ballot drop boxes and </span><a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/briefs/federal-judge-allows-georgia-ban-on-handing-voters-food-water-to-stand/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">penalties for passing out refreshments to people standing in line waiting to vote.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> More recently, a redistricting case in Texas alleges that Black and Hispanic votes were diluted in violation of the Voting Rights Act. Despite a trial judge and appellate court panel both ruling the voter map was in violation of the federal law, the </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/02/us/texas-voting-rights-minorities.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">full federal Fifth Circuit Court disagreed. </span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s nothing new to Fergie Reid Jr., the son of Fergie Reid Sr. — who was the only Black member of Virginia’s House of Delegates when he was elected in 1968, just three years after the Voting Rights Act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This s— has always been happening; it never stopped,” Reid Jr. said of barriers to voting or laws that disenfranchise people of color. “Everything didn&#8217;t just change because the Voting Rights Act got passed. It was always a struggle, one step at a time, pushing a rock up a hill. And now the rock is falling back down the hill.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the century before the Voting Rights Act Black men had the right to vote and some had been elected. But after the “hot minute” of that, Reid Jr. said, their access to legislative power was “too much for [white] people.”  What followed was decades of Jim Crow laws that disenfranchised people of color. It took until the 1960s for his father to make history as the first Black member of state government since the Reconstruction era following the Civil War. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the decade before his  election, Reid Sr. had also encouraged Black voter engagement through the Richmond Crusade For Voters, an organization he’d co-founded that still operates today. When Reid’s 90th birthday rolled around in 2015, his son launched the 90 For 90 campaign to bolster voter registration and candidate recruitment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black representation in Virginia has grown over the past decade. This year, Reid Jr. said he’s focusing recruitment efforts in states where candidates of color or Democrats could face an uphill battle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whether or not [Kamala] Harris can win, you have to compete everywhere,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Broad engagement is something Black Futures Lab political director Alexsis Rodgers said that the organization is working on, as well, inside and outside Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We know that there are Black community members there who want to be engaged, but they might not be getting good information. They might not know what the latest laws are in their communities,” Rodgers said. “And so in Georgia, North Carolina and Wisconsin, we&#8217;re really focused on doing that outreach.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While not totally partisan, the push for enhanced voting access often falls along partisan lines. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McClellan noted that when she was still a state senator and Democrats held majorities in Virginia’s legislature and governorship, they were “bucking the national trend” in Southern states to broaden voting access rather than restrict it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislature passed laws to allow for more absentee voting, the creation of ballot drop boxes, and extended early voting. McClellan, along with Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, also passed the </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+sum+SB1395" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voting Rights Act of Virginia </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, as 2024’s elections play out at the local, state and national level, so do proposed changes in who can participate and how. Georgia’s election board has </span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-election-board-plans-votes-on-new-rules-after-trumps-praise/KO32B4XY7VCSPNEXHZF5CUJRQ4/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposed changes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a focus on Fulton County — where a large portion of the state’s Black population votes — which would require “reasonable inquiry” before approving election results. With Fulton County in particular still at the center of former president and current candidate Donald Trump’s claims he actually won the 2020 election, voting rights advocates warn the measures could be misused by board members to reject the results of the presidential race.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/08/05/trump-praises-georgia-election-board/74674946007/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">praised Georgia’s electoral board’s proposals in a recent rally</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And though changes to election processes are the purview of state election boards, McClellan said the congressional efforts to restore parts of the Voting Rights Act that have been cast aside could prevent states from making changes that hearken to the days when her ancestors couldn’t vote or were subjected to restrictions like poll taxes and literacy tests. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rodgers, who has also been a Democratic organizer and supporter of McClellan, stressed that the federal bills are “about protecting democracy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sometimes that means Republicans will win, sometimes that means Democrats will win,” she said. “But ultimately it means that more people can participate in our democracy.”</span></p>

Charlotte Rene Woods/ Virginia Mercury</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares announced Friday that he’s going after the online Democratic fundraising platform ActBlue for potentially improper activity, without offering detailed evidence of what he believes the organization has done wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ActBlue rejected the attorney general’s allegations as “false” and politically motivated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a </span><a href="https://x.com/JasonMiyaresVA" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">letter posted to X</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Miyares made broad accusations of questionable donations made through the service that acts as a conduit between small-dollar contributors and a variety of Democratic candidates and causes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This includes hundreds of thousands of dollars of contributions through individual donors in the Commonwealth in volumes that are facially implausible and appear suspicious,” Miyares wrote. “Some of these Virginia donors are reported as making multiple daily contributions over the course of multiple years amounting to tens of thousands of dollars in aggregate.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The attorney general demanded “a detailed description of ActBlue&#8217;s processes and procedures for verifying the legitimacy and accuracy of donor and contribution information as well as the processes and procedures used in verifying information reported to regulatory bodies.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Given the seriousness of these allegations, I expect to receive your substantive response by August 12, 2024,” Miyares concluded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://x.com/actblue/status/1819438054534181083" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, ActBlue said Miyares was perpetuating misinformation in order to attack political opponents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This investigation is nothing more than a partisan political attack and scare tactic to undermine the power of Democratic and progressive small-dollar donors,” ActBlue said. “We welcome the opportunity to respond to these frivolous claims.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ActBlue has faced similar accusations from conservative activists in the past, but </span><a href="https://marylandmatters.org/2023/06/20/expert-claims-of-campaign-finance-irregularities-are-dubious/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">campaign finance experts contend</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the claims are overblown and based partly on quirks in how the Federal Election Commission reports small donations made through ActBlue and WinRed, its counterpart for GOP fundraising.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s unclear what inspired Miyares to target ActBlue. The attorney general’s letter didn’t point to specific donors or contributions made via ActBlue that he felt were problematic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The letter the AG released today speaks for itself,” said Miyares spokesperson Ian Lichacz. “Our office has reviewed allegations involving donor information of many individuals. No single donor or single allegation inspired this action.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The announcement follows conservative social media chatter about an unusually high number of political donations from one person who apparently lives in the Richmond suburbs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares amplified social media posts pointing to that particular donor, but federal campaign finance records show most of the contributions from the donor went to Republicans, not Democrats. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a few of the donations seemingly did occur through ActBlue, vastly more were made through WinRed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares reposted a social media message by hard-right figure Charlie Kirk, the founder of the conservative group Talking Points USA, which </span><a href="https://x.com/charliekirk11/status/1816867982330499419" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">incorrectly implied</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> thousands of small donations from the Richmond-area contributor were going to Democrats via ActBlue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My office is aware of these allegations and rest assured, we are looking into it,” Miyares said as he reposted Kirk’s misleading allegation a few days before announcing he had sent the letter to ActBlue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former President Donald Trump also reposted Kirk’s message on social media, with commentary added by another user suggesting Miyares would suffer politically if he failed to prosecute “money laundering” involving ActBlue. The donor whose high frequency of contributions inspired Kirk’s post made numerous donations to Trump, according to campaign finance records.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mercury is not naming the donor identified on social media because there is no indication yet that the person was a victim of identity theft or did not intend to make the donations Kirk and others deemed suspicious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The attorney general’s office did not comment on why the inquiry was focused only on ActBlue and not WinRed.</span></p>

They had two options: worse and worst.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Joe Biden’s Sunday concession to the ravages of advanced age (already the oldest sitting president in U.S. history, he would turn 82 just 15 days after the election) doesn’t assure the Democrats’ victory on Nov. 5. It does, however, lift the “worst” option, at least for the immediate term, and offers Virginia Democrats a glimmer of hope.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden labored under alarmingly poor job approval numbers before his abysmal performance in a June 27 debate with former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, which raised profound questions about Biden’s mental fitness and sent his campaign into an unrecoverable death spiral.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Biden’s polling plunged, Democrats in</span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/democrats-call-biden-step-aside-tracking-updates-reactions-rcna160699" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Congress</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/11/us/politics/biden-george-clooney-hollywood.html?smid=url-share" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Hollywood</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wrung their hands and differed publicly over whether he should abandon the race. Making things worse, Trump seemed not only invincible but inevitable after a rifle bullet grazed his right ear during a July 13 Pennsylvania campaign rally. Days later, wearing gauze over his wound, Trump was hailed as a mythic hero at the Republican National Convention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In public polling, the separation grew wider between an ascendant Republican campaign and a Democratic one seemingly disintegrating by the day with donors threatening to close their checkbooks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the seeming red wave grew into a tsunami, not only would Democrats likely lose Virginia in a presidential race for the first time in 20 years, it could threaten them in competitive contests for open U.S. House seats their party now holds,</span><a href="https://richmond.com/opinion/column/trump-assassination-attempt-virginia-republicans-wins-democrats/article_5a927c3c-42bd-11ef-a875-57a86e762128.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote Mark J. Rozell</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, dean of the George Mason University Schar School of Policy and Government.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://research.wilder.vcu.edu/commonwealth-polls/poll-archives/trump-leads-biden-by-3-points-in-virginia.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A poll of 809 Virginia adults</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conducted by Virginia Commonwealth University’s Wilder School of Government and Public Affairs from June 24 through July 3 found that 39% favored Trump and 36% supported Biden. The results are within the poll’s margin of error of plus-or-minus 4.8 percentage points, in a survey whose outcome is further clouded because the debate occurred on day four of the 10-day survey. Even so, it’s an outcome that didn’t comfort Democrats in a state Biden won by 10 percentage points over Trump just four years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A landslide Biden defeat that includes Virginia could even imperil the re-election of Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., against a prohibitive and little-known GOP underdog, Hung Cao, Rozell predicted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe Sunday changed that trajectory. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A more recent</span><a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2024/president/va/virginia_trump_vs_harris_vs_kennedy_vs_west_vs_stein-8518.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times/Siena College poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 661 likely Virginia voters conducted July 9-12 found Vice President Kamala Harris (whom Biden endorsed to succeed him as the putative nominee) was the choice of 43% compared with 39% for Trump. That slight advantage is within the poll’s ±4.4 percentage point margin of sampling error. The survey was completed before the July 13 attempt on Trump’s life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As long as the narrative focused on Democratic disarray, Biden’s age and doubts about his ability continued, Trump and the Republicans looked unbeatable. Now the narrative changes as the Democrats have a chance to unite and put the focus back on Trump,” Rozell said in an interview Sunday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden’s retreat is “a critical reset opportunity” for Democrats, not a guarantee for success, he noted. That’s a vital distinction, given the Democrats’ demonstrated penchant for squandering opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let’s see what the Democrats make of it. There is always the chance for a different kind of disarray,” Rozell said. “Imagine if there is a strongly contested convention with multiple ballots, for example, and Harris gets nudged out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An intramural power play that leapfrogs Harris would rip apart vital elements of the Democratic coalition — women and Black voters — and inflict long-lasting damage on the party as Trump never could. Harris, of Jamaican and South Asian descent and the daughter of immigrant parents, is the first woman ever elected on a national ticket.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, the last day for political parties to get a nominee on the ballot is Sept. 6, according to a </span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/media/castyourballot/deadlines-calendars/2023-2024-Deadlines-Calendar-FINAL.xlsx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">list of deadlines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published by the Virginia Department of Elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state’s newly expanded 45-day voting window begins Sept. 20, which means ballots need to be finalized and printed before that key date.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden — who has emphatically rejected calls from within his own party to step aside after his faltering debate performance against former President Donald Trump — easily won Virginia’s Democratic presidential primary on Super Tuesday. However, he won’t officially be the party’s nominee until later this summer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Democratic National Convention is scheduled to run Aug. 19-22. If Biden were to change his mind and step down as the party’s presidential candidate, Democrats would still have a short window after the convention before they’d have to finalize their presidential ticket in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sept. 6 deadline is tied to a </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title24.2/chapter5/section24.2-542.1/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requiring political parties to certify their presidential nominees “no later than 5:00 p.m. on the sixtieth day before the presidential election.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the process pushes further into September, the need to finalize and print millions of paper ballots poses both logistical and legal challenges for any last-minute efforts to swap out a presidential nominee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia law gives political parties the option of choosing a backup candidate if a nominee withdraws or dies in some elections. But that’s only an option well in advance of Election Day, making Sept. 6 the clearest deadline for a candidate switch to happen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second presidential debate is scheduled for Sept. 10, just as Virginia ballots are being printed for the start of early voting 10 days later.</span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia officials on Tuesday certified the results of last month’s congressional primaries and defended the integrity of the state’s voting systems after a contentious election season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think we can comfortably say we’ve had free and fair elections in this primary,” said former Republican delegate John O’Bannon, who now chairs the Virginia State Board of Elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 5th District GOP primary fight between incumbent U.S. Rep Bob Good, R-Campbell and state Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland, led to intense scrutiny of Virginia’s election system due to a close finish involving the two hard-right figures. Both McGuire and Good have previously stoked doubts about whether elections can be trusted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lawyer for McGuire’s campaign spoke to the elections board Tuesday, saying there were no irregularities in the election that would justify doubting the results or failing to certify McGuire’s apparent victory by a little less than 400 votes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are confident in the integrity of this election and the legitimacy of the result,” said Daniel Bruce, an attorney with the Holtzman Vogel law firm representing McGuire’s campaign.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good has signaled he’ll seek a recount in the primary he appears to have narrowly lost. No representative spoke on the congressman’s behalf Tuesday. There was no reason for Good to try to block certification of the primary, because the recount his campaign would have to pay for couldn’t begin until after Tuesday’s vote.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good, who was attacked by former President Donald Trump after Good endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for president, now has 10 days to officially seek a recount.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the June 18 primary, Good pointed to several unusual events to cast doubt on the election’s legitimacy, including several fire alarms going off at polling places and officials in the city of Lynchburg mishandling a small number of ballots by failing to follow procedures for an absentee drop box. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officials said there were normal explanations for the alarms. The drop box issue only involved seven ballots, according to officials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elections Commissioner Susan Beals, a Republican appointee of Gov. Glenn Youngkin, also gave a speech Tuesday declaring that none of those issues should create doubt about the outcome. Given all the variables involved in the locally driven process of running an election, she said, minor issues are bound to happen sometimes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This local responsibility means that there will be occasional issues with administration, as there are 133 individual elections being held,” Beals said, referring to the number of cities and counties in Virginia. “Any time you have a process that is run by humans, issues may occur. But these are not systemic problems that call into question the results of the election.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other business Tuesday, the state elections board voted unanimously to begin the process of potentially removing a local Republican election official who was accused of failing to perform her duties and being unable to set her partisanship aside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The board voted to seek the removal of Maria Anne Kinney, a GOP member of the Charles City County Electoral Board </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/28/virginia-board-considers-ousting-gop-election-official-accused-of-sharing-voting-machine-info/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accused of repeatedly sparring with colleagues</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in her county and behaving in a manner that made other election officials uncomfortable. Kinney is due in court Wednesday on a misdemeanor assault charge related to a county election employee’s claim Kinney pushed her as election business was being conducted last month. State election officials noted they had not verified the veracity of that accusation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">O’Bannon said the board had heard “sufficient factual information” about Kinney’s case to justify asking a court to make the final decision on whether she should be removed from the local board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re not adjudicating it,” he said. “That will be the court’s job.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead from the primaries, the state elections board conducted a random drawing Tuesday to determine the order in which political party’s candidates will appear on the ballot for the general election. Prior to the drawing, officials announced that the crystal bowl traditionally used for the process had “shattered” after being dropped. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was replaced by a new, similar-looking crystal bowl. The bowl was filled with film canisters containing strips of paper with the name of a political party, and board members drew the canisters from the bowl to determine the ballot order.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats got the top slot, followed by Republicans and an assortment of third parties.</span></p>

Minority Leader Tommy Norment, R-James City, in 2020. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few weeks ago, former Virginia Senate GOP leader Tommy Norment contacted a pair of Charles City County election officials with an unusual request.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an attorney, Norment is representing a Republican member of the Charles City Electoral Board, Maria Anne Kinney, whose feud with other election officials in the county has led to her facing a misdemeanor assault charge. That charge, set to be heard in court next month, arose from an alleged shoving incident at the county’s election office on June 11.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With tensions rising just before the June 18 primary, Norment said it might be best for the two election officials, Registrar DeNay Harris and her deputy Lisa Cosby, to steer clear of Kinney on election day in the small county east of Richmond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though all three women had jobs to do overseeing primary voting, Norment specifically asked Harris and Cosby not to go to the polling place where Kinney would be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you insist on stopping at her precinct in spite of my respectful request, please do NOT approach her or speak to her in any manner whatsoever,” Norment wrote in the June 14 email. “I have asked Mrs. Kinney to call my cell phone if you do come to her assigned precinct. If need be I will dispatch a sheriff’s deputy to the precinct to [ensure] there is not interaction initiated on your behalf. We do not need to escalate this situation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Harris and Cosby had any questions or concerns, Norment added, they should “contact an attorney of your choosing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris, Charles City’s top election official, didn’t take it as a respectful request. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t believe you can tell me not to attend the polling place when it is my job,” Harris wrote, adding that she felt Norment had no business contacting Cosby at all because Cosby is the alleged victim in the pending assault case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sharply worded email exchange between a local election official and an ex-senator whose final term in office expired at the end of 2023 was recently shared with the State Board of Elections. Before the assault accusation emerged, the board was already trying to decide whether Kinney’s conduct should lead to her being removed from her role overseeing elections in Charles City.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The emails were included in a </span><a href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/GetFile.cfm?File=Meeting%5C151%5C39263%5CAgenda_ELECT_39263_v1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">trove of material</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about the conflict in Charles City published as part of the agenda for next Tuesday’s state elections board meeting. At that meeting, the board will certify the primary results and potentially make a decision on what to do about Kinney.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The controversy involves a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/28/virginia-board-considers-ousting-gop-election-official-accused-of-sharing-voting-machine-info/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">variety of allegations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against Kinney, mostly centered on claims she’s refused to carry out the duties of an electoral board member and has been unable to act in a nonpartisan manner. Kinney, who joined the board in January, has disputed most of those accusations, saying her attempts to get situated as a new member have been stymied by open hostility from her colleagues.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia board considers ousting GOP election official accused of sharing voting machine info&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/28/virginia-board-considers-ousting-gop-election-official-accused-of-sharing-voting-machine-info/embed/#?secret=Zz21rosplX#?secret=KLBMBh8N33" data-secret="KLBMBh8N33" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state board first heard details of the Charles City matter on May 28, but deferred a decision on whether Kinney should be removed so that it could gather more evidence. The state board can’t remove Kinney from the county board on its own, but can initiate legal proceedings to have a judge consider removing her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even with Charles City on notice that the state was watching, things didn’t cool down in the county’s election office. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The assault charge was leveled after a June 11 meeting at the election office focused on pre-processing of absentee ballots. Harris told state officials Kinney arrived with another Republican representative who wanted to observe the process. Amid a dispute over whether the process was or wasn’t open to the public, Kinney pushed past Cosby, according to multiple witness accounts sent to state election officials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cosby reported the alleged push to law enforcement the next day. An incident report from the county sheriff’s office said Cosby related that Kinney “pushed into the left side of Cosby’s body forcing her way back into the room.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The feud spilling over into the court system appeared to be what got Norment involved and preceded his email to Harris and Cosby.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The records show Norment replied to Harris less than 10 minutes after she fired back at him. He said he respected her position and was “merely trying to avoid any further interactions that might exacerbate the situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I will not contact you again as I think you have overreacted,” Norment wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris didn’t let it go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I appreciate your concern for me, but I am not the one who is overreacting,” she wrote. “I responded to an email from a very seasoned Attorney who contacted me and the victim, which is very intimidating when we are already scared and have issues with what happened. So I apologize if you believe my response to your demand was what seemed to be overreacting”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Norment then said he didn’t mean to “irritate” Harris, offered an apology if he offended her and predicted the primary would go smoothly if  “everyone is civil and just does their job.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her final response, Harris said Norment had “bullied” her and Cosby and said she agreed “no communication is best at this point.” Norment said he had no intention of bullying, adding “if you felt that way, I apologize.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris declined to comment further. Norment didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday morning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though personal beefs aren’t all that unusual in local government, the situation in Charles City has raised a novel problem: What happens if two people in charge of carrying out critical election business can’t coexist in the same room?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a subsequent email, Norment informed Harris that Kinney wouldn’t be attending the county’s post-primary canvass on June 20 because a judge had approved a preliminary protective order instructing Kinney to have no contact with Cosby. Norment said that meant the two parties can’t be within 100 feet of each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I do not even want the opportunity for a technical violation,” he wrote.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the most high-profile contest in Virginia — the intra-GOP brawl between incumbent Rep. Bob Good and state Sen. John McGuire — was too close to call as of 10 p.m Tuesday evening, three hours after the polls closed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Navy veteran Hung Cao won a lopsided victory in a Republican primary to take on Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine in November, several competitive House of Representatives districts saw hard-fought battles for both parties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are the primary results so far:</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">10th District: Subramanyam prevails </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, bested 11 other Democratic candidates to win the party’s nomination in the blue-leaning but competitive 10th District based in Northern Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subramanyam, a lawyer and former White House technology advisor in the Obama administration, has served in the Virginia General Assembly since 2020. He was endorsed for the 10th District seat by incumbent Rep. Jennifer Wexton, D-Loudoun, who is stepping down from public service after being diagnosed with a severe neurological disorder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The runner-up in the Democratic contest was Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax. Former Virginia Education Secretary Atif Qarni finished in third place, followed by former House Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn in fourth and Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, in fifth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Republican contest, attorney and technology executive Mike Clancy easily defeated three other GOP contenders. Clancy will likely face an uphill battle in a district Wexton won by 6 percentage points in 2022.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">7th District: Vindman’s victory</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eugene Vindman, a military officer who rose to national fame by helping his twin brother blow the whistle on former President Donald Trump’s conduct in office, won the Democratic nomination for the competitive 7th District seat being vacated by Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Prince William.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman’s anti-Trump profile helped him crush his Democratic rivals in fundraising and helped him win around 50% of the vote in a seven-person primary. Early results showed Del. Elizabeth Guzman, D-Prince William, finishing second.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former Green Beret turned lawyer Derrick Anderson won the GOP nomination in the district, defeating fellow military veteran Cameron Hamilton. Four other Republican candidates were in the running, but the results reflected what was essentially a two-person race between Anderson and Hamilton.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger is running for governor in 2025 instead of seeking reelection to Congress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based largely in Prince William, Spotsylvania and Stafford counties, the district also covers rural bits of central Virginia and has been seen as in play for Republicans as they seek to hold their majority in the House. In 2022, Spanberger defended her seat by 4.6 percentage points against Prince William supervisor Yesli Vega. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">2nd District: Smasal wins, will take on Kiggans</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over in Virginia Beach, a Democratic primary set the stage for a general election that will likely draw national attention. Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee-backed Navy veteran Missy Cotter Smasal topped Democratic challenger attorney Jake Denton. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Denton trailed in fundraising, as Cotter Smasal had notched big endorsements from U.S. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries — who stands likely to become Speaker of the House if Democrats regain that chamber — along with all six of Virginia’s Democratic representatives and former governors Ralph Northam and Terry McAuliffe. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incumbent Rep. Jenn Kiggans’ seat is among vulnerable Republicans that Democratic national groups are targeting ahead of November for potential to flip. Kiggans is a Navy veteran and nurse who previously served in Virginia’s state senate. She defeated fellow Navy veteran Elaine Luria in 2022 by 3.4 percentage points. The Virginia Beach-anchored district has oscillated between Democratic and Republican control over the years and is expected to be very competitive for both women by November. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">1st District: Mehta succeeds</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorney Leslie Mehta, who formerly worked for the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia, handily beat former New Kent County treasurer Herb Jones in a two-way Democratic primary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She’ll now take on Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Westmoreland, in a Republican-leaning district.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mehta received a high-profile endorsement from Spanberger in the primary.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">5th District: Good v. McGuire, too close to call </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results of the 5th District congressional primary contest weren’t solidified hours after voting ended, with Good and McGuire each pulling nearly 50% of all counted ballots Tuesday night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s largest congressional district attracted a national audience as GOP heavyweights campaigned with both men. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On election eve, once-and-possibly-future president Donald Trump had a virtual rally for McGuire, while Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga stumped for McGuire at multiple events and posted videos on social media in the weeks leading up to the election.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ibqwUuuoKW"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/05/marjorie-taylor-green-calls-bob-good-a-liar-and-john-mcguire-a-loyalist-at-rally/">Marjorie Taylor Greene calls Bob Good a ‘liar’ and John McGuire a ‘loyalist’ at rally</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Marjorie Taylor Greene calls Bob Good a ‘liar’ and John McGuire a ‘loyalist’ at rally&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/05/marjorie-taylor-green-calls-bob-good-a-liar-and-john-mcguire-a-loyalist-at-rally/embed/#?secret=G7dMLgfeqf#?secret=ibqwUuuoKW" data-secret="ibqwUuuoKW" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Good had reinforcements from Florida congressman Matt Gaetz and Texas congressman Chip Roy. Good was also joined by former Trump strategist Steve Bannon (weeks before he’s </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/steve-bannon-contempt-jan-6-committee-prison-2da50bcf2f8ff8f3e01ef4bf2b1b845e#" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">due in federal prison</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for denying a subpoena related to a congressional investigation into the U.S. Capitol insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a June 7 event in Powhatan, Bannon said “prison is not gonna be that bad” and compared his upcoming sentence to his Navy service. “It’s just serving my country in a different way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also praised Good for his service as an elected official and chair of the House Freedom Caucus, congress’ most conservative group. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While he had a high profile former Trump strategist backing him, he lacked the support of Trump himself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though both candidates share conservative Republican policy stances and have expressed admiration for Trump, it’s Good’s brief endorsement of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis that has haunted him. Trump’s team also sent a cease and desist letter to Good’s campaign for using signs with his name that implied an endorsement he doesn’t have. </span></p>

<p>State Sen. Suhas Subramanyam and military officer Eugene Vindman were the victors in two closely watched Democratic primaries Tuesday in two competitive Northern Virginia districts.</p>
<p>But the most high-profile contest in Virginia — the intra-GOP brawl between incumbent Rep. Bob Good and state Sen.

<p><em>Original report:</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Polling places across Virginia are open from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. today as both Democrats and Republicans hold </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/17/what-to-watch-in-virginias-congressional-primaries-this-week/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">primaries</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to choose their nominees for congressional elections in November.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="azRuHVFCYV"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/17/what-to-watch-in-virginias-congressional-primaries-this-week/">What to watch in Virginia&#8217;s congressional primaries this week</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;What to watch in Virginia&#8217;s congressional primaries this week&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/17/what-to-watch-in-virginias-congressional-primaries-this-week/embed/#?secret=BN7B227iJz#?secret=azRuHVFCYV" data-secret="azRuHVFCYV" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans across the state will pick a challenger to run against Democratic U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, and at least one party is holding a primary in six of Virginia’s 11 congressional districts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two of those districts are coming open this year due to the upcoming departures of U.S. Rep. Jennifer Wexton, D-Loudoun and Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Prince William. Wexton is leaving Congress for health reasons, and Spanberger is running for governor in 2025.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both parties have competitive primaries in those two districts, the 10th and 7th. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican voters in central and Southside Virginia’s 5th District will also settle a bitter primary between Rep. Bob Good, R-Campbell, and state Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland, that’s drawn national attention largely due to former President Donald Trump’s decision to back McGuire over Good, a member of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus who endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for president.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would-be voters can find details on their status via the state’s </span><a href="https://vote.elections.virginia.gov/VoterInformation" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online citizen portal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which lets users check their registration status and find their congressional district.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In districts with both a Republican and Democratic congressional primary, voters will be asked to choose a ballot for one party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters participating in Tuesday’s primaries will need to present an </span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/media/formswarehouse/voter-id/outreach-materials/documents/Voter-Identification-Chart---Revised-08.23.2023.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">acceptable form of identification</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but anyone lacking an ID will still be able to cast a provisional ballot that will only be counted if elections officials verify their eligibility later.</span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Human resources officials in the city of Richmond recommended an “immediate departmental restructuring” of the city election office after an internal investigation concluded the city’s registrar and deputy registrar violated nepotism and ethics policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results of the HR investigation into the Richmond election office — which is separate from a more far-reaching probe underway by Richmond’s inspector general — were sent to state and local election officials on Tuesday. The Virginia Mercury obtained copies of the findings through a Freedom of Information Act request.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="IJEH6DK0LI"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/16/richmond-inspector-general-investigating-citys-elections-office/">Richmond inspector general investigating city’s elections office</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Richmond inspector general investigating city’s elections office&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/16/richmond-inspector-general-investigating-citys-elections-office/embed/#?secret=z8j9YH7puV#?secret=IJEH6DK0LI" data-secret="IJEH6DK0LI" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the investigation, Registrar Keith Balmer verified nepotism allegations lodged against his office from three ex-employees, the documents show. It was their complaints that initiated the HR review, which produced three similarly worded investigative reports on the complaints and a <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Notice-of-Investigative-Findings-Keith-G.-Balmer-Jerry-B.-Richardson-6.10.24-sjh-edits.pdf">summary of the findings</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recommendation for a swift reshuffling of staff, including the proposed “transfer or removal” of all employees in a line of supervision that includes a family member, suggests a shakeup could be coming to the office that runs elections in Virginia’s capital city. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though none of the allegations deal directly with voting or ballots, registrars are typically expected to be sticklers for following protocol given the sensitive, high-security nature of their work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The management issues in Richmond are also bubbling up during a presidential year, when election officials around the country are at their busiest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Richmond controversy highlights the at-times confusing lines of supervision for registrars, who are hired and fired by unelected boards made up of appointees picked by local political parties and confirmed by judges. Though Balmer doesn’t report to City Hall or Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney, the city’s investigation says he’s still subject to city policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview Wednesday evening, Richmond Electoral Board Chairman John Ambrose said he and the rest of the board that oversees Balmer’s office had received the findings and would consider them as part of Balmer’s annual evaluation in July.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Since we have an election next week on June 18 and the priority for the board is the correct and transparent conduct of the June 18 primary I don’t think it’s appropriate to take any emergency action at this time,” Ambrose said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nepotism accusations were laid out in a document titled “Nepotism Tree,” which says Balmer hired his brother and one of his brother’s friends to jobs in the election office. The office also contracted with a company owned by Balmer’s wife to provide training on how to accommodate voters with disabilities. That contract, amounting to $2,300, didn’t go through the city’s procurement office, according to the records.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two grandchildren of Deputy General Registrar Jerry Richardson, the second-in-command, work in the office, as do several people connected to the grandchildren, according to the “Nepotism Tree” document both Balmer and Richardson confirmed as accurate to city officials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richardson’s grandson, Christian Javins, works as the office’s elections services manager. Javins’s girlfriend, Kara Wilson, works as a policy analyst. A cousin of Wilson’s and a longtime friend of Richardson’s also work in the office, according to the records, which detail several other familial relationships among lower-level employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">City HR officials found that people with ties to Balmer and Richardson “were hired or promoted without transparent and fair recruitment processes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Favoritism towards relatives of senior management undermined the principles of fairness, impartiality and equal opportunity for all employees,” city officials wrote in reports dated May 16. The reports were signed by Employee Relations Investigator Josh Underwood and HR Division Chief Timeko Hunte-Brown.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the HR investigation appeared to be completed last month, the city sent a “notice of investigative findings” this week to state and local election officials who work with Balmer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Balmer said Wednesday evening that he had not yet reviewed the HR findings. He noted that, apart from his brother, the other family connections in the office predate his time as registrar, which started in 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I will ensure that no family member reports directly to a family member,” Balmer said in an email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">City HR policies set broader limits than that, aiming to prevent employees from making decisions that could benefit a relative “regardless of the working relationship.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Any employee with supervisory responsibilities shall not have a family member under their scope of responsibility,” the policy says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Balmer and Richardson acknowledged to HR officials that people in their office often got jobs after recommendations from existing staff, according to the records. Richardson also indicated the office didn’t have a formal interview process for open positions and said it was “common practice for just a conversation as an interview.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Their failure to maintain transparency in hiring practices and neglect to address employee concerns violated the trust and integrity expected from organizational leaders,” the HR reports say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three former employees who complained about the office’s management also alleged they suffered retaliatory firings after raising concerns about nepotism and other issues. City HR officials ruled those claims unfounded, while noting that registrars can hire and fire employees at will and faulting the office for being unable to provide clear documentation laying out why the workers were let go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Balmer told officials the three employees were terminated because of issues with their performance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investigators ruled Balmer and Richardson violated two city administrative regulations. One is an anti-nepotism policy meant to prevent preferential treatment for relatives and ensure employees don’t supervise their relatives. The other is a more general ethics policy outlining rules against using public office for personal gain and conduct that inhibits “the confidence of the public in the integrity of government.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investigation also revealed that Richardson had sold Kate Spade purses, wallets and money clips to employees during work hours to raise money for a nonprofit animal rescue organization she runs. The cost of the items ranged from $20 to more than $100.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Considering Richardson’s managerial role, selling items on city time to employees that are within her chain of command may give the perception of favoritism for those who purchase from Richardson or create an environment in which employees feel purchasing the items to be obligatory,” the report says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond HR officials recommended “an immediate departmental restructuring to correct any nepotism,” the implementation of more thorough hiring practices to ensure jobs are awarded on “merit and qualifications,” mandatory training on ethics and other city policies and potential discipline for those involved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s unclear when Richmond’s Office of the Inspector General is expected to complete its investigation into the election office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">City officials suspended government credit cards issued to the registrar’s office after concerns were raised about improper spending, much of which has been </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/registrar-balmer-city-credit-card-investigation-elections-office/article_6be2d0e8-146b-11ef-971d-1f0b4090e555.html#:~:text=The%20Times%2DDispatch%20in%20March,in%202021%2C%20denied%20the%20claims." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported by the Richmond Times-Dispatch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The inspector general is believed to be looking at that issue and others that deal with finances and accusations of improper conduct that go beyond HR rules.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reports issued by HR officials point to some of those other allegations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the ex-employees who filed a complaint also alleged his former co-workers took unused copper wire from the building that houses the elections office and sold it for scrap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A footnote in the HR report says an investigator in the inspector general’s office didn’t seem too concerned about that claim because “the copper wires were considered trash.”</span></p>

(John Moore/Getty Images)</p><p>Aiming to send a message, the Biden administration recently spotlighted its indictments and convictions in cases involving threats to election officials or workers.</p>
<p>But with no letup in reports of attacks, some elections professionals say federal law enforcement still isn’t doing enough to deter bad actors and ensure that those on the front lines of democracy are protected this fall.</p>
<p>“Election officials by and large have no confidence that if something were to happen to them, there would be any consequences,” said Amy Cohen, the executive director of the National Association of State Election Directors. “It is very clear that we are not seeing a deterrent effect.”</p>
<p>A U.S. Justice Department spokesman declined to comment for this story, instead directing States Newsroom to a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/voting/election-threats" target="_blank">webpage</a> for the department’s Election Threats Task Force.</p>
<p>Launched by the Justice Department in 2021 in response to the wave of harassment of election officials that followed the 2020 election, the Election Threats Task Force works closely with local law enforcement and U.S. attorney’s offices around the country to investigate threats.</p>
<p>In going after those who make threats against election workers, the Justice Department is honoring a foundational purpose: The department was created in 1870 in part to protect the voting rights of southern Blacks during Reconstruction.</p>
<p>Run by John Keller, a top official in the Justice Department’s Public Integrity Section, the task force also includes the Criminal Division’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, the Civil Rights Division, the National Security Division, and the FBI. It also works with several other government agencies, including the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and the Department of Homeland Security.</p>
<p>Since its launch, the task force has brought charges in 17 cases, according to the department’s <a href="https://www.justice.gov/voting/election-threats" target="_blank">tally</a>. Eight cases have resulted in prison time, with sentencing scheduled in several more.</p>
<p>In one case, brought in Nevada, the defendant was acquitted.</p>
<p>In March, a Massachusetts man received a three-and-a-half-year sentence — the longest won by the task force to date — for sending an online message to an Arizona election official warning her a bomb would be detonated “in her personal space” unless she resigned.</p>
<p>A Texas man received the same sentence last August for posting threatening messages targeting two Maricopa County, Arizona officials and their families, and separately calling for a “mass shooting of poll workers” in precincts with “suspect results.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Each of these cases should serve as a warning’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Attorney General Merrick Garland highlighted these convictions and others in a May 13 speech at a task force meeting.</p>
<p>“Each of these cases should serve as a warning,” declared Garland. “If you threaten to harm or kill an election worker, volunteer, or official, the Justice Department will find you. And we will hold you accountable.”</p>
<p>But those prosecutions amount to only a tiny share of what the Justice Department <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/13/us/politics/election-workers-threats.html" target="_blank">has said</a> is over 2,000 reports of threats or harassment submitted by the election community to the FBI since the task force was launched in 2021. Around 100 of those were investigated, according to the Justice Department.</p>
<p>The small number of investigations and prosecutions is largely due to free speech concerns. Legal experts say that anything short of a direct and explicit threat to cause physical harm may well be protected speech under the First Amendment.</p>
<p>“A true threat is a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence,” Keller has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-JhI1l6_y8&amp;t=426s" target="_blank">said</a>. “If they don’t cross that line into invoking violence, they are generally not going to constitute a criminally prosecutable threat.”</p>
<p>Still, as the 2024 vote approaches, there’s little evidence that the volume of attacks against the people who run elections has declined, or that election workers feel safer.</p>
<p>A recent Brennan Center <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/poll-election-officials-finds-concerns-about-safety-political" target="_blank">survey</a> found that more than half of local election officials said they were concerned about the safety of their colleagues or staff — around the same number as in 2022, the year of the last federal election. Around a quarter worry about being assaulted at home or at work.</p>
<p>“This is a widespread issue in the elections community,” said Tammy Patrick, the CEO for programs for the National Association of Election Officials, and a former election official in Maricopa County. “It’s happening all across the country. It’s not just a question of it being in swing states, or just being in the city or whatever. It’s happening in a way that is a concerted campaign to create and sow chaos.”</p>
<p>“There is some feeling that the task force is a political tool,” said another election expert, “that allows the administration to say they care and they’re doing something.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Troubling episodes but little followup</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In March 2022, anti-fraud activists, accompanied by the local GOP chair, showed up at the office of Michella Huff, the election director for Surry County, North Carolina.</p>
<p>Huff said the activists tried to pressure her to give them access to county voting machines, citing what they said were flawed voter rolls. The group repeatedly threatened to have Huff ousted from her job if she didn’t cooperate, and said they planned to return with the local sheriff, though they did not do so.</p>
<p>Huff declined to provide access to the machines, and reported the episode to the state election board’s investigations unit.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the board did not respond to an inquiry about whether the report was forwarded to federal law enforcement.</p>
<p>Election security advocates have <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23785738-susan-greenhalgh-letter" target="_blank">urged</a> the FBI to do more to probe efforts by supporters of former President Donald Trump to gain access to voting machines in other states, warning that the breaches could have allowed for voting machine software to be compromised.</p>
<p>Huff said she never heard from law enforcement on any level, despite speaking publicly about the episode.</p>
<p>Though Huff wasn’t physically threatened, she said she’d still like to have seen federal authorities do more to respond.</p>
<p>“If it is truly a threat, I think every threat needs to be looked at serious(ly), and it needs to be considered as to what the intent was, if it was successful, and what the repercussions would be if it had been successful,” said Huff. “A threat is a threat.”</p>
<p>More overt efforts to physically intimidate election workers also have at times spurred little law enforcement followup.</p>
<p>The night before South Carolina’s 2022 primaries, a Republican candidate who has promoted lies about the 2020 election posted a message on the conservative social media site Telegram, to a group of anti-fraud activists.</p>
<p>“For all of you on the team tomorrow observing the polls, Good Hunting,” the message <a href="https://www.rules.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/cramer_testimony.pdf" target="_blank">said</a>. “We have the enemy on their back foot, press the attack. Forward.”</p>
<p>During the voting period, groups of activists showed up at multiple polling places to verbally harass, photograph, and film election workers as they did their jobs, recounted Aaron Cramer, the executive director of the Charleston County Board of Voter Registration and Elections.</p>
<p>The activists called the police to at least one polling site, falsely alleging evidence of fraud by election staff. The police came, but made no arrests — though the episode left the site’s lead poll manager shaken, Cramer said.</p>
<p>Cramer said his office provided detailed reports on both the Telegram message and the harassment at polling sites to the Department of Homeland Security, as well as to the state election commission.</p>
<p>“We took that threat pretty seriously,” he said, referring to the Telegram message.</p>
<p>He said he received a response from DHS saying the report was being looked into, but heard nothing after that.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what the conclusions were, or what occurred after submitting that information,” Cramer said.</p>
<p>But Cramer added that the experience produced a successful effort to increase collaboration with local, state, and federal authorities — with the result that the county is much better prepared to respond to, and anticipate, similar incidents this year.</p>
<p>“When you’re on the defense, you’re kind of reacting to everything, and I think that’s how the past was,” said Cramer.  “And now we’re being proactive.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘I dread November for you guys’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Patrick, of the National Association of Election Officials, said that while she understands the need to avoid running afoul of the First Amendment, authorities must balance legitimate free speech concerns with their urgent duty to protect those conducting elections.</p>
<p>And, she suggested, they may not always be getting that balance right.</p>
<p>“We need to be really careful that we’re not allowing people to yell fire in a crowded theater,” Patrick said.  “And that we’re not allowing people to use what they are potentially claiming as their freedom of speech as a way of creating chaos in a system, or to threaten individuals who are just trying to do their job.”</p>
<p>In addition, election professionals say they’ve complained for years that after they submit reports about threats and harassment to the FBI, there’s often a lack of follow-up beyond an acknowledgment of receipt.</p>
<p>Of course, law enforcement frequently can’t share details about their work, even with those who were targeted, in order not to compromise an investigation. But Patrick said even basic information could be helpful.</p>
<p>“Even letting them know that the report is being worked, so it doesn’t just go into the void, and a victim knows there’s going to be a knock-and-talk, gives the individual who made that report some sense of closure,” Patrick said, referring to when federal agents show up to speak with a suspect at their home.</p>
<p>The problem may be exacerbated by a lack of understanding among some in the elections world about what federal law enforcement can and can’t do. Many election officials, said Cohen, of the National Association of State Election Directors, want front-end help with steps like bolstering physical security to better prepare for incidents.</p>
<p>“Law enforcement, and especially federal law enforcement, is only coming at the back end,” said Cohen. “Their goal is not prevention or recovery, their goal is prosecution. And it has taken our community, I think, a long time to understand what we should be expecting from DoJ.”</p>
<p>Ultimately, said Cohen, the prosecutions brought by the Justice Department appear to have done little to reduce the number of threats election workers are subject to today.</p>
<p>“I’m really grateful that DOJ has secured convictions in Arizona,” said Cohen. “But I don’t think securing convictions in Arizona three years later has actually deterred anything in Arizona.”</p>
<p>Indeed, Arizona has been a hotbed for election misinformation, and its election officials continue to be targeted by a consistent stream of threats, according to multiple <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/28/us/politics/kari-lake-maricopa-election-threats.html" target="_blank">reports</a>.</p>
<p>Huff, the county election director in North Carolina, said that with a major election approaching, members of the public often express sympathy for her and her staff — an acknowledgement that the vitriol they’ve been facing is only likely to get stronger.</p>
<p>“Out in public, I get that,” Huff said — ‘Boy, I dread November for you guys.’”</p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two members of the Charles City County Electoral Board have asked Virginia officials to begin the process of removing the third member of the board, who is accused of sharing sensitive election machine information with a local GOP leader.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/CharlesCity_Letter.pdf">May 14 letter</a> to the Virginia State Board of Elections, election officials in Charles City — a small community between Richmond and Williamsburg — formally requested the ouster of local Electoral Board Member Maria A. Kinney, a Republican who just joined the board in January. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cause listed in the request was “severe dereliction of duties,” including a claim Kinney allowed a former Charles City County GOP chair, Irene Churins, to view election equipment passwords during an accuracy test. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kinney’s two colleagues on the board — Republican Gerald Barnes and Democrat Kermit White — signed onto the letter seeking her removal, as did Registrar DeNay L. Harris, who serves in a nonpartisan role and reports to the three board members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Documents shared with the state board accuse Kinney of disregarding election policies, battling colleagues over how to keep and publish meeting minutes and reportedly telling others she considers herself a “sovereign citizen.” That term usually refers to a staunchly anti-government movement whose members claim they’re exempt from laws they deem illegitimate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kinney appeared before the state elections board Tuesday to strongly deny most of the allegations while acknowledging she could be more careful about election security protocols </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have never called myself a sovereign citizen and had to look up what it means,” Kinney said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She went on to dispute claims that she resisted taking the oath of office and was reluctant to give her personal information to the county’s human resources department. Kinney said she took the oath and filled out the HR paperwork after clearing up scheduling and technical issues. Suggestions to the contrary, she said, are “slanderous.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I do not believe that it is my actions that need to be curtailed,” Kinney said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Virginia’s system of election administration, local party activists nominate people to serve on city and county electoral boards that oversee elections in their communities. Judges make the appointments from lists of nominees submitted by local parties, a process that occasionally leads to ultra-partisan figures wielding power over how local elections are run.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The situation in Charles City County is the latest example of personal animosity flaring up in offices that are meant to be even-keeled and nonpartisan, with local GOP figures conducting themselves in a manner that appears to have troubled even their fellow Republicans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia law gives the party that prevailed in the most recent gubernatorial election automatic control of all local electoral boards in the state. After Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin won in 2021, a new wave of GOP activists are being appointed to election oversight jobs, some of them steeped in far-right conspiracy theories about the 2020 presidential election being stolen from former President Donald Trump.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barnes, who also appeared at Tuesday’s state board meeting, questioned how Kinney could continue to serve on the county board when higher ups in the Republican Party of Virginia have already stripped Churins of her powers and dissolved the Charles City County GOP Committee to start anew. The Republican Party of Virginia’s 4th Congressional District Republican Committee decided May 9 to remove Churins from her position and temporarily disband the local party she once led. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barnes also noted Kinney has already resigned as the board’s secretary over the minute-keeping dispute but is insisting on staying on as a board member.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Who is she going to represent? Nobody,” Barnes said. “What is she going to do?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a 30-minute closed meeting, the state elections board chose to delay action on the matter to allow more time to gather emails and other supporting documents mentioned as the two sides gave their version of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think it would be very helpful to have additional information,” said state Board Chairman John M. O’Bannon, a former Republican delegate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those involved in the dispute also gave differing accounts of separate incidents in which law enforcement has had to get involved in election office feuds, none of which have apparently led to charges being filed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because local electoral board members are appointed by judges, Virginia law requires the State Board of Elections to initiate the removal process by approving a petition asking the local circuit court to make the decision final.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The letter laying out the case for Kinney’s ouster says she and Churins disrupted the county’s efforts to check its voting equipment on Jan. 18, a mandatory process known as logic and accuracy testing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“During the completion of the L&amp;A, Secretary Kinney wanted to input the passwords for the equipment as we were zeroing the machines,” the letter says. “As we watched, Secretary Kinney allowed Mrs. Churins to write seal numbers, serial numbers, what polling places the equipment was assigned to, and the passwords she was viewing as we were wrapping up Logic and Accuracy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Barnes told Kinney she couldn’t share that information with party officials or the public, the letter alleges, Kinney “proceeded to tell him that he could not tell her what she could and could not do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kinney told state officials Churins was standing behind her and she didn’t realize Churins might have been close enough to see the passwords she was entering on the machines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She would not have been able to see through my chest wall to know the numbers I was entering,” Kinney said. “When informed that I had made this error, I agreed that I needed to pay closer attention in the future, and that I would do just that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The letter from Kinney’s colleagues said her “combative behavior compromises the integrity” of upcoming elections in Charles City.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have a problem here, which seems to grow exponentially with each election,” Barnes wrote in his own letter to Republican Party of Virginia Chairman Rich Anderson. “The problem is the conduct and behavior of the County Republican Chair, Mrs. Irene Churins. Her inability to treat the county election team with even a modicum of respect, her blatant refusal to abide by, much less acknowledge, current Virginia electoral laws and codes, as well as her continual ‘witch hunt’ for non-existent conspiracies, are not only egregiously unethical but a reflection upon our party which simply cannot stand.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barnes also suggested racism might be a factor in why the registrar’s office is facing hostility from some local Republicans based on a comment about Harris and a deputy registrar he said he heard at a local GOP meeting in 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I overheard another attendee say ‘They’re both black, and we must watch these women. They came from Richmond,’” Barnes wrote in his letter. “Mrs. Churins did not address this inappropriate remark, much less shutting down the conversation’s tenor.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Churins, who told state officials the documents shared with them were “full of lies,” strongly denied the racism charge when asked about it by The Virginia Mercury after Tuesday’s meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve got more Blacks than Whites,” Churins said. “And I’ve got friends from all races.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s total bunk and not who we are,” echoed Kinney.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one cited a direct source for the sovereign citizen accusation. Clara Belle Wheeler, a conservative election activist who previously served on the state elections board, took exception to the publication of an email suggesting she might be a source of information on things Kinney has said. That email, written by 4th District Congressional District Republican Committee Chair Carey Allen,  was included in the official materials published online for the state board meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I categorically deny everything that is written in those allegations,” said Wheeler, who now serves on the Albemarle County Electoral Board and conducts training for other Republican board members around the state. “I never have used the term sovereign citizen.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barnes defended the claim Kinney had described herself that way by saying he had heard about it “from more than two or three people.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked in an interview if she believes claims the 2020 presidential election was stolen or fraudulent, Kinney said “not in Charles City.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nationally, I don’t know,” she said. “I have not really paid attention to all of the… they showed one thing where somebody brought in a box or pulled a box from under a table or something… I’m a farmer. I’ve got other busy life stuff going.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s unclear when state officials plan to take up the dispute again for a final decision.</span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Richmond Electoral Board met with the city’s inspector general in a closed session Wednesday following allegations of nepotism and financial improprieties in the election office led by Registrar Keith Balmer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inspector General James Osuna and members of the electoral board declined to comment when they emerged from the closed-door meeting, saying an investigation opened by the inspector general’s office is not yet complete.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A document The Virginia Mercury obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request earlier this year offers clues about what Osuna is looking into.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last fall, an investigator in Osuna’s office contacted the State Department of Elections seeking assistance looking into a variety of complaints received from one of Balmer’s former employees. Investigator Michael Chodorov told state officials he hadn’t verified the accuracy of the information, but he relayed allegations about management “hiring family and friends,” questionable expenditures and other issues in the Richmond election office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">City authorities seemed to be under the impression the State Board of Elections should handle the matter due its role overseeing the work of registrars. In response, state officials said the complaint was a local concern because none of the claims had a direct tie to election policy or voting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s unclear if the information in the ex-employee’s complaint has been verified or disproven, but both state and local officials have been made aware of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Serious allegations have been made,” Electoral Board Chairman John Ambrose said Wednesday when asked about his level of concern based on what he’s heard. “And they’ll be seriously investigated.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Balmer declined to comment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a sign the issues in Richmond are escalating, officials confirmed Wednesday that City Hall has taken steps to cut off purchasing cards issued to Balmer’s office. The office isn’t a city department under Mayor Levar Stoney’s control but still uses local funds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some claims of nepotism in the Richmond election office have already been made public. Earlier this year, the </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/richmond-registrar-keith-balmer-nepotism-accusations-brother-wife-office-of-elections/article_e0eb9052-d738-11ee-9abd-7bef8c0bbd32.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond Times-Dispatch reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Balmer had given his brother a job and paid his wife’s company $2,300 for training on how election workers can accommodate voters with disabilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a public back-and-forth among board members before Wednesday’s closed session, Electoral Board Member Starlet Stevens said the subject of the private discussion was “where the money is being spent.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s going to happen whether you like it or not, John, and you’re not going to shut me up on this,” Stevens said to Ambrose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ambrose shot back: “You’re out of order by making these comments.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stevens, a Republican, was the board chair heading into Wednesday’s meeting. But Ambrose, a Republican, and Board Member Joyce Smith, a Democrat, held a vote to oust her from that position prior to the closed session and make Ambrose the board’s new leader. They didn’t elaborate on the exact reason for that decision, but shortly after that move Ambrose and Smith voted to reinstate an election officer who had been removed from the role after some sort of physical altercation with Stevens. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the meeting, Stevens and the reinstated election officer briefly argued over who instigated the confrontation. There was no clear resolution to the matter apart from Stevens being demoted from chair and the election officer being reinstated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s unclear where the signs of trouble in the Richmond election office might lead, but the inspector general’s unfinished investigation is occurring in a high-pressure presidential year, when election officials can least afford distraction and disruption.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, city and county election offices are overseen by three-person electoral boards that operate independently of other local leaders but have the power to hire and fire registrars. Those unelected board members are appointed by local political parties and confirmed by judges. The party that won the last gubernatorial election automatically gets majority control of every electoral board in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Balmer took over the Richmond election office from former registrar Kirk Showalter, who was </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/richmond-electoral-board-votes-to-remove-citys-top-election-official-after-tense-public-hearing/article_ff22c0fd-1ceb-5e40-8458-9db8430d9605.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">removed in 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> partly at the urging of the Democratic Party of Virginia. The Richmond Electoral Board is now under Republican control due to Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s victory in 2021, but that power shift didn’t impact Balmer’s job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Past dysfunction in local election offices has inspired calls for state leaders to reform the system to usher in more professionalism and stability and shield registrars from political power struggles and feuds involving partisan board members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">City officials have also chastised Balmer several times for apparent violations of procurement policy in which his office signed contracts without proper authorization under the city government’s spending rules, according to documents obtained through a records request to the city.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest election-related contract to raise eyebrows at City Hall was an agreement signed with a security firm in January that envisions “personal protection services” for Balmer at an $85 hourly rate per guard. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The contract estimates 45 hours of work per week at a minimum, adding up to a weekly cost of at least $3,825. The 40-week agreement is set to run from early February to Nov. 5, the day of the presidential election, indicating the costs could exceed $150,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election officials throughout the country have faced threats following former President Donald Trump’s false claims that the 2020 election was stolen, an atmosphere that’s led to heightened security measures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new security contract for the Richmond election office, signed with local firm HPi Unified, also envisioned six security training sessions for staff at a cost of $26,400.</span></p>

(Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder)</p><p>For the second time while serving in the Nevada Legislature, Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro gave birth last year. And again, she publicly pledged to continue full participation in her duties.</p>
<p>As the nation’s groundbreaker when it comes to working moms in a state capitol, Nevada made history in 2019 as the only female-majority legislative body in the U.S. Still, legislators like Cannizzaro acknowledge uncertainty before deciding to grow their families while serving, the <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/when-it-comes-working-moms-nevada-legislatures-demographics-reflect-reality" target="_blank">Nevada Current</a> reported.</p>
<p>“What does that look like? What does it mean to be in this building and pregnant? What does it mean if I have a 1½-year-old and have to leave a meeting to pick him up at daycare? Does that make me less able to fulfill my duties? There were questions that I had as I announced my first and second pregnancy,” Cannizzaro told the Current.</p>
<figure id="attachment_38654" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:410px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Canizzarro2.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-38654" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Canizzarro2-300x200.jpeg" alt="" width="410" height="273" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Canizzarro2-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Canizzarro2-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Canizzarro2-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Canizzarro2-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Canizzarro2-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 410px) 100vw, 410px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Nevada Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro, who was first elected in 2016 and was pregnant during the 2023 legislative session, has said it’s important to find balance and set boundaries as a legislative mom. (Trevor Bexon/Nevada Current)</p></figure>
<p>The number of women serving in state legislatures has more than quintupled since 1971, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University (CAWP). Nearly 33% of the 7,386 state legislative seats are occupied by 2,432 women, the center reported.  In Virginia, 35% of the legislative seats are filled by women. Meanwhile, Vote Mama Foundation estimates 23% of lawmakers nationally are moms.</p>
<p>“Things within the political ecosystem have changed to be more open to women,” said Kelly Dittmar, director of research at CAWP. “Having more women also begets more women.”</p>
<p>And there are visible signs of progress at statehouses across the country as the number of mom lawmakers grow.</p>
<p>In Georgia, where women state representatives did not have a bathroom near the House chamber until the 1970s, there is now a lactation pod on the first floor of the Capitol. And a freshman Republican lawmaker has brought her baby to the floor daily, but more notably, the baby was given an official House name tag — labeling him the “baby of the House’’ — so he would have floor privileges. Just two decades ago, such a move was frowned on by House leadership.</p>
<p>“We talk a lot up here about how representation matters, and I believe that to be true,” Georgia state Rep. Lauren Daniel, a Republican, said to her colleagues late last year.</p>
<p>“I hope as I stand here today, and every day, as the youngest female member of this body, that it shows any young girl in this state who may find herself pregnant that her life does not end when a new one begins,” said Daniel, who first became pregnant when she was 17 and is now mother to four.</p>
<p>Still, moms are struggling to get elected and remain in office. Beyond child care, there are myriad impediments. It takes money and an organized campaign infrastructure. As candidates, they are confronted with gender stereotypes that they often consider in executing their campaign strategy. And the time away from young children can be daunting.</p>
<p>Having run for office herself, Liuba Grechen Shirley said she sees why moms, especially moms of small children, are often missing from elected office. Grechen Shirley is the founder of Vote Mama, a political organization that seeks to increase the number of moms in office.</p>
<p>“If you are a mother with young children and you decide to step up and run, the first question you get asked is always ‘but who will watch your kids while you campaign?’” said Grechen Shirley, who ran for Congress in 2018 in New York’s 2nd Congressional District while wrangling her 1- and 3-year-old children on the campaign trail.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A run for the money</h4>

	
<p>When it comes to fundraising, men dominate. A 2021 OpenSecrets report analyzing fundraising during open-seat House primary races in 2020 found white men candidates led the money race, though white women candidates maintained a significant advantage over women of color, raising three times as much as Black women in open-seat primaries, <a href="https://dkftve4js3etk.cloudfront.net/OpenSecrets_RaceGenderReport2020_BrynerHaley.pdf" target="_blank">according to the report.</a></p>
<p>Women donors also give less money overall than men, comprising around one-third of money contributed to state general office and legislative races nationwide from 2019 to 2022, according to <a href="https://cawp.rutgers.edu/research/cawp-women-money-and-politics-series/donor-gap" target="_blank">a 2023 report</a> by CAWP. At the individual state level, financial support from women donors ranged from 14% of donations in Nebraska state races, to 46% of contributions in Colorado.</p>
<p>That doesn’t sit right for Grechen Shirley.</p>
<p>Data from the Pew Research Center shows 85% of women will give birth and become mothers by the time they’re 45 years old. Vote Mama’s research arm, the Vote Mama Foundation, found that in 2022, 23% of state legislators were moms, and 5% had children under the age of 18.</p>
<p>On Capitol Hill, 37 of 541 lawmakers in 2022 were moms with children under 18, equal to 6.8% of the 118th Congress, according to Vote Mama Foundation. Put another way, there were three times as many men named John or Jon as there were moms of minor children serving.</p>
<p>“Vote Mama exists because of my personal experience running for Congress with two small toddlers,” Grechen Shirley said. “I immediately understood why there were not more moms serving at the federal level when I was running because it is really difficult. It’s unsustainable for somebody who’s a working parent, somebody who’s not independently wealthy, somebody who is a primary caregiver. This system was designed for wealthy older white men.”</p>
<p>Vote Mama PAC has helped over 500 Democrats who are moms run for office. Grechen Shirley pressed the Federal Election Commission to rule in her favor to allow use of campaign funds to cover the cost of her child care so she could run in 2018. And since then, at the federal level, parents started using funds similarly.</p>
<p>Between 2018 and 2022, 68 federal candidates spent $717,706 in campaign funds on child care, <a href="https://www.votemamafoundation.org/reports/cfcc2024" target="_blank">according to a report released by Vote Mama</a> at the beginning of the year. About half those funds were spent by women. Grechen Shirley wants people to know that efforts to help moms run for office also help dads.</p>
<p>Women of color represent 77% of total Republican campaign funds spent on child care, the report says.</p>
<p>“This is a complete game changer and it will help diversify both parties,” Grechen Shirley said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A major barrier to running</h4>

	
<p>At the state level, 70% of campaign funds spent on child care between 2018 and 2022 were spent by candidates of color, according to the same report.</p>
<p>Thirty-two states authorize candidates to use campaign funds for child care, but according to Vote Mama, in at least six of them, the option had never been touched. In Virginia, the Attorney General&#8217;s office issued an advisory opinion allowing the use in 2021. The <a href="https://scdailygazette.com/2024/04/09/sc-house-approves-letting-candidates-use-campaign-donations-for-childcare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South Carolina House approved legislation</a> last month over the objections of the chamber’s hardline Freedom Caucus. But the bill died with session’s end Thursday after <a href="https://www.scstatehouse.gov/sess125_2023-2024/bills/4561.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">never getting a vote</a> in the Senate.</p>
<p>A bipartisan pair of moms pushed for the change in Georgia by asking the state ethics commission to weigh in. The commission approved the change last summer through an <a href="https://8c99c177-8ae3-4e84-b7ff-133cca25df05.usrfiles.com/ugd/8c99c1_83dae44615d9485683c52339081fce55.pdf" target="_blank">advisory opinion</a>.</p>
<p>Georgia Republican state Rep. Beth Camp said she thought it was odd that federal candidates could use campaign funds for child care expenses but state candidates could not. And she says she hopes the change will encourage more parents with young children to run for office.</p>
<p>“It is not a partisan issue. It is a nonpartisan issue because it impacts everyone,” said Camp, whose children are now adults.</p>
<p>Camp said she was surprised when she heard negative feedback from some colleagues who questioned why the change was needed when candidates had not used campaign funds for child care in the past.</p>
<p>“Well, honestly, we probably would have had more parents — not going to say women or men but more parents — enter into elected office if they’d had the opportunity,” Camp said. “When you start looking at how expensive it is to provide child care, there are some people who make the decision not to take that out of their family household budget.”</p>
<p>Rhode Island <a href="http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/BillText/BillText21/SenateText21/S0060.pdf" target="_blank">passed a law in 2021</a> letting state and local candidates spend campaign funds on child care. It has yet to be used by any candidate with child care burdens, man or woman.</p>
<p>Sen. Sandra Cano, a third-term Democratic state senator who has given birth to two children since she was elected in 2018, said she opted not to dip into her campaign war chest for child care partly due to public perception.</p>
<p>“I do feel I would put myself through more criticism if I did, even though it is legal,” she said.</p>
<p>Also a factor: her family members provide most of the care for her children, Arianna, 4, and Alessandro, 1. And her parents refuse to accept her offers to pay them for it.</p>
<p>Lack of access to child care is a major barrier moms face when running for office and that problem continues if they win the election, Dittmar said.</p>
<p>“(Women) are still more likely than their male counterparts to be the caregivers,” said Dittmar of the Center for American Women and Politics.</p>
<p>Ohio has not authorized political candidates to use campaign funds for child care.</p>
<p>Ohio House Minority Leader Allison Russo, a Democrat, spent thousands of dollars in extra child care costs when she first campaigned in 2018. Her daughter was a 1-year-old and her two sons were in elementary school at that time.</p>
<p>“It was a big, expensive part of my first campaign that we paid out of pocket,” she said. “I am privileged to have the circumstance that I have with family nearby and the support network, but not everybody has that and I think if we want more parents with young children, especially women to run for office, we have to think about how do we create this support at work.”</p>

<p>And in Indiana, Ragen Hatcher, a representative from Gary, noted that childcare access and expenses continued to pose challenges even after she was elected. The mom of four moved her family hours away from their home in northwest Indiana so she could continue to care for them while she served in the legislature. Hatcher said she’d like to see free childcare offered at the statehouse, as well as the option to enroll her kids in schools closer to the state capitol.</p>
<p>“Being a state representative or state senator, for young parents, is difficult. And I think it may be a barrier to why many younger people, and moms, don’t run for these offices,” Hatcher said. “There are some things that the legislature can do to accommodate people better with younger children, and I just hope that we start doing that instead of leaving that age group out — those who may have the younger children but don’t want to necessarily have to leave them at home.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The X factor</h4>

	
<p>From scheduling breast pumping, dropping kids off at school, securing child care and performing the full spectrum of duties expected of women as primary caretakers for their children, campaigning as a mom is a challenge and that’s before a person faces all the hurdles of serving in office as a mom, Grechen Shirley said.</p>
<p>“You campaign and you’re working full time for up to two years with no salary … the reality is no one talks about these things. Unless you know somebody personally who has run for office or served in office, there’s really no way to know what it will be like. It’s like childbirth, unless you know someone who’s gone through it, you really don’t know what it’ll be like,” Grechen Shirley said.</p>
<p>And no one questions why dads run for office because having kids is viewed as an asset for men in elections, and they’re good dads for taking a picture with their kids, Grechen Shirley said. But if a woman on the campaign trail or in elected office takes a picture with her kids, they’re “using” their kids.</p>
<p>Increased representation of moms in office doesn’t mean the behind-the-scenes burdens have lessened, said Jennifer Lawless, the Leone Reaves and George W. Spicer Professor of Politics at the University of Virginia and chair of its politics department.</p>
<p>Lawless highlighted U.S. Rep. Grace Meng, a New York Democrat, as an example. Meng has talked about <a href="https://19thnews.org/2023/05/members-congress-mothers-minor-children/" target="_blank">the continued stress</a> of finding child care in New York while she sits through marathon sessions on Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>“It seems normatively wrong that women are being asked to manage this additional aspect of serving or running,” Lawless said. “We should have a political system where they should not be asked to manage something extra. Because women have been doing this for so long they’ve somehow figured it out.”</p>
<p>Said Dittmar: “In holding office you’re at the whims of leadership and deadlines and timelines. You can’t just say, ‘I’m sorry, I have to take off tomorrow because my kid is sick’ if you have a major vote.”</p>
<p>Lawless, who challenged U.S. Rep. Jim Langevin in the 2006 Democratic primary for Rhode Island’s 2nd Congressional District, said the experience was “incredibly taxing,” even as a single woman without children.</p>
<p>“I can’t imagine what it would have been like to have that third component of child care factored in,” Lawless said.</p>
<p>Because of that, some moms wait until their children are older or out of the house before running for office, but Dittmar said she thinks that’s changing.</p>
<p>“A lot of the women who have young kids feel like there’s a lot going on in the world and in their states that they need to speak up on and so you’re seeing that translate into candidacy and office holding,” she said.</p>
<p>It’s those life experiences that drive moms into running for office. Without people in positions of power who have experienced the challenges of raising children, things like child care aren’t prioritized issues, Grechen Shirley said.</p>
<p>“When you talk to men about why they ran, they say ‘I thought I would be good at this job’. When you talk to a woman, a mom with young kids in particular, there’s usually one particular issue that they reached out to their local representative to get help with and either never heard back from their representative or didn’t get the help that they needed and they said ‘you know what, I can do this job better,’” Grechen Shirley said.</p>
<p>For example, the female-majority in Nevada has advocated for policies such as the “pregnancy fairness act” that strengthens protections beyond federal law for pregnant and postpartum workers and endorsed a maternal mortality review committee to improve health outcomes, the Current has reported. In January, eight weeks of paid family leave for state employees after the birth or adoption of a child or to care for a family member with a serious illness took effect. Other issues, including pay equity, remain on the agenda.</p>
<p>Lawless didn’t think achieving parity between mothers in the population and in elected office was necessary, though. More important to Lawless was working toward equal representation of women in political office and campaigns, regardless of their family status.</p>
<p>“Right now if we continue at the rate we are currently electing women in Congress, it won’t be until 2108 that we reach parity for women,” she said.</p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s 45-day early voting window began Friday for the June 18 primaries that will set the stage for the state’s U.S. Senate race as well as a handful of competitive races for seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans are choosing a nominee to challenge U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va. in a statewide contest this fall, and at least one party is holding a primary in six of Virginia’s 11 congressional districts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In-person early voting is underway at all local voter registrar offices, and many localities also offer satellite early voting sites. Would-be voters can find details on their local election office on the </span><a href="https://vote.elections.virginia.gov/VoterInformation/PublicContactLookup" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Department of Elections website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which also offers an </span><a href="https://vote.elections.virginia.gov/VoterInformation" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online citizen portal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allowing voters to check their registration status, register to vote, find out which congressional district they’re in and apply for an absentee ballot to be sent through the mail. The deadline to request a mail absentee ballot is June 7.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters casting ballots in person will need to present an </span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/media/formswarehouse/voter-id/outreach-materials/documents/Voter-Identification-Chart---Revised-08.23.2023.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">acceptable form of identification</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but anyone lacking an ID will still be able to cast a provisional ballot that will only be counted if elections officials verify their eligibility later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In districts with both a Republican and Democratic congressional primary, voters will be asked to choose a ballot for one party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine is considered a strong frontrunner in the Senate race. Virginia has voted Democratic in every presidential election year since 2008, and the five Republicans vying to compete against him in November aren’t particularly well-known. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GOP Senate field includes former congressional candidate and U.S. Navy veteran Hung Cao, U.S. Army veteran Eddie Garcie, attorneys Jonathan Emord and Chuck Smith and Scott Parkinson, who works for the conservative economic group Club for Growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More competition is anticipated in the U.S. House races, particularly in the Hampton Roads-based 2nd District and two Northern Virginia seats coming open in the 7th and 10th House Districts. A closely watched Republican primary is also playing out in the 5th District, which leans Republican and stretches through the central part of the state.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">7th District</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger — a Democrat who currently represents the 7th District anchored in Prince William County and the Fredericksburg area — isn’t running for election this year because she’s running for governor in 2025.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seven Democrats and six Republicans are competing in their respective primaries for the 7th District seat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The top fundraisers in the Democratic race are retired Army colonel Eugene Vindman, Del. Brianna Sewell, former Del. Elizabeth Guzman and Prince William Supervisors Margaret Angela and Andrea Bailey. Vindman — the brother of whistleblower Alex Vindman who </span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/08/trump-ukraine-call-impeachment-vindman/619617/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">called attention</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to a controversial 2019 phone call former President Donald Trump made urging Ukrainian officials to investigate President Joe Biden — has raised more than $3.7 million for his campaign, giving him a substantial money advantage over rivals that have more experience in Virginia politics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most well-funded Republican candidates are Army veteran Derrick Anderson, who previously ran for the seat in 2022, and former Navy SEAL Cameron Hamilton.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">10th District</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A dozen Democratic candidates are competing for the opportunity to replace U.S. Rep. Jennifer Wexton, D-Loudoun, who announced she won’t run for reelection after being diagnosed with a severe form of Parkinson’s Disease.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several big names in Democratic politics are in the running for the Democratic-leaning Northern Virginia seat, including former House of Delegates Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn, Sen. Jennifer Boysko, Del. Dan Helmer, Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, Del. David Reid and former Virginia education secretary Atif Qarni.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Running on the Republican side are attorney and technology executive Mike Clancy, Marine Corps veteran and former Youngkin administration official Aliscia Andrews, retired military officer Alex Isaac and defense contractor Manga Anantatmula.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">2nd District</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, is a top target for Democrats after narrowly flipping the 2nd District in 2022 by defeating former congresswoman Elaine Luria.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Missy Cotter Smasal, a Navy veteran and business owner, is being backed by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee to take on Kiggans, but she’s facing primary competition from civil rights and constitutional law attorney Jake Denton.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">5th District</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep Bob Good, R-Campbell, who chairs the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, is being challenged from the right by state Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland, in a hard-fought GOP primary where both candidates are angling for support from the Trump wing of the party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good has drawn criticism from McGuire over his decision to endorse Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for president instead of Trump, but Good’s campaign has returned fire by calling McGuire a political opportunist who’s constantly seeking higher office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The winner of the GOP primary would be the frontrunner in a Republican-leaning district that runs from the Charlottesville area to the outskirts of Richmond and includes the cities of Lynchburg and Danville.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three Democrats — Gloria Tinsley Witt, Paul Riley and Gary Terry — are also competing in a 5th District primary.</span></p>

(Photo by Gage Skidmore / <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gageskidmore/51825448131/">Flickr</a>/<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">CC BY-SA 2.0</a>)</p><p>Less than a week after the Republican National Committee unveiled a “historic” new program to monitor the polls for fraud, a top lawyer with the committee was among those indicted for an alleged scheme to use false fraud claims to overturn the results of Arizona’s presidential election.</p>
<p>Indeed, the lawyer, RNC senior counsel for election integrity Christina Bobb, was scheduled to appear April 25 at an online meeting to recruit activists for the GOP’s vote-watching effort, though she didn’t show up. The meeting was organized by fringe conspiracy theorists who, like Bobb, have helped spread lies about illegal voting.</p>
<p>Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes <a href="https://azmirror.com/2024/04/24/grand-jury-indicts-11-fake-electors-including-two-az-state-senators/" target="_blank">announced</a> the <a href="https://mcusercontent.com/cc1fad182b6d6f8b1e352e206/files/fa85cddf-ccc6-7dee-dd58-ff5e80d53b15/Indictment.03.pdf" target="_blank">indictments</a> on April 24 against 18 people, seven of whose names are redacted. Multiple <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/24/politics/arizona-criminal-charges-2020-election-subversion/index.html" target="_blank">news</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/24/us/arizona-fake-electors-trump.html" target="_blank">organizations</a> have used details in the indictment to identify Bobb and the other six. Mayes on Friday <a href="https://www.azag.gov/press-release/attorney-general-mayes-announces-names-additional-defendants-fake-elector-case" target="_blank">confirmed Bobb’s indictment.</a></p>
<p>The confluence of events involving Bobb, the RNC and a loose network of anti-fraud activists underscores how the Trump-controlled GOP appears to be laying the groundwork to contest this year’s election using the same false claims about illegal voting — and even some of the same key figures — as it did in 2020.</p>
<p>Asked for comment on Bobb’s reported indictment and whether she remained employed by the RNC, an RNC spokesperson declined to answer on the record.</p>
<p>Bobb did not respond to an inquiry about her failure to appear at the April 25 event.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">GOP’s ‘historic’ vote-monitoring program</h4>

	
<p>The Arizona indictments came less than a week after the Trump campaign and the RNC announced a “historic, 100,000 person strong” effort to closely monitor the voting process, calling it, “the most extensive and monumental election integrity program in the nation’s history.”</p>
<p>“Whenever a ballot is being cast or counted, Republican poll watchers will be observing the process and reporting any irregularity,” the RNC declared in a <a href="https://gop.com/press-release/trump-campaign-and-rnc-unveil-historic-100000-person-strong-election-integrity-program/" target="_blank">press release</a>.</p>
<p>The committee called the initiative “an historic collaboration between the RNC, the Trump Campaign, and passionate grassroots coalitions who are deeply invested in fighting voter fraud.” That appeared to be a reference to the party’s outreach to anti-fraud activists like those at Thursday’s meeting — many of whom have bought in to lies about the 2020 election.</p>
<p>Multiple lawsuits found no evidence of systematic or widespread fraud in 2020.</p>
<p>The RNC’s vote-monitoring effort has been championed by Lara Trump, former President Donald Trump’s daughter-in-law, who took over as RNC co-chair in late February. Bobb was announced as an election integrity lawyer at the RNC soon afterward.</p>
<p>Trump is the presumptive Republican nominee for president in 2024.</p>
<p>Lara Trump warned in an April 23 <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/tv/lara-trump-boasts-rnc-will-have-people-who-can-physically-handle-ballots-on-election-day/" target="_blank">interview</a> that the vote-monitoring program will include “people who can physically handle ballots” at polling places on Election Day. The rules for partisan poll watchers differ from state to state.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">17 charged in fake electors plot</h4>

	
<p>Bobb’s failure to attend Thursday’s online meeting, after organizers had promoted her appearance in advance, may have been because she has more urgent matters on her mind.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://mcusercontent.com/cc1fad182b6d6f8b1e352e206/files/fa85cddf-ccc6-7dee-dd58-ff5e80d53b15/Indictment.03.pdf" target="_blank">indictments</a> filed in Arizona allege a plot to use fake electors to overturn the state’s 2020 presidential vote.</p>
<p>The 11 people named in the indictment are the Arizona fake electors themselves, all Trump allies. The other seven people, whose names are redacted, have been identified by news outlets, including <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/24/politics/arizona-criminal-charges-2020-election-subversion/index.html" target="_blank">CNN</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/24/us/arizona-fake-electors-trump.html" target="_blank">The New York Times</a>, as Bobb, as well as Trump allies Rudy Giuliani, Mark Meadows, John Eastman, Jenna Ellis, Mike Roman and Boris Epshteyn. Mayes has since confirmed Eastman, Ellis, Roman and Epshteyn, who is still a Trump adviser.</p>
<p>One of the seven, the indictment says, “was an attorney for the Trump Campaign” and “made false claims of widespread election fraud in Arizona and in six other states.” That person also “encouraged the Arizona Legislature to change the outcome of the election,” and “encouraged (Vice President Mike) Pence to accept the false Arizona Republican electors’ votes on January 6, 2021,” according to the indictment.</p>
<p>Bobb joined the Trump campaign as a lawyer in the aftermath of the 2020 vote, and was among the campaign officials, led by Giuliani, who organized a scheme to use false fraud claims as justification for submitting fake electors in seven states Trump lost, including Arizona, CNN has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/politics/trump-campaign-officials-rudy-giuliani-fake-electors/index.html" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>Bobb also <a href="https://twitter.com/christina_bobb/status/1346907547949801473" target="_blank">tweeted</a> on Jan. 6, 2021: “<a href="https://twitter.com/VP" target="_blank">@VP</a><a href="https://twitter.com/Mike_Pence" target="_blank"> @Mike_Pence</a> can solve this now by sending it back to the legislators.”</p>
<p>The indictment lists Trump — unnamed but described as “a former president of the United States who spread false claims of election fraud following the 2020 election” — as an unindicted co-conspirator.</p>
<p>The indictment alleges that as part of the scheme, the fake electors voted for Trump to receive Arizona’s electoral votes, “falsely claiming to be the duly elected and qualified Electors for President and Vice President of the United States from the State of Arizona.”</p>
<p>“Defendants deceived the citizens of Arizona by falsely claiming that those votes were contingent only on a legal challenge that would change the outcome of the election,” the indictment continues. “In reality, Defendants intended that their false votes for Trump-Pence would encourage Pence to reject the Biden-Harris votes on January 6, 2021, regardless of the outcome of the legal challenge.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">RNC courts conspiracy theorists, election deniers</h4>

	
<p>The meeting at which Bobb was scheduled to appear Thursday was organized by two Florida activists with ties to leading election deniers, including MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, and included hundreds of grassroots anti-fraud activists from across the country.</p>
<p>It follows a similar April 4 <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/republican-national-committee-courts-election-conspiracy-theorists-help-watch-polls" target="_blank">event</a>, at which the director of the RNC’s election integrity program, Christina Norton, told activists how to get involved with the party’s vote-monitoring program. States Newsroom attended both virtual meetings.</p>
<p>The April 25 meeting featured a parade of speakers, including the former Democratic consultant Naomi Wolf, making claims about illegal voting in 2020 and 2022, predicting that this year’s vote will be similarly rigged, and rallying supporters to take action.</p>
<p>“The current situation is that President Trump will once again win the presidential election just as he did in 2020,” said one speaker, Greg Stenstrom, a Pennsylvania-based conspiracy theorist who co-authored the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Parallel-Election-Blueprint-Deception/dp/1958682292" target="_blank">book</a> “The Parallel Election: A Blueprint for Deception<em>,” </em>which alleged massive fraud in that state’s 2020 vote.</p>
<p>“But it will be taken from him, and all of us, again, unless we restore fair and honest elections in the short time we have remaining before November. He cannot hold onto the presidency unless we act.”</p>
<p>In place of a live appearance by Bobb, Steve Stern, an organizer of the call, played an interview he’d conducted recently with her for his podcast.</p>
<p>In the interview, Stern asked Bobb what could be done about President Joe Biden’s plan to add “a million illegal aliens” to the voter rolls. (There is <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/jan/12/donald-trump/trumps-claim-that-millions-of-immigrants-are-signi/" target="_blank">no evidence </a>that Biden has such a plan, despite frequent similar claims by the far right.)</p>
<p>Bobb agreed there is a “concerted effort to empower the illegals to cast ballots,” adding: “It’s a very, very, serious issue this time around, and it’s something that we’re looking into. … Is it something that law enforcement needs to handle, because there could potentially be a criminal component to it?”</p>
<p>“As far as illegals voting,” Bobb continued, “once they have registered, it’s very hard to undo that process. Because the registration is presumed valid.”</p>
<p>Studies have consistently shown that the amount of voting by non-citizens is minuscule. A 2017 Brennan Center <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/noncitizen-voting-missing-millions" target="_blank">analysis</a> found that suspected — not proven — votes by non-citizens accounted for just 0.0001 percent of all votes cast in the 2016 election.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Other connections</h4>

	
<p>In addition to these two meetings, there have been other recent instances of RNC staff courting right-wing activists who have spread election disinformation.</p>
<p>Bobb <a href="https://twitter.com/BreannaMorello/status/1768786469890425046" target="_blank">spoke</a> last month with the far-right podcaster Breanna Morello. And she joined a recent conference call with several Trump-allied groups that have promoted lies about 2020, the Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/01/republican-election-integrity-denier" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>Both the April 25 and April 4 meetings were organized by Stern and Raj Doraisamy, two far-right Florida activists and Lindell allies who have helped spread false claims about illegal voting.</p>
<p>Last month, Stern spoke with Steve Bannon, the former Trump adviser, to promote the April 4 meeting. “We have so many illegal aliens in this country,” Stern said. “They want to vote. We gotta stop them.”</p>
<p>Doraisamy was <a href="https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/news/politics/2022/02/06/defend-florida-lobbying-legislature-and-ron-desantis-voting-restrictions-conservative-group-gop/9244145002/" target="_blank">reportedly</a> outside the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and went on to found a group, Defend Florida, that went door to door to gather thousands of “affidavits” from Floridians in an effort to show that the state’s 2020 election was corrupted by massive fraud.</p>
<p>At a 2022 <a href="https://rumble.com/v139iop-desantis-signs-election-integrity-bill-into-law.html" target="_blank">event</a> organized by the group, Doraisamy thanked Lindell for his help with the door-to-door effort.</p>
<p>Also speaking at the April 25 meeting call was Joe Hoft, whose Gateway Pundit website, co-founded with Hoft’s brother Jim, has been a <a href="https://missouriindependent.com/briefs/gateway-pundit-accused-of-purposely-delaying-defamation-case-involving-false-fraud-claims/" target="_blank">key vector</a> for the spread of false conspiracy theories about the 2020 election, the covid vaccine, and more.</p>
<p>Joe Hoft’s self-published book, “The Steal,” is described this way on its Google Books <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Steal.html?id=JeFezwEACAAJ" target="_blank">page</a>: “It’s early in the morning of November 4th, President Trump was way ahead in the swing states, but he warned of 4am ballot drops. He was right again. When Americans woke up later that morning, the election had been stolen.”</p>
<p>Another speaker at the meeting, Jay Valentine, used initial funding from Lindell to create voter data monitoring software.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.americanoversight.org/in-the-documents-wisconsin-state-representatives-contacts-with-election-denying-activists-and-lawyers" target="_blank">documents</a> obtained by the progressive group American Oversight, Valentine has worked closely with Trump lawyer Sidney Powell, a key figure in the effort to overturn the 2020 election, to convince lawmakers in Wisconsin and other states to use his “fractal programming technology” to uncover mass fraud.</p>
<p>“Voter fraud is a nationwide crime perpetrated locally, mostly by Democrats,” Valentine <a href="https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2021/05/needed_a_national_election_fraud_database.html" target="_blank">has written</a> separately, promoting the idea of a national election fraud database. “We cannot fight industrial, sovereign, large-scale, election fraud with reports, press releases, and webinars.”</p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After years of partisan debate over the state of Virginia’s election system, Gov. Glenn Youngkin blocked Democratic bills meant to continue the adoption of ranked choice voting, expand legal protections for voting rights and modify data practices to avoid canceling the registrations of eligible voters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor also vetoed a measure that would have expanded the state’s existing ban on guns at polling places and nixed a bill that would have added photo identification cards issued by nursing homes and other state-licensed medical facilities to Virginia’s list of acceptable IDs for voting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin characterized several of the proposals as unnecessary complications, while several Democratic lawmakers said the governor was letting politics get in the way of good governance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It really lets us know who’s on what side of protecting our democracy,” said Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, who chairs the House Privileges and Elections Committee.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Voting lawsuits</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin vetoed </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB623" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sponsored by Price that would have strengthened a state-level voting rights law </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2021/03/12/virginia-is-set-to-become-the-first-southern-state-with-its-own-voting-rights-act-heres-what-it-does/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">she championed in 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> meant to prevent discrimination against minority groups.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under that law, the attorney general’s office and impacted voters can file lawsuits in response to perceived voting rights violations. Price’s 2024 bill would have also allowed advocacy groups focused on voting access to sue over planned changes to voting locations or reductions in hours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview, Price said the goal was to create more ways to prevent voter disenfranchisement instead of leaving it solely in the hands of the attorney general’s office and voters themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In actual practice, we’re seeing that people have lives, people have jobs, people may not know how to navigate court systems,” Price said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vetoed bill also would have added new rules requiring localities to come up with more detailed plans for satellite voting locations and preventing last-minute changes. Last year, the Richmond Electoral Board </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/07/27/gop-electoral-boards-move-to-cut-richmond-early-voting-sites-may-have-been-illegal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">caused an uproar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by announcing the city would not open two satellite voting sites for early voting as it had in previous years, a decision reversed after activists said it would disproportionately impact minorities and Richmonders who rely on public transportation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s veto statement primarily took issue with the bill’s expansion of who can file voting rights lawsuits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Current law allows voters to sue for violations under the Virginia Voter Rights Act,” Youngkin’s veto said. “The proposal will lead to administrative burdens and legal complexities that could hinder the fair and efficient administration of elections in our commonwealth.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Ranked choice voting</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Youngkin won the Republican nomination for governor in 2021 through a form of ranked choice voting the Virginia GOP used at a convention, he vetoed a bill that would have clarified the process of how the voting method can be used in government-run elections for some local offices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Current Virginia law allows local governments to adopt ranked choice voting, which allows voters to rank candidates based on who they like best and tabulates results over several rounds in which votes for the lowest-performing candidates are redistributed to others still in the running, for city council and county board races only. Arlington County is </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/07/18/after-being-first-in-virginia-to-use-it-arlington-hits-brakes-on-ranked-choice-voting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">already using ranked choice voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in local primaries, and democracy reform advocates are trying to get more local governments to embrace it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2024 </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB428" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ranked choice voting bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> initially would have allowed the method to be used in any local election, including school boards and constitutional offices. However, it was scaled back to focus mainly on “cleanup” language clarifying how the process should work and creating state standards for tabulation software and voting equipment, according to Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, the bill’s sponsor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s recognizing that ranked choice voting is here … and that a lot of localities have the choice of using ranked choice voting,” VanValkenburg said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some advocates for ranked-choice voting </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/how-ranked-choice-voting-saved-the-virginia-gop-from-itself/2021/11/05/6d1aa738-3dc2-11ec-8ee9-4f14a26749d1_story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">point to</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Youngkin’s 2021 victory as evidence of how the process can encourage consensus picks and disfavor the most extreme or polarizing candidates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of Youngkin’s opponents that year was former GOP state Sen. Amanda Chase, a hard-right figure with diehard support among some conservative activists but limited general-election appeal. The Virginia GOP’s choices to hold a convention with ranked choice voting minimized the chances of a Chase victory and allowed Republicans who preferred a more mainstream candidate to consolidate support behind Youngkin even if he wasn’t their first choice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor’s veto called ranked choice voting new to both Virginia and the nation and said “legitimate questions” about it need to be resolved before going further.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concerns have been raised about its use in general elections where some voters have found it confusing,” Youngkin said in his veto. “A heightened risk of mistakenly erroneous ballot submissions raises concerns about disenfranchisement and an increased lack of voter confidence in election results.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VanValkenburg said he feels politics, particularly the general hostility and suspicion toward ranked choice voting from many Republicans, is the real explanation for Youngkin’s veto, even though the legislation wasn’t a simple question of whether ranked choice voting should or shouldn’t exist in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think there are Democrats in the General Assembly who don’t like ranked choice voting,” he said. “But that’s not what this bill was.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Voter roll maintenance</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price filed </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB904" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">another bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in response to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/01/voting-rights-advocates-blast-youngkin-admin-over-error-affecting-3400/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">widely publicized data issues</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year that led Virginia election officials to wrongfully cancel the voter registrations of roughly 3,400 people who were eligible to vote despite past felony convictions.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="8lkpkxxQFe"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/01/voting-rights-advocates-blast-youngkin-admin-over-error-affecting-3400/">Voting rights advocates blast Youngkin admin over error affecting 3,400</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Voting rights advocates blast Youngkin admin over error affecting 3,400&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/01/voting-rights-advocates-blast-youngkin-admin-over-error-affecting-3400/embed/#?secret=fDCtV3V0Vt#?secret=8lkpkxxQFe" data-secret="8lkpkxxQFe" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her proposal would have established new data integrity criteria requiring election officials to reach a certain level of confidence before canceling the registration of a voter who may have moved, gone inactive or become ineligible after committing a crime. It also would have created a new process for giving voters a chance to dispute information suggesting they had a new felony conviction, and force election officials to keep public records showing who was removed from voter rolls and why.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin suggested delaying the measure for a year so officials can conduct a multi-agency study on how data is collected and shared for the purposes of maintaining accurate voter rolls. He recommended that study be completed by Nov. 30 and asked that the General Assembly be required to reapprove the bill next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price said she’s going to ask her colleagues to reject Youngkin’s amendment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Y’all already did an investigation,” Price said, referring to a review the Office of the State Inspector General completed last December that concluded the erroneous cancellations in 2023 were accidental. “We don’t need to study it. We know what happened. And this bill is an answer to it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin also vetoed Democratic bills that would have restored Virginia’s participation in ERIC, a multi-state voter data sharing program that has been abandoned by many red states after coming under fire from conservative activists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his veto statement on the ERIC bill, Youngkin said there were valid concerns about how the organization was being run.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have been explicitly clear about my affirmation of the legitimacy of our elections,” the governor’s veto said. “My focus is safeguarding Virginians&#8217; private information and continuously improving an efficient, cost-effective voter registration system.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Expanding list of acceptable IDs</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A relatively minor </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB26" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would have required election officials to accept identification cards issued by state-licensed private medical facilities such as nursing homes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia no longer requires a photo ID to vote, and the list of acceptable forms of identification is already extensive. It includes driver’s licenses whether current or expired, student IDs from Virginia colleges, nursing home IDs from government facilities and a variety of other official documents showing the voter’s name and address.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s veto noted that Virginians can also get a free ID card specifically for voting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Expanding this list presents additional complexities for poll workers in discerning which forms of identification are acceptable,” Youngkin’s veto said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any voter without ID is asked to sign a sworn statement verifying their identity and officials do additional research to determine if their ballot should be counted.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Wider gun bans near election sites</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State law already prohibits firearms within 40 feet of polling places. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB939" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> approved by the General Assembly would have grown that buffer to 100 feet and applied the restriction to satellite voting sites and any buildings where recounts are being performed or where an electoral board meeting is taking place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s veto suggested the bill would create a minefield of no-gun zones firearm owners would have to avoid that would shift according to the election calendar. Brandishing a firearm to intimidate would-be voters, Youngkin noted, is already a crime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">his legislation proposes intricate time-and-place restrictions on carrying firearms, potentially turning law-abiding citizens into unintentional criminals if they are unaware of the presence of a ballot drop-off box or an electoral board meeting,” the governor’s veto said.</span></p>

(Getty Images)</p><p>This year’s presidential election will be the first since generative AI — a form of artificial intelligence that can create new content, including images, audio and video — became widely available. That’s raising fears that millions of voters could be deceived by a barrage of political deepfakes.</p>
<p>But, while Congress has done little to address the issue, states are moving aggressively to respond — though questions remain about how effective any new measures to combat AI-created disinformation will be.</p>
<p>During Virginia&#8217;s 2024 legislative session, lawmakers reviewed about two dozen pieces of legislation related to artificial intelligence. One measure, Democratic Sen. Suhas Subramanyam&#8217;s <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SJ14" target="_blank">Senate Joint Resolution 14</a>, orders the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission to continue studying the impact of AI in the state.</p>
<div>It calls for a specific focus on understanding “deep fakes, data privacy implications, and misinformation,” as well as how to avoid the technology leading to discrimination and ensuring equity in AI algorithms. The resolution was continued to 2025.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Senate Bill 621 — to establish a commission dedicated solely to advising the governor on AI policy in Virginia — was folded into <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+bil+SB0487" target="_blank">Senate Bill 487</a>, which ultimately passed out of both chambers of the legislature, was included in its budget and now awaits a veto, signature or amendment by Gov. Youngkin by April 8.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The measure also directs the Joint Commission on Technology and Science to &#8220;conduct an analysis of the use of artificial intelligence by public bodies&#8221; in Virginia, and send a report replete with recommendations to the House Committees on Appropriations and Communications, Technology and Innovation and the Senate Committees on Finance and Appropriations and General Laws and Technology by Dec. 1 of this year.</div>

</div>
<p>Last year, a fake, AI-generated <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/slovakias-election-deepfakes-show-ai-is-a-danger-to-democracy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">audio recording</a> of a conversation between a liberal Slovakian politician and a journalist, in which they discussed how to rig the country’s upcoming election, offered a warning to democracies around the world.</p>
<p>Here in the United States, the urgency of the AI threat was driven home in February, when, in the days before the New Hampshire primary, thousands of voters in the state received a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/22/politics/fake-joe-biden-robocall/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">robocall</a> with an AI-generated voice impersonating President Joe Biden, urging them not to vote. A Democratic operative working for a rival candidate has <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ai-robocall-biden-new-hampshire-primary-2024-f94aa2d7f835ccc3cc254a90cd481a99" target="_blank" rel="noopener">admitted</a> to commissioning the calls.</p>
<p>In response to the call, the Federal Communications Commission <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/fcc-bans-ai-generated-voices-in-robocalls-that-can-deceive-voters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issued</a> a ruling restricting robocalls that contain AI-generated voices.</p>
<p>Some conservative groups even appear to be <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/new-antidemocracy-tool" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using AI tools</a> to assist with mass voter registration challenges — raising concerns that the technology could be harnessed to help existing voter suppression <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/new-antidemocracy-tool" target="_blank" rel="noopener">schemes</a>.</p>
<p>“Instead of voters looking to trusted sources of information about elections, including their state or county board of elections, AI-generated content can grab the voters’ attention,” said Megan Bellamy, vice president for law and policy at the Voting Rights Lab, an advocacy group that tracks election-related state legislation. “And this can lead to chaos and confusion leading up to and even after Election Day.”</p>
<h4 class="editorialSubhed">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Disinformation worries</h4>

	</h4>
<p>The AI threat has emerged at a time when democracy advocates already are deeply concerned about the potential for “ordinary” online disinformation to confuse voters, and when allies of former President Donald Trump appear to be having success in <a class="c-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/17/us/politics/trump-disinformation-2024-social-media.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/17/us/politics/trump-disinformation-2024-social-media.html" data-sk="tooltip_parent">fighting off</a> efforts to curb disinformation.</p>
<p>But states are responding to the AI threat. Since the start of last year, 101 bills addressing AI and election disinformation have been introduced, according to a March 26 analysis by the Voting Rights Lab.</p>
<p>On March 27, Oregon became the latest state — after Wisconsin, New Mexico, Indiana and Utah — to enact a law on AI-generated election disinformation. Florida and Idaho lawmakers have passed their own measures, which are currently on the desks of those states’ governors.</p>
<p>Arizona, Georgia, Iowa and Hawaii, meanwhile, have all passed at least one bill — in the case of Arizona, two — through one chamber.</p>
<p>As that list of states makes clear, red, blue and purple states all have devoted attention to the issue.</p>
<h4 class="editorialSubhed">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">States urged to act</h4>

	</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, a new <a href="https://www.newdealforum.org/newdeal-forum-publications/artificial-intelligence-and-elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> on how to combat the AI threat to elections, drawing on input from four Democratic secretaries of state, was released March 25 by the NewDEAL Forum, a progressive advocacy group.</p>
<p>“[G]enerative AI has the ability to drastically increase the spread of election mis- and disinformation and cause confusion among voters,” the report warned. “For instance, ‘deepfakes’ [AI-generated images, voices or videos] could be used to portray a candidate saying or doing things that never happened.”</p>
<p>The NewDEAL Forum report urges states to take several steps to respond to the threat, including requiring that certain kinds of AI-generated campaign material be clearly labeled; conducting role-playing exercises to help anticipate the problems that AI could cause; creating rapid-response systems for communicating with voters and the media, in order to knock down AI-generated disinformation; and educating the public ahead of time.</p>

<p>Despite the flurry of activity by lawmakers, officials and outside experts, several of the measures examined in the Voting Rights Lab analysis appear to have weaknesses or loopholes that may raise questions about their ability to effectively protect voters from AI.</p>
<p>Most of the bills require that creators add a disclaimer to any AI-generated content, noting the use of AI, as the NewDEAL Forum report recommends.</p>
<p>But the new Wisconsin law, for instance, requires the disclaimer only for content created by campaigns, meaning deepfakes produced by outside groups but intended to influence an election — hardly an unlikely scenario — would be unaffected.</p>
<p>In addition, the measure is limited to content produced by generative AI, even though experts say other types of synthetic content that don’t use AI, such as Photoshop and CGI — sometimes referred to as “cheap fakes” — can be just as effective at fooling viewers or listeners, and can be more easily produced.</p>
<p>For that reason, the NewDEAL Forum report recommends that state laws cover all synthetic content, not just that which use AI.</p>
<p>The Indiana, Utah and Wisconsin laws also contain no criminal penalties — violations are punishable by a $1,000 fine — raising questions about whether they will work as a deterrent.</p>
<p>The Arizona and Florida bills do include criminal penalties. But Arizona’s two bills apply only to digital impersonation of a candidate, meaning plenty of other forms of AI-generated deception — impersonating a news anchor reporting a story, for instance — would remain legal.</p>
<p>And one of the Arizona bills, as well as New Mexico’s law, applied only in the 90 days before an election, even though AI-generated content that appears before that window could potentially still affect the vote.</p>
<p>Experts say the shortcomings exist in large part because, since the threat is so new, states don’t yet have a clear sense of exactly what form it will take.</p>
<p>“The legislative bodies are trying to figure out the best approach, and they’re working off of examples that they’ve already seen,” said Bellamy, pointing to the examples of the Slovakian audio and the Biden robocalls.</p>
<p>“They’re just not sure what direction this is coming from, but feeling the need to do something.”</p>
<p>Bellamy added: “I think that we will see the solutions evolve. The danger of that is that AI-generated content and what it can do is also likely to evolve at the same time. So hopefully we can keep up.”</p>

Parker Michels-Boyce for The Virginia Mercury</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A federal judge gave a greenlight Monday to a novel legal argument challenging Virginia’s longstanding felon disenfranchisement policy based on limits imposed on the state when the Civil War ended.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit is focused on the 1870 Virginia Readmission Act, a federal law that allowed the former Confederate state to rejoin the U.S. Congress. As a condition for regaining elected representatives in the federal government, the law states that the Virginia Constitution cannot be used to deprive anyone of voting rights “except as a punishment for such crimes that are now felonies at common law.” At the time, common law felonies included “murder, manslaughter, arson, burglary, robbery, rape, sodomy, mayhem and larceny,” according to filings in the case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By now stripping voting rights for all felonies instead of a particular set of crimes, the lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia and other groups alleges, the state has fallen out of compliance with the Reconstruction-era law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voting rights and social justice groups have fought for years to scale back the scope of Virginia’s felon voting policy, which many advocates say disproportionately affects Black communities because of broader disparities in the criminal justice system. Under the state’s current </span><a href="https://www.restore.virginia.gov/restoration-of-rights-process/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, people with felony convictions can ask to have their voting rights restored by the governor, but governors have broad leeway to be as lenient or as strict as they wish in granting or denying those requests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his initial opinion on the case, U.S. Eastern District Court Judge John A. Gibney Jr. indicated that argument had enough legal merit to survive the state’s attempts to have the case thrown out. Rejecting the state’s assertion that federal courts shouldn’t intervene in what’s effectively a Virginia political matter, Gibney ruled that the case “plausibly presents” the possibility that Virginia officials are violating federal law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the judge dismissed some aspects of the case, the ACLU of Virginia hailed the ruling as a victory for their side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia may no longer be a Confederate state, but the provision of our constitution that was specifically put in place to suppress the voting rights of newly enfranchised Black citizens after the Civil War is still oppressing Virginians today,” Vishal Agraharkar, a lawyer with the ACLU of Virginia, said in a news release. “Virginia is still living in the past, but by allowing our case to proceed today, the court demonstrated that it’s never too late to work for justice.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ACLU is working on the case with the WilmerHale law firm and a voting rights group called Protect Democracy. The plaintiffs are Virginians with felony convictions who have tried to have their voting rights restored by Gov. Glenn Yougkin without success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gibney removed a nonprofit group called Bridging the Gap from the case after ruling a general interest in helping former prisoners reenter society wasn’t enough to give the organization legal standing to sue. The judge also dismissed several other legal theories in the case, finding that the Virginia Readmission Act didn’t create affirmative rights for Virginia voters and concluding felon disenfranchisement isn’t a “punishment” as defined in the Eighth Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The judge declined to dismiss Youngkin and Secretary of the Commonwealth Kelly Gee, who oversees felon rights restorations for the Youngkin administration, as defendants in the suit. The state had argued the governor and his team don’t have a strong enough connection to the challenged policy to be included in the litigation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But under Virginia’s voting rights restoration scheme,” Gibney wrote, “these defendants may enforce the permanent disenfranchisement of certain individuals.”</span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>By <span class="tnt-byline">Emily Richardson/Capital News Service</span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Gov. Glenn Youngkin recently vetoed two bills that would have allowed Virginia to rejoin a national organization that helps maintain voter rolls.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The nonpartisan <a href="https://ericstates.org/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="3">Election Registration Information Center</a>, or ERIC, ensures up-to-date voter rolls and helps voters register when they move, according to Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico. Virginia was a founding member of ERIC in 2012 under the direction of former Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia withdrew from ERIC in May 2023, citing other states departing and “increasing concerns regarding stewardship, maintenance, privacy and confidentiality of voter information,” among other reasons, according to a <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/23810805/file_0097-2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="4">letter from the commissioner</a> of the Virginia Department of Elections. Nine states had left ERIC by October 2023, according to VanValkenburg.</p>
<p dir="ltr">VanValkenburg introduced <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=SB606" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="5">Senate Bill 606</a> to require state membership in ERIC and a budget amendment to cover membership fees. Del. Mark Sickles, D-Fairfax, introduced an <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB1177" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="6">identical measure</a>. Democrats narrowly pushed the proposals past both chambers, where they hold a slim majority.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The vetoes come at a time when election methods and voting-related policy are being questioned by state legislatures <a href="https://news.wgcu.org/elections/2024-03-05/new-laws-across-states-will-affect-voting-in-november-elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="7">across the country</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Objectively, ERIC is the best way to maintain up-to-date voter rolls,” VanValkenburg said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He expressed <a href="https://twitter.com/ScVanValkenburg/status/1766504572409815295" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="8">disappointment</a> with the veto and the governor’s “continued insistence on playing politics with our election security” ahead of the 2024 election on X, formerly known as Twitter.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It is deeply troubling for our democracy when our Governor and Virginia Republicans compromise the security of our elections and our ability to maintain accurate voter lists in an attempt to satiate the most extreme, MAGA-wing of their party,” VanValkenburg stated.</p>
<p dir="ltr">VanValkenburg said he thought the governor might <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/Vetoes-(1).pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="9">veto</a> his bill. The state budget has $200,000 allotted to cover the membership cost, which the General Assembly passed in its final <a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/get/amendmentpdf/4922/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="10">version</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Department of Elections could use ERIC in tandem with other services, Sickles <a href="https://twitter.com/ScVanValkenburg/status/1766504572409815295" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="11">stated</a>. He also pointed out that the department previously praised ERIC.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Nothing changed in the ERIC states to reduce its effectiveness or quality,” Sickles stated.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A <a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/media/formswarehouse/maintenance-reports/2022-List-Maintenance-Report_final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="12">2022 list maintenance report</a> by the Virginia Department of Elections states that participation in ERIC “streamlined” Virginia’s cooperation with other states in the sharing of voter registration data.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/media/formswarehouse/maintenance-reports/2023-List-Maintenance-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="13">2023 report</a> briefly mentions ERIC but focused on how the department now works to confirm state voter data, including felony convictions that prevent a person from voting. The new approach yielded <a href="https://spanberger.house.gov/posts/spanberger-joins-virginia-democrats-in-once-again-pushing-doj-to-investigate-youngkin-administrations-purging-of-voter-rolls" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="14">criticism </a>after 3,400 qualified voters were purged from the list.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia signed <a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/news-releases/virginia-signs-agreements-with-six-states-as-part-of-improvements-to-accuracy-of-voter-list.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="15">agreements</a> with six nearby states last September to share data and “securely compare voter lists and identify potential voter fraud.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">At present, 24 states and the District of Columbia are ERIC members. There was a recent exodus of Republican-led member states fueled by “right-wing misinformation,” according to VanValkenburg.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia&#8217;s decision to leave ERIC was a result of “persistent management issues, improper data use, escalating costs and the inability to meet statutory requirements for border state information sharing,” the governor stated in his <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/Vetoes-(1).pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="16">veto</a> of SB 606.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia attempted to reform the organization’s bylaws before leaving, according to Youngkin’s spokesperson Christian Martinez.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Virginia decided to diversify its list maintenance efforts, successfully sought direct access to state and federal data sources and increased the number of states from where we receive data,” Martinez stated.</p>
<p dir="ltr">These current agreements incur no additional costs, according to the veto, which also states that ERIC membership fees have increased more than 115% since 2022.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Election law became a partisan issue as a result of misinformation former President Donald Trump and other election deniers spread about ERIC and election administration, VanValkenburg said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I think ERIC got caught up in the big lie of the 2020 election, and unfortunately that’s filtered its way down to the votes on rejoining,” VanValkenburg said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It is important for the legislature to make secure and accessible elections a bipartisan priority, VanValkenburg said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“That’s something that I’ve worked on, and Democrats have worked on since I’ve been in the General Assembly,” VanValkenburg said. “It’s unfortunate that we didn’t get bipartisan support.”</p>

But under new language included in the budget passed by the Democratic General Assembly, there would be no such audit of the 2024 presidential contest.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="7I9pxQw5dX"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2021/03/31/audit-overwhelmingly-confirms-virginias-election-results/">Audit overwhelmingly confirms Virginia&#8217;s election results</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the term “audit” is often invoked by conservative activists to mean an intensive investigation into results they find suspicious, state law requires “risk-limiting audits” to be performed for some elections to verify the accuracy of voting equipment. The process involves hand counting only enough ballots to obtain “strong statistical evidence that the reported outcome is correct,” according to </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title24.2/chapter6/section24.2-671.2/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Mark Sickles, D-Fairfax, said the budget language both clarifies the intent of a 2022 bill that tweaked the process and ensures an audit won’t inhibit Virginia’s ability to certify its presidential outcome in accordance with the federal Electoral College timeline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People are worried about any excuse someone might make for not certifying the election,” Sickles said in an interview. “After what happened last time, people are kind of sensitive about what things people might use to try tying things up in litigation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The approved amendment in the budget specifies that “a risk-limiting audit of a presidential election or an election for the nomination of candidates for the office of president shall not be conducted.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2023-RLA-Manual_FINAL.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previous guidance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Virginia Department of Elections had indicated that in 2024, a statewide audit would be performed for either the presidential contest or Virginia’s U.S. Senate race. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the budget language stands, election officials would most likely perform an audit of the race between U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., and his to-be-determined GOP challenger, as well as a randomly selected U.S. House of Representatives election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State law doesn’t require risk-limiting audits for presidential elections, instead leaving it to the discretion of state election officials to choose which contests to audit. Applying the process to statewide races can help officials comply with a rule requiring every local election office to participate in an audit “at least once every five years.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The audit of Virginia’s 2020 presidential results happened after the results were certified, meaning it didn’t affect Virginia’s ability to officially report Biden’s victory. In a major difference, the 2022 law requires audits to be completed before certification of the outcome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tram Nguyen, a voting rights advocate with left-leaning New Virginia Majority, said the budget item ensures the audit process doesn’t “end up messing up the presidential timeline.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think risk-limiting audits are great,” Nguyen said. “They are a best practice across the country.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The budget item dealing with audits also extends the post-election timeline for local electoral boards to certify results. It gives officials 10 days, three more than existing law, to check the validity of outstanding ballots and verify local results to the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two GOP lawmakers who signed off on the budget — Senate Minority Leader Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover and Sen. Todd Pillion, R-Abingdon — wrote on the document that they objected to the amendment dealing with elections. Efforts to reach McDougle and the Senate GOP were unsuccessful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The budget is currently under review by Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who made audits a key piece of his “election integrity” focus while campaigning in 2021. Former Gov. Terry Mcauliffe </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2021/10/08/youngkin-mcauliffe-spar-over-election-audits/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">attacked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Youngkin over that position, saying the emphasis on audits was a nod to conspiracy theories about the 2020 election being stolen from Trump. Youngkin insisted he was only professing support for the standard, risk-limiting audits Virginia has </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+sum+SB1254" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">required since 2018</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement Wednesday, Youngkin’s office said it’s looking over the budget but emphasized that Youngkin “has been committed to restoring Virginians’ faith in our elections and improving the voting processes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That means using all the tools at our disposal to ensure the integrity of our elections,” said Youngkin spokesman Christian Martinez.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite persistent Republican criticism that Virginia’s election system isn’t secure enough, there have been no examples of widespread voter fraud in recent years.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the 2020 election did produce a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/2020-election-error-in-prince-william-county-benefited-trump-officials-reveal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">significant counting error</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Prince William County, which caused Trump to get 2,327 more votes than he should have and subtracted 1,648 votes from Biden’s total. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That wasn’t enough to swing the outcome of any contests, officials said, but some saw it as an alarming example of an election error going undetected until long after the incorrect vote totals had been certified. It wasn’t until this year that Prince William officials revealed the full scope of the problem, a delay largely caused by the criminal prosecution of a former county election official that ended with all </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/02/prince-william-election-felony-charges-dropped/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">charges being dropped</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has different procedures for recounts of close races when ballot irregularities could potentially have a greater impact on election results. Court-supervised recounts can only be called if an election is decided by a margin of less than 1% of total votes cast for the winner and runner-up. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recount process mostly involves hand-counting ballots that couldn’t be read by scanning machines and having a court resolve disputes about whether a ballot can or can’t be counted for a particular candidate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump handily defeated former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, his last rival still standing in what was once a sizable GOP field. Several other Republican candidates qualified to appear on Virginia’s ballot but had already dropped out before Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden also faced light competition, beating Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips and activist Marianne Williamson in a contest the Associated Press called just nine minutes after the polls closed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia Democrats sent a loud and clear message: we are unequivocally behind President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. Virginia Republicans did the same as it pertains to Donald Trump,” Democratic Party of Virginia Chairwoman Susan Swecker said in a statement Tuesday evening, adding that the Virginia GOP had showed its fealty to a “destitute bigot.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s well-educated suburbs and potential for crossover votes under the state’s open primary system appeared to give Haley a slim chance of competing with Trump. But the early results showed she wasn’t doing well enough in those areas to counter the GOP frontrunner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Time for Nikki Haley to drop out so we can focus on getting rid of Joe Biden!” Trump-supporting state Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland, said on social media shortly after the race was called.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Virginia showed its swingy side in 2021 with the election of Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, the state has leaned solidly Democratic in higher-turnout presidential years. In 2020, Biden beat Trump in Virginia by more than 10 percentage points. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite some unfounded fraud claims from Trump supporters, a recently dropped criminal case involving the 2020 election revealed that the size of Biden’s victory was slightly understated due to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/2020-election-error-in-prince-william-county-benefited-trump-officials-reveal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">counting errors in Prince William County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> affecting a few thousand ballots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state hasn’t voted for a Republican presidential candidate since 2004, when former President George W. Bush defeated John Kerry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several polls have shown Biden well ahead of Trump in Virginia, but not by the double-digit margins of 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia’s other statewide contest this year, U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., is seeking a third term in office. </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/elections/us-senate/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eight Republicans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are expected to compete in a June primary for the chance to run against Kaine, but the GOP doesn’t appear to be treating the Virginia seat as a major pickup opportunity. Kaine comfortably defeated former Gov. George Allen in 2012 and won a blowout victory over hard-right Republican Corey Stewart in 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, when Virginia also had a U.S. Senate race alongside Trump on the ballot, U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., beat Republican Daniel Gade by 12 percentage points.</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There may not be much drama left in the presidential primaries, but Virginia voters will once again head to the polls today to cast their votes on who the Republican and Democratic standard-bearers should be in 2024.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s regular polling places are open from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. Would-be voters can check their status and polling place by using the state’s </span><a href="https://vote.elections.virginia.gov/VoterInformation" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online voter portal tool</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are considered heavy favorites to win their respective contests and the Virginia delegates at stake.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump is still facing active competition from former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, but the other four GOP candidates who qualified to be on the primary ballot in Virginia — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Texas pastor Ryan Binkley — have already dropped out of the race. Trump has defeated Haley in almost every state, but she has promised to stay in the running until at least Super Tuesday, when voters in more than a dozen states and American Samoa are casting ballots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Virginia’s Democratic ballot, Biden’s name will appear alongside Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips and activist Marianne Williamson, neither of whom appear to be seriously threatening the incumbent’s bid for a second term.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because Virginia doesn’t register voters by party, primary participants can choose to receive a Republican or Democratic ballot. Voters cannot cast ballots in both primaries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All voters are asked to present identification to vote; find a list of acceptable forms of I.D.</span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/media/formswarehouse/voter-id/outreach-materials/documents/Voter-Identification-Chart---Revised-10.2022.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you don’t have an acceptable form of I.D., you can still vote by either signing an affirmation of identity form and then using a regular ballot or completing a provisional ballot;</span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/casting-a-ballot/in-person-voting/#provisional-ballot" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">here’s how that process works</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia now has a same-day registration process allowing those who didn’t register in advance to cast a provisional ballot on the day of an election. However, those ballots aren’t counted immediately. They are only counted if officials can confirm the voter’s eligibility in a verification process that occurs shortly after Election Day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters under 18 are allowed to participate in the presidential primaries as long as they turn 18 before the Nov. 5 general election.</span></p>

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)</p><p>Former President Donald Trump must be placed on Colorado’s 2024 ballot, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously on Monday, striking down a first-of-its-kind holding by the Colorado Supreme Court that the Republican front-runner is <a href="https://coloradonewsline.com/2023/12/19/colorado-supreme-court-trump-2024-ballot-ruling/" target="_blank">disqualified from office</a> under a Civil War-era insurrection clause.</p>
<p>“Because the Constitution makes Congress, rather than the States, responsible for enforcing Section 3 (of the 14th Amendment) against federal officeholders and candidates, we reverse,” justices wrote in the unsigned, “per curiam” opinion.</p>
<p>The ruling — which comes just one day before Colorado holds its presidential primary election on Super Tuesday, March 5 — brings an end to a six-month legal saga that <a href="https://coloradonewsline.com/2024/02/08/colorado-lawsuit-against-trump-supreme-court/" target="_blank">began in Denver District Court</a> and sent shockwaves through American politics during its fast-tracked ascent through the judicial system.</p>
<p>Six Republican and unaffiliated Colorado voters, backed by the nonprofit Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, <a href="https://coloradonewsline.com/2023/09/06/lawsuit-bar-trump-colorado/" target="_blank">filed a lawsuit last September</a> alleging that Trump’s actions in relation to the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol disqualify him from office under Section 3. The clause prohibits a person who “engaged in insurrection” after taking an oath to support the Constitution from holding office again.</p>
<p>In a 4-3 majority opinion issued Dec. 19, the Colorado Supreme Court sided with the plaintiffs, ordering Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold not to certify Trump’s candidacy for the state’s 2024 Republican presidential primary. The historic ruling, which drew furious condemnations from leading Republicans and even some centrist and liberal commentators, set the stage for similar decisions by <a href="https://coloradonewsline.com/2023/12/28/trump-ineligible-maine-primary-ballot/" target="_blank">Maine’s secretary of state</a> later in December and an <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-is-disqualified-illinois-ballot-judge-rules-2024-02-29/" target="_blank">Illinois judge</a> last week.</p>
<p>Though all nine U.S. Supreme Court justices agreed on the outcome of the case, the opinions released Monday show a divide over how far the court should have gone to settle key issues relating to the enforcement of Section 3.</p>
<p>In his <a href="https://coloradonewsline.com/2024/01/03/trump-appeals-colorado-ruling-barring-him-from-ballot-to-u-s-supreme-court/" target="_blank">appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court</a>, Trump’s attorneys challenged the Colorado ruling on a variety of grounds. In addition to arguing that enforcement of Section 3 required an act of Congress, Trump’s team put forward a theory that Section 3’s reference to “officer(s) of the United States” did not include the presidency, and disputed claims that the Jan. 6 attack was an “insurrection” and Trump “engaged” in it.</p>
<p>Monday’s ruling is silent on the latter two questions. But five Republican-appointed justices — Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh — appear to back strict limitations on how the insurrection clause can be enforced. Citing a precedent known as Griffin’s case, an 1869 circuit court opinion authored by Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase, they wrote that it was “necessary” for Congress to enact enforcing legislation pursuant to Section 5 of the 14th Amendment, which states that “Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.”</p>
<p>“The Constitution empowers Congress to prescribe how those determinations should be made,” the ruling says, referring to the Enforcement Act of 1870 and Section 2383 of the U.S. Code, a statute prescribing a criminal penalty for “rebellion or insurrection,” as appropriate uses of the Section 5 power.</p>
<p>That interpretation appears to rule out the possibility that Section 3 could be enforced by federal courts or by Congress through other means, such as by refusing to seat insurrectionist members or declining to certify the election of an insurrectionist president. In a separate opinion, Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote that she did not join the other conservative justices in deciding that issue. And in a third opinion, the three Democratic-appointed members of the court — Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson — called the majority’s Section 5 findings “as inadequately supported as they are gratuitous.”</p>
<p>“Today, the majority goes beyond the necessities of this case to limit how Section 3 can bar an oathbreaking insurrectionist from becoming President,” the liberal justices wrote. “Although we agree that Colorado cannot enforce Section 3, we protest the majority’s effort to use this case to define the limits of federal enforcement of that provision.”</p>
<p>The Colorado ruling never took effect, because the justices stayed their order pending U.S. Supreme Court review, and Trump still appeared on GOP primary ballots, which were mailed to Colorado voters beginning Feb. 12. Monday’s U.S. Supreme Court ruling ensures that all votes cast by Colorado primary voters for Trump — the overwhelming favorite for his party’s nomination following the withdrawal of nearly all of his major rivals from the race — will be counted.</p>
<p>“I am disappointed in the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision stripping states of the authority to enforce Section 3 of the 14th Amendment for federal candidates,” Griswold <a href="https://twitter.com/JenaGriswold/status/1764670650592186392" target="_blank">wrote on X</a> following the ruling. “Colorado should be able to bar oath-breaking insurrections from our ballot.”</p>
<p>“In accordance with this decision, Donald Trump is an eligible candidate on Colorado’s 2024 Presidential Primary,” Griswold said.</p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce / For the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The right to vote is a cornerstone of our democracy. Unfortunately, recent actions taken by Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin and his administration have underscored the fragility of this fundamental right. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last fall, right before Election Day, news broke that over </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/01/voting-rights-advocates-blast-youngkin-admin-over-error-affecting-3400/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3,400 formerly disenfranchised voters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were erroneously removed from the voter rolls  – none were convicted of new crimes – due to changes in policy that were never widely discussed nor publicized, until it was too late. The process of getting your voting rights restored in Virginia remains obscure, generating confusion and discouraging participation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, more than ever, with the Super Tuesday primaries tomorrow and the general election approaching, it is imperative that voters – particularly those of us who have been convicted of felonies in Virginia – check our voter registration status to ensure our voices are heard in the upcoming elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a person whose right to vote was revoked based on a wrongful conviction, I know that voting is not a privilege; it is a fundamental aspect of citizenship that shapes the direction of our communities and our nation. As a young, single mother of three, who was burdened with the associated legal costs for something I did not do, I was forced to sit out multiple elections. Even though I never spent a night in jail nor prison, and was sentenced to five years on probation, I was banned from voting for over nine years due to my inability to pay my fines, fees and restitution. I could knock on doors and get others registered, but I could not use my voice to vote for the things my family needed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the Voting Rights Act of 1965 prohibits racial discrimination in voting, too often felony voting bans only deepen existing racial inequality. </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9930477/#:~:text=In%20the%20South%2C%20more%20than,vote%20due%20to%20felony%20convictions.&amp;text=But%20perhaps%20more%20shocking%2C%20is,were%20old%20enough%20to%20vote." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have shown that African Americans and other people of color are more likely to be disenfranchised due to felony convictions — a result of the systemic racism that plagues our criminal legal system. As a matter of fact, in Virginia, over 10 percent of Black voting age adults are</span><a href="https://www.sentencingproject.org/reports/locked-out-2022-estimates-of-people-denied-voting-rights/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> banned from voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I know how this feels firsthand, as I am one of several Black Virginians in my family who have had their rights taken away then restored.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, efforts to purge voter rolls must be scrutinized through a lens of racial equity, and every precaution must be taken to prevent the further marginalization of communities of color. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also important to consider that banning people who have been incarcerated from voting does nothing to advance public safety or prevent crime. There is nothing safe about people not participating in our political process; quite the opposite. Research consistently demonstrates that </span><a href="https://www.sentencingproject.org/app/uploads/2023/07/Increasing-Public-Safety-by-Restoring-Voting-Rights.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">restoring voting rights for people with felony convictions can improve community safety</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, by allowing returning citizens to remain engaged in their communities and the policies that shape their lives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For many Virginians with felony charges, the restoration of their voting rights symbolizes a second chance, a chance to reclaim their stake in society and contribute to the shaping of their communities. To strip them of this right, especially right before elections, is to deny them their full citizenship and undermine the very fabric of our democracy. In a time when the right to vote seems more fragile than ever, checking your voter registration status is a simple yet crucial action that every voter must take. It ensures that you are still registered to vote and that your voice can be heard on Election Day. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, checking your voter registration status is easier than ever before. Whether you have a felony or not, taking a few moments to verify your registration ensures that you are prepared to participate in upcoming elections. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, individuals can check their voter registration status online through the</span><a href="https://vote.elections.virginia.gov/VoterInformation/Lookup/status" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Department of Elections website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or by contacting their local registrar&#8217;s office. By taking this proactive step, you not only safeguard your own right to vote but also take a meaningful stand against attempts to disenfranchise vulnerable communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fight for voting rights is far from over, but together, we can ensure that every eligible citizen, including Virginians impacted by the criminal legal system, has the opportunity to participate in our democracy. You can check your voter registration status today, and help protect the integrity of our electoral system and the rights of all Virginians.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Together, we can ensure that democracy prevails in Virginia.</span></p>

<p>But he also will be remembered as a footnote in an unexpected chapter of state history in 2009 that effectively eliminated Virginia’s longstanding ban on the personal use of campaign funds, a situation the General Assembly is still struggling to rectify.</p>
<p>The story began when Ware faced a Democratic primary challenge in June 2009. His opponent, Martin Jeffrey, pointed to entries on Ware’s publicly available campaign finance reports that he said suggested Ware had spent campaign funds for his own personal use, in violation of state law.</p>
<p>Ware ignored accusations while cruising to a 2-to-1 primary victory. But Jeffrey’s complaint had found its way to the State Board of Elections, which unexpectedly decided to open an investigation. There was no precedent for such an inquiry. Officials in the board’s campaign finance section previously had said their enforcement powers extended no further than asking candidates to correct mathematical errors or supply missing information such as donor addresses or occupations.</p>
<p>The day after the primary, David Allen, who had recently been hired to head up the campaign finance section, wrote to Ware demanding the Democratic legislator produce receipts and other documentation related to the spending in question.</p>
<p>In a recent interview, James Alcorn, then the State Board of Elections’ policy director, said the case went forward under the theory that because the agency asks for documentation in other types of enforcement actions, it has the authority to ask candidates for expenditure receipts. “When the complaint did come in against Delegate Ware, we had a responsibility to look into it,&#8221; <a href="https://roanoke.com/archive/election-board-tightens-rules/article_5dbb6276-bc2a-5d7b-a8a0-04d997172b7d.html" target="_blank">Alcorn told The Roanoke Times in June 2009</a>.</p>
<p>The Ware case alarmed lawmakers of both parties, who worried that the agency could become a pawn in politically motivated complaints.</p>
<p>Ware agreed to amend several of his campaign finance reports to include a more detailed description of some expenses, but he denied spending money for personal use. The Roanoke Times reported that Ware turned to Allen’s predecessor, Chris Piper, to help respond to the request. Piper was working for a Washington, D.C., law firm with a campaign finance compliance practice.</p>
<p>The Board of Elections eventually closed the investigation into Ware’s campaign spending, but in the process called into question the applicability of <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title24.2/chapter9.3/section24.2-948.4/" target="_blank">language in the state code</a> that for decades had banned the personal use of campaign funds.</p>
<p>The meaning of the language leaves no doubt about the law’s intent: “It shall be unlawful for any person to convert any contributed moneys, securities, or like intangible personal property to his personal use or to the use of a member of the candidate&#8217;s ‘immediate family.’”</p>
<p>The agency turned to the state Office of the Attorney General for help. A lawyer there said the language was clear but discovered that its placement in the code had changed during a general reorganization of campaign finance laws approved by the General Assembly in 2006. Originally, the personal use language appeared in its own code section. But the reorganization placed it as a subsection of a law related to “final” campaign finance reports, which candidates submit when closing the account of a candidate’s fundraising committee.</p>
<p>The lawyer’s reading of the law, based on where the language appeared in the code, was that the prohibition against personal use applied only to the weeks or months before a candidate closed his account. In other words, at all other times personal use is not illegal in Virginia.</p>
<p>Based on that interpretation, the Board of Elections closed the Ware investigation without any further action in October 2009. Officials said because Ware’s spending in question had not taken place within the timeframe of a final report, the agency was “barred by law” from looking into the matter.</p>
<p>There has never been a request for a formal attorney general’s opinion confirming that interpretation, but the Board of Elections’ announcement led everyone in the political community to accept that Virginia effectively no longer prohibits personal use of campaign funds.</p>
<p>In the last 15 years, the General Assembly has been unable to put the genie back into the bottle. Legislation to reinstate a universal ban has foundered over how to define “personal use” without the potential for candidates facing complaints like the one an opponent lodged against Ware.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m happy I went through the process,” Ware told the Roanoke Times in October 2009, “but I cannot sit here and tell you that I believe there was ever a legitimate concern &#8230; about my campaign expenditures. All of it was contrived and made up.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By law, the governor’s party controls three of the board’s five seats. Requiring four votes for decisions on future elections commissioners, the bill’s proponents argued, would encourage the board to hire an apolitical administrator instead of leaving it to the governor to appoint someone with a more partisan background.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current system, said Del. Israel O’Quinn, R-Washington, leaves elections commissioners susceptible to political pressure from the governor who hired them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There&#8217;s no perfect way to get at this,” O’Quinn said Tuesday. “It&#8217;s been tried in many different ways, in many different times. I think this is a full faith effort to get there.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, reiterated his belief that the supermajority rule was a recipe for partisan gridlock that could incentivize the minority party to block the majority from making a decision. VanValkenburg said he respects O’Quinn’s efforts on the bill and agreed to work with those interested in the issue to come up with “a better way” for the 2025 session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But I can’t support this,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Danica Roem, D-Manassas, the lawmaker who gave O’Quinn extra time to try to salvage his bill, said she hopes that effort bears fruit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let’s see if we can get something on this,” Roem said. “I think the idea is good.&#8221;</span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday morning, a freshman Republican delegate voiced an unusually blunt opinion on why Virginia lawmakers are still finding it so difficult to pass a law stopping them from spending donors’ money on themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acknowledging he’s still “new here,” Del. Paul Milde, R-Stafford, said he sees no reason why the General Assembly couldn’t have figured the issue out over the last decade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The only rationale I can see for some of us resisting this after 10 years is because they want to have the flexibility to buy things that really aren&#8217;t campaign related,” Milde said during Friday’s meeting of the House Privileges and Elections Committee. “And I just can&#8217;t believe we can&#8217;t get it together on this.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Milde indicated he’s not hopeful this year’s going to be any different for legislation seeking to ban the personal use of campaign funds. But for now, the idea still has a flicker of life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, the House elections committee unanimously passed a <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB377" target="_blank">personal use bill</a> that had already cleared the Senate. However, instead of going to the House floor for a full vote, it’s going to the House Appropriations Committee, the same place a similar bill </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/13/in-virginias-democratic-legislature-campaign-finance-reform-bills-languish-without-votes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">died without a hearing earlier</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the session. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several other campaign finance reform bills aimed at capping contribution sizes and preventing donations from regulated utilities have already failed, leaving the Senate’s personal use bill as the last chance for reform supporters to get a significant piece of legislation passed this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, asked Friday for the bill to go straight to the House floor. But the elections panel instead sent it to the budget committee, a move that complicates its path to passage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview Friday, Boysko said she still hopes the bill can pass and is planning to tweak it to try to boost its chances in the House Appropriations Committee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have an amendment that I think we’ve worked out that I think will be something they will find amenable,” Boysko said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether that amendment gets heard depends on whether the committee dockets the bill as the 2024 session enters its final two weeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want people to trust us when we ask for money,” Boysko said. “It&#8217;s a commonsense transparency bill.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boysko’s pending amendment clarifies who would be qualified to file a complaint about alleged violations of the rule. It removes language that says complaints can only come from campaign donors or voters who would be represented by the candidate in question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s wide-open campaign finance system allows politicians to accept unlimited donations from special interests and wealthy donors and — unlike laws at the federal level and in other states — doesn’t prohibit candidates from spending that money to cover personal expenses that have no connection to their campaigns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Efforts to bring Virginia into alignment with the rest of the country have failed year after year as legislators have raised concerns that the proposal might backfire and open them to weaponized accusations of corruption where none exists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Friday’s hearing, House Minority Leader Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, echoed a longstanding concern from lawmakers that the line between official political use and personal use isn’t always as clear as outside observers might think. As a former speaker, Gilbert said people in leadership positions are expected to travel extensively to raise money and support other candidates’ campaigns. The precise wording of the bill, he suggested, shouldn’t be so strict that he or others would be penalized for using campaign funds to pay for parking or a hotel room while attending those types of events.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m not complaining. … I chose to do this,” said Gilbert, who voted for the bill. “But I want to make sure that I can use the natural funds that are available to support those bigger campaign activities.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, who chairs the House elections committee, reminded Gilbert that the bill allows lawmakers to seek guidance from state election officials on what would and wouldn’t count as a legitimate expense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you did something that you received guidance for, you are covered under it,” Price said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boysko’s bill spells out that campaign funds could not be used to pay for things like a home mortgage, clothing, cars, country club memberships, vacations, food, tuition payments and entertainment unrelated to a campaign. Mirroring federal law, it would allow elected officials to use campaign funds on “ordinary and necessary expenses incurred in connection with the duties of the individual as an office holder.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill allows campaign funds to be used for child care expenses tied to campaigning, a carveout meant to allow more working parents to run for office without upending their family finances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The State Board of Elections would be responsible for investigating alleged violations. If a violation were to be found, the candidate would have to repay any money spent on unlawful purposes and could be fined up to $10,000 depending on the severity of the violation. The board would also have the ability to declare complaints frivolous, a finding that could allow legal action against the person who complained for “abuse of process.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Friday’s hearing, Boysko invoked the recent example of former Republican congressman George Santos, who was expelled from the U.S. House of Representatives after being accused of improperly using campaign cash to pay for luxury goods, vacations, Botox treatments and purchases on OnlyFans, an online platform for explicit content.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He spent money on spa days. On vacations. On items from luxury retailers. And rent,” Boysko said. “What is so disturbing to me, in Virginia, the vast majority of his spending currently is legal.&#8221;</span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After passing the House of Delegates 99-0, legislation that would strip future Virginia governors of their power to handpick the state’s elections commissioner ran into trouble Tuesday in a Senate committee.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB742" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which has drawn bipartisan support in the House despite being sponsored by a Republican, is the latest of several attempts to reduce the role of partisan politics in the state’s election bureaucracy. Similar efforts have failed late in previous sessions, and the new complications in the Senate highlight the complexity of trying to get partisanship out of an election system that’s inherently political.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of the next governor being able to hire someone to lead the Virginia Department of Elections, the bill under consideration by the Democratic-controlled General Assembly would give that ability to the five-person State Board of Elections. By law, the governor’s party controls that board, but the pending legislation would require a supermajority vote (four of five members) in order to hire and fire elections commissioners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The supermajority rule seemed to cause the most angst for Democratic senators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Tuesday’s committee hearing, Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, asked whether it’s realistic to expect Democrats and Republicans to agree on who should run the elections department given the threats and intimidation directed at election officials from the right. If Democrats were to retake the governor’s mansion in 2025, the bill would require at least one Republican board member to vote with the Democratic majority in order to hire or fire an elections commissioner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why should we believe that the group that’s in the minority is going to step out?” VanValkenburg said. “If it’s a 4-1 vote to elect a commissioner, that one person in the world we’re living in now could face a lot of pressure politically and otherwise.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proponents of the bill have said the elections board, which includes ex-legislators from both parties, has worked in a mostly bipartisan manner and has a real chance of making a “consensus pick” on the next commissioner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t think it’s far-fetched to think that you could have a 5-0 vote,” said Del. Israel O’Quinn, R-Bristol, the bill’s sponsor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VanValkenburg then made a motion to kill the bill. But it was pulled back from the brink by Sen. Danica Roem, D-Manassas, who voted to keep the proposal alive and asked for it to be delayed for a week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview, Roem said she wanted to give O’Quinn more time to work out any issues on the Senate side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A bill like that that got out of the House 99-0, he’s clearly put in work for it. No question,” said Roem, who clarified she doesn’t have a yes or no position on the bill as it was presented Tuesday in the Senate Privileges and Elections Committee. “If everyone likes the idea, but they don’t like the words on the bill right now, let’s give it a little extra time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s current system of selecting an elections commissioner has often fueled complaints of politics seeping into the work of the supposedly nonpartisan elections department. As the leader of that department, the commissioner has a hand in ensuring voting laws are properly followed, maintaining accurate voter rolls, certifying voting equipment, verifying election results and overseeing the work of local election offices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Current Commissioner Susan Beals, a Republican hired by Gov. Glenn Youngkin, has testified in favor of the bill. The current five-member board, she told a House committee earlier this month, “works very well together to set policy and certify voting systems and election results.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe this group is most well-suited to pick the next elections commissioner of Virginia,” Beals said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lobbyist for the Virginia Registrars Association of Virginia, which represents city and county election officials across the state, also spoke in favor of the proposal, calling it “a good government bill.” The League of Women Voters of Virginia also supports the bill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Complaints about partisan influence in the elections department have run in both directions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, Democrats accused the Youngkin administration of playing politics by erroneously </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-10-27/virginia-reinstate-3400-voters-accidental-purge-youngkin-election" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">removing thousands of eligible voters from the rolls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-joins-republican-states-pulling-out-of-multi-state-voter-list-program/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ending Virginia’s participation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a multi-state voter roll maintenance program that had come under fire from right-wing “election integrity” activists. A local GOP official also </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2023/03/23/lawsuit-alleges-youngkin-pushed-dept-of-elections-to-change-a-southside-state-senate-nomination-process/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accused Youngkin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of pressuring the department to intervene in a dispute over how Republicans would pick their nominee in a competitive state Senate race.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2016, a Republican lawmaker </span><a href="https://www.dailypress.com/2016/10/13/gop-leader-fire-virginias-elections-chief/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">called on</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> former Gov. Terry McAuliffe to fire then-Elections Commissioner Edgardo Cortes over alleged partisan bias, and a </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/review-finds-virginia-elections-agency-had-culture-of-open-support-for-one-party-over-the/article_2878feb3-7855-5d2b-9123-97e76d43d315.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislative review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> two years later found the department had an “environment of open support for one party over the other” during the McAuliffe years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When former Gov. Ralph Northam succeeded McAuliffe in 2018, he replaced Cortes with Chris Piper, a former campaign finance compliance specialist who had held a variety of positions in state government. Though Piper drew bipartisan praise in the role, Youngkin announced in 2022 that he wouldn’t keep his job. Piper, who also </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/01/25/youngkin-says-he-intends-to-replace-virginias-top-election-official/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">publicly advocated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for less political influence over the commissioner position, was then replaced by Beals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill under consideration by the General Assembly, which would retain its ability to confirm or reject the commissioner’s hiring, would change the process that will greet the next governor who will take office in early 2026.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation would allow Beals to continue in the role until June 30, 2027, a timeline that would give the next governor time to fill three of the elections board’s five seats before the board would consider a new commissioner. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under state law, the governor appoints all members of the board, with three seats reserved for members of the governor’s own party and two seats going to the party that finished second in the most recent gubernatorial election. The supermajority rule would mean the governor’s party could not use its majority control to make unilateral hiring decisions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In addition to depoliticizing the process it gives the board quite a bit of incentive to get to a consensus pick with the 2027 legislative elections and the 2028 presidential elections both coming down the pike,” O’Quinn said as he presented the bill in the House.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Past efforts to give the two major parties equal seats on the board have failed, with skeptical lawmakers warning they would lead to tied votes that would cripple the board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under O’Quinn’s bill, if the board fails to make a bipartisan choice, the existing commissioner would be deemed reappointed subject to General Assembly confirmation. If the position became vacant, the commissioner’s duties would be handled by the department’s director of operations, who is not a political appointee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year’s bill originally failed in a House committee but was revived after O’Quinn amended it to clarify that the next commissioner decision would be made by a board shaped by whomever wins the 2025 gubernatorial election. Because board members serve staggered terms, Youngkin’s board appointees won’t immediately depart when he leaves office in early 2026.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Tuesday’s hearing, Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville, put the current elections commissioner on the spot by publicly asking her if she feels political pressure from Youngkin. When Beals deflected the question, Deeds asked again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right now I’m appointed by the governor,” Beals said. “He is my boss.”</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it gets </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/visuals/visual/the-cost-of-elections-over-time/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more and more expensive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to win a seat in the Virginia General Assembly, the state legislature continues to find new ways to stifle efforts to put limits on the state’s wide-open campaign finance laws.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, several bills meant to slow the flow of money into Virginia politics have been blocked without lawmakers taking a recorded vote showing that’s what they’re doing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the last decade, proposals have been introduced to create stricter campaign finance limits in Virginia and boost public confidence that the legislature can’t be bought by special interests writing checks of unlimited size. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Democrats have been vocal about making campaign finance reform a priority, and many have accepted big checks from Clean Virginia, a well-funded advocacy group focused on energy and campaign finance reform that says its mission is to “fight corruption in Virginia politics.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the party’s retaking of full control of the General Assembly this year doesn’t appear to be producing any breakthroughs on campaign finance issues as Tuesday’s crossover deadline approaches. As the two chambers rush to finish work on their own bills, no major campaign finance legislation has made it through both sides of the Capitol. If those positions hold in the second half of the session, none of the bills will win final passage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, Democratic-sponsored campaign finance proposals are languishing in Democratic-controlled committees, where several bills have been allowed to expire without a hearing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Del. Joshua Cole, D-Fredericksburg, presented </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB190" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would prohibit candidates from accepting campaign money from public utilities like Dominion Energy, the proposal died without a vote when no one on the 22-member House Privileges and Elections Committee made a motion for or against it. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB874" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sponsored by Del. David Bulova, D-Fairfax, that would have set caps on donations from both corporations and individuals was never docketed by the same committee.</span></p>
<p>In an interview, Cole said he&#8217;ll keep fighting for campaign finance reform, despite his latest bill failing in an unusual fashion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Time will tell what will happen,&#8221; Cole said. &#8220;The appetite is definitely there for it.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the Senate side, another utility-focused campaign finance reform </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB326" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sponsored by Sen. Danica Roem, D-Prince William, made it out of the chamber’s elections committee, but stalled when it was sent to the Finance and Appropriations Committee. It never got a hearing there, despite being projected to have no impact on the state budget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked why Roem’s bill wasn’t docketed, Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, criticized the bill itself instead of offering any procedural explanation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The people who are complaining about Dominion being a monopoly want to replace them,” Lucas said. “They want to be the monopoly. So what&#8217;s the difference?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clean Virginia’s critics have often accused the organization and its main funder, wealthy Charlottesville investor Michael Bills, of engaging in a new form of influence-peddling by offering substantial checks to lawmakers who vow to stop accepting money from Dominion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview, Roem didn’t sound disheartened over her bill’s fate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is the first time we’ve ever gotten out of committee. This still marks progress,” Roem said. &#8220;Clearly we have more steps to go.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nancy Morgan, a campaign finance reform advocate with BigMoneyOutVA, said Democratic leaders appear to be “strong-arming the members to kill the bills in untransparent ways.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not allowing bills to be voted on, or even heard by legislators, is anathema to our democratic process,” Morgan’s group said in a statement last week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A seemingly less controversial </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB377" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to prohibit spending campaign cash on personal uses unrelated to politics — something already banned at the federal level and in almost every other state — looked to be on track to pass this year after clearing the state Senate 35-4 and passing the House elections committee unanimously. But the </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB40" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House version</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was bottled up in the budget-writing committee after three state agencies estimated it would cost them more than $745,000 to add more staff to implement the law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the legislature’s own fiscal analysts sharply disagreed with that figure, saying the law would create virtually no new costs and wouldn’t substantially add to anyone’s existing workload.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It just seemed highly inflated,” said Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, who chairs the House elections committee and formally requested a second opinion on the steep cost estimate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+oth+HB40J110+PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">written analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> attached to the personal use bill, staffers at the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission said they concluded the proposal wouldn’t substantially burden state agencies after looking at similar laws in Georgia and Tennessee. Both states already have systems for investigating complaints and issuing advisory opinions similar to what the Virginia proposal envisioned, JLARC found, and the strain on staff is minimal because there are usually just a few cases to handle per year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“JLARC estimates the fiscal impact of the bill would be negligible,” the General Assembly’s analysts said in their rebuttal to the estimates from the Virginia Department of Elections and Virginia Department of Corrections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The JLARC statement didn’t address an additional $429,426 estimate from the office of Attorney General Jason Miyares, which claimed it would need two additional attorneys and a paralegal to help implement the law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite JLARC disputing the projected costs of the personal use bill, Del. Marcus Simon, D-Fairfax, said its chances of passage are now “slim to none” after failing to pass the House. The House can still take up the Senate version of the bill, but Simon said it’s unlikely to be a priority for the body late in the session as lawmakers try to finalize more big-ticket items.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite Simon’s less-than-optimistic prediction about the fate of efforts to ban the personal use of campaign money, Clean Virginia said it still hopes a “commonsense ban” can pass this year after clearing the Senate with an “overwhelming bipartisan majority.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Passage of this bill would represent a strong first step towards comprehensive campaign finance and ethics reform in Virginia,” said Clean Virginia Legislative Director Dan Holmes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">General Assembly members and statewide officeholders are prohibited from raising campaign funds during legislative sessions, but the latest effort to extend that ban to special sessions also appears to be on track to die without lawmakers attaching their names to a vote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bipartisan bill banning fundraising during “active” special sessions made it to the Senate floor. But in an unrecorded voice vote last week, the Senate chose to send the bill back to its elections committee, a maneuver that killed the bill because the panel was already done with its work on Senate bills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the floor, Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, said the bill “had a lot of issues.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s going to create more problems than it’s going to solve,” Surovell said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. David Suetterlein, R-Roanoke, the bill’s sponsor, objected to the move, saying his legislation appeared to be heading for the same death by unrecorded vote that often befalls bills to ban the personal use of campaign funds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Every year it found a different way to die on an unrecorded vote,” Suetterlein said.</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislation that would’ve let Virginia political parties exclude some voters from their primary elections was defeated Monday in a House of Delegates subcommittee that deals with election rules.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rejection of the </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB56" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican-sponsored bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — which would have required voters to register their party affiliation with the state starting next year — preserves Virginia’s open primary system, which gives eligible voters the freedom to participate in any government-run primary regardless of their political leanings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill would not have automatically blocked voters unaffiliated with a party from participating in that party’s primaries. Instead, it would have given the parties themselves the power to decide whether to exclude independents and voters affiliated with an opposing party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Monday’s committee hearing on the proposal, Del. Rozia Henson, D-Fairfax, asked what it would mean for voters who live in deep-blue or deep-red areas, where a lack of partisan competitiveness means nominating elections often decide who will represent that area in local, state or federal office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Tommy Wright, R-Franklin, the bill’s sponsor, said Democrats in a blue area could block Republicans from voting in their primary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And if they didn’t have a candidate, they wouldn’t vote at all,” Wright said, referring to Republicans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Bill Wiley, R-Winchester, who sponsored the same bill as Wright, told the subcommittee that general elections are the proper time for parties to try to appeal to crossover voters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The primaries are specific for the party,” Wiley said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Democratic-led subcommittee didn’t take a recorded vote on the bill, which failed for lack of a seconded motion to pass it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s lack of registration by party has occasionally given rise to complaints of partisan meddling by allowing Democratic-leaning voters to cast ballots in Republican primaries and vice versa. To avoid crossover votes in primaries, Republicans often choose to hold party-run conventions or firehouse primaries that give party organizers more leeway to ensure only Republican voters participate. When both parties have government-run primaries for the same office at the same time, voters have to choose between a Democratic and Republican ballot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rules for government-run primaries are taking on new importance due to a recently enacted law that makes it more difficult and potentially impossible for political parties to conduct their own conventions or firehouse primaries. By requiring parties to make absentee voting accommodations in party-run elections, the law is expected to force Republicans to hold more open primaries and drop their preference for conventions and other closed processes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/01/26/lynchburg-republicans-to-test-virginias-new-law-on-primaries/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reporting by Cardinal News</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Lynchburg Republicans are embarking on the first test of the new election law by attempting to hold a party-run nomination process in upcoming Lynchburg City Council races. That decision has drawn scrutiny from Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, who asked Attorney General Jason Miyares to ensure the Lynchburg GOP complies with the new law requiring the party to allow remote participation by overseas military personnel, college students who are away from home and would-be voters who can’t attend in person due to a disability or sickness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several people spoke in opposition to the bill at Monday’s meeting, saying injecting more partisanship into state politics would further erode an already fraying democratic system. Letting parties decide who can and can’t participate in a government-run primary, said Mary Crutchfield of the League of Women Voters of Virginia, is a “disturbing prospect in a democracy.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Open primaries invite independents, who are now a majority of all voters, to participate,” Crutchfield said. “Yes, spoiler voters might affect an outcome. But that is not common and affects both parties.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steve Richardson, a Falls Church resident affiliated with the centrist, election reform-focused Forward Party, said closed primaries would be a “giant step backward for voters.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Closing the primaries is unjust,” Richardson said. “It grants private organizations the power to exclude voters.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the rejected bill, voters who were already registered would have been classified as independent by default unless they changed their status to Democrat or Republican.</span></p>

My purpose is to illuminate the necessity for a reassessment of our state&#8217;s election timelines to guarantee the integrity and precision of our democratic procedures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the core of our electoral process lies a pivotal period known as &#8220;The Canvass.&#8221; This seven-day, post-election window requires careful examination as we navigate the intricacies associated with provisional and absentee ballots. While the resilience of our system was evident in the past two general elections, it is imperative that we prepare for the imminent challenges of a presidential cycle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the implementation of same day registration in 2022, Richmond alone has experienced an influx of over 4,000 provisional ballots, notably from our college student population. As custodians of democracy, each ballot – whether cast in advance or on Election Day – warrants thorough verification and scrutiny. However, our current seven-day timeframe poses a threat to the thoroughness of this critical process; here are some of the challenges:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Strict Timeline Constraints:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Section 24.2-671 mandates a narrow window for ascertaining results. This rigid framework does not account for the complexities of processing absentee results by precinct.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Comprehensive Reporting:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Accuracy remains our paramount concern. Detailed reporting demands meticulous attention, a luxury often denied within our current timeframe.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Resource and Logistical Constraints:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> From staffing limitations to technological challenges, our capacity to expedite results within the seven-day limit is increasingly strained.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Quality Assurance and Legal Compliance:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Hasty proceedings undermine our duty to uphold election integrity. Compliance with the Virginia code&#8217;s provisions, especially regarding the counting of postmarked absentee ballots, necessitates time and diligence.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>External Factors:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Unforeseen challenges like logistical hiccups, further constrict our ability to meet the seven-day deadline.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed legislation <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB1238" target="_blank">House Bill 1238</a> offers a reasonable resolution. By affording registrars and electoral board members an additional three days, we can ensure that each ballot receives the attention it deserves, without compromising our commitment to timely results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia&#8217;s electoral process stands as a beacon of democracy. Yet, its resilience hinges on our ability to adapt and address evolving challenges. By supporting House Bill 1238, you would champion a system that values both timeliness and accuracy, safeguarding the trust and confidence of our electorate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The invaluable insights of registrars across the commonwealth are worthy of consideration. Together, we can empower Virginia&#8217;s electoral system to navigate the complexities of modern elections, ensuring that every vote counts, every voice matters and our democracy endures.</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce for the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just a few weeks into the new year, it’s already election season again in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 45-day early voting period for Virginia’s March 5 presidential primaries begins today, even though it’s far from clear which candidates will still be in the running come Super Tuesday.  President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are the strong frontrunners, but they’re both facing competition in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the Republican side, Trump — who dominated this week’s Iowa caucuses — is on the ballot alongside Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and Texas pastor Ryan Binkley. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy will also appear on Virginia’s ballot, but both have already suspended their campaigns after acknowledging they were unlikely to win.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Democrats, Biden is facing Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips and activist Marianne Williamson.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia voters don’t register by party affiliation, but anyone voting in the presidential primaries will have to request either a Republican or a Democratic ballot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deadline to register and cast a regular ballot in the primaries is Feb. 12, but latecomers can register and cast provisional ballots after that date. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last day of in-person early voting is March 2.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia residents can use the state’s </span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/citizen-portal/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online portal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to check their status and register to vote.</span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Virginia Senate committee voted Tuesday to advance one bill strengthening the state’s so-called sore loser law but rejected another as lawmakers debated how to handle candidates who refuse to accept defeat in party primaries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In last year’s contentious General Assembly elections, candidates who ran in both Republican and Democratic primaries </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/09/27/2023-elections-bring-new-scrutiny-of-virginias-sore-loser-rule/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">threatened or announced write-in campaigns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> instead of backing a party rival who beat them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And in one unusual episode in a local contest, a candidate for the Roanoke County Board of Supervisors ran as a Republican for most of the 45-day early voting window only to drop out of the primary at the last second and file to run as an independent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the state’s current sore loser law, anyone who runs in a party primary can’t have their name printed on the general-election ballot. They can, however, encourage supporters to write in their name, even though write-in campaigns are almost never successful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Bryce Reeves, R-Spotsylvania, filed </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB167" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to extend the sore loser law to write-in campaigns, arguing losing candidates are using the write-in process to evade the rule.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All I’m trying to do is keep the sore losers out of the game,” Reeves said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats on the panel were wary of the idea, noting that even if a defeated candidate did nothing to invite a write-in campaign, the proposed law would go too far by completely eliminating voters’ ability to choose that candidate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That election would then be void under your law,” Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee rejected the proposal on an 8-6 party-line vote. But another Republican-sponsored </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB109" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on a similar topic got a friendlier reception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to the ballot switcheroo in Roanoke County, Sen. David Suetterlein, R-Roanoke, filed a bill clarifying how the sore loser law aligns with the 45-day early voting period lawmakers approved in 2020. That situation revealed that, technically, a candidate isn’t considered “defeated” in a primary if they formally withdraw before Election Day but weeks after early voting began.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suetterlein told the committee that legal revelation opened the door to underhanded political tactics, specifically mentioning talk he had heard about Republicans encouraging Democrats at risk of losing primaries to drop out and run as independents, potentially splitting the Democratic vote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That ended up not happening. But I think that this current interpretation really invites that to happen all the time,” Suetterlein said. “It was an issue for my community. I think it’s going to become an issue for a lot of our communities.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB109" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suetterlein’s bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which spells out that any failed candidate who appeared on a primary ballot cannot also appear on the general-election ballot, passed on a bipartisan 10-4 vote, with a few Democrats in opposition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Democratic-led committee barely entertained several other Republican bills to scale back early voting, repeal same-day voter registration and reinstate Virginia’s former photo ID requirement for voting. In a statement released after the meeting, the Senate Democratic Caucus said its members “vehemently oppose and will relentlessly combat all legislative attempts to undermine or restrict voting access.”</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce / For the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia conservatives have pointed to the prosecution of Prince William County’s former top election official for allegedly fudging 2020 vote counts as the strongest evidence available that fraud was a real concern in the last presidential contest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, after the case against former Registrar Michele White <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/01/03/michele-white-prince-william-charge-election-fraud/" target="_blank">was dropped</a>, the county’s elections office revealed that the tabulation errors actually worked in favor of former President Donald Trump.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In <a href="https://26d73768-aba6-4644-905b-6ea5efbfc5d6.filesusr.com/ugd/d8ec42_4838ad7c950247ae9cf010d85b4654c1.pdf" target="_blank">a statement</a>, the Prince William elections office said Trump received 2,327 more votes in the county than he should have, and President Joe Biden was “shorted” 1,648 votes. The swing of a few thousand votes did not affect the overall outcome of the race in Virginia, where Biden won by more than 450,000 votes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The reporting errors were presumably a consequence of the results tapes not being programmed to a format that was compatible with state reporting requirements,” read the statement from Prince William Director of Elections Eric Olsen. “Attempts to correct this issue appear to have created errors. The reporting errors did not consistently favor one party or candidate but were likely due to a lack of proper planning, a difficult election environment and human error.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The county said the mistakes in 2020 also led to an undercount of votes for both U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, a Democrat, and his Republican challenger, Daniel Gade. The discrepancy also wasn’t large enough to affect the outcome in that race, which Warner won comfortably.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Votes for U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Westmoreland, were also undercounted in Prince William, said Olsen, but not enough to affect the outcome of that election, which Wittman won.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Olsen said his office has made “improvements” to try to ensure the errors are not repeated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mistakes are unfortunate but require diligence and innovation to correct. They do not reflect a purposeful attempt to undermine the integrity of the electoral process and the investigation into this matter ended with that conclusion,” Olsen said. “We have worked to bring transparency to the reporting of an election that happened three years ago. … The public should have faith in the thousands of tireless public servants and volunteers who preserve and protect our democracy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Prince William prosecution was one of the highest-profile cases taken up by the election integrity unit created by Attorney General Jason Miyares. When that unit was <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/09/09/virginia-ag-announces-20-person-election-integrity-unit/" target="_blank">announced in 2022</a>, both Miyares and the Republican Party of Virginia pointed to Prince William to make the case for why an election integrity unit was necessary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the Prince William case was announced, the attorney general’s office repeatedly refused to go into detail about the basis for the charges against White, saying it could not comment on pending litigation.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We are pleased that the attorney general&#8217;s investigation into the 2020 election results encouraged the Prince William County Office of Elections to reform their processes and add transparency,  which will increase confidence and better serve Virginians,&#8221; Miyares spokeswoman Victoria LaCivita said Thursday evening.</p>

Circuit Court on his claim of presidential immunity from criminal prosecution. (Screenshot from C-SPAN)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Former President Donald Trump appeared in federal court Tuesday seeking immunity from charges that he schemed to overturn the 2020 presidential election results and knowingly fed lies to supporters who turned violent on Jan. 6, 2021.</p>
<p>Trump, who is leading polls in the 2024 Republican presidential primary field, watched while his attorney D. John Sauer was grilled by a panel of judges as he argued that the former president is shielded from criminal prosecution because he acted in an official capacity. Trump in a brief press conference later suggested a ruling against his immunity claim would spur “bedlam” from his supporters.</p>
<p>The former president arrived at the courtroom minutes before the proceedings with his team of lawyers and sat mostly expressionless, taking no notes, while Sauer answered questions from a three-judge all-female panel, according to reporters inside the courtroom. Dozens of other journalists watched a live feed from a media room for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in the E. Barrett Prettyman Courthouse.</p>
<p>Presiding Judges Karen LeCraft Henderson, Florence Y. Pan and J. Michelle Childs fired question after question to Sauer for roughly 40 minutes as he argued that Trump’s acts leading up to and on Jan. 6 were “official” and that his eventual acquittal by the U.S. Senate protects him from double jeopardy.</p>
<p>Trump was impeached by the U.S. House for inciting an insurrection on Jan. 6.</p>
<p>The decision by the appeals judges — Henderson, appointed under President George H. W. Bush, and the others recent President Joe Biden appointees — is likely to land in the U.S. Supreme Court, where a ruling could have significant implications for presidential liability.</p>
<p>Under questioning, Sauer told the appeals panel that “to authorize the prosecution of a president for his official acts would open a Pandora’s box (from) which this nation may never recover.”</p>
<p>The judges questioned whether a president’s actions while in office, no matter the legality, would be immune from criminal prosecution.</p>
<p>“You’re saying a president could sell pardons, could sell military secrets, could order SEAL Team Six to assassinate a political rival,” Pan said to Sauer.</p>
<p>Sauer conceded that selling military secrets “strikes me as something that might not be held to be an official act.”</p>
<p>Pan replied that Sauer’s concession undermines the Trump team’s argument that the government’s separation of powers guarantees the judiciary cannot hold the executive branch accountable.</p>
<p>“Given that you’re conceding that presidents can be criminally prosecuted under certain circumstances, doesn’t that narrow the issues before us to ‘Can a president be prosecuted without first being impeached and convicted?’” Pan said.</p>
<p>“Your separation of powers argument falls away, your policy arguments fall away if you concede that a president can be criminally prosecuted under some circumstances,” Pan said.</p>
<p>Henderson, questioning whether Trump’s actions can be defended as official acts, said, “I think it’s paradoxical to say that his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed allows him to violate (federal law).”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Government’s case</h4>

	
<p>Arguing for the U.S. Department of Justice, Assistant Special Counsel James Pearce described the potential for an “awfully scary” and “frightening” future if presidents could be completely immune from criminal prosecution.</p>
<p>Pearce rebuffed the notion that “floodgates” would open for cases against presidents.</p>
<p>“This investigation doesn’t reflect that we are going to see a sea change of vindictive tit for tat prosecutions in the future. I think it reflects the fundamentally unprecedented nature of the criminal charges here,” Pearce said.</p>
<p>Trump could be seen shaking his head in disagreement at the comment, according to reporters in the room.</p>
<p>“If as I understood my friend on the other side is to say here, a president orders his SEAL team to assassinate a political rival and resigns, for example, before an impeachment, (it’s) not a criminal act. I think that’s an extraordinarily frightening future,” Pearce said during his roughly 20 minutes of questioning.</p>
<p>In his five-minute rebuttal, Sauer said a United States in which a president is “very, very, very seldom prosecuted because they have to be impeached and convicted first is the one we’ve lived under for 235 years. That’s not a frightening future, that’s our republic.”</p>
<p>Sauer said the criminal charges against Trump are now creating “a situation where we have the prosecution of the political opponent who’s leading in every poll in the presidential election next year and is being prosecuted by the administration that he’s seeking to replace.”</p>
<p>The three-judge panel concluded oral arguments after an hour and 15 minutes and did not indicate when judges would release a decision.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump calls for immunity, warns of ‘bedlam‘</h4>

	
<p>In brief remarks following the hearing at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in Washington, which was a Trump-branded property until his business sold the lease in 2022, Trump said presidents should have legal immunity, proclaimed his innocence and hinted his supporters would create more unrest if he were prosecuted.</p>
<p>Biden was using federal prosecutions to damage his chief rival politically, Trump said.</p>
<p>“This is the way they’re going to try to win,” he said. “And that’s not the way it goes. There’ll be bedlam in the country. It’s a very bad thing, it’s a very bad precedent. As we’ve said, it’s the opening of a Pandora’s box. It’s a very sad thing that’s happened with this whole situation.</p>
<p>“When they talk about threat to democracy, that’s your real threat to democracy and I feel that as a president, you have to have immunity,” Trump added.</p>
<p>The remarks drew on a strategy <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-legal-problems-abound-first-test-2024-presidential-campaign-nears-iowa" target="_blank">the Trump campaign has employed</a> for months to use the former president’s myriad legal troubles to boost his electoral standing by framing him as a victim of political persecution.</p>
<p>Trump suggested that he was being prosecuted for official acts related to curbing voter fraud and repeated debunked claims that the 2020 election was decided by fraudulent votes.</p>
<p>“I did nothing wrong, absolutely nothing wrong,” he added. “I’m working for the country.”</p>
<p>Trump spoke for just more than seven minutes and did not take questions.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump indictment</h4>

	
<p>U.S. District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan in December <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.258148/gov.uscourts.dcd.258148.171.0_1.pdf" target="_blank">denied</a> Trump’s motion to dismiss his case based on presidential immunity.</p>
<p>U.S. Special Counsel Jack Smith asked the Supreme Court to immediately take the case, bypassing the appeals level, but the justices <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-wont-yet-rule-presidential-immunity-question-trump-case" target="_blank">declined</a>.</p>
<p>A federal grand jury <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/fueled-lies-trump-charged-seeking-overturn-2020-election-6" target="_blank">indicted</a> Trump in August for interfering in election results following the November 2020 presidential contest.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.258149/gov.uscourts.dcd.258149.1.0_2.pdf" target="_blank">indictment</a> accuses Trump of conspiring with attorneys, a U.S. Department of Justice official and a political consultant, all unnamed, to organize fake electors for Trump from seven key states that Biden in fact won. Those states included Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p>
<p>The indictment also outlined Trump’s pressure campaign on former Vice President Mike Pence to reject electors from those states during his ceremonial role of certifying the election results on Jan. 6, 2021.</p>
<p>Leading up to that date, the indictment recounts, Trump knowingly fed a stream of lies to his supporters that he won the election, igniting a rally during which he spoke on Jan. 6, 2021 and culminating in a violent attack on the U.S. Capitol. The official four charges against Trump include conspiracy to defraud the United States; conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding; obstruction of, and attempt to obstruct, an official proceeding; and conspiracy against rights.</p>

Congress held a joint session today to ratify President-elect Joe Biden's 306-232 Electoral College win over President Donald Trump. A group of Republican senators said they would reject the Electoral College votes of several states unless Congress appointed a commission to audit the election results.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Trump_opinion.pdf" target="_blank">an opinion</a> issued Dec. 29, U.S. District Judge Leonie M. Brinkema ruled that the pair of activists who filed the suit lacked legal standing to challenge Trump’s eligibility for office because they “totally failed” to show that Trump’s presence on Virginia’s ballot would cause them specific harm. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Although this increasingly litigated legal question of whether former President Trump may be disqualified from running for or serving in public office raises issues of the utmost importance in our democratic system of self-governance, the Court cannot reach the merits of plaintiff’s claims because it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction,” Brinkema wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ruling indicates there won’t be any late-breaking developments regarding Trump’s eligibility as a primary candidate in Virginia, where early voting for the state’s March 5 presidential primaries is set to begin Jan.19. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As legal battles continue to play out elsewhere, the question of whether Trump’s role in the events leading up to the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol qualifies as an act of insurrection — which would bar him from holding office — could ultimately be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Virginia challenge, the judge drew a distinction between the case before her and recent headline-grabbing decisions by authorities in Colorado and Maine to disqualify Trump from primary ballots on similar grounds. The Colorado Supreme Court and Maine’s secretary of state issued the rulings based on their own states’ election laws, Brinkema wrote, not in response to claims brought in federal court.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Federal courts across the country have consistently held that individual citizens do not have … standing to challenge whether another citizen is qualified to hold public office,” Brinkema ruled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the suit also named state elections officials as defendants, attorneys in the office of Attorney General Jason Miyares had asked the court to dismiss the case on largely technical grounds. State attorneys said the legal challenge was based on a misunderstanding of how Virginia primaries work, noting that state election officials “do not actively police the eligibility of presidential candidates” in primaries run by the state but overseen by political parties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Republican Party of Virginia also sought to intervene, arguing that if allowed to proceed, the lawsuit would threaten GOP voters’ rights to pick their own nominees for office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the opinion dismissing the case, Brinkema also chided the plaintiffs, Hampton Roads-area voters Roy L. Perry-Bey and Carlos A. Howard, for a variety of procedural irregularities as they attempted to represent themselves before the court, such as failing to include full contact information and claiming health concerns were preventing them from responding to new filings in a timely manner.</span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Tammy Brankley Mulchi and Democrat Tina Wyatt Younger will face off in a special election this January to represent state Senate District 9 in Southside Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters elected long-time Sen. Frank Ruff this November to represent the district, which encompasses Pittsylvania, Halifax, Charlotte, Lunenburg, Mecklenburg and Nottoway counties, the southern part of Prince Edward County and the city of Danville. Ahead of being sworn in to his next term, however, Ruff announced that he would not take office due to a cancer diagnosis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who on Wednesday asked the General Assembly during his budget presentation to rename the commonwealth’s Center for Rural Virginia in Ruff’s honor, has set the special election for Jan. 9, the day before the General Assembly reconvenes for the 2024 session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a Dec. 20 deadline for candidates to file with the state Department of Elections to run in that race, both Republicans and Democrats held nominating contests Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans held a six-hour mass meeting in Drakes Branch in Charlotte County Tuesday night, selecting Mulchi, who had been endorsed by Ruff, after four rounds of voting. Six people ran for the nomination. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A member of the Clarksville Town Council and realtor, Mulchi previously served as a legislative aide to Ruff and Del. Tommy Wright, R-Lunenburg. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Southside Virginia faces challenges unlike other regions of Virginia. The people of the region need a senator who shares their conservative values, understands the challenges facing their region, and knows how to meet those challenges by increasing opportunities,” said Senate Minority Leader Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover, in a statement. “Tammy Mulchi will be that senator, and she has the full support of her future colleagues in the Senate Republican Caucus.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats elected Younger, a former vice mayor of South Boston and chair of the Halifax Democrats, in a firehouse primary. With 89 votes, she narrowly edged out the next closest candidate, Danville vice mayor Gary Miller, who received 82 votes. Four candidates ran in the party’s firehouse primary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Democratic Caucus Chair Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, said in a statement that “Tina’s wealth of experience will greatly be an invaluable asset to our caucus.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Given their background, I’m confident they will be yet another durable brick in our blue wall as we continue to ensure economic security, enhancing the quality of public education, and ensuring a bright future for every Virginian,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate District 9 is considered a strongly Republican district, with 65% of voters casting ballots for Republicans in elections in 2021 and 2022. </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As many as 10 candidates will vie for party nominations for a Southside Virginia state Senate seat on Tuesday, Dec. 19. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Sen. Frank Ruff, a 30-year veteran of the General Assembly, was elected this November to represent the new Senate District 9, encompassing Pittsylvania, Halifax, Charlotte, Lunenburg, Mecklenburg and Nottoway counties, the southern portion of Prince Edward County and the city of Danville. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, however, Ruff announced he will not take office for the 2024-28 term after a cancer diagnosis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Entering into an aggressive and ongoing treatment regimen, I have concluded I may not be able to devote 100% of my focus to doing the work needed in the General Assembly,” said Ruff in a statement. “Consequently, I believe now is the right time to retire.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the legislative session set to begin Jan. 10, Gov. Glenn Youngkin </span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/media/castyourballot/Writ-for-Special-Election---SD-9.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has called a special election</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to fill the seat on Jan. 9, 2024. Because candidates must file with the Virginia Department of Elections by Dec. 20 in order to appear on the ballot, both Democrats and Republicans in the district are holding their nominating contests one day earlier, on Dec. 19. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Public Access Project </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/offices/state-senate-9/district/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ranks the district strongly Republican</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the 2022 congressional races, roughly 65% of voters cast their ballots for a Republican. The same percentage also voted for Youngkin over former Gov. Terry McAuliffe in the 2021 gubernatorial election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, parties are allowed to choose their nominating method for candidates. Republicans have chosen to hold a mass meeting at Drakes Branch Fire Department at 4801 Main St., Drakes Branch, at 6:30 p.m. Tuesday, with registration beginning at 5 p.m. In this approach, all voters must be present at the meeting location during balloting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re expecting up to four rounds of voting,” said Will Pace, chair of the 9th Senate District Republican Committee and the Pittsylvania County Republicans. “This is not a drive-by vote and leave thing. This is something where you need to commit your entire night. We’re expecting it to be a long night.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If rules for the meeting are approved as anticipated, candidates with fewer votes will be progressively eliminated as the night goes on. Voters must bring photo identification, be in line by 6:30 to participate and sign a statement saying they will support the Republican candidate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pace said he was anticipating a turnout of up to 500 people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Six Republicans are in the running for Ruff’s seat. They include retiring Del. Jim Edmunds, Halifax pastor and business owner Andy Ferguson, legislative aide Kade Gravitt, Clarksville Town Council member Tammy Brankley Mulchi, Virginia Board of Education member Dale Sturdifen and Danville City Councilman Lee Vogler. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Dems-SD9.png" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-37291" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Dems-SD9-298x300.png" alt="" width="298" height="300" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Dems-SD9-298x300.png 298w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Dems-SD9-150x150.png 150w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Dems-SD9-768x774.png 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Dems-SD9.png 837w" sizes="(max-width: 298px) 100vw, 298px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ruff has endorsed Mulchi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats, in turn, have chosen to nominate their candidate through the unassembled caucus process, also known as a firehouse primary. This method allows voters to cast a ballot during the specified time window but doesn’t require them to stay for the entire balloting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patricia Harper-Tunley, a member of the Senate District 9 Democratic Nominating Committee and chair of the Lunenburg County Democratic Committee, said four people “have shown interest” in the seat but that names won’t be released until after the caucus filing deadline of noon Tuesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters will be able to cast their ballots at any of seven locations in the district between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m. Tuesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s the time frame that we have,” said Harper Tunley. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To date, only one candidate has publicly announced they are seeking the seat. Trudy Berry, an Air Force veteran from Lunenburg, ran a write-in campaign against Ruff this fall after a local Democratic party official </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/08/15/virginia-elections-board-declines-to-help-democrat-bounced-from-ballot-over-partys-typo/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accidentally mistyped an email address</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when attempting to file her paperwork to run, leading to Berry being disqualified. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Berry, however, said that over the weekend, state Sen. Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, who will become Senate Majority Leader when the 2024 legislative session begins, called her and asked her to withdraw her candidacy in favor of Danville Vice Mayor Gary Miller.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I told him I was appalled that he even had the gall to ask me to step down,” said Berry, who called the request “a bad look on the party.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surovell was traveling Monday and did not immediately provide a comment on Berry’s account of the conversation.</span></p>
<p><em>This story has been updated to clarify that four people had shown interest in the Democratic seat as of Monday afternoon.  </em></p>

This is the first of three planned debates between the two candidates in the lead up to the election on November 3. (Photo by Morry Gash-Pool/Getty Images)</p><p>When former President Bill Clinton showed up at the White House in early 2023, he was there to join President Joe Biden to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-live-biden-and-bill-clinton-speak-on-30th-anniversary-of-family-and-medical-leave-act" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Family and Medical Leave Act</a>. It was hard to avoid the fact that it had been three decades since Clinton was in office – yet at 77, he’s somehow three years younger than Biden.</p>
<p>Biden, now 80 years old, is the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/20/politics/joe-biden-80th-birthday/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first octogenarian to occupy the Oval Office</a> – and his main rival, former President Donald Trump, is 77. A Monmouth University poll taken in October 2023 showed that roughly three-quarters of voters think Biden is <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4233885-more-in-new-poll-likely-to-see-biden-as-too-old-than-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">too old for office</a>, and nearly half of voters think Trump is too old to serve.</p>
<p>My former boss, President George H.W. Bush, happily chose not to challenge Clinton again in the 1996 election. If he had run and won, he would have been 72 at the 1997 inauguration. Instead, he <a href="https://millercenter.org/president/bush/life-after-the-presidency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enjoyed a great second act</a> filled with humanitarian causes, skydiving and grandchildren. Bush’s post-presidential life, and <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/506330/americans-outlook-retirement-worsened.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American ideals of retirement</a> in general, raise the question of why these two men, Biden and Trump – who are more than a decade and a half beyond the <a href="https://www.fool.com/research/average-retirement-age/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">average American retirement age</a> – are stepping forward again for <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/05/a-broken-office/556883/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the hardest jobs in the world</a>.</p>
<h4 class="editorialSubhed">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A trend toward older people</h4>

	</h4>
<p>Trump and Biden are two of the three oldest men to ever serve as president. For 140 years, William Henry Harrison held the <a href="https://thehill.com/changing-america/enrichment/arts-culture/3744771-here-are-the-oldest-us-presidents-to-ever-hold-office/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">record</a> as the oldest person ever elected president, until Ronald Reagan came along. Harrison was a relatively spry 68 when he took office in 1841, and Reagan was 69 at his first inauguration in 1981.</p>
<p>When Reagan left office at age 77, he was the oldest person ever to have served as president. Trump left office at age 74, making him the third-oldest to hold the office, behind Reagan and Biden.</p>
<p>According to the Census Bureau, the <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2023/population-estimates-characteristics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">median age in America</a> is 38.9 years old. But with the <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47470" target="_blank" rel="noopener">average ages in the House and Senate</a> at 58 and 64, respectively, a word often used to describe the nation’s governing class is “gerontocracy.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/what-is-a-gerontocracy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Teen Vogue</a>, which recently published a story explaining the word to younger voters, defines the term as “government by the elderly.” Gerontocracies are more common among religious leadership such as <a href="https://www.ncronline.org/blogs/francis-chronicles/no-church-old-men-cardinals-called-be-grandfathers-pope-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Vatican</a> or <a href="https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1313938/irans-fossilized-gerontocracy-faces-the-youth-in-the-street.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the ayatollahs</a> in Iran. They were also common in communist ruling committees such as the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/soviet-gerontocracy-collapse-cautionary-tale-united-states-2022-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Soviet Politburo</a> during the Cold War. In democracies, elderly leaders are less common.</p>
<h4 class="editorialSubhed">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Beyond the White House</h4>

	</h4>
<p>Biden and Trump aren’t the only aging leaders in the U.S. It’s a bipartisan trend: Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, is 72, and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, is 81. Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley was just reelected and has turned 90, with no plans to retire. Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders is 81 and hasn’t mentioned retirement at all.</p>
<p>In the House, California Democrat and former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, at age 83, just announced she’s running for reelection for her <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-house-speaker-pelosi-seek-re-election-reversing-earlier-plan-2022-01-25/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">19th full term in office</a>. Bill Pascrell Jr., a New Jersey Democrat, and Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Democrat who serves as the nonvoting delegate from Washington, D.C., are both 86. Kentucky Republican Harold Rogers and California Democrat Maxine Waters are both 85. Maryland Democrat Steny Hoyer is 84. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/08/us/politics/oldest-members-of-congress.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">list goes on</a>, and none of these politicians has indicated they’re retiring.</p>
<p>A local pharmacist on Capitol Hill made headlines a few years ago when he revealed that he was <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/11/16458142/congress-alzheimers-pharmacist" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filling Alzheimer’s medication prescriptions</a> for members of Congress. Every one of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/08/us/politics/oldest-members-of-congress.html%22%22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20 oldest members of Congress</a> is at least 80, and this is the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/118th-congress-age-third-oldest-1789-rcna64117" target="_blank" rel="noopener">third-oldest House and Senate since 1789</a>.</p>
<h4 class="editorialSubhed">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Delayed retirement</h4>

	</h4>
<p>What’s going on here?</p>
<p>Most baby boomers who delay retirement do so because they <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/032216/are-we-baby-boomer-retirement-crisis.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can’t afford</a> to stop working, due to inflation or lack of savings. But all of these political leaders have plenty of money in the bank – <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2020/04/majority-of-lawmakers-millionaires/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many are millionaires</a>. If they retired, they would enjoy <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/RL/RL30631" target="_blank" rel="noopener">government pensions</a> and <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/RL/RL30064" target="_blank" rel="noopener">health care benefits</a> in addition to Medicare. So for them, it’s not likely financial.</p>
<p>One theory is that it’s denial. No one likes to be reminded of their own mortality. I know people who equate retirement with death, often because of others they know who have passed away just after stepping down — which may explain why both <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/senator-dianne-feinstein-death/h_ad846d97416acf1e8bbaf2373d6205ab" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sen. Dianne Feinstein</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/ruth-bader-ginsburg-dies/2020/09/18/3cedc314-fa08-11ea-a275-1a2c2d36e1f1_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</a> stayed so long on the job, dying while still in office at age 90 and 87, respectively.</p>
<p>For others, it’s identity-driven. Many of the senior leaders I’ve seen have worked so hard for so long that their entire identity is tied to their jobs. Plus, years of hard work means they don’t have hobbies to enjoy in their remaining years.</p>
<p>Another theory is ego. Some lawmakers think they’re indispensable – that they’re the only ones who can possibly do the job. They’re not exactly humble.</p>
<p>In the political world, their interest is often about power as well. These are the types who think: Why wouldn’t I want to keep casting deciding votes in a closely divided House or Senate, or keep giving speeches and flying around on Air Force One as president, or telling myself I’m saving democracy?</p>
<p>It’s easy to see why so few of them want to walk away.</p>
<h4 class="editorialSubhed">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Age limits?</h4>

	</h4>
<p>There have been calls to impose age limits for federal elected office. After all, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/jmd/page/file/1446196/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">federal law enforcement officers</a> have mandatory retirement at 57. So do <a href="https://www.nps.gov/aboutus/become-a-law-enforcement-ranger.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">national park rangers</a>. Yet the most stressful job in the world has no upper age limit.</p>
<p>For those who think mandatory retirement is ageist and arbitrary, there are other options: Republican candidate Nikki Haley has called for <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/3859468-haley-calls-for-mental-competency-tests-for-politicians-over-75/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compulsory mental competency tests</a> for elected leaders who are 75 and older, though she has said <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/time-competency-test-politicians-heres-why" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passing wouldn’t be a required qualification for office</a>, and failing wouldn’t be cause for removal. A September 2023 poll shows <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4192393-mental-competency-tests-for-politicians-over-75-see-overwhelming-support-in-new-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">huge majorities of Americans support competency testing</a>. That way, the public would know who was sharp and who was not. Sounds like a fine idea to me.</p>
<p>So does having the generosity to step aside and think of others. And having the wisdom to realize that life is short and about more than just going to work. And having the grace to do what John F. Kennedy, the nation’s second-youngest president, once said: to <a href="https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/president-john-f-kennedys-inaugural-address" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pass the torch to a new generation of Americans</a>.</p>
<p>My colleague professor Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/19/us-congress-presidency-gerontocracy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">puts it well</a>: “I’m 70, so I have great sympathy for these people: 80 is looking a lot younger than it used to, as far as I’m concerned. But no, it’s ridiculous. We’ve got to get back to electing people in their 50s and early 60s.” And the <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4233885-more-in-new-poll-likely-to-see-biden-as-too-old-than-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling shows</a> that most Americans would say, “Amen, brother.”</p>

I am honored to lead this office again as Commonwealth’s Attorney-Elect for Loudoun County.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Buta Biberaj has lost her bid for reelection as Loudoun County commonwealth’s attorney to Republican former prosecutor Bob Anderson by 300 votes, according to data from the Loudoun elections office. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final tally provided by the elections office has Anderson receiving 68,068 votes and Biberaj earning 67,768. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biberaj has not decided whether she will request a recount, according to her campaign. </span></p>
<p>“This is the closest commonwealth’s attorney’s race in Loudoun history,” said Shannon Sankey, Biberaj’s campaign manager, in a statement. “Following the canvass process, Buta trails by just 300 votes out of more than 136,000 votes cast. This 0.22% deficit puts our campaign well within the margin for a recount in Virginia. Our campaign is reviewing the results and we expect to make a decision shortly on our next steps. Buta remains committed to protecting democratic rights and ensuring that every Loudoun resident’s vote is counted.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, with counting ongoing, Biberaj faced a deficit of about 1,000 votes, a lead she ultimately was able to shrink to just 300.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biberaj faced criticism from both parties during her first term as commonwealth’s attorney in Loudoun County, particularly for her decision to </span><a href="https://wjla.com/news/local/loudoun-county-commonwealths-attorney-buta-biberaj-list-crimes-including-hit-run-will-no-longer-be-prosecuted-misdemeanor-virginia-youngkin-democrat-republican-nova-speeding-reckless-fairfax" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">divert low-level misdemeanors and nonviolent charges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to police for prosecution rather than involving the commonwealth’s attorney’s office. While she defended the move as necessary to allow the office to focus on violent crimes, critics accused her of allowing crimes to go unpunished. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other criticism centered on her competence and prosecutorial decisions, including trying a disorderly conduct case involving Scott Smith, the parent of a Loudoun high school student who was sexually assaulted in what became a high-profile case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While other progressive prosecutors in Northern Virginia and Norfolk have faced similar criticisms of being soft on crime, Biberaj is the only one to lose her election this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the days following the Nov. 7 election, Anderson referred to himself in social media posts as the commonwealth’s attorney-elect and pledged to bring “transparency back to the Commonwealth’s Attorney’s Office” and do “what is necessary to restore the community’s trust.”</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever notice that neither party tends to stay in power very long in Virginia? It’s become our natural condition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cable TV politicos tend to get all breathless from time to time and dye Virginia cardinal red or cobalt blue, depending on which way the pendulum swings from one election cycle to the next. The truth is we’re a deep purple Goldilocks state — preferring our politics not too left, not too right — and have been for more than 50 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s one of several distinctions that sets Virginia apart from its sister states in the South.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the latter 19th century through the 1960s, one-party rule was the order of the day. Virginia was a thoroughly Democratic state — wall-to-wall, from every courthouse and city hall to Capitol Square. Being Democratic then was the polar opposite of being Democratic today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was a Democratic Party with roots in the antebellum South. It had defended slavery and pushed the nation toward the Civil War. In the 100 years after Appomattox, Dixie Democrats resisted Reconstruction and embraced Jim Crow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the early 1920s in Virginia, it took form as the political machine founded by and named for Gov. Harry Flood Byrd. The racist excesses of that time stagger the conscience. Poll taxes. Voter literacy tests. Dr. Walter Plecker’s discredited</span><a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/plecker-walter-ashby-1861-1947/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">eugenics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that informed Hitler’s genocide against Europe’s Jews and his futile quest for a “master race” of Aryan </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">übermenschen</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And there was </span><a href="https://virginiahistory.org/learn/civil-rights-movement-virginia/massive-resistance" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Massive Resistance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Virginia’s orchestrated defiance to the Supreme Court’s 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision that outlawed racially segregated public education in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the Kennedy presidency, the Democratic Party began its leftward arc and its hold on Virginia (and the South) began to slip. The cynical Republican “</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/a-grand-bargain-that-secured-the-south-for-the-gop/2019/08/16/64166948-976a-11e9-830a-21b9b36b64ad_story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Southern strategy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” first attempted by Barry Goldwater’s 1964 presidential campaign and perfected four years later by Richard Nixon, shifted the South, including Virginia, from a Democratic stronghold to reliably Republican in 1968. The commonwealth voted Republican in 10 consecutive presidential elections, ending with Barack Obama’s 2008 victory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1969, Linwood Holton, a social progressive who at last broke the back of segregation in Virginia, became its first elected Republican governor. Since then, partisan control of the governor’s office has changed hands half a dozen times, but neither party has held it for more than three consecutive terms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The General Assembly gradually transitioned from Democratic dominance through the 1980s to an even split and power sharing during the mid- to late ’90s before the GOP achieved hegemony in 1999, adding majorities in both legislative chambers to complement Gov. Jim Gilmore’s governorship. It was an enormous milestone for legislative Republicans, who once could have caucused in a broom closet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It took the Democrats 20 years to climb back to total control of the legislative and executive branches of state government in the 2019 election – and just two years to lose it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During that Democratic biennium, numerous liberal reforms became law.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the 2021 election, a Virginia electorate – shaken by the COVID-19 pandemic, tiring of new President Joe Biden and sensing that Democrats in Richmond had gone too far too fast – handed the House majority back to the GOP and elected Republicans to the top three statewide offices, including Gov. Glenn Youngkin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the course of this year, Youngkin made a determined effort to win full legislative control and open the spillway for a flood of conservative priorities the hungry Republican base had wanted for more than 10 years. That included tightening the window for having abortions from 26 weeks of pregnancy to 15 with exceptions for victims of rape and incest and to protect the mother’s life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evidently, too far too fast. Again. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s the hazard of one-party control now, as moderates in both parties exit – either through retirement or primary losses to challengers farther from the political center – and legislators forsake compromise to push more ideologically-driven agendas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuesday’s election was a thunderous rebuke to Republicans nationally after a conservative Supreme Court in June 2022 struck down the Roe v. Wade decision that had kept abortions legal since 1973. The court effectively pushed abortion policy back to the nation’s 50 statehouses, and this week’s results left no doubt about voters’ enmity toward the ruling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ohioans overwhelmingly approved a referendum guaranteeing abortion rights in state law. In Kentucky, a Democratic governor who had pushed back against the state’s strict abortion laws was easily reelected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of its divided government, Virginia is the only Southern state that hasn’t imposed stringent limits on abortions, some of them amounting to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">de facto</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bans. Youngkin and his party saw the opportunity to follow suit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin had masterfully disarmed moderate to Democratic-leaning suburbanites in winning the governor’s race two years earlier. He leveraged pandemic disruptions to public education and marginalized roles of parents in their children’s schools as resonant kitchen table issues in a campaign that showed Republicans how to overcome former President Donald Trump’s toxic legacy and blaze a new path to victory in a state Democrats had owned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He believed he had struck gold again with his 15-week abortion proposal, something he saw as a compromise that could counter Democrats’ attacks on the visceral reproductive rights argument. Even more, he hoped, the strategy could allow Republican legislative candidates to turn the tables and position Democrats as extremists for supporting longer intervals for legal abortions. Youngkin’s PAC, Spirit of Virginia, crushed gubernatorial fundraising records and poured more than</span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/donors/374333-spirit-of-virginia/?start_year=2022&amp;end_year=2023&amp;recip_type=all" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$15 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> behind GOP candidates by October’s end, including a late $1.4 million ad blitz touting his abortion plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have to bet big to win big. Or lose big. And Youngkin lost. Big.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the precincts reported and the numbers were crunched, not only did the Senate remain in Democratic hands, Republicans had also lost control of the House — after just two years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So for at least the next few years, a diminished Youngkin will </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">pro</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">pose and the Democratic legislature will </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">dis</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">pose. Each will frustrate and obstruct the other. The adversarial process will assure a Goldilocks outcome, preventing passage of anything too left or too right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, as Virginians made clear on Tuesday, we’re OK with that.</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce for the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two-year period before the arrival of Gov. Glenn Youngkin was the first time in decades that Democrats controlled both chambers of the Virginia General Assembly. Come January, they’ll be back in charge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That sets up a policymaking dynamic that hasn’t been seen in Virginia since the 1990s: A Republican governor working with a fully Democratic legislature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because Youngkin will still be able to veto anything the slim Democratic majorities send to his desk, it won’t be anything like the burst of legislative breakthroughs on big topics that Democrats pushed through in 2020 and 2021. With a 21-19 majority in the state Senate and a 51-49 majority in the House of Delegates, Democrats lack the supermajorities needed to override vetoes and enact new laws over Youngkin’s opposition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a redistricting-fueled retirement boom earlier this year, more than a third of the candidates elected to General Assembly seats last week will be new to the body, adding a new element of unpredictability to how votes might shake out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s unclear what might top the state’s legislative agenda once the new legislature is seated, but here’s a look at what last Tuesday’s results could mean for a few big policy issues.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A new push for abortion rights</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn’t a sure bet Republicans would have had the votes to pass Youngkin’s 15-week abortion ban even if they won majorities. But new limits on abortion are now a nonstarter after Democrats won on promises to stop them.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="30pxRsPU12"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/08/virginia-democrats-triumph-in-statehouse-elections-reducing-youngkins-power/">Virginia Democrats triumph in statehouse elections, reducing Youngkin&#8217;s power</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Winning both chambers gives Democrats the chance to play offense on abortion rights, and they don’t need the governor to do it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a post-election news conference last week, abortion rights advocates said they want the new Democratic majorities to begin the multi-year process of amending Virginia’s constitution to protect abortion access.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our victory on Tuesday allows us to work with these majorities to advance a constitutional amendment that will be on Virginia’s ballot in 2026 when we keep an abortion-rights majority in 2025,” said Jamie Lockhart, executive director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Virginia’s system, constitutional amendments have to pass the General Assembly two years in a row, with an election in between. That means the General Assembly would have to pass an abortion rights amendment in the 2025 and 2026 sessions, with voters having the final say in the fall of 2026.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the Democratic-controlled Senate already passed an abortion rights amendment earlier this year that failed in the Republican-led House of Delegates, Lockhart indicated the amendment’s specifics could change now that Democrats have the ability to give it initial passage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A similar abortion rights constitutional amendment that passed in Ohio this week included clear language allowing abortion limits past the point of fetal viability, usually around 24 weeks. The initial amendment proposed in Virginia didn’t mention fetal viability as a valid reason to restrict abortion access, leading critics to argue it could override Virginia’s existing law banning abortion in the third trimester. During the campaign season, many Democratic candidates said they wanted to keep Virginia’s abortion laws unchanged.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A shift on education?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin has portrayed himself as being at the vanguard of a parents’ rights movement by restoring a preeminent role for parents in K-12 schools that he says have been derailed by left-wing leaders. Democrats have attacked him as an enemy of public education and accused him of stoking culture war fights over critical race theory, sexual content in books and accommodations for transgender students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those fights could very well continue, but the election results showed there’s a limit to the conservative pushback over the direction of public schools. Democrats can try to repeal or roll back some of Youngkin’s education policies, but the governor can still wield the veto and his appointees will continue to control the Virginia Board of Education. A stalemate on more controversial school-related issues could precede a pivot toward the more nuts-and-bolts elements of education, such as funding levels, teacher pay, testing reform and student performance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After campaigning on more school funding and better pay for educators, Democrats and their allies hailed Tuesday’s results as a clear victory for public education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This means that our communities want to fully fund our public schools,” House Minority Leader Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, said at an election party late Tuesday night when it became clear Democrats had won enough seats to make him the state’s first Black House speaker. “This means that our communities said, ‘don&#8217;t turn teachers against parents and [have] students snitching on teachers for teaching about our history.’ They said ‘no we don&#8217;t want that. Don&#8217;t ban books. We don&#8217;t want that.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin also stressed education as an ongoing priority at his post-election news conference, without dropping hints about specific areas of focus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Educational excellence, and making sure that our children have an opportunity to not just go to school but receive an extraordinary education, continues to be hugely important,” the governor said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin has had mixed success pushing for more alternatives to traditional public schools, but those efforts are also likely to stall in a less-friendly legislature.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">New hope for weed dispensaries</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bipartisan efforts to legalize retail sales of marijuana have failed in the last two sessions largely because the Youngkin administration’s quiet opposition has prevented the legislation from reaching his desk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A fully Democratic General Assembly might not be as inclined to let the governor avoid the issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Adam Ebbin, D-Fairfax, who has sponsored retail sales bills in the past, said he intends to keep pushing forward on the issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It will still be an accomplishment if we can all agree on a bill,” Ebbin said in an interview.. “Whether or not we can agree on something that the governor will live with remains to be ascertained.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats legalized possession of small amounts of marijuana in 2021 and allowed adults to grow up to four marijuana plants at home;Democratic victories last week closed the door on the possibility of Republicans rolling back those laws. The state also has a small medical marijuana industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Authorizing recreational sales has been a tougher puzzle to solve because of differing viewpoints on how that industry should be structured and who should be allowed to profit from it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats and some Republicans have argued that moving forward with regulated retail dispensaries is the best way to rein in the booming unregulated market for cannabis products. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JM Pedini, executive director of pro-legalization group Virginia NORML, said the election result “clears a path” for something to get to Youngkin’s desk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, without the supermajority of votes required to overturn a veto, any serious adult-use retail legislation must be both pragmatic and palatable in order to succeed,” Pedini said. “The bill should be easy to read, narrow in scope, and will absolutely require bipartisan support.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Budget and tax cuts</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin has gotten billions in tax relief passed in his first two years with bipartisan support, including the $200 per person rebate payments that went out just before the elections. But his more aspirational calls to cut the corporate tax rate and lower the top income tax rate are most likely dead under Democratic control.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the budget begins with the Youngkin administration, it will remain one of the most direct ways for the governor to lay out his priorities and make new proposals. However, any new tax-cutting plans he sends down are likely to face an even tougher reception now that Democrats are in charge of both General Assembly money committees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some bipartisan tax ideas — such as overhauling the state’s </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/11/04/virginias-highest-tax-bracket-starts-at-17k-some-say-its-time-for-an-update/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">outdated income tax structure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in which the highest bracket starts at $17,000 in income — were left on the table in the last round of budget negotiations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are also signs the relatively flush years for the state budget coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic are coming to an end as federal relief dollars disappear. Earlier this month, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported next year’s budget is </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/back-to-normal-next-va-budget-faces-big-bills-for-medicaid-education/article_73e56ec4-78c9-11ee-8097-f3a8a38a7729.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expected to be much tighter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and that Youngkin is </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/youngkin-looking-at-potential-spending-cuts-to-save-money-for-next-budget/article_005d09de-7a7d-11ee-838c-a32118694e37.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposing spending cuts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for some state agencies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the governor’s main budgetary priorities has been </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/12/14/youngkin-proposes-230-million-behavioral-health-overhaul/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">overhauling the state’s struggling mental health system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a relatively apolitical issue that’s likely to continue to be a focus moving forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor is scheduled to introduce his budget proposal next month. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">More gun-control bills</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Youngkin ran as a gun-rights supporter, he hasn’t fully embraced the absolutist rhetoric of groups like the National Rifle Association.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His views might be tested in the new legislature, with Democrats promising to push forward with enhancements to the state’s red flag law and toughening laws requiring gun owners to keep firearms locked up away from children.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The first bill I will submit in the Senate is the safe storage legislation I’ve carried in the House. We can and must do more to keep our kids safe from gun violence,” Sen.-elect Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico </span><a href="https://x.com/ScVanValkenburg/status/1722117062162616656?s=20" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said on X</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after defeating Republican Sen. Siobhan Dunnavant. “The Governor should sign it when it passes the House and Senate.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a 6-year-old student shot a teacher at a Newport News Elementary School early this year, VanValkenburg introduced a bill that would’ve created criminal penalties for gun owners if their firearms are taken by minors and used to commit a crime or violence. Opponents argued the state’s existing laws already criminalized that behavior in other ways. The mother of the Newport News shooter </span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/deja-taylor-virginia-teacher-shooting-newport-news/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pleaded guilty to felony child neglect in August</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but her charge of endangering a child by reckless storage of a firearm was </span><a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/crime/deja-taylor-mother-6-year-old-who-shot-richneck-elementary-teacher-plea-hearing/291-739dd8bc-94d7-4fcb-b7af-1c43b9cdca22" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">set aside</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in court</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent mass shooting in Lewiston, Maine has also led Virginia Democrats to call for reinvigorating the red flag law their party passed in 2020 as part of </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/northam-signs-landmark-gun-control-bills-recommends-tweaks-to-two-others/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a landmark gun-control package</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats also could re-up their push to restrict the sales of assault-style weapons, but that could be a more difficult task, given their small majorities and the party’s </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/02/17/va-senate-committee-blocks-assault-weapon-bill-4-democrats-vote-to-push-it-to-2021/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">inability to agree</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the issue the last time it had control.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After realizing the legislature will not have pro-gun majorities, the gun-rights group Virginia Citizens Defense League said it’s planning to fight against gun control on multiple fronts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We will be using the courts to invalidate bad gun laws that we probably can’t repeal in the General Assembly as it is now configured,” VCDL President Philip Van Cleave said in a message to the group’s members.</span></p>

(Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incumbent Democrat Buta Biberaj, one of several progressive prosecutors to take office in Virginia four years ago, on Thursday was trailing Republican Bob Anderson by about 1,000 votes in the race for Loudoun County commonwealth’s attorney.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Anderson, who served as Loudoun’s chief prosecutor from 1996 to 2003, on Wednesday </span><a href="https://twitter.com/bobanderson4ca/status/1722268071652692256" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said on X</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that “there is no current path to victory for Buta Biberaj,” Biberaj has not conceded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is one of the closest races in Virginia, and we will ensure that every Loudoun voter has their voice heard in the democratic process,” said Biberaj. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loudoun, she added, is “a swing county, and it’s no surprise that results are close. We will monitor the ongoing canvass process to protect everyone’s voting rights.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Others were more skeptical of her prospects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Loudoun County had enough of treating victims like criminals and letting repeat, violent offenders off easy,” said Miyares </span><a href="https://x.com/JasonMiyaresVA/status/1722279486874386816?s=20" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on X</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Wednesday afternoon. “They wanted a prosecutor who puts the needs of the county before their political agenda — and that&#8217;s why they fired Buta Biberaj last night.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday morning, Anderson, who campaigned on “prioritizing justice, fairness, and community safety” and “bringing the criminal justice system in Loudoun County back on track,” was leading Biberaj by 1,021 votes. Loudoun’s elections office said at least 2,500 provisional and mail-in ballots are being reviewed before counting ends on Monday. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title24.2/chapter8/section24.2-800/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">State law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allows any candidate to request a recount if the results are within one percentage point of each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biberaj has been a polarizing figure since her 2019 election, fielding criticism from members of both parties over her competence and prosecutorial decisions. While other progressive prosecutors in </span><a href="https://www.fox5dc.com/news/overwhelmed-and-untrained-a-fairfax-co-prosecutors-plea-for-help" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fairfax</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/local/virginia/prince-william-co-supervisors-accuse-prosecution-board-members-for-increased-crime/65-d591221a-8752-4d7c-9e7a-e0dfdeb222db" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prince William</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> counties and </span><a href="https://www.wavy.com/news/residents-want-norfolk-commonwealths-attorney-investigated/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Norfolk city</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have faced similar criticisms, Biberaj is the only one on the verge of being ousted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans have denounced Biberaj as soft on crime, pointing especially to her decision at the beginning of 2023 to </span><a href="https://wjla.com/news/local/loudoun-county-commonwealths-attorney-buta-biberaj-list-crimes-including-hit-run-will-no-longer-be-prosecuted-misdemeanor-virginia-youngkin-democrat-republican-nova-speeding-reckless-fairfax" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">divert low-level misdemeanors and nonviolent charges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to police for prosecution rather than involving the commonwealth’s attorney’s office, a move she defended as necessary to allow the office to focus on violent crimes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conservative group Virginians for Safe Communities led an unsuccessful charge to recall Biberaj in the past year, accusing her of “neglect of duty, misuse of office, and incompetence in the performance of her duties.” With Fight for Schools, a PAC focused on parents’ rights, the organization also </span><a href="https://www.loudountimes.com/news/virginia-state-bar-asked-to-investigate-violations-against-loudoun-county-commonwealth-s-attorney/article_0b724d26-edb5-11ec-92f8-67e7496520d7.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filed a complaint with the Virginia State Bar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over alleged misconduct in a series of burglary cases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biberaj also received some backlash for trying a disorderly conduct case involving Scott Smith, the parent of a high school student who was sexually assaulted in what became a high-profile case. Smith was arrested and later convicted for arguing loudly during a school board meeting, clenching his fist and later threatening to kick in the teeth of deputies who carried him out of the building, an episode that became a key moment for members of the “parental rights” movement. Smith was </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/virginia-schools-sexual-assault-youngkin-a52c053b6cd85a23407e5b8c164ec7b1?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=44444444-4444-4444-4444-444444444444" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">later pardoned by Gov. Glenn Youngkin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;ve done everything possible to try to make Loudoun County a better place, and the voters can either get it right or get it wrong,” Smith said. “It’s up to them, and whatever they decide is what Loudoun gets.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not all complaints have come from the opposite side of the political aisle. Some Democrats, including Loudoun Supervisor Kristen Umstattd, who backed Biberaj’s opponent Elizabeth Lancaster in the June primary, have also voiced frustration with the commonwealth’s attorney.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Umstattd said she believed Biberaj had allowed multiple violent offenders out of jail, including one who </span><a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/family-of-woman-allegedly-killed-by-abusive-husband-intends-to-file-suit-against-loudoun-county/3002739/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">killed his wife</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a hammer while released prior to trial.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I want a commonwealth&#8217;s attorney who will keep violent individuals in jail, not let them out. … Second, I want someone competent in the position,” Umstattd said. I don&#8217;t have any questions that Bob Anderson would be very competent. He is someone who believes in fairness, but he will aggressively prosecute cases where that needs to happen, and Buta was very lackadaisical on the prosecution. It almost was as if she was an arm of the public defender rather than being the commonwealth&#8217;s attorney.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biberaj has also racked up strong support, with endorsements from federal and state Democrats including U.S. Rep. Don Beyer, who called her “a champion for justice and equality in Loudoun,” and state Sen. John Bell, who praised her for saving taxpayer dollars and prioritizing victims of violent crimes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Buta has ensured the safety of our county for the past three years and I have no doubt she will continue to do just that once re-elected,” Bell said in a February statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biberaj for her part has argued that violent crime has significantly decreased in Loudoun, pointing to data from the 2021 </span><a href="https://vsp.virginia.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/CrimeInVirginia2021.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia State Police Crime Report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showing a 31% drop from 2019 to 2021 even as it increased statewide. She has also noted the expansion of the county’s special victims unit, which has tripled from two to six attorneys, and said her office’s approach to property crimes and misdemeanors has led to a decrease in daily incarceration counts from 425 to 250 people, resulting in significant taxpayer savings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heather Gottlieb, a Loudoun resident who described herself as a solutions architect, on Election Day said not keeping Biberaj’s administration would be a step backward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don&#8217;t want to go backward. We are all human beings, and throwing people in jail is not the answer,” Gottlieb said. “If there are people who have done egregious things and harmed others and things like that, obviously they need to pay for their crimes, but just throwing people in jail is not the right thing to do for Loudoun County.”</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuesday was a tough night for Churchill Downs in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The multistate gaming and horse-racing company, best known for its ownership of the Churchill Downs racetrack where the Kentucky Derby is held, put millions of dollars this campaign season toward getting voters to back two ballot measures that would further expand its gambling operations in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If successful, one referendum would have allowed horse racing-themed slot machines in the city of Manassas Park, permission Churchill Downs needed to open its eighth Rosie’s Gaming Emporium in Virginia. Another would have approved the construction of a Richmond casino that would have been jointly owned by the company and media conglomerate Urban One. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In support of those measures, Churchill Downs funneled over $5.7 million into Virginia campaigns. Most of that, $5.1 million, went to the Richmond Wins, Vote Yes PAC pushing for the Richmond casino, which city voters had rejected in a referendum two years ago. An additional $518,000 went to the Manassas Park efforts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve put a lot of time, effort, blood, sweat, and tears to winning the Richmond referendum because we believe that&#8217;s a huge market for brick and mortar gaming,” Churchill Downs Incorporated CEO Bill Carstanjen </span><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4643985-churchill-downs-incorporated-chdn-q3-2023-earnings-call-transcript" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told investors on an Oct. 25 call</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="0v24goIbwj"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/">Home</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Home&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/embed/#?secret=DHuu5NBEoU#?secret=0v24goIbwj" data-secret="0v24goIbwj" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But on Tuesday, voters decisively defeated both measures. Almost 59% of Manassas Park voters rejected the Rosie’s referendum, while almost 62% of Richmond voters nixed the casino project — a stark contrast to the 51%-49% split on the casino in 2021 when Urban One was the plan’s sole backer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Paul Krizek, D-Alexandria, who is serving as vice chair of a subcommittee reviewing the state’s gambling regulations, said the votes could indicate Virginians are ready to slow down the rapid expansion of gambling that’s taken place over the last four years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I feel that we need to put a pause on expansion,” said Krizek. “And one of the reasons we need to do it is we don’t have a regulatory body that handles all of gambling yet.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Churchill Downs, which also owns Virginia&#8217;s Colonial Downs racetrack in New Kent County, didn’t respond to several requests for comment for this story. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Krizek and the gambling subcommittee’s chair, Sen. Bryce Reeves, R-Fredericksburg, are planning to propose a bill this winter that would require a three-year waiting period if a casino is put on the ballot and a locality’s voters reject it. The pair said the change would bring Virginia’s casino rules in line with </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/59.1-391/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> governing referenda on horse racing machines like those considered in Manassas Park. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t know of any referendums that don’t have language in there that don’t put a limit on how many times” they can occur, said Krizek. “It’s unfair to voters to keep coming back to the well every single year after year until you win.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reeves also said he thought it would be “prudent” to enforce a hiatus on bringing casino proposals to voters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Richmond, “the voters didn’t want it, but somehow they put it back up there,” he said. “Are you going to do that every year until they finally succumb to the will of the casinos? I don’t think that’s right. And I think when the voters speak as they have in this election, they need to honor that.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Virginia tightly limited the forms of gambling residents could engage in for years, the General Assembly in 2018 began to loosen its restrictions, allowing historical horse racing machines and two years later legalizing online sports betting and the construction of casinos in five cities, including Richmond, if voters endorsed them in a referendum. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Krizek called the casino law’s lack of a time limit for those referenda “an oversight.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t think anybody anticipated that a locality would say no to it,” he said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We did it,” the group said in a Facebook post. “Yesterday we proved that our Hanover School Board is not for sale.” Hanover is a “special place with some of the best schools in Virginia,” the group continued, closing out their message by thanking residents for voting against the referendum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A total of 66.8% of voters in Hanover County turned out for the General Election. Nearly 45,000 of the county’s 86,000 registered voters cast a vote on the school board referendum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hanover County Registration and Elections Office did not immediately respond to when the results of the provisional ballots would be available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Department of Elections, the local electoral board reviews each provisional ballot during its canvass of votes cast to determine if the vote will be counted. The electoral board reviews provisional ballots the day after Election Day and the process must be concluded within seven days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tim McDermott, a volunteer with the Hanover Citizens for an Elected School Board, said the group will continue following the results of the provisional ballots still being considered, but did point out that a lot of “yes” votes would be needed to close the gap with the opposition.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re disappointed with the way the vote has turned out,” he said, but “we’re hopeful that the provisional ballots will yield something.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Berdan, a volunteer with the “Vote Yes” campaign, said there was a lot of enthusiasm and money poured into the campaign to transform the school board into an elected body, but Hanoverians were “drowning in a sea of unfounded nonsense” and mistakenly characterized the referendum as “one for political school boards.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our campaign was hopeful and positive, funded by small-dollar, local donations by individuals,” Berdan wrote. “I am proud to have been part of it, and look forward to the next time we bring this question to voters.”</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin holds a news conference on the steps of the Virginia Capitol to discuss his party's losses in the 2023 General Assembly elections. (Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facing the press on the steps of Virginia’s Capitol, Gov. Glenn Youngkin was direct about how he felt about Tuesday’s General Assembly elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m a little disappointed, to be clear,” Youngkin said Wednesday in his first public remarks about the outcome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly halfway through his four-year term, the Republican governor had spent enormous amounts of time and money trying to help the GOP hold the House of Delegates and flip the state Senate. Instead, Democrats held the Senate and flipped the House, an outcome that leaves Youngkin with less legislative power than he had before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assuming a more subdued tone than he took during his campaign-season pep rallies, Youngkin said the election results reflect Virginia’s status as a “really purple” state, with many close contests decided by “razor-thin” margins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m not going anywhere,” Youngkin said. “And we still have a divided government. Which means we all have to come together to progress legislation.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some close races were still being watched Wednesday for potential changes to vote counts from late-arriving ballots, but Democrats appeared to be on track to win a 21-19 majority in the Senate and at least a 51-49 House majority. For the 2023 legislative session, Democrats had a 22-18 Senate majority and Republicans had a 52-48 majority in the House.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It remains to be seen what kind of policy agenda Youngkin and a Democratic General Assembly will agree on, but the governor pointed to several issues on which he believed the two parties can work together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Better schools, safe neighborhoods and an improved mental health system, he said, are areas he’s already been prioritizing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These are areas where over the course of the last two years we have come together on a bipartisan basis. Because that&#8217;s what Virginia requires,” Youngkin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked if he feels voters rejected his call to ban most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, Youngkin said he was attempting to forge consensus on a difficult topic and still believes “Virginians don’t want to be extreme in either direction.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor said he has not yet spoken to Democratic leader Don Scott, who’s poised to become the first Black House speaker in Virginia history, or top Democrats in the state Senate believed to be in line to lead their majority next year. However, he said he intends to do so once Democratic winners go through the process of formally selecting their new leaders in the coming weeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic Party of Virginia Chairwoman Susan Swecker was in attendance at Youngkin’s press conference and told reporters afterward that the governor’s comments were an overly rosy spin on what she said was “a clear rebuke of any abortion ban.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nice try,” she said. “But there is a lot of revisionist history going on there. He was very confident all day yesterday in his live interviews.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swecker said she agrees with Youngkin that Virginia is a purple state, but she said that doesn’t account for the fact that voters sent a clear signal they “wanted to keep abortion legal.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Two years ago, a slim majority went on a Tinder date with Glenn Youngkin,” Swecker said. “And now are sorry that they swiped right.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a memo released Wednesday afternoon, Youngkin’s PAC laid out a case for why, despite losing partisan control, the story was more complicated than a resounding defeat for their side. Youngkin’s political advisers said Republicans won more than a dozen districts that backed President Joe Biden in 2020 and came within “just a few thousand votes of winning majorities in both legislative chambers” despite Democrats having a significant spending advantage on TV ads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defeated House Speaker Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, referenced the wave of abortion-themed ads from Democrats in a more pointed statement released shortly after Youngkin’s press conference.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the end, our focus on better schools, safer communities and lowering the cost of living couldn’t overcome a dishonest Democratic focus on a lone issue,” Gilbert said. “Now, our Republican Caucus will again assume the role of the loyal opposition, working with Governor Youngkin to hold the line against the worst left-wing impulses of the incoming Democratic majority and ensure that common-sense ideas aren’t forgotten.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement released early Wednesday morning, Senate Republican leaders highlighted the fact that their numbers in the Senate will have “increased by one.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our 19 returning senators and senators-elect stand ready to promote our positive agenda of fighting inflation, lowering taxes, supporting law enforcement and getting energy prices under control,” said Sen. Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover, the chairman of the Senate GOP caucus. “We will also stand strong against the Democrats’ extreme progressive agenda.”</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce for the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RICHMOND — Virginia Democrats beat back Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s effort to turn the state fully red by defending their state Senate majority in Tuesday’s General Assembly elections and flipping control of the House of Delegates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the final counts in the high-stakes battle for the statehouse weren’t fully clear at midnight, with multiple races still too close to call, Democrats appeared to have secured control of both chambers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even before outlets including the Associated Press called the House races around midnight, Democrats were already hailing the night as a victory, one that will further erode Youngkin’s ability to enact his conservative agenda as he begins the second half of his four-year term. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a watch party in downtown Richmond, caucus leaders pulled out a pair of blue bricks to symbolize that the so-called “brick wall” against Youngkin’s agenda had endured.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re more than just a brick wall now. We are building a house,” said Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, the chair of the Senate Democratic Caucus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the House side, where Republicans had a 52-48 majority earlier this year, Democrats are now poised to elevate Minority Leader Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, to become the first Black House speaker in Virginia history.</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce for the Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to unofficial results, Del. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, defeated incumbent Sen. Siobhan Dunnavant, R-Henrico, in one of the toughest suburban districts Republicans were trying to defend. In Northern Virginia, Democrat Russet Perry beat Republican Juan Pablo Segura in a competitive race for an open seat representing parts of Loudoun and Fauquier counties. In another Northern Virginia contest, Del. Danica Roem, D-Prince William, triumphed over Republican Bill Woolf, making her the first transgender person ever elected to the state Senate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Dels. Tara Durant, R-Fredericksburg, and Emily Brewer, R-Suffolk, won two other close contests, defeating Democratic opponents Joel Griffin and Del. Clint Jenkins, D-Suffolk, respectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate matchup between Sen. Monty Mason, D-Williamsburg, and Republican Danny Diggs was too close to call at night’s end and may take days to resolve as election officials continue to tabulate votes cast under the same-day registration system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin has spent months rallying Republicans to flip the Senate and hold the House, but the GOP’s failure to achieve that ambitious goal shows the limits of the governor’s brand of conservatism, as well as the staying power of Democrats, who gained new evidence for their belief that Youngkin’s 2021 win was more of a pandemic-era anomaly than a lasting realignment of state politics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The emperor has no clothes except for a red sweater vest,” Sen. Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, said as results rolled in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats ran largely on preserving abortion access, launching a wave of ads that declared a vote for their party was a vote to stop Youngkin from passing his proposal to ban most abortions after 15 weeks. Youngkin had portrayed that plan as a reasonable “limit” because it would have allowed exceptions for cases of rape and incest and when the mother’s life or physical health is at risk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GOP effort to defuse abortion as a motivating issue for Democratic-leaning voters wasn’t enough to stop the tide in the suburban battlegrounds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview, Jamie Lockhart, executive director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia, said “abortion rights won” despite Republican efforts to obfuscate the issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Voters weren’t fooled,” Lockhart said. “They showed up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though he has two more years left in office, Youngkin will have to spend that time working with a new crew of Democratic leaders at the statehouse who have been sharply at odds with him on virtually every major issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican candidates mostly campaigned this year on the same themes Youngkin ran on in 2021: cutting taxes, getting tougher on crime and giving parents a bigger role in K-12 schools. Many of the GOP candidates running in swing districts echoed the governor’s stance on abortion, characterizing their position as a reasonable compromise that would keep the procedure legal in the earliest stages of pregnancy, when most Virginia abortions occur.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuesday’s results are also a setback for the lingering buzz about Youngkin as a possible late entrant into the GOP presidential primary by complicating the governor’s narrative about flipping a blue state red.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin and other Republican leaders had not yet weighed in on the results as of publication.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At an election night event in Henrico, Dunnavant indicated she was not conceding her race but acknowledged she was “down.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am 100% proud of my campaign,” she said. </span></p>

<p>The second time was not the charm for developers’ dreams of building a casino in Richmond.</p>
<p>City voters appeared to have decisively rejected the idea in a referendum Tuesday, with more than 60% of votes cast opposing the measure at the time the Richmond Grand Resort &amp; Casino&#8217;s backers declared defeat.</p>
<p>Two hours after the polls closed, the Richmond Wins, Vote Yes PAC jointly funded by casino developers Churchill Downs and Urban One conceded defeat in a statement that described their $10 million effort as “a community-centered campaign to create more opportunities for residents of this great city to rise into the middle class.”</p>
<p>“We are grateful to the thousands of Richmonders who voted for good jobs and a stronger city, especially those in Southside who poured their hearts into this project,” the PAC wrote.</p>
<p>Tuesday night’s results presented a far clearer rejection of the casino than a 2021 referendum that saw voters split 51% to 49% against the proposal and represented a blow for Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney, a vocal cheerleader of the project.</p>
<p>“I will continue to be a voice for communities that have been historically overlooked and underserved,” said Stoney in a statement Tuesday. “I will work for more accessible and affordable child care, for good paying jobs, and for an abundance of opportunities for ALL Richmonders – no matter their zip code or socioeconomic status.”</p>
<p>Virginia’s General Assembly in 2020 allowed five cities around the state to hold referenda on casino gaming. Four of them — Bristol, Danville, Norfolk and Portsmouth — have approved the establishments with little fanfare, but the issue has remained deeply controversial in Richmond. There, debates have emphasized the split among the city’s whiter neighborhoods, which have largely opposed the casino, and those with greater concentrations of Black people, particularly in Southside, which have shown more support for the idea.</p>
<p>Those tensions came to a head Friday when anti-casino group No Means No released a series of audio clips from local radio programs geared toward Black audiences that contained <a class="c-link" href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/11/03/richmond-casino-promoters-make-racially-inflammatory-remarks-on-local-radio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/11/03/richmond-casino-promoters-make-racially-inflammatory-remarks-on-local-radio/" data-sk="tooltip_parent">racially inflammatory remarks</a> made by Urban One founder Cathy Hughes, one of the main backers of the project, and other Black casino proponents.</p>
<p>One radio host, who was fired Friday over his comments, accused casino opponent and Jewish lawyer Paul Goldman of being “a white Jew with a background of Judas.” In numerous other clips, Hughes implied that opposition to the casino was driven by racism, repeatedly using an offensive slur to refer to Black people and telling listeners, “Do not forget that they do not see you as a human being.”</p>

(Meghan McIntyre/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RICHMOND – As the second Richmond casino referendum wraps up this evening, voter attitudes toward the project appear to remain deeply divided. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Residents in the city’s Southside, where the casino is planned, appear to largely favor the Urban One project — a stark contrast to the opposition seen elsewhere in the city.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A similar split was seen in 2021, when the city first held a referendum on a casino that was narrowly defeated. The revival of the issue this year has sparked widespread debate, particularly after </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/11/03/richmond-casino-promoters-make-racially-inflammatory-remarks-on-local-radio/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">racially inflammatory remarks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the casino’s lead backers were publicized late last week.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several voters at Southside’s Hickory Hill, Bellemeade and Blackwell polling sites told the Mercury they support the project and the benefits they say come with it. However, only one voter agreed to an interview due to the controversy they said surrounds the casino. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Bellemeade Community Center, 33-year-old Southside resident Lorenzo (LT) Ferrell said the additional jobs, increased property value and business opportunities the casino promises to bring are among several reasons why the project should move forward. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If people like to gamble, if people have problems with gambling, they’re gonna do it regardless, whether they go to MGM, whether they drive to a different area, whether they download an app on their phone,” Ferrell said, referring to the MGM National Harbor casino, which sits just across the Potomac River from Alexandria in Maryland. “We have slot machines now, so I don’t really think that’s the issue.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, not all Southside residents shared the same stance. At Hickory Hill Community Center, longtime resident Leonard, who declined to give his last name, spent the day passing out anti-casino flyers to incoming voters while donning a “Vote no to the casino” shirt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you’re dealing with local things, you can contain things on a local level, but when you start bringing in a lot of out-of-town people and people from different places and other parts of the world, things can get tricky,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anti-casino sentiment was far more evident at the Virginia Commonwealth University campus polling location, where numerous students and faculty said they opposed the project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tony Tann, a 29-year-old VCU faculty member, said, “We’ve already voted no for this once, why are we voting for this again? You should listen to us the first time around.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VCU sophomore Dev Partangle, 19, said he feels “like there&#8217;s better things we could be doing to actually help the people of Richmond” than building a casino.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the Richmond Community High polling location in Northside, longtime resident Michelle, who also declined to provide her last name, said she came out to the polls specifically to vote no on the casino. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you look at the ballot, there’s only one reason most people are probably gonna come out to vote, because there’s no one running for the other districts,” she said.</span></p>

(Samantha Willis/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Election Day drew to a close, the outcome of a referendum that could transform Hanover County’s school board into an elected instead of an appointed body remained unclear. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If successful, the results could offer a blueprint for change for the commonwealth’s few remaining appointed school boards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hanover is one just 12 localities in Virginia that stills allows its governing body to appoint school board members, while in the rest of Virginia, voters decide who represents them. On Election Day, voters in Hanover County had mixed views on the choice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The current school board, they&#8217;re good decision makers,” said voter Barbara Boor. “I dread the day we get an elected school board; I just don&#8217;t feel that the right decisions will be made because people will get elected that really aren&#8217;t qualified to be on the school board. It will be a popular vote, instead of a vote for knowledge.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carmen Courtney also voted against an elected school board. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Keep it the way it is. It&#8217;s working good, we haven&#8217;t had any problems,” Courtney said. “We have wonderful schools and wonderful teachers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Bob Junod said that because the school board is appointed by the elected Board of Supervisors, the appointed school board is already a political body. He said recent decisions made by the board swayed his decision to support the elected model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Historically, Hanover schools are very good — my kids all went to school here. But things have happened in the past few years that are a little different, with the library situation and talking about the rights of individual LGBTQ children,” Junod said. “If one section of the population is being targeted, then another section could be targeted.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hanover’s school board, like some others across the state, has come under scrutiny by groups including the Virginia NAACP, the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia and Equality Virginia over its handling of COVID-19 protections and transgender student policies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February, the Republican-controlled House supported a bill that would’ve allowed localities to petition a circuit court for a referendum asking voters if the school board should be elected, but it was </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/21/senate-kills-house-backed-measure-on-elected-school-boards/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">killed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Democratic-controlled Senate. A supermajority of the local governing body would have been required to back the petition. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If passed, lawmakers said the legislation would have created contention between governing bodies and school boards over issues such as funding. Others saw the legislation as an opportunity for voters to select their school board representation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to 1992, nearly all school boards in Virginia were appointed. In that year, however, Del. Wendell Walker, R-Lynchburg, carried a bill allowing local governments to hold a referendum on electing the boards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the General Assembly passed the law, the majority of Virginia localities switched to elected boards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris Ambler, a parent who voted “yes” for an elected school board, said it’s time for a new normal in Hanover.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m ready for change, for more citizen input on who should be on the school board,” Ambler said. “Appointed school boards have worked well in the past; I think the school board has done a good job representing parents and students, for the most part. I just want to see the kids get a good education.”</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce for the Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HENRICO — Voters in the Richmond-area 57th House District on Election Day voiced a range of reactions to Susanna Gibson, the Democratic contender for a key legislative seat whose campaign was rocked this September by the news she had performed sex acts online. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gibson, who has taken a low profile since the news broke, told the Mercury she felt &#8220;great&#8221; after casting a vote at Henrico’s Nuckols Farm Elementary School Tuesday morning. But asked about how the revelation had impacted her campaign, a member of her team replied, &#8220;I appreciate your time but I think we&#8217;re done.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nurse practitioner got national headlines this fall after </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/09/11/susanna-gibson-sex-website-virginia-candidate/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Washington Post revealed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> she had streamed sex acts on the online platform Chaturbate while soliciting tips to perform specific acts. Gibson called the leak an illegal breach of her privacy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite her candidacy in a battleground district where she faces Republican retired home builder David Owen in a tight race, Democrats distanced themselves from Gibson following the revelation. Her name was noticeably absent from a list of endorsements of Democrats from President Joe Biden, and </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/10/31/four-takeaways-from-the-last-campaign-finance-reports-of-virginias-2023-elections/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">her fundraising slowed in October</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, voters offered mixed reactions to the Democrat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paul Pinigis, a 57-year-old engineer who identified himself as a Republican, said he voted for Gibson despite her online activities and his political affiliation because he was more broadly concerned about the Republican Party being &#8220;tainted&#8221; by former President Donald Trump.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I could not vote for a Republican now,&#8221; Pinigis said. &#8220;Even if someone is a reasonable candidate, I can&#8217;t vote for a Republican.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One woman said Gibson’s conduct had led her to vote for Owen despite her own pro-choice stance on abortion. But other female voters said the Democrat’s actions had not outweighed their preference for a candidate who opposed further restrictions to Virginia’s abortion laws.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The abortion issue is really near and dear to my heart,&#8221; said Heather Sabharwal, a 48-year-old self-employed woman who called proposals to limit the procedure a &#8220;massive threat.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One former CPA, who declined to publicly disclose her name, said she was unhappy with Gibson&#8217;s conduct but still voted for her because of Owen&#8217;s stance on abortion. The Republican has backed Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s proposal for a 15-week ban with exceptions for rape, incest and when the life of the mother is at risk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I had to do it for the issue, even though I really do think somebody who would do that while they&#8217;re running for office does show very poor judgment,&#8221; the woman said. &#8220;It was really a vote against him, not a vote for her. She put Democrats in a really hard spot.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few power outages were the only trouble Virginia election officials had to report as of 11 a.m. as voters head to the polls in a closely watched battle for control of the General Assembly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A polling place in Arlington County lost power just as it opened, according to Virginia Elections Commissioner Susan Beals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They moved voting outside so that it could continue,” Beals said. “And the power was restored by 7:45 a.m.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Roanoke County, Beals said, the local registrar’s office was without power due to a blown transformer, but voting at polling places hadn’t been interrupted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They are working to get generators in to help with that,” Beals said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals said there had also been some minor pollbook issues in Chesterfield County that were resolved quickly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The elections commissioner announced that as of Tuesday morning, more than 789,000 Virginians had already cast their ballot by voting early in person or voting through the mail. Those numbers can’t be neatly compared to 2019, the last Virginia election cycle when all 140 General Assembly seats were on the ballot, because the state had not yet adopted its relatively new 45-day early voting window.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Department of Elections has been scrambling to fix a </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/11/01/voting-rights-advocates-blast-youngkin-admin-over-error-affecting-3400/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data error</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that led to an estimated 3,400 voter registrations being canceled. According to officials, the issue primarily affected people with felony convictions who had a new probation violation after having their voting rights restored by a governor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked if election officials were seeing any issues with people showing up and finding out they weren’t registered, Beals stressed that anyone who finds themselves in that situation will still be able to cast a provisional ballot that can be verified after Election Day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No one should be turned away,” Beals said.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin joined Republicans Bill Woolf and John Stirrup in Prince William County on Election Day. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury) </p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LOUDOUN — Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin defended his views on abortion early Tuesday morning as he urged voters to support Republicans in a competitive Northern Virginia Senate district featuring Republican Juan Pablo Segura and Democratic opponent Russet Perry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Republican Youngkin, speaking to reporters with Segura at an Ashburn precinct, insisted the 15-week plan that he has floated and that many state Republicans support is not a ban, an argument the Virginia GOP has embraced this election season as Democrats campaign heavily on abortion rights. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Anything anybody else says is an absolute lie,” said Youngkin. Democrats, he continued, “have no plan for job growth, they have no plan for public safety, they have no plan for education, they have no plan for behavioral health, they have no plan for running government better. All they do is sell fear, and we&#8217;re the party of help and hope beats fear every day of the week.”</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Senate District 31 race: Republican Juan Pablo Segura vs. Democrat Russet Perry&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/19/senate-district-31-race-republican-juan-pablo-segura-vs-democrat-russet-perry/embed/#?secret=KcVABJYwD9#?secret=1VoetYrpyp" data-secret="1VoetYrpyp" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Virginia’s current law, there are few restrictions on abortion in the first and second trimesters. Abortions are also allowed in the third trimester if three doctors determine the pregnancy poses a risk to the mother. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s proposal would forbid abortions after 15 weeks except in cases of rape, incest and a threat to the life of the mother.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Segura has said he supports the governor’s proposal, while Perry has campaigned on upholding Virginia’s current abortion laws.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the Ashburn precinct where Youngkin spoke, Tyler Pla, a 24-year-old who works in sales, said abortion was a top issue for him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Pro-life is my biggest one,” Pla said. “If you can&#8217;t defend babies, then what are you doing? That&#8217;s where life starts.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liz Carter, a 51-year-old who works in sales and voted earlier in Loudoun County, however, said the governor’s proposal will deny women health care they need, citing two dilation and curettage procedures she had related to two miscarriages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By denying women the right for women to choose, it also prevents women from getting access to that kind of health care, and I’m especially worried for my daughter that she will have fewer rights than I did,” Carter said.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin speaks at a rally in Henrico County on the last weekend before the 2023 General Assembly elections. (Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a parking lot in suburban Henrico County on Sunday, Gov. Glenn Youngkin got a crowd of supporters to chant “Hope beats fear,” the slogan he’s adopted for the final runup to Tuesday’s critical Virginia General Assembly elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Democrats hoping to preserve or expand their power to block Republican policies at the statehouse, Youngkin said, have “no agenda” of their own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They are doing everything they can to spread untruths. And we have to break through,” Youngkin said. “I think these candidates have done an amazing job of breaking through with a vision of the future as opposed to selling fear.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a Democratic event a few miles away, former lawmaker Jay Jones said the progress Virginia made under Democratic leadership, such as tougher gun control laws and expanded voting access, is at risk from an all-Republican executive branch trying to “run roughshod over the things that we worked so damn hard for.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now we’re here to push back on the craziness,” said Jones, who ran for attorney general in 2021 and is widely seen as a future contender for statewide office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s attempt to rebrand the GOP as the party of can-do optimism — an ongoing project that still has some donors championing him as a potential candidate for president — is facing a major test this week, when all 140 General Assembly seats are on the ballot and partisan control of both the state Senate and House of Delegates will be decided by a handful of hotly contested races.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter what happens, Youngkin still has two more years in his term as governor. But his party is fighting an uphill battle to win the policymaking majorities it needs to fully enact his legislative agenda.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The strength of Youngkin’s 2021 victory propelled Republicans to a narrow majority in the House. But the Democratic-controlled Senate wasn’t on the ballot that year, and Republicans will have to beat expectations to flip it.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The newly redrawn Senate map being used this year has 16 seats that favor Republicans, 20 seats that favor Democrats and four swing districts in between, according to the Virginia Public Access Project. That leaves little room for error by Republicans trying to make inroads in suburban areas like Henrico that have Democratic-friendly demographics.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_36863" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSCF6603-scaled.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-36863" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSCF6603-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSCF6603-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSCF6603-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSCF6603-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSCF6603-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSCF6603-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSCF6603-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Prince William, speaks to a crowd of Democratic volunteers in Henrico County. (Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can do the things that all the pundits don&#8217;t think are possible,” U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Prince William, said Sunday as she stumped for Del. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, who’s trying to oust Sen. Siobhan Dunnavant, R-Henrico. “But the great thing is, the pundits think he&#8217;s going to win.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats also feel they’re getting a boost from campaigning heavily on preserving abortion access in the last Southern state that hasn’t passed new restrictions since Roe v. Wade was overturned. Abortion rights proponents have tried to turn the swing-district contests into a referendum on Youngkin’s push to ban most abortions after 15 weeks with exceptions for cases of rape and incest and when the mother’s life or health is at risk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin and other Republicans have portrayed the 15-week cutoff as a “reasonable” limit and have accused Democrats of supporting limitless abortion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The elections are also a gauge of how voters feel about Youngkin, who has solid approval ratings in Virginia despite years of attacks from Democratic critics who say his nice-guy image masks a more hard-right policy platform.  to former President Donald Trump. Polls have consistently shown Youngkin is more popular in Virginia than President Joe Biden, who hasn’t been a major presence in Virginia’s legislative races apart from funneling national money into the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican commercials routinely feature cameos from the governor, and some swing-district Democrats have incorporated Youngkin-esque rhetoric on cutting taxes into their own campaigns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At his Henrico rally, Youngkin said Democrats have tried to thwart “common-sense conservative principles” and offer no solutions on issues like public safety and the economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They stand in the way of progress every chance they get,” Youngkin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The polls close at 7 p.m Tuesday night, but some election watchers are cautioning that things are looking close enough that it could take days to have a clear picture of which party came out on top.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under state law, ballots cast via mail can be accepted as long as they’re received by noon on Friday. Virginia also recently enacted a same-day registration process that allows people to cast provisional ballots that have to be verified by local election officials after Election Day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That means that in particularly tight races, the unofficial vote counts available Tuesday night won’t necessarily reveal who won and who lost.</span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Virginians are heading to the polls to decide the high-stakes battle for control of the General Assembly. The contests happening today will set the stage for the second half of Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s four-year term, producing either complete GOP control of the statehouse, a Democratic-led legislature with more power to combat Youngkin and pursue its own priorities or two more years of divided government. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Mercury staff will be covering the races as they unfold statewide. Here is the key info you need to know:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Polls are open from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. Anyone in line at 7:00 p.m. will be allowed to vote.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Registered voters may find their polling place and see what’s on their ballot by entering their address </span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/casting-a-ballot/polling-place-lookup/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the Virginia Department of Elections website or by contacting their local registrar’s office.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> All voters are asked to present identification to vote; find a list of acceptable forms of I.D. </span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/media/formswarehouse/voter-id/outreach-materials/documents/Voter-Identification-Chart---Revised-10.2022.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you don’t have an acceptable form of I.D., you can still vote by either signing an affirmation of identity form and then using a regular ballot or completing a provisional ballot; </span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/casting-a-ballot/in-person-voting/#provisional-ballot" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here’s how that process works</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Virginia now has a same-day registration process allowing those who didn’t register in advance to cast a provisional ballot on Election Day. However, those ballots aren’t counted immediately. They are only counted if officials can confirm the voter’s eligibility in a verification process that occurs shortly after Election Day.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> All 40 seats in the Virginia Senate and 100 seats in the House of Delegates are up for election, but not all districts are being contested by both parties.</span></li>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury) </p><p>While all 140 seats in the Virginia General Assembly<span style="font-weight: 400;"> are on the ballot Nov. 7, not all are closely contested <i>—</i> or even contested at all. Roughly one-third of the House of Delegates&#8217; races and five Senate races have only one candidate vying for election, while numerous others have two or more but represent an electorate that leans strongly Republican or strongly Democratic. </span></p>
<p>With two closely divided chambers <span style="font-weight: 400;"><i>— </i>the Senate has 22 Democrats and 18 Republicans, while the House has 52 Republicans and 48 Democrats <i>— </i>control of both will come down to the outcome of a dozen or so races. This fall, the Virginia Mercury profiled 10 of those key races and the issues at play in each. Here are some of the major contests to watch: </span></p>

Here, we never take a year off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This evening, before the polls open, take a stroll if you can through your neighborhood. Maybe even drive around your community — roll the window down, weather permitting. Look around. Listen. Feel. Breathe in the cool fall air.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election eve long ago became perhaps my most special night on each year’s calendar. It was because of the resolute, almost reverential calm that pervaded the darkened streets and neighborhoods.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the overwhelming balance of my adult life, elections were my business. I </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">lived </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">them as a newsman and political correspondent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the weekends preceding each election, I had studied published polls and campaign finance data and traveled extensively across Virginia. I had made countless phone calls to local party leaders, candidates, campaign professionals, registrars and “real people” I had met in my reporting. Rarely did any election night result surprise me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reporters and editors spent Mondays before elections polishing the background and contextual material at the bottom of stories that would be transmitted the next day to publications and broadcasters across Virginia and beyond. That material would remain unchanged but the tops of the stories were revised many times Tuesday night into Wednesday’s wee hours with fresh tallies and trends until, eventually, The Associated Press declared a winner and announced it with a bulletin, the next-highest priority level for wire-service reports behind a flash.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such was the caffeine- and adrenaline-fueled work within the pressure cooker that was election night in AP’s state control bureaus as vote totals flooded in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the night before, when I would invariably leave work late, I’d often take the long way home, sometimes varying my route through different parts of town. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The streets were conspicuously empty and quiet except maybe for falling leaves rustling in the breeze. Bars and eateries, where autumn Monday nights normally meant lively pro football crowds, seemed sparse and subdued. Some households had displayed their support for certain candidates with yard signs that, by then, had largely exhausted any expectation of influencing the undecided.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all the biting rhetoric and the acidic ads, after all the claims and counterclaims and liberties taken with the truth, after all the debates and breathless campaign reporting, after all the final rallies had ended, now the voters would have their say – the only say that matters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The anticipation felt palpable: the people’s pent-up will was about to be made manifest in the seminal triumph of representative democracy. It seemed an almost sacred moment, and it always inspired me. It probably will tonight, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This evening, let yourself </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">believe</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in our collective wisdom; that we as voters get it right more often than not. Even if the candidate (or candidates) of your choice fall short, trust that it’s better than unaccountable and unelected power imposing its will upon us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trust that your votes are being fairly and faithfully collected and counted by honorable people just like you who are doing their best, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">because</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">they are</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another edifying aspect of my years of daily political reporting was Election Day visits to urban, rural and suburban polling places where I met citizens who gave earnestly of their time and worked long, tiring hours at local precincts to ensure that their neighbors’ votes mattered. The same goes for dutiful, skilled career election professionals, regardless of the party in power, who kept the processes clean and transparent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Government of, by and for the people took root here 247 years ago. Over that time, suffrage was justly expanded to populations once disenfranchised — women and the descendants of enslaved people chief among them. There is still work yet to do. However, there is no guarantee that our constitutional democracy will make it to 250 years, as malignant forces hell-bent on authoritarian rule seek power by any means, up to and including</span> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-56004916" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seditious violence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One generation cannot bequeath the blessings of freedom to the next. It must be earned and defended anew through informed vigilance, intentional electoral participation and the courage to stand against those who prosper from dividing Americans and turning one against the other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So tonight, take it all in. Savor the quiet resolve of Americans — Virginians, your neighbors — about to choose their government in our fragile annual exercise of the peaceful delegation of power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tomorrow, cast your vote and then watch the machinery of democracy and the rule of law run their righteous course.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember and cherish it. We risk its loss sooner than we dare imagine.</span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Radio entrepreneur Cathy Hughes may have upended her push to build a casino in Richmond by letting her opinions fly on the radio.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just days before Richmonders head to the polls to vote a second time on a proposed casino partly owned by Urban One, the media company Hughes founded, casino opponents published a series of audio clips revealing racially inflammatory remarks made by Hughes and other Black casino proponents on local radio programs geared toward Black audiences. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The clips include numerous examples of Hughes implying that opposition to the casino is driven by racism. At one point, she says, “Do not forget that they do not see you as a human being.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even though you may have a house like theirs, a car like theirs, your children may go to the same schools — they see you as a n*****, alright?” Hughes said. “Wake up!” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a different recording, local radio personality and occasional political candidate Preston Brown took aim at Richmond activist Paul Goldman, a Jewish lawyer and former aide to Gov. Doug Wilder who has been fighting to block the casino.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He’s a white Jew with a background of Judas,” Brown said, referring to the biblical figure who betrayed Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney, who supports the casino and has </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2021-11-01/critics-question-urban-ones-financial-links-to-pro-casino-elected-officials-and" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">received political contributions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from donors tied to the project, denounced the Goldman remark in a social media post Friday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I unequivocally condemn the antisemitic remarks made by a guest host on The Box 99.5 FM regarding Paul Goldman,” Stoney </span><a href="https://x.com/LevarStoney/status/1720433255680299049?s=20" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said on X</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “We must call out hate in all of its forms, and his remarks are completely unacceptable.”</span></p>
<p>https://twitter.com/LevarStoney/status/1720433255680299049?s=20</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stoney did not mention any of the other controversial remarks made by Hughes and others, and his office refused to comment further.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement Friday afternoon, Goldman, a former chairman of the Democratic Party of Virginia, suggested the response and limited apology overlooked “the true meaning of the damage they have done to Richmond.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For the love of money, for personal gain, they are willing to turn their casino project into a wedge of division, to attempt to win by a divisive strategy serving only their selfish interests,” Goldman said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The audio clips, taken from multiple radio shows, were posted on the website of the No Means No anti-casino group. It’s unclear exactly when each comment was made, and the clips don’t show the full context of what preceded and came after each remark. Radio One, the station that aired Brown’s comments, did not immediately respond to a request for the full recordings of the shows from which the clips were taken. At least one of the clips posted by the anti-casino group was edited to condense multiple comments, according to a longer audio file of Brown’s remarks obtained by the Virginia Mercury. However, no one has come forward to dispute the accuracy of what the anti-casino group published.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Radio One, the station that aired Brown’s comment, issued a statement saying Brown was acting as a “temporary guest host” and is not employed by the station.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These remarks were horrible and offensive,” said Marsha Landess, the station’s regional vice president. “Once we heard the comments and because he was alone in the studio with his producer, I personally drove to the station and immediately removed him from the show.  He will not be appearing again. Our CEO, Alfred Liggins, has personally apologized to Mr. Goldman on behalf of the station and our company.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liggins is the son of Hughes. Efforts to reach Brown Friday were unsuccessful. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Landess confirmed that the “primary voices” heard on most of the clips were Hughes and radio host Gary Flowers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond Wins Vote Yes, the pro-casino PAC funded by Urban One and its business partner Churchill Downs, also distanced itself from the remarks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Richmond Wins Vote Yes is about bringing people together to build a better Richmond and provide meaningful economic opportunity for the city and its people,” the PAC said. “This campaign unequivocally condemns the anti-Semitic language and divisive comments that were made on the air.”</span></p>
<p>Rae Cousins, a Democrat who is running unopposed this November to represent House District 79 where the casino would be located, said in an email that &#8220;in reviewing all of the radio snippets that have been released, I absolutely condemn these statements and adamantly stand against all forms of discrimination, hatred and divisiveness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No matter where people stand on this or any political issue, we must agree that these kind of attacks have no place in our community,&#8221; she wrote.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Shots at Kaine’s family life</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recordings also include sharp criticism by Hughes, Brown and Flowers of Tim Kaine, one of Virginia’s two U.S. senators and previously state governor, mayor of Richmond and a member of the city council. In one clip where Hughes and others discuss the removal of Confederate monuments from Richmond in 2020, the Urban One head said, “Tim Kaine might have wanted one on his front yard.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine </span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/local-news/richmond/senator-kaine-votes-no-to-one-casino-as-richmond-residents-gear-up-for-election-day/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voted against the casino in the 2021 referendum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a decision Hughes appears to have been referencing when she referred to the “damage that he had done.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He knows the pain of the Black people of the Southside of Richmond. And yet … he&#8217;s saying that it is better for a Black man to get drunk off some beer that he financed, some craft beer in a local brewery, than to have a job. How do you equate that?” she asked. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That comment appears to be in reference to a criticism levied by Brown against the former governor in the longer version of his remarks obtained by the Mercury. In the extended remarks, Brown castigated Kaine for selling beer and wine at a church fundraiser this summer, saying, “He don’t want you to gamble, but he want to sell beer and wine, and it’s OK. You see why I say some people talk out of both sides of their face?”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In yet another clip, Brown noted Kaine and his wife, Anne Holton, had </span><a href="https://richmondfreepress.com/news/2021/oct/14/kaine-holton-household-split-casino/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">disagreed on the casino issue in 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with Holton voting in favor of the proposal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Bible said, ‘When two come together and agree,’” he said. “Now how can those two live in the same household and not agree? So how can we have him representing us as a senator when he can’t even keep his own home together?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked about the remarks, Katie Stuntz, a spokesperson for Kaine, said Friday that the senator “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is attending a friend’s funeral and is unavailable for comment.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virginia is new to the casino business</h4>

	 </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s four other cities allowed to have casinos — Bristol, Danville, Portsmouth and Norfolk — have approved them without much drama.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been a different story in Richmond, where the proposed casino has occasionally inflamed longstanding racial fault lines.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="QfNM6u4Xb5"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/29/fifth-virginia-casino-could-be-in-the-cards-but-richmond-voters-still-divided/">Fifth Virginia casino could be in the cards, but Richmond voters still divided</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Fifth Virginia casino could be in the cards, but Richmond voters still divided&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/29/fifth-virginia-casino-could-be-in-the-cards-but-richmond-voters-still-divided/embed/#?secret=tCYkIfaaZo#?secret=QfNM6u4Xb5" data-secret="QfNM6u4Xb5" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the casino legalization bill was </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/02/05/after-gambling-interests-strike-a-deal-in-private-push-begins-for-casino-legalization-bill/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">being discussed in 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, some Black lawmakers in the General Assembly said they wanted at least some Black ownership of casinos in the industry rather than having Black people simply work in them. Urban One, which describes itself as “the largest local urban radio network” and a “leading voice speaking to Black America,” seemed to fit the bill when the company expressed interest in building a casino in Richmond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the project emerged in early 2021, it was described as America’s first and only Black-owned casino and pitched as a way to uplift South Richmond, an area in need of revitalization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state capital is overwhelmingly liberal and has had mostly Black political leadership for decades, but stark divides have persisted between the city’s wealthier, whiter areas and working-class Black neighborhoods that often feel left out of the city’s economic development efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Richmond voters rejected the first casino referendum two years ago, the lower-income minority neighborhoods closest to where the proposed casino would be built strongly supported the project. But opposition was high enough elsewhere in the city that it went down in defeat, sparking some criticism that white Richmond had scuttled a project Black Richmond wanted. Meanwhile, progressive activists who oppose the casino see themselves as fighting predatory gambling interests that drain money from the communities they seek to enter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed Richmond Grand Resort  and Casino on the ballot this year promises to create 1,300 jobs and generate $30 million in annual tax revenue. The “Black-owned” marketing has been largely dropped this year because Urban One is now pursuing the casino as a joint project with Churchill Downs, the horse racing and gambling enterprise that bought Virginia’s Colonial Downs racetrack last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vote on this year’s casino referendum is expected to be close, but it wasn’t immediately clear Friday what impact the disclosure of the audio clips might have on the vote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Hughes in one recording released by casino opponents insisted the issue “is not about the color of a person’s skin,” other clips reveal her repeatedly casting the casino debate in racial terms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In one clip, she </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">characterizes Black opponents of the casino and Black supporters as, respectively, &#8220;house n****** and field n******.&#8221; In another, she says, “We have got to connect our Black middle class with our Black downtrodden and realize that we are one and the same in the eyes of white folks. White folks do not care.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hughes and Flowers specifically called out two casino opponents, marijuana legalization and civil rights advocate Chelsea Higgs Wise and former City Council candidate Allan-Charles Chipman, in one segment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These are not white folk pulling up signs and flying planes around the city,” said Flowers. “They’re paying for it, but they’ve hired Black people to do that — self-hating Black people.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chipman </span><a href="https://twitter.com/MrLegacyJones/status/1720448146981949583" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hit back on X</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after the recordings were circulated, writing, “I am not a self-hating Black person as they called me. I am an exploitation-hating Black man that firmly believes Dr. King is right when he said ‘Racism, economic exploitation, and militarism are all tied together. You can’t get rid of one without getting rid of the other.’” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Nov. 7 looming, the clips make it clear that even the casino’s backers are unsure of what will happen Tuesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I spent $10 million is what the final bill looks like to keep it in Richmond. Such a waste. I am so mad at this opposition,” said Hughes in one recording. “Do you know how much good I could have done with $10 million that I had to pay to lawyers and accountants and lobbyists and make contributions to everybody I thought could influence?” </span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officials in Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration, including the de facto state Republican Party chief himself, can’t get voting right in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest piece of evidence is the</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/10/29/youngkin-virginia-elections-voter-rolls/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">purging of nearly 3,400 citizens who</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as former felons, had had their voting rights restored. They were then incorrectly taken off the rolls because of probation violations and then belatedly reinstated.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Voting rights advocates blast Youngkin admin over error affecting 3,400&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/01/voting-rights-advocates-blast-youngkin-admin-over-error-affecting-3400/embed/#?secret=2EHNEvjvph#?secret=3cikD6oHqK" data-secret="3cikD6oHqK" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Elections announced the newest developments Oct. 27, as early voting continued for all 140 state House of Delegates and Senate contests leading up to Tuesday, Election Day. The results will determine whether Youngkin can impose an agenda that includes limiting most abortions after 15 weeks in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">True, 3,400 people out of</span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/media/registration-statistics/2023/10/oct-pdfs/Daily_Registrant_Count_By_Locality_2023_11_01_053558.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">6.12 million registered voters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Virginia is a tiny percentage. The margin of victory for state House candidates in 2021, however, was razor-thin in several contests. More on that later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Elections earlier in October (also known as ELECT) had originally</span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-10-10/virginia-democrats-us-congress-voter-elect-attorney-general" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">said at least 275 voters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had been affected by the snafu. Staffers culled the former felons from the rolls after they removed people who committed new felonies after their rights had been restored.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This already has had a chilling effect on voting,” Shawn Weneta, policy and advocacy strategist at the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia, told me this week. He’s a onetime felon whose rights were restored under then-Gov. Ralph Northam.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People have gone and tried to vote [early] and been turned away,” Weneta added. “It’s an equity issue.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would anyone be surprised if, after Election Day, officials discovered </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">even more</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than 3,400 people had been affected?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginians who have faced problems include Eric Wardell, who</span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-10-25/youngkin-mcdermid-virginia-inspector-general-investigate-voter-roll-removals" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">VPM News reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had petitioned Arlington County twice for reinstatement after being unable to register to vote there, even though his rights had been restored in 2019. Wardell later told the outlet he learned he’d been added to the voter rolls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another was Nathaniel Hill, 59, who spoke at a news conference Wednesday in Richmond. “I paid $3,300 in taxes last year,” Hill said. “If you can accept my tax money, then you can restore my rights,” reported the</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/11/01/voting-rights-advocates-blast-youngkin-admin-over-error-affecting-3400/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Mercury’s Graham Moomaw</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin has ordered the state inspector general to investigate the removals. The problem, though, is that they occurred in the first place. Congressional Democrats from Virginia have</span><a href="https://bobbyscott.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/bobbyscott.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2023.10.30-doj-letter-copy.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">asked U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland to probe the issue, too</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bumbling from the current state administration speaks volumes concerning Youngkin’s overheated claims about voting when he was on the campaign trail in 2021 and what he’s actually done while in office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said back then that elections – though run well in the commonwealth –</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/11/10/maybe-now-we-can-lay-the-election-integrity-talk-to-rest/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">deserved greater scrutiny</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He participated in a discredited</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/08/12/28460/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“election integrity” rally in Lynchburg</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He played coy during the GOP nominating process about whether</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/11/10/maybe-now-we-can-lay-the-election-integrity-talk-to-rest/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">he believed Joe Biden had won the 2020 presidential election</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Youngkin was inaugurated in early 2022, though, he and other officials have overseen a share of electoral problems. The governor also has helped worsen one of the nation’s most rigid and</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2016/05/02/roger-chesley-politics-cant-obscure-the-right-thing-to-do/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">discriminatory policies of rights restoration for felons</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He could’ve endorsed a constitutional amendment that would’ve allowed automatic restoration of voting and other civil rights. (It had passed the General Assembly in 2021 and needed to pass a second time before going to Virginians in a referendum.) Instead,</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/03/31/youngkin-seeks-the-will-of-the-people-but-only-when-its-politically-convenient/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin stayed mute</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and House Republicans –</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/03/03/republicans-fall-in-line-against-final-push-to-expand-felon-voting-rights-in-virginia/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">newly in charge in 2022</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – killed the bill in a subcommittee.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/03/23/youngkin-administration-now-requires-felons-to-apply-to-get-their-voting-rights-back/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">His administration forced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> people seeking a return of those rights to apply, rather than automatically restoring them. The</span><a href="https://www.wvtf.org/news/2023-10-06/virginia-lawsuit-over-voting-rights-restoration-clears-early-hurdle" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">opaqueness of the process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including the criteria for restoration, led to </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/voting-rights-felons-restoration-virginia-naacp-youngkin-0392d38300c1e771d1190dc04a16d025#:~:text=(AP)%20%E2%80%94%20The%20Virginia%20NAACP,who%20have%20completed%20their%20sentences." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lawsuits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Susan Beals, Youngkin’s elections commissioner, then pulled Virginia out of</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-joins-republican-states-pulling-out-of-multi-state-voter-list-program/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a formerly uncontroversial, multistate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program to share accurate voter rolls. The departure came even after a high-ranking state lawyer assigned to handle election issues by Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares defended the usefulness of the Electronic Registration Information Center, or ERIC. The commonwealth had been a charter member in 2012.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/05/18/quitting-multistate-voter-data-program-plays-into-conspiracy-theorists-hands/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I wrote earlier this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Virginia’s decision to leave the program followed unhinged complaints by conspiracy theorists and some politicians. Several states with Republican leaders left the compact. Yet as I write this,</span><a href="https://ericstates.org/about/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">ERIC still lists 24 states and the District of Columbia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as members.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia announced in September</span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/news-releases/virginia-signs-agreements-with-six-states-as-part-of-improvements-to-accuracy-of-voter-list.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">it has signed data-sharing agreements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with five states and D.C. “Virginia now updates our voter list using data coming directly from one-to-one data sharing agreements with neighboring states and partnerships with state and federal agencies,” the Department of Elections announcement read.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The self-congratulatory tone, however, can’t mask the fact Virginia is reinventing a wheel that wasn’t broken. Or that the number of states in the new compact is far fewer than ERIC’s total.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back to the narrow results in the House of Delegates’ elections in 2021:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Democratic Party officials have pointed out their candidates lost several close contests that year. A few included the 91</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> District (94 votes), 85</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> District (115 votes) and 63</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rd</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> District (512 votes). They want to make sure everybody who can vote has the ability to do so and no one is disenfranchised.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of “election integrity,” Youngkin and his crew should pursue “election competence.” With this administration, that’s been lacking – especially with so much at stake at the polls.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This marks the longest period of time (mid-session) that the House has ever gone without a Speaker. This rudderlessness in our most powerful governing body would be deeply concerning at any time, but we are currently facing multiple international crises, which highlights the global impact of our democracy’s failing health. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter what you think the United States’ role in the ongoing conflicts should be, we can generally agree that a functioning government is needed to respond effectively. And our government has been unable to move forward on any response so far.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(It didn’t have to be this hard. While our legislature was leaderless, Canada’s House of Commons replaced their Speaker quickly using ranked choice voting.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How did we get here? </span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/americans-are-widely-pessimistic-about-the-state-of-democracy-in-the-u-s-ap-norc-poll-finds" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most Americans agree</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the health of our democracy is in decline. Some reminisce about the “good old days” of Ronald Reagan and Tip O’Neill and civil discourse. They remember when the two parties had disagreements, but weren’t necessarily disagreeable, with conversations being far more productive than they are today. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several things have changed since the Reagan administration which have exacerbated this division –  gerrymandering, tribalism, social media  – but one of the biggest is that legislators typically aren’t incentivized to come together. There’s no motivation to solve the problem,  not when the same conflicts can be used for fundraising fodder in the next election.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not a big leap to trace much of this backwards incentive structure. Unite America talks about </span><a href="https://primaryproblem.uniteamerica.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Primary Problem</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or “how a small minority of voters wind up deciding the vast majority of US House in partisan primary elections.” The current winner-take-all approach to primaries allows divisive, polarizing candidates to win the nomination in non-competitive districts and thereby get elected while only being accountable to a small fraction of voters on their party’s flank. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://fairvote.org/report/the-motion-to-vacate-and-electoral-incentives/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to FairVote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 6 out of the 8 House members who ousted Former Speaker Kevin McCarthy were first nominated </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">without</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the majority of voter support. Ringleader Matt Gaetz was nominated with only 36% of the primary vote. He can be disruptive without repercussions because the majority of voters in his district have no mechanism by which to hold him accountable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By requiring majority support from voters in order to win an election, ranked-choice voting prevents polarizing candidates from getting elected. There’s no guarantee, but if 36% is your ceiling, you’re not headed to Congress under a ranked-choice voting system.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://upvoteva.org/blog/9-things-to-know-about-ranked-choice-voting" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ranked-choice voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is set up to elect candidates who build consensus and seek solutions. It restores the incentive structure that rewards compromise, conversation and nuance. It would produce the kinds of leaders who could look at the daunting situations in Europe, Asia and the Middle East and put their heads together to parse these complicated conflicts. It elects the kinds of leaders we need at this pivotal point in our own history. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working on democracy reforms like ranked-choice voting can sometimes feel abstract or merely academic, but it’s times like these that expose a desperate need for a new way to select and motivate our leaders and illustrate the global impact of our efforts. </span><a href="https://upvoteva.org/blog/benefits-ranked-choice-voting-virginians" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here in Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we see adopting RCV in party primaries and in local elections as a practicable and concrete step toward progress in this regard. We&#8217;ve found that the more people learn about RCV, the more people like it, and we’ll keep working to make these changes in the coming months.</span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nathaniel Hill, a 59-year-old truck driver and Marine veteran from Southside Virginia, gets particularly frustrated when he thinks about how much he has to pay to the government that accidentally took away his ability to vote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I paid $3,300 in taxes last year,” Hill said. “If you can accept my tax money, then you can restore my rights. We don’t want taxation without representation. … I work hard just like the next person.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hill — one of an estimated 3,400 Virginians with felony convictions who erroneously had their voter registrations canceled when Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration took a stricter approach to cleaning up the voter rolls — traveled to Richmond from his home in Southampton County to blast Youngkin over the voting rights ordeal he and others have been through.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is not a glitch,” Hill said as he spoke at the bell tower on Capitol Square Wednesday, explaining that he just now got a letter telling him he’s eligible to vote again after being told he was ineligible late last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, the Virginia Department of Elections announced state and local officials had reinstated the voter registrations of almost everyone believed to be affected by what the Youngkin administration has described as an administrative error.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Virginia’s system, people convicted of felonies lose their power to vote and, once released from incarceration, can only get it back if the governor restores their voting rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem revealed this year arose, according to state officials, as the elections department attempted to fix a related problem in the voter system that was preventing people who re-offended after having their rights restored from being taken off the voter rolls as they should’ve been. However, the felony conviction data from the Virginia State Police that was powering those removals included not only felony convictions, but also the names of people with probation violations. It was that group that was erroneously removed when there should’ve been no change to their voting status.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The elections department, run by Youngkin-appointed Commissioner Susan Beals, is indicating the issue is now resolved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Impacted voters are receiving written notification that their registration has been reinstated and those voters will be able to vote in the November general election,” the agency said Friday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to Wednesday’s event, Youngkin spokesperson Macaulay Porter said the governor “has consistently stated all eligible voters should be able to vote.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voting rights advocates aren’t so sure about that, pointing out Wednesday that the explanations coming from the governor’s representatives, as well as the numbers on how many registrations were wrongly canceled, have changed over time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It started at &#8216;there&#8217;s not a problem,” said Shawn Weneta, a policy strategist for the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia. “And then it changed to &#8216;it&#8217;s a small problem, it&#8217;s only 270 but not much more.&#8217; And we find out a few weeks later on a Friday evening that it&#8217;s more than 10 times as many.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weneta also said the notices being sent to impacted voters are deficient because they don’t fully explain what happened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was not an admission of fault. It was not an apology that we stripped you of your constitutional rights,” Weneta said. “It was simply a registration form saying you&#8217;ve been added to the voter rolls. It was incredibly confusing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin has asked the state inspector general’s office to investigate the issue, but Democrats in Virginia’s congressional delegation have called on the U.S. Department of Justice to look into what happened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The extent of the issue and the thoroughness of the fix may not be fully known until Tuesday, when voters will be going to the polls in a pivotal election that will decide which party controls the General Assembly’s two legislative chambers next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For any would-be voters who show up and discover an issue with their status, there’s a backstop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Virginia’s relatively new same-day registration rule, potential voters who don’t register prior to Election Day or whose status is uncertain can cast a provisional ballot that will ultimately be counted if election officials can verify the voter’s eligibility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advocates at Wednesday’s news conference reiterated their calls for a constitutional amendment that would eliminate the gubernatorial power to restore voting rights and have those rights be automatically restored once an offender serves their time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We all are here today to ask for accountability, for transparency and a process that removes this process from the hands of one individual,” said Sheba Williams, the executive director of re-entry group Nolef Turns.</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><em><strong>By Chris McIsaac and Robert Melvin</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Democrats were in power in 2020, Virginia </span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/media/electionadministration/electionlaw/2020-Changes-to-Virginia-Election-Laws.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">enacted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> one of the longest early voting periods </span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/early-in-person-voting" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">of any state</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Now, Governor Glenn Youngkin and GOP candidates for the Virginia legislature are seeking to capitalize on this law to propel themselves to a Republican trifecta of state government control by urging supporters to lock in their votes before Election Day. With key legislative majorities on the line, Virginia has become a national model for how Republicans hope to use early voting to win competitive elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans kicked off their effort to encourage early voting in Virginia’s 2023 legislative election back in </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meetthepressblog/virginia-gov-glenn-youngkin-launches-program-boost-gop-early-voting-rcna93569" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">July</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the launch of the Secure Your Vote Virginia campaign. This get-out-the-vote (GOTV) initiative will also serve as a trial run for a national</span><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/republicans-launch-new-effort-boost-early-voting-breaking/story?id=99908627" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">effort launched</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">by the Republican National Committee (RNC) to promote</span><a href="https://thehill.com/latino/4225368-gop-launches-spanish-language-early-voting-campaign/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">early voting</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in the 2024 presidential campaign. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early voting has become popular in Virginia since lawmakers extended the time period to 45 days and approved no-excuse absentee voting </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+HB1#:~:text=Permits%20any%20registered%20voter%20to,other%20sections%20of%20the%20Code." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. While the pandemic drove nearly </span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/media/formswarehouse/maintenance-reports/PostElectionReport_FinalRevised_211001.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">60%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of voters to submit their ballots early or by mail in 2020, voters have continued the trend in the two post-pandemic general elections under the new rules. Rather than return to pre-pandemic levels – where </span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/media/formswarehouse/maintenance-reports/Post-Election-Report-November-2019-with-Appendixes.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">less than 10%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of ballots were cast early – roughly </span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/media/formswarehouse/maintenance-reports/2022-Post-Election-Report_FINAL.3.3.2022.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one-third</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of voters cast their ballots in advance of Election Day in 2021 and 2022. It’s a shock to no one: when campaigns promote early voting, more individuals take advantage of the practice. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campaigns with limited campaign funds available for GOTV efforts need to maximize the impact of every dollar. By encouraging routine voters to submit ballots early, GOTV dollars can be used to target less reliable or undecided voters — a much more prudent use of funds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increased early voting also benefits the voters as well. Voting from home or in-person before Election Day offers many voters, who are already struggling to balance work and family obligations, more flexible and convenient options. It also helps those who prefer to vote on Election Day by contributing to </span><a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/download/?file=/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/The-2018-Votin-Experience.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shorter lines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the polls.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, many Republicans have become wary of early voting; despite</span><a href="https://www.eitanhersh.com/uploads/7/9/7/5/7975685/effectslaws_062923.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> finding no meaningful impact on election outcomes, the perception that early voting benefits Democrats over Republicans persists. But it’s just not true: Look no further than the Virginia elections in 2021 held just months after the voting reforms went into effect. Rather than helping to cement Democratic power in Richmond,</span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/graphics/USA-ELECTION/VIRGINIA/gkplgdmzavb/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Glenn Youngkin prevailed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over Terry McAuliffe and Republicans</span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/electionresults/20211102/house/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">flipped 7 seats</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to regain control of the House of Delegates. And, obviously, with more power in the statehouse comes the ability to shape policy in the years ahead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That ability to inform future policy around the mechanics of early voting will be critical as its utilization continues to increase. For example, Virginia election officials are allowed to begin </span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/table-16-when-absentee-mail-ballot-processing-and-counting-can-begin" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">processing mail ballots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as they are received. This includes things like verifying signatures and removing ballots from envelopes, allowing for greater efficiency when the actual tabulation begins on election day, which inspires confidence in our elections and reduces delayed results. Legislators in other states where election workers cannot process early votes as they are received, such as </span><a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2023/04/pennsylvania-elections-legislature-pre-canvassing-republicans/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pennsylvania</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.wisn.com/article/wisconsin-gop-bill-proposal-process-absentee-ballots-before-elections/45328976" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wisconsin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, are looking to follow Virginia’s lead by implementing changes to allow for some period of pre-processing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pre-processing is just one example of early voting policies that will be fine-tuned in the coming years, particularly as the practice grows in popularity. By focusing on achieving victory under the state’s existing early voting rules, Virginia Republicans are increasing the odds of being in a position to inform these essential debates and leading a path forward for other states to adopt similar practices.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s off-year legislative races have long attracted national attention because poll watchers view them as a bellwether of how the electorate may lean in congressional and presidential contests. This year has an added layer of interest: Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin has long flirted with the idea of a presidential run, and the outcome of the election will make it clear how viable his prospects are. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With races tight in roughly a dozen disputed districts, </span><a href="https://www.dailypress.com/2023/10/30/as-election-day-draws-near-virginia-candidates-attack-ads-are-getting-nastier/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">campaigning has turned unusually nasty</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a state where politicians tend to pride themselves on their gentility. The latest campaign finance reports filed by candidates ahead of Nov. 7 show the parade of attack ads is being fueled by record amounts of cash — a situation made possible by Virginia’s lax laws, which put few limits on election fundraising or spending.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s four takeaways from the Oct. 30 reports, </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/money/raw-reports/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">as published by the Virginia Public Access Project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Democrats outraised Republicans in the final election stretch, especially in the House, but both parties are throwing around enormous amounts of cash </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest figures from VPAP, which cover funds raised between Oct. 1 and Oct. 26, show Democrats outraising Republicans, particularly in the House, with thinner margins between the parties’ hauls in the Senate.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Altogether, VPAP data on the Senate races shows Democrats took in $12.7 million to the GOP’s $10.6 million. For House campaigns, Democrats netted $14.2 million and Republicans $8.4 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While both chambers are in play this year, the Senate is seen as more crucial to both parties because it is currently the last bastion of Democratic control in state government. If Republicans can flip it, they will achieve the coveted trifecta of power; if Democrats can keep it, they can continue to block what they consider the most objectionable Republican proposals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the October fundraising is concentrated where you’d expect: in the big swing races. According to VPAP numbers, in the </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/10/19/senate-district-31-race-republican-juan-pablo-segura-vs-democrat-russet-perry/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loudoun- and Fauquier-based Senate District 31</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Democrat Russet Perry took in almost $2.7 million, while Republican Juan Pablo Segura got $2.1 million. In </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/10/10/senate-district-16-race-democrat-vanvalkenburg-vs-republican-incumbent-dunnavant/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate District 16 in the Richmond suburbs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Democratic Del. Schuyler VanValkenburg raised $2.2 million to Republican Sen. Siobhan Dunnavant’s $1.9 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the House races, VPAP shows Democrats netted the seven highest fundraising amounts of the period, led by former Del. Josh Cole in </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/10/12/house-district-65-race-democrat-cole-vs-republican-peters/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Fredericksburg-area House District 65</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ($2 million), Josh Thomas in </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/10/11/house-district-21-race-republican-stirrup-vs-democrat-thomas/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prince William County’s House District 21</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ($1.8 million) and Michael Feggans in the </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/09/21/house-district-97-democrat-feggans-vs-incumbent-republican-greenhalgh/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Beach-based House District 97</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ($1.4 million). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also notable: Money for Democratic House candidate Susanna Gibson has majorly slowed since the news that </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/09/11/susanna-gibson-sex-website-virginia-candidate/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">she performed sex acts online</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> broke in early September. According to VPAP reports, Gibson only took in $211,000 between Oct. 1 and Oct. 26. She previously raised nearly $489,000</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in September.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> However, in the latest period she still outraised her Republican opponent, David Owen, who took in nearly $190,000 in October. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The amounts of money that have flowed into this year’s elections are huge</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year&#8217;s races could prove <a href="https://www.vpap.org/visuals/visual/general-assembly-cash-and-amount-raised-oct-30/" target="_blank">to be Virginia’s most expensive yet</a>. </span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="RhS9o3aRHm"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/07/11/millions-funneled-into-virginia-primaries-reignite-calls-for-campaign-finance-reform/">Millions funneled into Virginia primaries reignite calls for campaign finance reform</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between Oct. 1 and Oct. 26, VPAP data shows General Assembly candidates </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/money/raw-reports/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised nearly $46 million</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">— $23.4 million for Senate races and $22.6 million for House races</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That’s on top of the summer and early fall fundraising hauls and the more than <a href="https://www.vpap.org/elections/senate/candidates/primary/" target="_blank">$28 million spent on the June Senate primaries</a> and $8.5 million <a href="https://www.vpap.org/elections/house/candidates/primary/" target="_blank">spent on the House primaries</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, the money isn’t slowing. </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/updates/4681-large-pre-election-donations-20231031/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday alone</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Virginia Senate Democratic Caucus gave $384,000 to Del. Clint Jenkins, who is fighting against Republican Del. Emily Brewer to represent </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/10/24/senate-district-17-race-democrat-jenkins-vs-republican-brewer/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Hampton Roads- and Southside-based Senate District 17</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. On the same day, Youngkin’s Spirit of Virginia PAC gave $675,000 to a handful of Republican candidates. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Two of the biggest donors are Youngkin&#8217;s PAC and Clean Virginia </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the right, VPAP shows that Youngkin’s Spirit of Virginia PAC is one of the biggest spenders of the period, routing $690,000 to </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/09/19/senate-district-24-race-republican-diggs-vs-incumbent-democrat-mason/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">former Poquoson and York County Sheriff Danny Diggs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, $600,000 to </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/10/20/senate-district-27-race-republican-durant-vs-democrat-griffin-vs-independent-gary/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Tara Durant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, $529,000 to Dunnavant, $300,000 to Segura, $265,000 to </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/10/09/house-district-82-race-democrat-adams-vs-republican-incumbent-taylor/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Kim Taylor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and $250,000 to former Prince William County Supervisor </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/10/11/house-district-21-race-republican-stirrup-vs-democrat-thomas/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Stirrup</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, among others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clean Virginia, the Charlottesville-based group founded by millionaire Michael Bills to counter Dominion Energy’s influence in the General Assembly, gave $200,000 each to Democrats Perry, VanValkenburg, Feggans, Thomas and Travis Nembhard, who is vying for Northern Virginia’s House District 22. The organization also doled out smaller donations to numerous other candidates, most of whom were Democrats. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clean Virginia and Dominion were the </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/07/11/millions-funneled-into-virginia-primaries-reignite-calls-for-campaign-finance-reform/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two biggest spenders in this year’s primary elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, collectively contributing over $12 million to campaigns. Dominion’s PAC has continued to make large donations over the past month, mostly in the $10,000 to $75,000 range. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Richmond’s casino referendum is also drawing big money </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to VPAP data, Urban One and Churchill Downs have raised over $9 million </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/09/29/fifth-virginia-casino-could-be-in-the-cards-but-richmond-voters-still-divided/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to convince Richmond voters they want the Richmond Grand Resort and Casino</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after a 2021 referendum failed to get enough support for the proposal. If they can squeak out a win this cycle, Virginia will be on track to get its fifth casino after the General Assembly in 2020 passed a law allowing five cities to hold referenda on the issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The companies’ Richmond Wins, Vote Yes campaign took in almost $1.2 million this October, much of it in in-kind expenditures by Urban One and Churchill Downs that added to an initial investment of more than $8 million. Construction and trades groups also raised nearly $200,000 in support of the proposal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anti-casino efforts, including the No Means No Casino campaign and the Richmond Anti-Corruption League, raised roughly $220,000 in opposition. </span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce / For the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has been three years since we won early voting rights across the commonwealth, and for working folks everywhere, we finally have more options for how we use our power to vote every year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not always so easy for working people to vote on Election Day, and having the option to vote early means that we are able to make a plan to vote that we can actually follow through on. As a psychiatric nurse for Loudoun County, I wasn’t always able to leave work on time to vote on Election Day due to emergencies, staff shortages, or untimely issues, and that meant missing out on making sure the right people were elected to fight for the things that mattered to me and my community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve lived in Virginia for 32 years now; I’ve seen 32 years of election cycles. I can tell you, politically, nothing good happens in Virginia by accident. That’s why I vote and, most importantly, that’s why I knock on doors every year (last year alone, I knocked on over 700 doors): to remind folks to make a plan to vote and even better yet, to go vote early before Election Day. We are the reason good things happen here, because we make a plan to vote and we follow through on that plan, year after year, election after election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I care about getting people to vote because we cannot be effective as a community, as working families, and as a union if we do not have legislators who work for us. Every single aspect of our lives is touched by the General Assembly – from workers’ rights to gun safety laws, to voting access, to women’s healthcare, and education for our children. When we vote for and elect champions for workers and families, and when we hold them accountable, we are able to make a difference in people’s everyday lives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For years, my co-workers and I came together in Loudoun County to vote for and elect leaders who would ensure that we finally have the same collective bargaining rights that public employees have in 47 other states. Now, we are on the cusp of being able to bargain our first contract for good union jobs and quality public services for all people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We don’t want to lose all of that hard work and go back to a time when we didn’t have that right. When working people vote, working people win! I’m excited for another election this November, and for another opportunity to go vote early for those candidates who will make sure all working people have the right to bargain for a better future. </span></p>

Wade. (Kate Masters/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During Virginia’s 2021 election, former Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe warned that Texas’ push to ban almost all abortions could spread across the country unless states took action to protect abortion rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That note of alarm two years ago didn’t resonate with voters as much as McAuliffe wanted. He lost to Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican who mockingly said McAuliffe was running to be an “abortion governor” instead of a “jobs governor.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But one big part of McAuliffe’s prediction came true. As he said it might, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, clearing the way for states to pass sweeping abortion bans and infusing Virginia’s abortion debate with new energy and significance. Since the fall of Roe, Youngkin has marched with anti-abortion activists in Richmond and rallied the Virginia GOP behind </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1385" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a proposal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to restrict abortion access after 15 weeks of pregnancy.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Youngkin vows to &#8216;protect life&#8217; as Supreme Court overturns right to abortion&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/06/24/youngkin-vows-to-protect-life-as-supreme-court-overturns-right-to-abortion/embed/#?secret=7Fya1KcZmB#?secret=bNprpb67a5" data-secret="bNprpb67a5" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With control of the Virginia General Assembly up for grabs next month, that changed political dynamic has Democrats hoping voters want to punish Republicans over the rollback of abortion access that would arrive in Virginia if Youngkin’s party wins majorities in the state Senate and the House of Delegates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key difference between 2021 and 2023, according to Jamie Lockhart, executive director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia, is that the loss of the constitutional right to abortion is no longer a hypothetical concern. No matter how hard Republicans try to finesse their way out of an unpopular position, she said, abortion rights supporters are “fired up” to cast their ballots accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People will see that a ban is a ban,” Lockhart said. “And that politicians can&#8217;t run away from their decades of anti-abortion votes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A strong Democratic performance on Nov. 7, when all 140 Virginia General Assembly seats are on the ballot, would end the GOP’s dream of completing a Youngkin-led revival of conservative power in a state that’s gone blue in every presidential election since 2008. Republicans winning full control would likely boost Youngkin’s profile as a rising Republican leader charting a new path through some of his party’s toughest political branding problems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both the Virginia Senate, where Democrats have a 22-18 majority, and the House, where Republicans had a 52-48 majority prior to a wave of post-session resignations, are closely divided enough that both parties have realistic shots at winning one or both chambers. In light of that highly competitive atmosphere, Virginia’s abortion-centered election cycle has drawn national attention as the next test of how long the </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/26/us/politics/democrats-special-elections-biden.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">string of post-Roe special election wins for Democrats</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> around the country will continue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a recent press call organized by the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, Democratic strategist Tom Bonier said Virginia’s early voting data shows strong engagement by Democratic voters, but all signs point to a “very close election.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Since Dobbs, we&#8217;ve seen this Democratic overperformance that&#8217;s been fairly consistent,” Bonier said, referring to last summer’s Supreme Court decision that scrapped the Roe precedent and empowered red states to pass strict abortion bans.</span></p>
<p><b>‘What they’re selling is not true’</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans, who have the newfound advantage of a decently popular governor raising millions to support their statehouse candidates, aren’t exactly ducking the abortion fight. They’re arguing aggressively that a 15-week cutoff — with exceptions for cases of rape and incest and to protect the life of the mother — is a middle-ground position closer to the laws in many socially liberal European countries than it is to the draconian proposal portrayed in Democratic ads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin and his allies hope their abortion messaging, which the governor’s PAC is pushing in a </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/youngkins-pac-sets-1-4-million-ad-push-on-abortion-issue/article_2256a7ce-678c-11ee-93e8-1b49cbbcb646.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1.4 million ad campaign</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, can mute the swing-district backlash and prevent the 15-week proposal from becoming a dealbreaker for voters also concerned about the economy, crime and other issues more favorable for their party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There&#8217;s a reason why this is the only note they&#8217;re hitting,” House Speaker Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, said of the barrage of Democratic ads on abortion. “But they keep having to run up against the fact that what they&#8217;re selling is not true.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For weeks, Republican operatives have cried foul over Democratic ads they say attempt to mislead voters into believing Virginia Republicans are pushing for a complete abortion ban with no exceptions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In one example from a competitive Senate race in the Fredericksburg area, Democratic candidate Joel Griffin ran an ad accusing Del. Tara Durant, R-Fredericksburg, of backing an abortion ban without exceptions that would “force a 10-year-old rape victim to carry to term.” Durant, who says she supports a rape exception, called the ad “brazen fearmongering” and noted the Griffin campaign’s citation for its claim was a </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/TaraDurantVA/posts/393279066173500/?paipv=0&amp;eav=AfboKLSQC9e3WrLhlRfKKbsZld-Xq587IEqE9IR4MPJpSHLe1WNNDamy60j0VUrfr44&amp;_rdr" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in which she praised the fall of Roe as “a great day for life” but said nothing about child rape victims.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abortion-rights supporters say there’s good reason to be distrustful of the GOP’s newly moderate tone on abortion, given the numerous </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/08/10/abortion-ban-virginia-elections-stirrup/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">examples</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of staunchly anti-abortion comments Republican figures have made in more unguarded moments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;ve seen across the South and across the country what happens when Republicans get a majority. They don&#8217;t just institute a ban, they become more punitive over time,” said Del. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, who’s trying to flip a key GOP-held district represented by Sen. Siobhan Dunnavant, R-Henrico. “Maybe it starts at 15 weeks and becomes six weeks.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a GOP rally in battleground Henrico County this week, Youngkin said he’s been specific about what he and his party will support and thinks people are “ready to move on and talk about topics besides abortion.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They are all about no limits,” Youngkin said of the Democratic Party. “We are for reasonable limits. And we&#8217;ve been wholly clear on what we want to do. I think the other side is really trying to sell disinformation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican leaders have pushed back on claims the 15-week proposal they’re campaigning on might not actually reflect their true position.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;ve been asked would I sign a different bill,” Youngkin said. “No. That&#8217;s the bill that I&#8217;m going to sign.”</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/10/20/abortion-virginia-election-poll-youngkin-approval/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public polling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on abortion in Virginia has consistently shown that most voters don’t support sweeping new restrictions. But when asked specifically about the 15-week proposal, voters are closer to an even split.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For that reason, Virginia’s abortion debate partly comes down to a semantic battle over the poll-tested word “ban.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic candidates say it’s a perfectly valid term to apply to Youngkin’s proposal, because some abortions that are legal in Virginia today would become illegal if the governor’s bill becomes law. As the last Southern state that hasn’t passed more restrictive abortion laws after Roe was overturned, abortion-rights advocates say any winnowing of access in Virginia will also affect women in nearby states who might consider coming here for procedures no longer available to them at home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans insist the term “ban” is an inaccurate description of a law that would keep abortion legal during the first four months of pregnancy, when the overwhelming majority of abortions occur, while allowing several exceptions beyond that point.</span></p>
<p><b>‘A firm law that should not be touched’</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Democratic candidates in competitive races have said they support keeping the state’s abortion laws as they are and/or enshrining the right to an abortion in the Virginia Constitution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the DLCC call, multiple Democratic lawmakers emphasized that they didn’t push for a broad overhaul of Virginia’s abortion laws when they had full control of the statehouse in 2020 and 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We wrote a firm law that should not be touched,” said Sen. Monty Mason, D-Williamsburg, who’s trying to hold off a challenge from Republican Danny Diggs, the former sheriff of York County and the city of Poqouson.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats used their period of majority power to </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/01/29/virginia-lawmakers-vote-to-repeal-mandatory-ultrasound-waiting-period-for-abortion/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">repeal some abortion rules</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like mandatory ultrasounds and waiting periods but didn’t push to lift the ban on third-trimester abortions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike other states, where activists have led referendum efforts to let voters weigh in on abortion rights, Virginia’s system requires all constitutional amendments to originate with the General Assembly. Once the legislature passes a proposed amendment two years in a row, it then goes on the ballot for a final up-or-down vote by regular Virginians.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Their side&#8217;s campaigning on a ban,” said Del. Danica Roem, D-Prince William, who’s running in a competitive state Senate race in Northern Virginia against Republican Bill Woolf. “Our side is campaigning on a statewide referendum to the people: ‘Do you want to codify the existing protections that we have?’”</span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The binary choices on offer in both parties’ talking points (ban vs. no ban, limits vs. no limits) gloss over the nuances of Virginia’s existing abortion laws, which already impose a time-based cutoff for routine procedures but allow late-term abortions when doctors determine there’s a compelling medical reason.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title18.2/chapter4/article9/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">current law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, abortion is largely unrestricted in the first and second trimesters but is only allowed in the third trimester, which starts at about 28 weeks, if three doctors agree continuing the pregnancy poses a serious threat to the woman’s life or health. Starting in the second trimester, abortions must be performed in licensed hospitals. Virginia law also requires patients under 18 to have written consent from an adult family member before an abortion, but judges can waive the consent rule if the minor objects due to abuse or other reasons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats in several battleground races have accused Republicans of wanting to jail doctors who perform abortions, and abortion-rights supporters say any tightening of the laws could have broader, chilling effects on doctors who may want to err on the side of caution. Performing abortions outside the bounds of Virginia’s current laws — which exist in a section of state code titled “Crimes and Offenses Generally” — is already punishable as a class 4 felony that can come with prison time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prosecutions of doctors under Virginia’s existing laws appear rare, but one high-profile case in the early 1980s received extensive media coverage and rose all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. In </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1982/06/20/the-doctor-the-law-and-a-landmark-case/8b5134ee-ef82-40af-b1fc-0f363995047d/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">that case</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Northern Virginia physician, Dr. Chris Simopoulos, was prosecuted after a 17-year-old girl who had been more than five months pregnant left an aborted fetus in a motel wastebasket two days after the doctor injected her with a saline solution at his clinic. Despite differing testimony over whether Simopoulos had or hadn’t instructed the teen to deliver the fetus under medical supervision, the doctor was convicted of performing a second-trimester abortion at a clinic instead of a hospital and sentenced to serve 30 days in jail. Both the Supreme Court of Virginia and the U.S. Supreme Court upheld that outcome after Simopoulos challenged the constitutionality of Virginia’s second-trimester rules.</span></p>
<p><b>‘This is about who makes decisions’</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats have been largely successful in turning the General Assembly races into a referendum on Youngkin’s 15-week proposal without getting into specifics about their counterpush to create a state-level constitutional right to abortion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The constitutional amendment’s backers portray it as a straightforward effort to block future erosion of abortion access in Virginia, but opponents argue it’s written so broadly it could invalidate existing abortion limits that many Democrats say they support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like the GOP’s 15-week bill, the Democratic-sponsored </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SJ255" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">amendment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been unable to pass the politically divided General Assembly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed amendment declares “every individual has the fundamental right to reproductive freedom” and says that right cannot be denied or infringed “unless justified by a compelling state interest and achieved by the least restrictive means that do not infringe an individual&#8217;s autonomous decision-making.” The state only has a valid interest in restricting abortion access, the amendment specifies, when a law is designed to “ensure the protection of the health of an individual seeking care, consistent with accepted clinical standards of practice and evidence-based medicine.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a committee hearing on the amendment earlier this year, Republican lawmakers said the amendment appears to leave no room for the concept of fetal viability. The now-defunct Roe decision only prevented abortion bans until viability, usually defined as beginning around 24 weeks, leaving states free to ban the procedure once a fetus has a significant chance of surviving outside the womb. After viability, the Roe decision said, states have an interest in “the potentiality of human life.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the amendment’s chief sponsors was former state senator turned U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond. After the amendment cleared the state Senate on a party-line vote,  a Republican-led House committee grilled McClellan on whether the proposal could invalidate laws like the third-trimester ban and parental consent rule.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her committee testimony, McClellan said third-trimester abortions are rare and typically only occur when something has gone “horribly wrong” with a pregnancy and the question of viability has become moot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is about who makes the decisions. And those decisions should be made by patients and their providers,” McClellan said, repeatedly emphasizing that abortion restrictions could still stand if deemed consistent with medical standards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked again if the amendment would create a right to abortion at any point in pregnancy, McClellan said: “I’m not going to give you a different answer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well I know what it sounds like,” replied Del. Wren Williams, R-Patrick. “It sounds like a yes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One high-profile Republican candidate this cycle says Youngkin’s bill doesn’t do enough to accommodate the difficult choices women and health-care providers have to make when something goes wrong late in pregnancy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dunnavant, a practicing OB/GYN running in a Democratic-friendly district that’s made her one of the most imperiled Republicans of the 2023 cycle, has </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/01/20/republican-senator-breaks-with-gop-to-oppose-15-week-abortion-bill-in-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said she can’t support a 15-week ban</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> without an additional exception allowing abortions in cases of severe fetal anomalies that leave no realistic chance of survival. At a recent press conference, Dunnavant said she pressed her own party to include that exception and feels it was a mistake to move forward without it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We all are beleaguered and fatigued by the extreme language around abortion,” Dunnavant said, specifying that includes extremism from her own side. “And I think people are worried. I think we need to find a way to go forward together.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, Republicans in Virginia and beyond accused Democrats of backing “infanticide” after debate over a </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/01/30/failed-legislation-loosening-restrictions-on-late-term-abortions-which-are-already-legal-in-some-cases-in-virginia-ignites-furor/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">failed Democratic bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would have lifted restrictions on second- and third-trimester abortions. In the third trimester, the bill would have allowed one doctor to verify the necessity of an abortion as opposed to three. It also would have lowered the bar for how severe the health threat needs to be to allow a third-trimester abortion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the ensuing furor over a video clip of the bill’s sponsor, Del. Kathy Tran, D-Fairfax, saying it would allow abortion up until birth if one doctor felt it was necessary, Democrats accused Republicans of recklessly demagoguing the issue despite third-trimester abortions already being legal under certain circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2019 abortion controversy didn’t stop Democrats from winning full control of the General Assembly later that year. But the party didn’t revive the bill in the ensuing two years of Democratic control when they might’ve had the numbers to pass it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the disappearance of the 2019 bill, Gilbert, the Republican House speaker, said the proposed constitutional amendment could have a similar effect of allowing “abortion at any point without any limitations.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gilbert said the fact that he and other conservative lawmakers are supporting a position that doesn’t necessarily align with their personal beliefs or the public’s views in the parts of Virginia they represent, “speaks volumes” about the seriousness of their effort to arrive at an abortion policy with broad support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Some of our candidates are adamantly pro-life but they understand that this is where Virginians are and they have embraced this legislative proposal as a basic framework of where we intend to be,” Gilbert said. “And I have been exceedingly clear that we will not go beyond it as long as I am speaker.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a national atmosphere that indicates Republicans are paying a political price over the shock of a conservative Supreme Court eliminating a right that had stood for 50 years, Virginia’s elections could swing on how many voters are buying GOP leaders’ assurances that they’re not interested in forcing the kind of sharp right turn on abortion Virginians would reject.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked about Gilbert’s comments, Lockhart, the Virginia Planned Parenthood leader, said the speaker “has voted to restrict abortion access dozens of times.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t trust him,” she said.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr">College-aged people are among the largest voting block, yet tend to have the lowest turnout in elections, according to Campus Vote Project Virginia coordinator Amber Wilt.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The group is a project of the Fair Elections Center and works to reduce barriers to student voting, according to its <a href="https://www.campusvoteproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.campusvoteproject.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1698234210569000&amp;usg=AOvVaw14o3cieMihIabygrllmTQL">website</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Just over 20% of voters ages 18-29 cast a ballot in Virginia’s midterm elections last year, according to <a href="https://circle.tufts.edu/latest-research/state-state-youth-voter-turnout-data-and-impact-election-laws-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://circle.tufts.edu/latest-research/state-state-youth-voter-turnout-data-and-impact-election-laws-2022&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1698234210569000&amp;usg=AOvVaw09fpWmL_eMM43ReifEU_w4">Tufts University</a>. The state with the highest voter turnout in that age group in 2022 was Michigan, with 36.5%.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Everyone has concerns, whether it’s political or not, and they all are impacted by their ballot,” Wilt said. “So I try to work with them a little bit to identify how their concerns can be shown on the ballot.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are two primary obstacles between college students and voting, according to Wilt.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“One is students not feeling like their vote matters and that it amounts to anything, and the other being that they just don’t really feel like they know enough about what’s up for election,” Wilt said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are definitely “unfortunate hurdles” that can get in the way of voting, according to Maria Reynoso, founder and executive director of We Vote VA. The group presents election information through digital content.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“At the same time, there are a lot of things happening in Virginia and across the country that could be motivating factors for people to really have their voice heard,” Reynoso said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Representatives should be more transparent and present more information online to help boost turnout among young voters, according to Reynoso.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Young people are motivated. They’re energized. They want to be involved,” Reynoso said. “I think we just have to do a better job at giving access, making electoral information more accessible to people.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">VCU Votes is a student coalition and a separate course, according to freshman Lucie Carberry, a student in the VCU Votes course. Students hosted an event Oct. 19 that mirrored a voting simulation to better prepare students for voting.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“A lot of college students have the problem of being embarrassed that they don’t know how to vote and they end up not voting because of the anxiety related to the embarrassment of actually voting,” Carberry said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Most Virginia universities have campus organizations to increase voter education and engagement, such URGOV at the University of Richmond, HoosVote at University of Virginia, and Marlins Vote at Virginia Wesleyan University.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“There are groups on campus that are dedicated to this, and I would say search and find those groups, or go to your political science faculty members,” said Carah Ong Whaley, academic program officer at the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics. “They’re going to be a really credible source of information if you don’t have a voting coalition on campus.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">College students face hurdles such as motivational and technical barriers when voting, Ong Whaley said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This isn’t necessarily the case in Virginia, but in other states, there’s just outright <a href="https://legislature.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/sessioninfo/2023/legislation/H0124.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://legislature.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/sessioninfo/2023/legislation/H0124.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1698234210569000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0SvAd53860yW6hAHRQ9RXF">attempts</a> to block young people from voting,” Ong Whaley said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia has increased access to voting in recent years.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Students can use their student ID to go vote, but they may not know that, and so helping inform them about how and demystifying the process of voting will help them get to the polls,” Ong Whaley said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Political parties can help make voting social, celebratory and communal. That is important, especially in a divisive environment, Ong Whaley said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Ask what you can do to improve your community the day after elections,” Ong Whaley said. “Especially this year when we’re talking about state and local elections, you know, these are really elections that impact our everyday lives as residents in Virginia, so it is really important to be a voter.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virginia college voter guide 2023</h4>

	
<p dir="ltr">Students may be confused about how to vote when away from home, especially after redistricting in 2021, according to Reynoso.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia’s redistricting may have changed a voter’s representatives or impacted the partisan lean of their district. Voters can check districts and potential changes on the Virginia General Assembly <a href="https://whosmy.virginiageneralassembly.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://whosmy.virginiageneralassembly.gov/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1698234210569000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1kY1Txc4eCFsSCHguH98iO">website</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Whether you’re in school, living in the district that you’re in right now, or going back home, local representation is what impacts you the most,” Reynoso said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">All 140 seats in the state’s General Assembly, which creates laws for all state residents, are open this election. There are 100 seats in the House of Delegates and 40 in the Senate.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are also over 2,300 candidates vying <a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/casting-a-ballot/candidate-list/2023-november-general-election---local-candidates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.elections.virginia.gov/casting-a-ballot/candidate-list/2023-november-general-election---local-candidates/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1698234210569000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0Yov0drAfujrFPpwwapLZz">for election</a> to local seats and positions such as mayor, school board, board of supervisors, treasurer, clerk of court, commonwealth attorney and sheriff.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Voting is important in all districts and races, according to Reynoso. Turnout can sway the outcome of races, some more than others. The Virginia Public Access Project ranks districts by leans Republican, strong Republican, leans Democratic, strong Democratic and competitive.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are 11 districts rated <a href="https://www.vpap.org/elections/house/vpap-index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.vpap.org/elections/house/vpap-index/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1698234210569000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2F-QASzIyHPt2NwXzK_6E6">competitive</a> by VPAP, and a handful of others that pundits consider too close to call.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. House Republicans on Wednesday voted for Louisiana’s Mike Johnson as speaker in a chamber that has been frozen for more than three weeks after former Speaker Kevin McCarthy was ousted.</p>
<p>In a 220-209 party-line vote, all Republicans present backed Johnson. All Democrats present voted for Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York.</p>
<p>Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik of New York nominated Johnson, 51, who represents his state’s 4th District, saying the conservative congressman “epitomizes what it means to be a leader.”</p>
<p>“Today is the day that House Republicans will humbly look in our hearts and elect Mike Johnson as speaker of the people’s House,” Stefanik said.</p>
<p>Democratic Conference Chair Pete Aguilar of California nominated Jeffries, calling him a “far contrast from who Republicans nominated.”</p>
<p>“The most pressing needs of everyday Americans are his North Star,” Aguilar said.</p>
<p>Johnson, who does not have a strong bipartisan track record, will be tasked with working with the Democratic-controlled Senate on a quickly approaching Nov.17 government funding deadline, and critical legislation such as the recent nearly $106 billion supplemental request from the Biden administration to fund Ukraine, Israel and global aid and U.S border security.</p>
<p>Johnson has voted against several recent bipartisan pieces of legislation such as the infrastructure law, a gun safety bill signed into law and the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.</p>
<p>Johnson was one of more than 100 House Republicans who voted to block Pennsylvania and Arizona’s 2020 presidential election results following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.</p>
<p>In advance of the joint session of Congress on Jan. 6 Johnson led a <a href="https://mikejohnson.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=715" target="_blank">statement</a> with 36 fellow Republicans outlining opposition to the Electoral College results in Georgia and Michigan as well.</p>
<p><em>This is a developing story that will be updated.</em></p>

<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. House Republicans Tuesday voted to tap Minnesota’s Tom Emmer as speaker following five rounds of ballots — but Emmer quit the race just four hours later, after he was attacked by the GOP’s most powerful figure, former President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>After beating six candidates, Emmer, the No. 3 Republican, faced an uphill battle to coalesce more than 20 hard-right Republican holdouts loyal to Trump, who took to social media shortly after the vote to warn that electing Emmer would be a “tragic mistake.”</p>
<p>“He never respected the Power of a Trump Endorsement, or the breadth and scope of MAGA,” Trump, also a 2024 candidate for president, wrote about Emmer on his site, Truth Social. “He is totally out-of-touch with Republican Voters.”</p>
<p>Emmer, 62, who represents a safe GOP district that includes parts of the western and northern Twin Cities suburbs, the city of St. Cloud and rural areas in between, had continued to meet with holdouts on Tuesday afternoon following the closed-door conference vote.</p>
<p>Emmer quickly left the meeting later Tuesday, dogging reporters chasing after him. He declined to comment before entering a black car. Lawmkers said he dropped out a short time later.</p>
<p>With Emmer out, Republicans will have to begin their nomination process anew and it was unclear how that would proceed.</p>
<p>Emmer would have had to get nearly all of the 221 Republican votes on the House floor, as all Democrats are expected to vote for Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. In the final secret ballot, Emmer earned 117 GOP votes, a long way from the 217 needed for the speaker’s gavel if all Republicans are present and voting.</p>
<p>In a roll call conference vote, again behind closed doors, on whether a member would support him on the floor, Emmer’s support grew to 186, according to several lawmakers in the meeting.</p>
<p>Several Republicans leaving Tuesday’s meeting, such as Reps. Steve Womack of Arkansas and Dusty Johnson of South Dakota, acknowledged that Emmer did not have the votes needed to become speaker, but still remained hopeful that Emmer could narrow that gap.</p>
<p>Womack said that because the conference had a roll call ballot, Emmer can see which Republicans were holdouts.</p>
<p>“I expect that Tom would want to meet with the individuals that are not calling his name and see if there is something he can say or do that could bring them around and help shore up their requisite 217,” Womack said. “If he can’t do that, then he’s got to make a decision as to whether he goes to the floor.”</p>
<p>Womack added that there are some members that will always be against Emmer, but he did not name them.</p>
<p>“What I just saw in that room illustrates to me that there are some people that are pretty well dug in and are not going to support the current designee,” he said.</p>
<p>For example, Georgia’s Rick Allen, had already stated he will never vote for Emmer because the Minnesota Republican voted<a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2022513" target="_blank"> to codify same-sex marriage, according to CNN.</a></p>
<p>Johnson said that Emmer was working on flipping those holdouts.</p>
<p>“People with concerns are coming forward, and he’s taking them head on,” Johnson said.</p>
<p>When asked how many members voted against Emmer in the roll call vote, Mike Waltz of Florida said “too many.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Third GOP nominee</h4>

	
<p>Emmer was the third Republican nominee for speaker.</p>
<p>The first, Louisiana’s Steve Scalise <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/scalise-drops-out-race-us-house-speaker" target="_blank">never brought his nomination for a floor vote</a> and the second, Ohio’s Jim Jordan, was <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2023/10/20/jim-jordan-again-rejected-in-bid-for-u-s-house-speaker-and-gop-struggles-to-regroup/" target="_blank">tossed aside</a> by the party after his third and final unsuccessful floor vote for the speaker’s gavel.</p>
<p>The House has been without a speaker for 21 days.</p>
<p>Emmer, who serves in GOP leadership as the Republican whip, had the endorsement of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, but would have had to court members and allies of the far-right House Freedom Caucus who are aligned closely with Trump.</p>
<p>On Monday, Emmer posted a video in which he said he has always “gotten along” with Trump, who is also the current GOP front-runner in the 2024 presidential election.</p>
<p>In a Monday campaign stop in New Hampshire, Trump was asked if he’d endorse Emmer. The former president said he’d “always gotten along with” Emmer, but said he was trying to allow House Republicans to choose their own leader.</p>
<p>Emmer posted <a href="https://twitter.com/GOPMajorityWhip/status/1716536001819017487" target="_blank">a video clip of the appearance to X</a>, saying as speaker, he would continue the pair’s “strong working relationship.”</p>
<p>However, by Tuesday, Trump had posted about his opposition to Emmer on his social media site.</p>
<p>Emmer was also one of the few candidates running for the speakership who voted to certify the 2020 election results.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The speaker campaign</h4>

	
<p>On Monday night, as they tried again to elect a speaker, House Republicans heard pitches from eight of their colleagues who had filed by a Sunday deadline. Pennsylvania’s Dan Meuser was also a candidate but dropped out in the middle of the <a href="https://www.penncapital-star.com/government-politics/u-s-house-republicans-mull-eight-new-candidates-for-speaker-in-advance-of-votes/" target="_blank">closed-door candidate forum</a>.</p>
<p>Those GOP <a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2023/10/23/nine-republicans-are-running-for-u-s-house-speaker-heres-your-guide-to-the-field/" target="_blank">lawmakers who ran</a> for the speaker’s gavel included Reps. <a href="https://alabamareflector.com/2023/10/23/alabama-congressman-gary-palmer-to-run-for-u-s-house-speaker/" target="_blank">Gary Palmer of Alabama</a>, <a href="https://floridaphoenix.com/2023/10/20/floridas-byron-donalds-is-now-a-candidate-for-u-s-house-speaker/" target="_blank">Byron Donalds of Florida</a>, Austin Scott of Georgia, <a href="https://lailluminator.com/2023/10/21/another-louisiana-republican-joins-u-s-house-speaker-fray/" target="_blank">Mike Johnson of Louisiana</a>, <a href="https://michiganadvance.com/2023/10/21/rep-bergman-says-his-hat-is-in-the-ring-for-u-s-house-speaker/" target="_blank">Jack Bergman of Michigan</a>, Kevin Hern of Oklahoma and Pete Sessions of Texas.</p>
<p>Early Tuesday, Scalise, the House majority leader, said the goal is for Republicans to unify behind a nominee and get back to legislative work that has been stalled since McCarthy was <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-votes-remove-kevin-mccarthy-speaker" target="_blank">ousted earlier this month. </a></p>
<p>“There’s a lot of work to do,” Scalise said. “All of these things are bills that are ready to go that we want to move.”</p>
<p>Whoever becomes speaker will be tasked with a quickly approaching <a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2023/09/30/ditching-ukraine-aid-u-s-house-in-bipartisan-vote-passes-bill-to-avert-shutdown/" target="_blank">Nov. 17 deadline for government funding</a> and a nearly <a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2023/10/20/israel-ukraine-global-aid-and-border-funding-would-hit-106-billion-under-biden-request/" target="_blank">$106 billion supplemental aid request</a> from the White House for Ukraine, Israel and global aid and U.S. border security. Emmer will also have to lead in moving must-pass legislation such as the <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2023/08/01/massive-defense-bill-approved-by-u-s-senate-but-deep-partisan-divide-with-house-looms/" target="_blank">annual defense bill</a> and five-year <a href="https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/2023/10/09/farm-bill-stalled-amid-u-s-house-speaker-battle-delay-of-spending-bills/" target="_blank">reauthorization of the farm bill</a>.</p>
<p>On top of legislative duties the new speaker will have to balance striking deals with a White House and Senate controlled by Democrats while also fundraising and protecting vulnerable Republicans and expanding the House’s slim GOP majority in the 2024 elections.</p>
<p>McCarthy said he wants to see the party move beyond its deep fractures and that there must be “consequences” for the eight Republicans who voted with Democrats to oust him.</p>
<p>“It’s frustrating because it’s just a few, these eight, working with all the Democrats to ruin the reputation of the Republicans, but we’ll earn it back,” the California Republican said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Five ballots for Emmer</h4>

	
<p>Republicans went through five secret ballots on Tuesday to get to a nominee. Some candidates withdrew their names prior to voting to speed the process along, such as <a href="https://alabamareflector.com/2023/10/24/gary-palmer-withdraws-from-u-s-house-speaker-race/" target="_blank">Palmer</a> and Meuser.</p>
<p>Sessions was dropped in the first round of ballots; Bergman in the second round; Scott in the third round; Hern in the fourth round; and Johnson in the fifth round. Donalds withdrew in the fourth round.</p>
<p>Because Republicans have struggled to rally behind one candidate, Rep. Mike Flood of Nebraska asked all speaker candidates and GOP lawmakers to sign a unity pledge.</p>
<p>But there were clear signs of dissent.</p>
<p>For the first four rounds of secret ballots, six lawmakers voted either present or for others besides the announced candidates, stirring concern that a candidate may not be able to gain the support of the majority of the conference on the floor.</p>
<p>Bill Huizenga of Michigan said as the final ballot was ongoing, he had a message for those Republicans who voted present: “We got to figure this out. Stop voting present, stop voting for other people. We have two candidates.”</p>
<p>One of those who voted present, Troy Nehls of Texas, said that Emmer had no chance of becoming speaker and that as Republicans, “we are, again, back to where we started.”</p>
<p>Rep. Brett Guthrie of Kentucky said Emmer asked the holdouts to remain in the room after an up-or-down roll call vote to discuss differences.</p>
<p>“So when I left, several people who voted different than Emmer were at the microphone,” he said.</p>
<p>Rep. Ann Wagner of Missouri said she hoped Emmer’s approach would rebuild trust among the conference.</p>
<p>“This is really good because it also does away with this feeling that there are any kind of backroom deals going on or that people are, you know, getting their wish lists,” Wagner said, referring to one-on-one meetings that other speaker candidates have held.</p>
<p>In January, McCarthy made a secret handshake deal with far right conservatives before he won on a 15th ballot.</p>
<p>Mario Díaz-Balart of Florida said that while Donalds was his first choice, he wanted to unify around Emmer whom he described as “honorable.”</p>
<p>As whip “he has the relationships. If he can’t pull it together then we’re running into some very, very difficult times,” he said.</p>
<p>House Democrats continued to criticize the GOP Tuesday.</p>
<p>“Chaos and dysfunction continue to be the order of the day in the House Republican majority. Today is day 21 without a speaker, and the other side is back to square one,” Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar said at a press conference.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Emmer finances, fundraising</h4>

	
<p>Known in Congress as a promoter of cryptocurrency, Emmer’s own finances are remarkably traditional, according to personal financial reports required of members of Congress.</p>
<p>In his most recent annual report, filed in May, Emmer listed only one asset, an investment account worth between $15,000 and $50,000, and one liability, a mortgage of between $100,000 and $250,000.</p>
<p>He listed no stock holdings, transactions, gifts or other finances — a rarity for congressional financial disclosures that are<a href="https://alabamareflector.com/2023/02/07/tuberville-among-four-in-alabama-congressional-delegation-to-invest-in-corporate-stocks/" target="_blank"> often</a><a href="https://westvirginiawatch.com/2023/07/11/manchin-earned-476k-in-2022-from-family-coal-company-congressional-disclosures-show/" target="_blank"> more</a><a href="https://mainemorningstar.com/2023/09/19/maines-u-s-senators-among-stock-holding-members-of-congress-financial-disclosures-show/" target="_blank"> complicated</a>.</p>
<p>A prolific fundraiser as the former head of the House Republican campaign operation, Emmer has raised millions from the cryptocurrency sector and promoted the technology in the House, where he sits on the Financial Services Committee.</p>
<p>He raised $2 million for the National Republican Congressional Committee in the 2022 cycle from the political action committee of Ryan Salame, the former co-CEO of FTX, a crypto firm that went bankrupt after serious allegations of fraud.</p>
<p>Immediately following that scandal, Emmer<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/ftx-failure-divides-lawmakers-how-tough-get-crypto-regulation" target="_blank"> maintained</a> that the FTX example should not undermine the promise of cryptocurrency itself.</p>
<p>For the current campaign cycle, Emmer has raised a combined $3.7 million for his own campaign and for his leadership PAC. He’s raised $230,000 from contributors in the securities and investment industry — more than any industry other than “retired,” according to the nonprofit campaign spending tracking group Open Secrets.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Answer: five. One to put in a new bulb, but only after a protracted, emotional debate with the other four about the painful necessity of parting with the old one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yep, change comes mighty slow here in the Old Dominion. We cling to anachronisms like cat hair to polyester pants. That includes hoary rites and prerogatives rooted in the British monarchy our forebears won a war against to form our democratic republic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of them is the imperative of putting the full duty of felons’ rights restoration on one chief executive, the governor (who enjoys the monarchical salutation “His Excellency” at official ceremonies and stuffy, high-flown social occasions).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pardons, reprieves, clemency and rights restoration are specifically delegated to the governor by the Virginia Constitution. Governors have folks around them to help decide who gets the slate wiped clean and who doesn’t, but it’s not a duty to be outsourced. When it comes right down to it, His Excellency alone decides which individuals with felony records regain the right to vote, hold elective office, serve as notaries or are selected for juries after they successfully reenter society.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put aside for the moment ideological and/or ethical qualms over the prospect of the state’s most powerful political figure holding sole, unfettered discretion over which one-time offenders get to vote and which do not.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="LNXYjBiJjY"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/04/21/restoration-of-rights-should-be-automatic/">Restoration of rights should be automatic</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Restoration of rights should be automatic&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/04/21/restoration-of-rights-should-be-automatic/embed/#?secret=MAXetaKpXu#?secret=LNXYjBiJjY" data-secret="LNXYjBiJjY" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all know of smelly, end-of-term clemency sprees by presidents and governors that paid off past favors. None was bigger (or smellier) than President Gerald Ford’s preemptive pardon of his recently resigned predecessor, Richard Nixon, for egregious criminal abuses exposed by the Watergate scandal. That pardon, more than any other, made possible the one-term presidency of Jimmy Carter, who riled many Americans at the time with his blanket pardon of those who dodged the military draft during the Vietnam War.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider it instead from a purely practical standpoint: how does one guy equitably judge the merits of tens of thousands of released felons’ applications in a timely way? Sure, he’s got staff support from the Secretary of the Commonwealth’s office and input from the Department of Corrections. But is it the best use of time for a governor and a cabinet-level office to be vetting restoration-of-rights requests from folks who hot-wired and stole a car 20 years ago at age 18, or who went to prison after being caught in someone’s house near a stash of crack and a stolen gun?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more than a decade, governors of both parties prided themselves on setting up processes to expeditiously reward those who’ve paid their due and renounced their rough and rowdy past.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell, in the final year of his four-year term, was the first to effectively make restoration automatic for nonviolent felons who had done their time and completed parole and probation requirements. Citing a belief in forgiveness and second chances born of his Catholic faith, McDonnell returned more than 10,000 former offenders to full citizenship before he clocked out in January 2014.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His two Democratic successors put the process on steroids. By the time Terry McAuliffe and Ralph Northam — the 72nd and 73rd governors, respectively — left office, more than 300,000 former felons had their right to vote reinstated, eliminating the backlog who had sought restoration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McAuliffe, during his term, issued a series of executive orders intended to restore the franchise to felons who completed all their post-conviction obligations </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">en masse</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In 2016, the state Supreme Court sharply</span><a href="https://www.eji.org/files/howell-v-mcauliffe-virginia-supreme-court-decision-07-22-16.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">struck down</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> his efforts, holding that the sweeping blanket authority he asserted to restore the vote to a class of felons rather than specific individuals was incompatible with Virginia’s Constitution.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="d1E9iTH6oY"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/06/28/can-a-suit-tied-to-an-1870-law-finally-end-va-s-feudal-felon-rights-restoration-regimen/">Can a suit tied to an 1870 law finally end Va.’s feudal felon rights restoration regimen?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Can a suit tied to an 1870 law finally end Va.’s feudal felon rights restoration regimen?&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/06/28/can-a-suit-tied-to-an-1870-law-finally-end-va-s-feudal-felon-rights-restoration-regimen/embed/#?secret=x3hWXEiP3r#?secret=d1E9iTH6oY" data-secret="d1E9iTH6oY" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, McAuliffe and his successors began swiftly and individually enfranchising applicants who completed their sentences. That included Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin for the first year of his term before he rescinded the policy seven months ago, slowing the pace to a trickle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Against that backdrop, Youngkin’s rights-restoration constipation earned the commonwealth another reputational blemish last week when a</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/16/us/voting-rights-felons.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times story</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> exposed inequities inherent in Virginia’s antiquated regimen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It tells the story of George Hawkins, who did 13 years for attempted murder when he was 17, finished his post-release obligations, applied to the governor to gain his voting rights and has been rejected twice without explanation. It notes that a</span><a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/1-2023-04-06-complaint.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">lawsuit in U.S. District Court</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> challenging Youngkin’s process has been allowed to proceed over the state’s motion to dismiss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Times’ reporting also starkly shows what an outlier Virginia is on the issue of rights restoration. Virginia and Kentucky are the only states that still vest all voting rights restoration decisions for felons in their governors, </span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/felon-voting-rights" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">according to</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the National Conference of State Legislatures. Unlike Virginia, however, Kentucky governors can issue blanket restorations via executive order, as Gov. Andy Beshear did in 2019, leaving Virginia in a league of its own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the Virginia NAACP alleged that race was a motivation in Youngkin’s decision to throttle down the process, his secretary of the commonwealth, Kay Coles James, forcefully rebutted the assertion in a two-page letter to state NAACP president Robert N. Barnette Jr. She said applications do not collect data on the applicant’s race, religion or ethnicity. If some felons are not getting their rights restored quickly enough, she wrote, it’s because Youngkin generally prioritizes applications from nonviolent offenders over those who used a firearm.<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/07172023-KCJ-letter-to-NAACP.pdf" class="pdfemb-viewer" style="" data-width="max" data-height="max" data-toolbar="bottom" data-toolbar-fixed="off">07172023 KCJ letter to NAACP</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so it goes: the ceaseless point/counterpoint rhetoric; the litigation that quibbles and nibbles around the edges. It gets us no closer to a lasting, 21st century solution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real change requires a state constitutional amendment, something that has been tried several times, unsuccessfully, since the 1980s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, a proposed constitutional amendment must pass both chambers of the General Assembly unchanged in consecutive years separated by a legislative election before it goes to voters for ratification (or rejection) in a statewide referendum. It has never made it to the ballot, with the most recent effort failing last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initial passage came in the 2021 session when Democrats held House and Senate majorities and the governor’s office. A year later, after Republicans swept the 2021 state elections, the</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=221&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sj1" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">second passage was snuffed out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a House subcommittee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another shot at modernizing Virginia’s suffrage policy for penitent felons is not on the horizon given the current composition of the legislative and executive branches, even if Democrats hold their tenuous Senate majority in next month’s legislative election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But then, people who have spent years staring at a concrete wall and locked steel bars may have a different perspective on time than most of us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Old family court records have become an unexpectedly prominent issue in one of the most competitive races in this year’s battle for control of the Virginia Senate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Del. Clint Jenkins, D-Suffolk, says it was his family that wanted him to respond forcefully to campaign ads from his Republican opponent spotlighting turbulent periods in his home life that left him facing misdemeanor charges. In his telling, the attack ads are an example of the GOP’s “bullying” tactics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of people don’t want to get into the mudslinging,” Jenkins said in a recent interview, stressing that his campaign has tried to focus on policy, particularly on K-12 education, and how it affects the people of the new Senate District 17, which runs from the edge of Hampton Roads to parts of Southside Virginia and the rural outskirts of Petersburg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Emily Brewer, R-Suffolk, says the domestic assault accusations lodged against Jenkins roughly two decades ago are relevant at a time when crime and safety is a major issue for many voters. That history, she said, shows an alarming pattern of behavior, even though the misdemeanor charges arising from the three incidents were ultimately dismissed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s something that people talked about in this community for a long time,” Brewer said. “It’s not like it’s a secret historic fact here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Jenkins has made several runs for public office before, his past legal troubles are coming under new scrutiny in a politically split district that will help determine which party controls the Senate next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Portraying her Democratic opponent as soft on crime, Brewer has run TV ads with imagery evoking an allegation that Jenkins grabbed his daughter by the throat after a Thanksgiving dinner in 2003, a detail included in police records from the time. In 2004, the </span><a href="https://www.suffolknewsherald.com/2004/07/12/jenkins-cleared-of-assault-charge/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suffolk News-Herald reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Jenkins was “cleared” of an assault charge without detailing exactly why the matter was dismissed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brewer said Jenkins has been a reliable vote for Democratic efforts to make the criminal justice system less punitive, changes Republicans say have come at the expense of public safety.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He has a past where he’s directly dealt with the criminal justice system in a way that is not positive,” Brewer said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a response ad that features members of his family sticking up for his character, the Jenkins campaign accused Brewer of spreading “bold faced lies.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My daughter lives with me. My daughter is my business partner. My daughter is a big part of my team. And we worship together,” Jenkins said in the interview. “That’s what my family wanted to demonstrate. And for people to see who we are.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brewer, the owner of a wine and beer shop in downtown Suffolk who has served in the House of Delegates since 2018, was endorsed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin in a competitive GOP primary earlier this year for the open Senate seat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jenkins, who helps run a family real estate company, was first elected to the House in 2019, when he defeated a top Republican lawmaker in a district redrawn by federal judges to address race-based gerrymandering.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_36723" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:979px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/SD17.png" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-36723" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/SD17.png" alt="" width="979" height="649" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/SD17.png 979w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/SD17-300x199.png 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/SD17-768x509.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 979px) 100vw, 979px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Senate District 17. (Supreme Court of Virginia)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, Republicans will have to outperform expectations to achieve their goal of overturning the 22-18 Democratic majority in the Virginia Senate. But the 17th District, which Youngkin won by about 5 percentage points in 2021, isn’t seen as the toughest on the map. As of Sept. 30, Brewer had raised nearly $1.5 million, well ahead of the nearly $650,000 raised by Jenkins, </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/offices/state-senate-17/elections/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to the Virginia Public Access Project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Democratic candidates in other competitive races, the Jenkins campaign is hitting Brewer for her anti-abortion views, including her past comments calling late-term abortion “barbaric” and labeling Planned Parenthood a “terrorist organization.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brewer supports Youngkin’s proposal to ban elective abortions after 15 weeks with exceptions for cases of rape and incest and when the mother’s life is at risk. Jenkins said Virginia’s abortion laws — which provide mostly unrestricted access in the first and second trimesters of pregnancy but only allow third-trimester abortions when three doctors agree there’s a serious health risk to the mother — should remain as they are.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let’s be real, we don’t tell men what to do with their bodies. It’s all about freedom,” Jenkins said. “The other side talks about freedom, but yet this action that they’re talking about is taking away freedom.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brewer said that based on her conversations with potential voters, she’s not convinced abortion is a top issue for the district. And she disputed the notion that a 15-week limit with exceptions is overly harsh, saying it’s “about in line” with the abortion laws many European countries have adopted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I wouldn’t say they’re the bastion of conservatism,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the economy, Brewer is emphasizing workforce development and opening up more pathways for young people to go into skilled trades. For those growing up in places like Suffolk, she said, learning a trade can open up more opportunities to work closer to home instead of tying career aspirations only to a four-year college degree.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s great to, you know, get a full ride to go somewhere and get a degree in theater or English. And that’s awesome,” Brewer said. “But if you stay in this community, what do you do with that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked if she believes abortion could be a decisive issue this year, Brewer said she thinks the day-to-day struggles of people trying to afford groceries, gas and other necessities are a more pressing concern. Brewer’s campaign has touted her support for cutting taxes, spotlighting Republicans’ partially successful push to reduce taxes on groceries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jenkins said it was Democrats who pushed for bigger direct tax rebate checks in the most recent state budget that passed on a bipartisan basis. He’s pitching education as a top issue, touting his support for higher teacher pay and a more urgent approach to fixing up or replacing Virginia’s aging school buildings. His own experience growing up in Suffolk, he said, taught him that education can give people a “fighting chance” and prepares them to “make a quality contribution to society.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats have been using their Senate majority, he said, to fight for more education funding and ensure public money isn’t diverted to private schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If we lose the Senate, we lose that progress,” he said.</span></p>

</p><p>WASHINGTON — U.S. House Republicans Monday night gathered behind closed doors to hear the pitches of eight candidates for the speaker’s gavel, as the chamber approaches three weeks without a speaker.</p>
<div id="modal-ready">
<p>Monday’s nearly three-hour meeting was meant to produce a leading GOP candidate, so that when Republicans vote behind closed doors on Tuesday, there will be a new speaker designate who can be brought to the House floor for a vote. Ohio’s Rep. Jim Jordan on Friday was cast aside by the conference after he failed to gain enough support on the floor.</p>
<p>“We heard tonight, a really strong vision laid out by each of them. Everybody has a lot of the same goals in mind,” said Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana, who was briefly the nominee two weeks ago before bowing out. “We need to get moving on our agenda.”</p>
<p>The<a href="https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/2023/10/23/nine-republicans-are-running-for-u-s-house-speaker-heres-your-guide-to-the-field/" target="_blank"> eight Republican men who have declared their candidacy</a> for speaker of the House are Reps. <a href="https://alabamareflector.com/2023/10/23/alabama-congressman-gary-palmer-to-run-for-u-s-house-speaker/" target="_blank">Gary Palmer of Alabama</a>, <a href="https://floridaphoenix.com/2023/10/20/floridas-byron-donalds-is-now-a-candidate-for-u-s-house-speaker/" target="_blank">Byron Donalds of Florida</a>, Austin Scott of Georgia, <a href="https://lailluminator.com/2023/10/21/another-louisiana-republican-joins-u-s-house-speaker-fray/" target="_blank">Mike Johnson of Louisiana</a>, <a href="https://michiganadvance.com/2023/10/21/rep-bergman-says-his-hat-is-in-the-ring-for-u-s-house-speaker/" target="_blank">Jack Bergman of Michigan</a>, Tom Emmer of Minnesota, Kevin Hern of Oklahoma and Pete Sessions of Texas.</p>
<p>Rep. <a href="https://www.penncapital-star.com/blog/u-s-rep-dan-meuser-of-pennsylvania-says-hes-a-candidate-for-speaker-of-the-house/" target="_blank">Dan Meuser of Pennsylvania</a> declared himself a candidate on Sunday but he dropped out of the race during the closed-door meeting Monday night.</p>
<p>“I came in late. I have other commitments that I want to adhere to, largely leading President Trump’s campaign in Pennsylvania. And, we have great candidates,” Meuser said.</p>
<p>Meuser said former President Donald Trump supported his decision to exit the speaker race “based upon the situations at hand and with some of the other members that are in so as we get a strong speaker,” but stopped short of endorsing another candidate.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Majority vote</h4>

	
<p>According to House Republican <a href="https://www.gop.gov/conference-rules-of-the-118th-congress/" target="_blank">rules</a>, any nominee must get a majority of the vote of the conference in the closed-door meeting. Because there are eight candidates, it could take a while before Republicans rally around a speaker designate.</p>
<p>If none receives a majority during the first ballot, the candidate with the least votes would be removed from the ballot and another round of voting would begin.</p>
<p>With 221 House Republicans, a candidate needs the support of 111 to become the speaker nominee in the conference vote. However, the nominee would likely need 217 votes on the floor if all Republicans are present and voting.</p>
<p>The GOP’s speaker designate can only afford to lose a handful of votes on the House floor, as all Democrats are expected to vote for House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York for speaker.</p>
<p>Any Republican speaker will have to walk a delicate line negotiating with the White House and Democratic-controlled Senate on must-pass legislation like an annual defense bill, and aggressively fundraise for the Republican Party as well as protect vulnerable Republicans and expand their slim House majority in the upcoming 2024 elections.</p>
<p>The next speaker of the House will also be tasked with an upcoming <a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2023/09/30/ditching-ukraine-aid-u-s-house-in-bipartisan-vote-passes-bill-to-avert-shutdown/" target="_blank">Nov. 17 deadline on government funding</a>, as well as nearly <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2023/10/23/israel-ukraine-global-aid-and-border-funding-would-hit-106-billion-under-biden-request/" target="_blank">$106 billion in supplemental aid request from the White House </a>for Israel, Ukraine and U.S. border security.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Unity pledge</h4>

	
<p>House Republicans have been unable to pick a successful candidate to replace former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who was <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-votes-remove-kevin-mccarthy-speaker" target="_blank">ousted in early October</a> by eight Republicans voting with all Democrats. Following his removal, McCarthy said he would not run again, but has said the decision is ultimately up to the Republican conference.</p>
<p>Jordan brought his candidacy to the floor<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/jim-jordans-bid-be-us-house-speaker-ends-after-rejection-gop-closed-meeting" target="_blank"> three times</a>. With each vote, he continued to lose GOP support.</p>
<p>Following Jordan’s losses, House Republicans held a secret vote in which Jordan failed to garner enough votes from his fellow GOP lawmakers to continue as the nominee.</p>
<p>The first speaker candidate, Louisiana’s Scalise, never called a floor vote, stepping down <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/scalise-drops-out-race-us-house-speaker" target="_blank">a day after he was selected</a> as the nominee after he realized he couldn’t reach the 217 votes needed to become speaker.</p>
<p>To avoid continued struggles to come together in unity behind a candidate, Nebraska Rep. Mike Flood unveiled <a href="https://flood.house.gov/media/press-releases/congressman-flood-launches-unity-pledge-speakers-race" target="_blank">a unity pledge</a> Friday, urging his Republican colleagues to sign and give their support for the speaker designate, regardless of who becomes the candidate.</p>
<p>“I wanted to start this process, this election, with us understanding that we have to be unified to the end of it,” Flood said to reporters.</p>
<p>As of Monday night, all eight candidates signed the pledge, Flood said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Damage to GOP</h4>

	
<p>Several Republicans, such as Reps. Dusty Johnson of South Dakota and Ralph Norman of South Carolina, said that Republicans ultimately have to pick a speaker because the last few weeks have been damaging to the party.</p>
<p>“Hopefully, small groups of members who have stood in the way of us getting work done in the past understand how incredibly damaging the last four weeks have been,” Johnson said, referring to the beginning of the month when McCarthy was removed.</p>
<p>Norman argued that “there is no perfect speaker,” and that Republicans need to unify behind a candidate.</p>
<p>Following the Republican candidate forum, House Rules Committee Chair Tom Cole of Oklahoma said that all the candidates were good and that he hopes a new speaker can be picked quickly.</p>
<p>Rep. Brett Guthrie of Kentucky said he supports Flood’s unity pledge.</p>
<p>“I think anybody asking for our votes should commit to supporting whoever wins. That’s the only way we’re gonna govern, if we become a majority,” Guthrie said on his way into the candidate forum.</p>
<p>“Anybody who gets 51% at the end of the day, we walk across the street, hold hands and vote for that person … And that’s the way it should be,” said Rep. Vern Buchanan of Florida.</p>
<p>Rep. Matt Gaetz, who sparked McCarthy’s ouster earlier this month, said he thought the candidates did “a great job” in the forum.</p>
<p>“I was most heartened by those who wanted to advance single-subject spending bills rather than link disparate issues like Ukraine funding and Israel funding together,” the Florida Republican said.</p>
<p>Rep. Victoria Spartz of Indiana said she’s pleased to see “competition and vibrancy.”</p>
<p>“I think it’s important for us to govern, but I truly think it’s a good process. This institution is so broken, so only crisis maybe will help, for the American people, to make us work,” Spartz said.</p>
<p>She added that she has “concerns” with some of the candidates, not specifying who, but said she wanted “to give people a chance.”</p>
<p>Whichever candidate gets a majority of the vote will coordinate with North Carolina’s Patrick McHenry, who has been serving as speaker pro tempore, to bring the nomination to the floor for a vote.</p>
<p>McCarthy handpicked him for the role under a procedure established in the wake of the 9/11 attacks to ensure continuity of government. <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/scalise-drops-out-race-us-house-speaker" target="_blank">It’s unclear what legislative authority</a> McHenry has, and House Republicans last week <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gripped-paralysis-again-after-gop-punts-proposal-speaker-pro-tem" target="_blank">punted on adopting a resolution</a> that would temporarily allow McHenry to move legislation.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A range of experience</h4>

	
<p>Of all the candidates, Minnesota’s Emmer is the highest ranking Republican.</p>
<p>Emmer has the advantage of already being a member of House GOP leadership and party insider, with connections as a former National Republican Congressional Committee head.</p>
<p>But Emmer, the current House majority whip, is facing criticism from the far right. Emmer did not support Trump’s false 2020 election victory claims, and voted to certify the Electoral College count.</p>
<p>However, he did sign onto a lawsuit out of Texas challenging election results in swing states that Biden won in 2020.</p>
<p>Like Emmer, Palmer also sits in a GOP House leadership position, as chair of an advisory committee known as the Republican Policy Committee.</p>
<p>Hern, who at one point owned two dozen McDonald’s franchises, chairs the Republican Study Committee, a body that has promoted a conservative agenda among House GOP lawmakers since the 1970s.</p>
<p>Hern said the closed-door meeting had a good turnout and he was happy to answer questions from his GOP colleagues. He said they asked “questions of concern about where our conference currently is and where it needs to go.”</p>
<p>Donalds, who belongs to the far-right House Freedom Caucus, received floor nominations for speaker last week and in January during the course of more than a dozen ballots that finally declared McCarthy the winner.</p>
<p>Donalds, first elected in 2020, defended his legislative record, pointing to his time as a Florida state legislator.</p>
<p>“I know the legislative process,” he said. “I’ve worked with our colleagues up here to get a lot of policies done.”</p>
<p>Donalds added that he spoke with Trump but did not answer reporters who asked if the former president would endorse him.</p>
<p>“The president is going to watch us do our process,” he said. “I think he’s gonna be happy with who’s gonna be the next speaker of the House.”</p>
<p>The former president did endorse Jordan, who co-founded the House Freedom Caucus, and struggled to win the support of more centrist Republicans. Members who voted against Jordan also received death <a href="https://kentuckylantern.com/2023/10/19/members-of-u-s-house-gop-describe-threats-sparked-by-votes-against-jim-jordan-for-speaker/" target="_blank">threats</a> and other threatening messages from Jordan allies.</p>
<p>Scott briefly challenged Jordan but lost an internal secret ballot on Oct. 13. Scott is vice chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture, where he chairs the panel on General Farm Commodities, Risk Management, and Credit. He is also the co-chair of the Congressional Crop Insurance Caucus.</p>
<p>He said that many of the candidates running are similar and “there are no personal differences between us.”</p>
<p>“It’s just a matter of being able to do things and get the ball rolling in the right direction,” Scott said. “I’m committed to a House that operates and functions.”</p>
<p>Scott added that he did not specify a plan for government spending to Republicans, but “laid out a path forward for us as a conference.”</p>
<p>Johnson chairs the House Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Constitution and Limited Government, and chairs the Congressional Long Range Strike Caucus.</p>
<p>Bergman, a former lieutenant general in the U.S. Marines and commercial airline pilot, does not hold a leadership position on any committees or caucuses, but he does sit on three House committees, including Armed Services and Veterans Affairs.</p>
<p>Sessions, who has served in Congress for over two decades and was a former head of the NRCC, currently sits on two House committees.</p>
<p>“We’re gonna find out what people think,” Sessions said about whether Republicans would support his nomination.</p>

Hanover is one of a handful of Virginia localities whose school boards are appointed by local governments rather than elected by voters. (Samantha Willis/The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In November, Hanover County voters will answer a question that sounds simple but could be the precursor of a historic shift in the way the county oversees the education of its 17,000 public school students: “Shall the method of selecting the school board be changed from appointment by the governing body to direct election by the voters?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preceding this referendum is a chorus of voices — from parents, educators, students and community members — calling for significant change in how members are added to the school board. What began years ago as low-toned complaints about the board’s lack of transparency and accountability to residents are now a cacophony of legitimate concerns that cannot be easily quieted. As a graduate of Hanover schools, I say emphatically: Bring the noise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hanover County is one of just 12 localities statewide where </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/21/senate-kills-house-backed-measure-on-elected-school-boards/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">school board members are appointed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by a local governing body instead of elected by citizens. Before 1992, all school boards in the state were appointed, according to Gina Patterson, executive director of the Virginia School Boards Association, which serves 131 school boards across the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were the last state that allowed elected school boards in the country,” Patterson told me by phone. “The beauty of Virginia is that we allow both elected and appointed school boards; we allow whatever is the best fit for the community.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Hanover’s case, there has been continued consternation about what the best fit for the community really is, centering on whether the appointed school board is truly representative of Hanover students, what they need academically and what they and their parents want from their educational experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even a cursory glance at the school board’s actions over the past few years lends legitimacy to students’ and parents’ concerns that the majority-white, majority-male school board — appointed by the all-white, majority-male Hanover County Board of Supervisors — doesn’t reflect or respect beliefs, lifestyles or teachings outside a conservative, white worldview.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was the school names controversy, wherein the school board refused to change the names of Hanover schools bearing Confederate veterans’ monikers. The board staunchly refused to remove the racist school names for years, despite protests from hundreds of citizens who rightly viewed them as hurtful reminders of the Civil War and the white men who fought in it for the right to continue owning Black people as property. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the issue first surfaced for a vote in 2018, the Board of Supervisors booted off Marla Coleman, who was one of just two school board members to vote to change the names. (The other member, Ola J. Hawkins, was a Black woman; removing her would have been too obviously racist, they probably concluded.) Coleman has since </span><a href="https://fb.watch/nOtInjQyp2/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">publicly shed light</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on what she calls the “political” appointment process, which until now has been shrouded in secrecy by the Board of Supervisors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amanda Kronenberg, a parent of a 9-year-old Hanover Public Schools student and a 15-year-old who attends Maggie Walker Governor’s School, said she first learned Hanover had an appointed school board at the time of the name change controversy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I started to look into who was on the school board, what they do, who is my rep, and how they voted on this issue,” she said. “The person who was my rep at the time voted against changing the names; I was pro-changing the names. I didn&#8217;t like that they didn&#8217;t support the students that way, so I wondered when they were up for election and ‘never’ was the answer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After years of negative press about the school names, the board finally, if reluctantly, </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/07/17/treat-the-cause-not-the-symptoms/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voted to change the names</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2020. By then, they’d lost the trust of many members of Hanover’s Black community and their allies, and that well-earned distrust persists today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, the school board flagrantly rejected standards mandated by the state Board of Education to protect transgender and nonbinary students, leading to student protests and a </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2021/12/09/aclu-hanover-schools-transgender-students/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> levied by five trans students and their families. The school board then hired notorious conservative Christian advocacy group Alliance Defending Freedom to craft its own </span><a href="https://go.boarddocs.com/vsba/hcpsva/Board.nsf/files/CHMR566C441D/$file/Restroom%20and%20Locker%20Room%20Policy%20-%20August%2030.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for trans children, which requires these students to submit written requests to use bathrooms that match their gender identity and gives the school board the sole authority to accept or reject the requests. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kronenberg was also troubled by this kerfuffle, saying it “signaled that the school board or system didn’t care about trans students, which appalled me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The board’s policy also suggests the requests include students’ personal information, including disciplinary and criminal records, and a doctor’s or therapist’s note “verifying that the student has been diagnosed with gender dysphoria and/or that the student consistently and authentically expresses a binary gender identity.” This needlessly burdensome process seems unfair and discriminatory toward students whose gender identity should have no bearing on the quality of education they get in Hanover and whether they can just use the bathroom where they feel most comfortable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the school board’s </span><a href="https://go.boarddocs.com/vsba/hcpsva/Board.nsf/files/CE5J244B014C/$file/Equity%20Report%20Data%20-%20May%202022.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">self-directed equity audit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> revealed that “Black students in Hanover schools are overrepresented in school discipline and underrepresented in advanced courses, such as AP and IB programs, in the county for the second straight year,” according to </span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/local-news/hanover-county/after-years-community-equity-board-member-says-no-movement-on-top-proposals-to-hanover-school-board/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WRIC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite that, a member of the school system’s Community Equity Advisory Board, formed partly in response to the racial equity concerns that bubbled up during the school names controversy, said there had been “no movement” from the school board on the advisory group’s top recommendations — that the school system submit to a third-party equity audit and that it hire a director of equity and inclusion initiatives — for at least three or four years. All of this sent the message that the school board doesn’t take its commitment to equity seriously. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, this year, the board has ruffled feathers by jumping on the book banning bandwagon. This June, it created and voted in a policy that outlines how public requests for books to be banned from school libraries will be processed and then</span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/education/hanover-books-ban-llibrary/article_35e54f04-0a65-11ee-92bc-bff2eab514de.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> banned 19 books</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including “The Bluest Eye” by Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Toni Morrison.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Zw2PWzJ3lP"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/06/15/school-districts-struggle-to-implement-new-laws-on-sexually-explicit-books/">School districts struggle to implement new laws on sexually explicit books</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;School districts struggle to implement new laws on sexually explicit books&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/06/15/school-districts-struggle-to-implement-new-laws-on-sexually-explicit-books/embed/#?secret=OvbfbVIEvY#?secret=Zw2PWzJ3lP" data-secret="Zw2PWzJ3lP" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I first read that book as a Hanover County high school student, devouring sentences between classes; it solidified my lifelong love of literature and gave me an example of fiction writing on a genius scale authored by a Black woman whom I adored and emulated as a budding creative writer. Sadly, other young Black aspiring writers in Hanover schools won’t get the same mind-opening opportunity — an essential point of public education — that I did. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout these firestorms, the common denominator is Hanover’s School Board, whose hardline stances against progressive actions to make the school system more welcoming, equitable and inclusive of all students clashes with large swaths of the constituents it serves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To me, appointed school boards like Hanover’s hearken back to the Jim Crow era, when all-white appointed school boards had sole authority over education in their localities, often to the detriment of Black students. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A classic example of this dynamic was found in Prince Edward County, where in 1951, students of the county’s only high school for Black students, Robert Russa Moton High, and the NAACP sued the school board for refusing to equally fund Moton or give it basic resources for student success — like books in good condition or classrooms where students would be warm and dry. A Black teenager, Barbara Johns, </span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/video/virginias-black-churches-develop-young-leaders-wlo5jv/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">led a protest of 450 students</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before the lawsuit; it set the stage for the landmark case that would end school segregation, Brown v. Board of Education. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This model of appointed school board leadership belongs in the history books, not in Virginia’s modern school systems. But in Hanover, the growing number of folks who didn’t agree with the school board’s many missteps has had no recourse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beginning last year, a nonpartisan, citizen-led group, </span><a href="https://www.electhanover.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hanover Citizens for an Elected School Board</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, collected more than 10,000 signatures in support of placing the question of whether the county’s school board should be appointed or elected on the November ballot. In July, their work earned the court-ordered </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-07-21/hanover-county-elected-school-board-referendum" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">right to a referendum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group makes some very sane points. They highlight the fact that while school boards in Virginia have no taxation authority, they do determine how federal, state and local funds, some of which come from taxpayers, should be spent. Even if Hanover residents don’t have a child in school or any connection to the school board, their taxes still fund it. Should taxpayers continue to have no say in the school board’s decisions? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A counter-effort to keep the school board appointed has geared up, fueled by a $15,000 contribution from the </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/committees/474664/raw-reports-in/?schedule=A" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hanover County Republican Committee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They’re fighting under the banner of voting no to “political school boards.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Hanover’s school board has </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">always </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">been political, by virtue of its members’ appointment by the Board of Supervisors, whose politics could be seen as clear as day even by Stevie Wonder.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="khsV2h4Dho"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2019/07/08/this-is-hanover-but-it-doesnt-have-to-be/">This is Hanover (but it doesn&#8217;t have to be)</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;This is Hanover (but it doesn&#8217;t have to be)&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2019/07/08/this-is-hanover-but-it-doesnt-have-to-be/embed/#?secret=Zs39FKdjpt#?secret=khsV2h4Dho" data-secret="khsV2h4Dho" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another anti-elected school board group, Together Hanover, shared this </span><a href="https://rumble.com/v2jwcca-i-know-spotlighting-is-illegal-officer-but.....html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">frankly frightening presentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in an April Board of Supervisors meeting. If you don’t care to watch the full sermon, they allege that those seeking an elected school board </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">have an “unstated goal through teaching CRT to create a race war and gender war” and are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">vying “t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">o not only keep parents out of the classroom but to keep parents from knowing what&#8217;s going on in the classroom in the first place.” The rhetoric is closely aligned with Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s dubious </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/08/21/virginia-youngkin-parents-matter-elections/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Parents Matter” movement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which stokes unfounded fears about Virginia schoolchildren being force-fed critical race theory and equity education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If parents matter so much, why shouldn’t they have a say in deciding who will represent them and their children on the school board? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Election Day in Hanover, there will be much to lose but also much to gain. Whether the referendum on electing the school board passes or fails, the fact that it’s on the ballot means Hanover citizens finally have a vote in the county school system’s progression or regression — and a chance to participate in the democratic processes that uphold this nation. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s Senate District 27, a newly drawn district around the city of Fredericksburg in a region with a history of tight margins, has the most crowded ballot in the state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There, Republican Del. Tara Durant, Democrat Joel Griffin and Independent Monica Gary are sparring on </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">abortion access, learning loss and electoral reforms. Republican Matt Strickland, who lost the primary to Durant this June, </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/09/27/2023-elections-bring-new-scrutiny-of-virginias-sore-loser-rule/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">is also running a write-in campaign</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In past elections, voters in the district have gone for Democrats including U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, President Joe Biden and U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine. But they also threw their support behind Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin and former President Donald Trump. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More funding in the race has so far gone to Griffin than Durant, with the Democrat raising about $1.7 million and the Republican $1.3 million, according to the latest data from the Virginia Public Access Project. Gary has raised about $213,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Durant, a former schoolteacher who has represented the region in the House since 2022, is focusing her campaign on addressing learning loss, reducing crime and lowering taxes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These are still the staple issues, the ones I hear about when I talk to people in the district the same as two years ago, and they remain a top priority,” Durant said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griffin, a veteran who is founder and CEO of an investment firm and served as chairman of the Stafford County Economic Development Authority, has centered his campaign on enshrining abortion access in the state Constitution, preventing book bans and supporting the economy through data center development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think the reality is that people don&#8217;t want their government stepping in and telling half the citizens what they can do,” said Griffin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gary, a Stafford County supervisor who has been open about her past as a stripper, is focusing on abortion access, school funding and electoral reforms like ranked choice voting and campaign finance limits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I understand the difficulty of trying to get out of the assistance and out of the system, how hard that is,” Gary said.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Abortion </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griffin and Gary are highlighting abortion in their campaigns, while Durant has been relatively quiet on the issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia currently allows abortion with few restrictions in the first and second trimesters and permits it in the third if three doctors agree continuing the pregnancy poses a risk to the mother. After the overturning of Roe v. Wade, many Virginia Republicans have backed a proposal by Youngkin to ban the procedure after 15 weeks except in cases of rape, incest and a threat to the life of the mother.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griffin has said he supports a constitutional abortion amendment that Senate Democrats passed in the most recent legislative session but House Republicans defeated. Republicans have criticized the amendment as going further than the state’s current law to allow abortions under any circumstance.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+ful+SJ255+pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The amendment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stated that the “right to make and effectuate one&#8217;s own decisions about all matters related to one&#8217;s pregnancy shall not be denied, burdened, or infringed upon.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We pass that in this legislative session by having a blue Senate and turning the House blue,” Griffin said. “Then we come back next year for the next session, and we vote on it again.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_36692" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:982px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/SD27.png" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-36692" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/SD27.png" alt="" width="982" height="657" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/SD27.png 982w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/SD27-300x201.png 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/SD27-768x514.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 982px) 100vw, 982px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Senate District 27. (Supreme Court of Virginia)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Durant early in her campaign was quiet on the issue of abortion, she released a statement in support of the 15-week restrictions after Griffin ran an ad stating she supported legislation that would force a rape victim to “carry to term.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The lies touted by Joel Griffin’s campaign are a failed effort to cloud the extreme, partisan stance he’s recently adopted in exchange for campaign cash,” read the statement, which also noted Griffin donated to her campaign in 2022. Griffin’s campaign said the donation was made “before he knew how extreme she was.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Gary said she wants to make access to abortion easier by reducing the number of referrals needed for the procedure in the third trimester from three to two. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think that&#8217;s very cost restrictive, especially with the increasing costs of health care,” Gary said.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Schools </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All three candidates are focusing strongly on education, with Durant dialing in on learning loss, Griffin focusing on halting districts from banning books, and Gary highlighting the need to improve school funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Durant has accused Democrats of “reducing standards” in education, leading to learning loss exacerbated by pandemic-era school closures. In an interview with the Mercury, she specifically said she wants to revive legislation to provide extra </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB2495" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">math instruction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in districts with lagging SOL scores or rural or economically disadvantaged areas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Math is so challenging because it becomes a snowball effect,” said Durant. “It really kind of compounds itself over time.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griffin is focusing on additional school funding and blocking legislation that could lead to book bans. The issue has gotten special attention </span><a href="https://fredericksburg.com/news/local/education/23-more-books-removed-from-spotsylvania-school-libraries/article_3cd2d170-6761-11ee-afdb-f75ed6a276a9.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in Spotsylvania,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> part of which lies in the district, after division leaders removed 37 books from county high school libraries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We need to stop creating this adversarial relationship between the students, the parents, the teachers, the administration,” Griffin said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funding for schools is also a top priority for Gary, who argued the state needs to keep its cost of competing adjustment in its funding formula, despite criticism of the instrument as outdated by Virginia’s </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/07/10/study-finds-virginia-underfunds-k-12-schools-recommends-spending-billions-more/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Replacing the current system with one-time funding sources is “just going to continue to cause other neighboring localities to struggle more,” Gary said, pointing to local school divisions’ decision to put classrooms in trailers when faced with building problems.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Crime, economy and electoral reform</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three candidates are also running on a varied slate of other issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Durant is emphasizing the need to reduce crime by funding law enforcement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police “need the resources and tools in order to do their job and to keep us safe,” Durant said. “That is not happening. That gets blocked by the Senate repeatedly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griffin is zeroing in on encouraging the growth of data centers in the region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I want to make sure that we address all of the issues and concerns regarding being environmentally conscious, making sure that we have a local workforce here in the area to be providing the services,” Griffin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Gary is pushing for changes to the state’s electoral system, including campaign contribution limits and ranked choice voting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People are frustrated, because they don&#8217;t feel they often don&#8217;t feel like they can vote for who they really believe in,” Gary said.</span></p>

	</div>
	</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Senate District 31, composed of parts of Loudoun and Fauquier counties, Republican Juan Pablo Segura is attacking Democrat Russet Perry as soft on crime while emphasizing parental rights. Meanwhile, Perry is focusing on abortion, portraying Segura as a threat to reproductive rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both candidates in the closely contested race are newcomers to state politics. Perry is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a former CIA officer and prosecutor with the Loudoun commonwealth’s attorney’s office, which she left in 2021. Segura is an entrepreneur and co-founder of Babyscripts, a digital maternal health care tech company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The race, centered in a very purple district in Northern Virginia that includes the politically volatile Loudoun County, is considered highly competitive. It has also seen a flood of cash: As of Oct. 15, Segura’s campaign had raised approximately </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/candidates/448584/raw-reports/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$2.8 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Perry’s team had collected </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/candidates/447053/raw-reports/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$3.3 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to the nonprofit Virginia Public Access Project, which collects election data.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Segura did not agree to an interview for this story, but his campaign sent a lengthy statement on why he is running.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Public safety</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Segura in his campaign ads has attacked Perry as anti-police, pointing to her work in the office of Loudoun Commonwealth’s Attorney Buta Biberaj, a progressive prosecutor who has faced sharp criticism from Republicans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular, Segura, who said public safety should be a priority and law enforcement should be “fully funded,” has pointed to Biberaj’s decision to </span><a href="https://wjla.com/news/local/loudoun-county-commonwealths-attorney-buta-biberaj-list-crimes-including-hit-run-will-no-longer-be-prosecuted-misdemeanor-virginia-youngkin-democrat-republican-nova-speeding-reckless-fairfax" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">divert low-level misdemeanors and nonviolent charges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to police for prosecution rather than involving the commonwealth’s attorney’s office. Biberaj defended the move as a necessary step to allow the office to focus on violent crimes.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_36664" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:965px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-36664" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-17-at-3.33.56-PM.png" alt="" width="965" height="651" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-17-at-3.33.56-PM.png 965w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-17-at-3.33.56-PM-300x202.png 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-17-at-3.33.56-PM-768x518.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 965px) 100vw, 965px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  (Supreme Court of Virginia)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My opponent was one of her top lieutenants,” Segura told </span><a href="https://www.fox5dc.com/video/1285493" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fox 5 in an interview this September</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “They’ve dropped cases, publicly said they are not going to prosecute hit-and-runs and other high-level misdemeanors, and so we have got to focus on the issues that make our community safe and that make everyone successful.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Segura has also attacked Perry in television ads for having accepted endorsements from groups that he says have supported defunding the police. While his ads have not named any of those groups, the Republican State Leadership Committee has pointed in one release to endorsements of Perry by progressive news outlet Daily Kos and progressive organization NextGen PAC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perry, however, said she helped put murderers and sex offenders in jail during her time as a prosecutor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Public safety is a complex topic that involves a lot of different things,” she told the Mercury.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a prosecutor, she noted that she </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">helped start mental health and drug court dockets in Loudoun County to offer services to those in need and help “alleviate issues in the criminal justice system.” Additionally, she </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">said she has trained law enforcement in crisis intervention and red flag laws, a measure that allows the temporary confiscation of a person’s firearm if they are considered a risk to themselves and others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loudoun, she said, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is routinely rated one of the safest” counties in the state, “and I&#8217;m proud to have been a part of that.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Abortion</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perry is focusing most of her messaging on upholding Virginia’s current abortion laws, while Segura has joined other Republicans in supporting Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s 15-week restrictions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Virginia’s current law, there are few restrictions on the procedure in the first and second trimesters. Abortions are also allowed in the third trimester if three doctors determine the pregnancy poses a risk to the mother. Youngkin’s proposal would forbid abortions after 15 weeks except in cases of rape, incest and a threat to the life of the mother.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Like most voters in our commonwealth, I support the current law as it stands,” said Perry. “My opponent could be the deciding vote to ban abortions in Virginia, but I will be the vote to protect the right to choose.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Segura told </span><a href="https://youtu.be/btyuNvsNaik?si=feYLWGmiMnknzd_w" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NBC4 Washington</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that “we need to find compassionate consensus on the issue of abortion, and that’s why I’m supporting the governor’s plan.” In his interview with Fox 5, he characterized Perry’s views on abortion as “extreme.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perry has similarly portrayed Segura’s views as out of touch with those of Virginians, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/RussetPerry/status/1714014812714221764?s=20" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">saying on X</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, formerly known as Twitter, that “my opponent doesn’t seem to understand what the voters of SD-31 want, including that these decisions are best left to a woman and her doctor.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview with the Mercury, Perry accused Republicans of “putting forward bill after bill seeking to criminalize women and health care providers and put them in jail for decisions that I believe should be left to a woman and her doctor.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the existing law, physicians who perform abortions outside of the allowed circumstances specified in statute </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title18.2/chapter4/article9/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are already subject to a Class 4 felony</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which carries a penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $100,000.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Parental rights </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Segura is also hoping to see success by emphasizing parental rights, an issue that is widely seen as having helped Youngkin win the governor’s race in 2021. The issue has been especially controversial in Loudoun County, where two highly publicized assaults by a student captured national headlines in 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have to rebuild trust in our schools,” Segura told NBC4. “You can’t give a child an aspirin without a parent’s permission, so how can we not have parents involved with all the other issues in our schools?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This April, Segura filed a lawsuit against the Loudoun County School Board, claiming it had deliberately covered up the sexual assaults. The case was dismissed Monday after a circuit court judge ordered that </span><a href="https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/loudountimes.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/dd/dddd567e-53ea-11ee-be09-7b8f24543794/6504902e76970.pdf.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the internal investigation report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> be unsealed last month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perry said she supports transparency in government issues and sees school safety as a priority.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kids “deserve to go to school and be safe, and us as the adults in the room deserve for that to happen,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think it&#8217;s important for us as a society to have transparency and for folks to be able to see that report,” she said. “I think there were a lot of questions surrounding it and what was in it. It&#8217;s informative to folks about what happened, much like the attorney general&#8217;s report was, and how we can go about making sure that those events never unfold again.”</span></p>
