<p>That’s because domestic workers, including nannies, housekeepers and home health workers, have historically been excluded from the basic labor protections most workers enjoy.</p>
<p>“There are standards in every other industry,” she said. “Why not us?”</p>
<p>After a decade of domestic work, Dominguez became an organizer for the Fair Work Center, a labor advocacy group in Washington state that won a victory in 2019 when Seattle <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/documents/Departments/LaborStandards/OLS_QA_Domestic%20Workers_FINAL_10022020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">implemented</a> an ordinance guaranteeing minimum wage, meal periods and paid rest breaks for domestic workers. Now, advocates are pushing for new statewide legislation that would ensure minimum wage and sick time and require written agreements between employers and workers.</p>
<p>“I know what it is to be unprotected and alone in this industry,” Dominguez said. “There’s no co-workers.”</p>

<p>If advocates are successful, Washington would join a dozen Democratic-leaning states and several cities that have added new protections for domestic workers. Efforts in those places did not face widespread opposition, though they raised some concerns about privacy and overregulation of workers in private homes.</p>
<p>In 2010, <a href="https://labornotes.org/2010/07/domestic-workers-new-york-win-first-ever-job-protections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York became the first state</a> to pass a Domestic Worker Bill of Rights, guaranteeing overtime pay, at least one day off per week and protections against racial and sexual harassment. Since then, 11 other states have passed similar laws, as have Philadelphia, Seattle and Washington, D.C., according to the National Domestic Workers Alliance.</p>
<p>Congress is unlikely to pass national standards anytime soon. President-elect Donald Trump has promised mass deportations of immigrants — who make up a disproportionate share of domestic workers — and he and the GOP-dominated Congress almost certainly would be cool to new regulations designed to protect them.</p>
<p>Federal labor laws for decades exempted domestic workers from many safeguards, including a minimum wage, civil rights protections and workplace safety standards. These exclusions were rooted in racism and sexism, said Zoë West, a senior researcher at The Worker Institute at Cornell University who has studied the industry and operated training programs to educate workers about their rights.</p>
<p>Historically, domestic work has largely been done by Black and immigrant women, West said, and that work — cleaning, child care and the like — has long been viewed as “women’s natural work.”</p>
<p>“There’s a very persistent, strong perception that this isn’t real work,” she said.</p>
<p>Some of the new state and local legislation has mandated that domestic workers are paid overtime and at least the state or city minimum wage, while other laws have gone further, ensuring protections such as paid time off.</p>
<p>But new laws are just the first step.</p>
<p>“[Y]ou still have this enforcement question,” West said. “Across all kinds of low-wage work — not just domestic work — there’s a lot of challenges in enforcing labor law.”</p>
<p>Many domestic workers are privately employed by families, making it difficult to educate both employers and workers about new protections. And domestic workers, who are sometimes paid cash without any formal work agreement, can be particularly vulnerable to retaliation.</p>
<p>In Philadelphia, which approved new domestic worker protections in 2019, some workers who pushed employers to honor newly won rights such as lunch breaks or contracts were fired, said Aurora Munoz, the Pennsylvania organizing manager for the National Domestic Workers Alliance.</p>
<p>The organization has since launched an anti-retaliation campaign and is pushing the Philadelphia City Council to approve new legislation next year to prevent retaliation and beef up enforcement.</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.phila.gov/media/20240122095349/Policy-and-Compliance-Report-2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Philadelphia received six complaints </a>regarding domestic worker protections; five of those cases were closed. The city’s labor department could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>“If we enforce it to the T, then it will be really amazing and beneficial for not just domestic workers, but a lot of low-wage workers,” Munoz said.</p>
<h4 class="editorialSubhed">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘People are paying attention’</h4>

<p>For New Jersey state Sen. Britnee Timberlake, the story of domestic work is the story of her family.</p>
<p>Her grandmother worked as a so-called baby nurse and house cleaner. When she relocated to the Northeast from North Carolina, she found domestic jobs for other family members moving North.</p>
<p>Timberlake, a Democrat, sponsored legislation requiring meal breaks, protection from discrimination and the right to written contracts for domestic workers.</p>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" title="“Steep fines in Iowa set off state-federal showdown over child labor laws” — Stateline" src="https://stateline.org/2024/07/23/steep-fines-in-iowa-set-off-state-federal-showdown-over-child-labor-laws/embed/#?secret=GDbSJQ7wtt#?secret=orLbWvTw9b" width="500" height="440" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-scripts" data-secret="orLbWvTw9b" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>“One of my only regrets with the bill is that I did not name it after her,” she said of her grandmother. “This is something that is a part of my history and a part of my fabric.”</p>
<p>Timberlake said <a href="https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/bill-search/2022/S723" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the legislation</a>, introduced in 2022 and enacted earlier this year, aligns with broader efforts to provide protections for workers who aren’t in unions.</p>
<p><a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2024/01/09/domestic-workers-celebrate-passage-of-bill-granting-them-new-labor-protections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Business groups opposed the bill</a>, saying it would unfairly overburden employers, the New Jersey Monitor reported.</p>
<p>The New Jersey Business &amp; Industry Association pushed for some amendments that were added to the bill, including removal of a provision that would have mandated an extra hour of pay in situations where the employer cannot provide a meal or rest period. <a href="https://njbia.org/lame-duck-review-how-nj-business-fared/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In a legislative update on the group’s website,</a> Vice President of Government Affairs Elissa Frank said the changes “successfully strike a balance between providing flexibility for employers to manage their workforce according to business needs and ensuring certain protections for employees.”</p>
<p>Now, Garden State advocates are working to ensure both workers and employers know about the new law, said Evelyn Saz, the lead New Jersey organizer with the National Domestic Workers Alliance.</p>
<p>Saz came into domestic work <a href="https://19thnews.org/2023/10/domestic-workers-health-safety-protections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">after fleeing war</a> in her native El Salvador for the United States, where she struggled to find work because she did not speak English and had a foreign university degree.</p>
<p>“I took any opportunity I could as a single mother to support my family,” she wrote in an email to Stateline translated into English by a co-worker at her alliance. “This work can’t stop now. We need to make sure that domestic workers are fully informed about their rights and are able to enforce them.”</p>
<p>Traditional labor organizing focuses on a single geographic location: a hotel or factory with a broad group of workers and a single employer. But that’s not possible with domestic workers, said Ben Fuller-Googins, deputy director of Carroll Gardens Association, a neighborhood organization in Brooklyn that advocates for affordable housing, worker rights and other issues.</p>
<figure id="attachment_41608" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:225px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=41608" rel="attachment wp-att-41608"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-41608 size-medium" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/domestic-workers-sign-768x1024-1-225x300.jpeg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/domestic-workers-sign-768x1024-1-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/domestic-workers-sign-768x1024-1.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  The Carroll Gardens Association celebrates International Domestic Workers Day in June 2024 in Brooklyn, N.Y.

<p>“You don’t know how many domestic workers there are, where they work,” he said. “There’s one employer per worker.”</p>
<p>That’s led his organization to aim to educate workers and employers across the entire Carroll Gardens neighborhood about the state’s protections for domestic workers.</p>
<p>“Our approach is that, generally, employers want to do the right thing but are not equipped with the resources and guidance they might need,” he said.</p>
<p>The New York State Department of Labor has conducted 840 investigations into potential violations of the law since 2010, when the law was enacted.</p>
<p>Kenya Williams, who’s been a nanny in New York for 26 years, said she was only recently informed of her rights when a member of the Carroll Gardens group approached her in a local park. Before that, she said, she generally took whatever pay and conditions were offered to her and didn’t know to ask about holiday or overtime pay.</p>
<p>“Things are slowly getting better,” she said. “I think we are making improvements in our industry and people are paying attention.”</p>
<h4 class="editorialSubhed">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Is the home a workplace?</h4>

	</h4>
<p>By its nature, domestic work can be informal.</p>
<p>With no human resources department at hand, families will often ask friends what they pay their nannies or Google how to hire a housekeeper, said Stacy Kono, director of Hand in Hand, a national group representing employers of domestic workers.</p>
<p>“In many ways, the first barrier we often face is people don’t even realize they’re employers,” she said.</p>
<p>While some employers do not provide benefits or pay fair wages, Kono said many want to do the right thing for those who work in their homes.</p>
<p>“We haven’t seen organized employer opposition to the efforts,” she said of the new laws. “It’s generally been employers supporting the efforts.</p>
<p>“We want to shift the mindset so that people do recognize domestic work as protected labor that is work like any other work, and for that reason, the home is a workplace.”</p>
<p>Whether private homes should be considered a workplace has been an ongoing debate in California.</p>
<p>Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2020 <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/SB-1257.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetoed legislation</a> that would have required domestic employers to comply with occupational health and safety rules. In his veto message, the governor said he agreed with the sponsor’s intent.</p>
<p>“However, new laws in this area must recognize that the places where people live cannot be treated in the exact same manner as a traditional workplace or worksite from a regulatory perspective,” he wrote.</p>
<p>This September, <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billHistoryClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB1350" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newsom signed narrower legislation</a> extending safety standards for domestic workers employed by agencies.</p>
<p>“It isn’t everything we want. It doesn’t protect all of our base. But it is an important and historical step forward for California,” said Kimberly Alvarenga, director of the California Domestic Workers Coalition.</p>
<p>The University of California, Los Angeles estimates the state is home to more than <a href="https://losh.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/37/2020/06/Hidden-Work-Hidden-Pain.-Domestic-Workers-Report.-UCLA-LOSH-June-2020-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">350,000 domestic workers</a> employed in 2 million households. That includes an estimated 175,000 who work for agencies or services as opposed to private families, Alvarenga said.</p>
<p>California previously <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/DomesticWorkerBillOfRights.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extended overtime pay</a> to most domestic workers, but they still were not given the same health and safety protections as many other workers.</p>
<p>While the organization would like to see safety standards extended to all workers, Alvarenga said it’s currently focused on enforcement and education around the new law.</p>
<p>“This work is not being valued. It’s not being recognized,” she said. “They’re not asking for something special. They’re just asking for basic protections.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clarissa McGhee, a janitor at the Marshall Plaza municipal building, says she intermittently uses a cane due to arthritis but has never let it interfere with her work — until she allegedly stopped receiving shifts. According to McGhee, Nu-Tech manager Russell Dandridge told her, “don’t come with a cane.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My heart just dropped,” McGhee said in a phone interview with The Mercury. “I’m like, what does my cane have to do with me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGhee described her cane as a necessary aid she occasionally relies on but insisted that it doesn’t hinder her ability to perform her job. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a part of me,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By early November,Nu-Tech instructed McGhee to clock out of a shift and return with a doctor’s note. After obtaining the note, McGhee brought it to the company the following week but was still sent home and allegedly told that her cane was “a liability.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGhee has since filed a </span><a href="https://www.seiu32bj.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/12-17-2024-McGhee-EEOC-Complaint.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">complaint </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">with the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission, citing violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act. She also joined her colleague, Sharonda Smith, in a separate complaint filed with the National Labor Relations Board alleging retaliation for union activity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smith said that the two women had posted a flier to generate interest in forming a union. Shortly after, she was informed in November that her position had been terminated in November — a move she believes was linked to her union involvement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Service Employees International Union’s regional chapter filed the </span><a href="https://www.seiu32bj.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/12-18-2024-Nu-Tech-ULP.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">labor complaint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on their behalf and </span><a href="https://x.com/32BJSEIU/status/1869828304141988121" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">the action during a rally outside Richmond City Hall on Thursday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the rally, Smith shared her struggles since losing her job. A diabetic, she expressed concern about affording medical supplies not fully covered by Medicare and about keeping a roof over her family’s head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I expect to get eviction notices from the hotel where my family and I live because we can’t afford anything else,” Smith said. “I have to go to charities and food banks, but I shouldn’t have to do this because I enjoyed my job and I want work!”</span></p>

Although the labor market has cooled this year, the Trump administration stands to inherit a fairly healthy labor market, with decent job growth across many sectors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of jobs was bolstered by the return of striking workers, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics report. Employment in transportation equipment manufacturing rose by 32,000 jobs. Boeing machinists who went on strike in September seeking higher pay and better retirement benefits reached a </span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/boeing-factory-strike-ends-as-union-workers-vote-to-accept-contract#:~:text=Boeing%20factory%20strike%20ends%20as%20union%20workers%20vote%20to%20accept%20contract,-Nation%20Nov%205&amp;text=SEATTLE%20(AP)%20%E2%80%94%20Factory%20workers,and%20generate%20much%2Dneeded%20cash." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">deal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in November.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agency also revised up the number of jobs added in the October and September reports by 56,000 jobs combined. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the unemployment rate ticked up from 4.1% to 4.2%, the economy is looking strong, particularly when you look at gross domestic product, said Louise Sheiner, with the nonpartisan Brookings Institution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s been remarkably strong. If you look at what the Congressional Budget Office projected the level of real GDP before the pandemic, it&#8217;s higher now. We&#8217;ve just had a really strong economy,” said Sheiner, who focuses on fiscal policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although she said the labor market has been slowing a little, it’s still healthy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elise Gould, senior economist at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, said the three-month average of job growth at 173,000 jobs shows a fairly strong labor market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employment in healthcare and government, including state government employment, continued to add jobs. Leisure and hospitality added 53,000 jobs and food services and drinking places added 29,000 jobs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gould said she is keeping an eye on the employment-to-population ratio, a measure of workers employed versus the working-age population. The measure is down 0.6 percentage point over the year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let&#8217;s pay attention to that and see where that goes,” she said. “We were at a pretty nice high this summer that has come down a bit.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economists will also keep an eye on demographic data changes in the next jobs report. The unemployment rate for Black men jumped from 5.7% to 6% and the unemployment rate for Black women increased from 4.9% to 6%. Economists and policy experts said that although they will be watching these numbers, they don’t think the higher unemployment rate for Black people will necessarily continue. The month-to-month data can be volatile and may not point to a broader trend, they said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Black unemployment rate jumped to 6.4% which is the highest since March and then looking at Black women, we saw their unemployment rate jumped to 6% which is the highest that we&#8217;ve seen in 2.5 years,” said Clara Wilson, senior policy analyst at the Groundwork Collaborative, a left-of-center economic think tank. “However, the spike in Black unemployment is something to always keep a track of because if we continue to see a rise in Black unemployment that typically is a warning signal canary in the coal mine that there could be further weakening in the labor market down the line.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retail jobs fell by 28,000, with a loss of 15,000 in general merchandise and 4,000 in electronics and appliance retailers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m not particularly concerned about it because it can be due to the fact that it was just a late Thanksgiving this year, so that holiday hiring may not have happened during the reference period in the same way,” Gould said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Average hourly earnings rose 0.4%, the same as October, and 4% over the past year. Although some economists say the Federal Reserve would like to see wages come down to help it meet its 2% target for inflation, Wilson said higher wages are an indication that workers are benefiting from the current economy. She said she’s worried that the Trump administration will undo some of the economic progress she said has been made from the Biden administration’s major legislation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s really important to remember that real people are behind the data and the strong labor market propels more opportunities for workers and ensures families have higher wages and that leads to a stronger economy. Policymakers should take those lessons that we&#8217;ve learned from those strong public investments and sustain that progress,” Wilson said.</span></p>

A shortage of new homes is driving continued high housing costs, casting doubt on Virginia's future growth. (Parker Michels-Boyce/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Virginia will help fund housing construction near major business developments, Gov. Glenn Younkgin announced this week.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new executive order, on the heels of an announcement about a major manufacturing development near Danville, sets a goal of investing $75 million towards localities that want to bolster housing supply tied to new job creation over the next five years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The private sector is ready to step in and meet the needs of our growing workforce with much needed workforce housing,” Youngkin said in a release announcing his order. “(This) announcement advances these efforts by accelerating workforce housing development and requiring local governments to support the housing growth that Virginia needs.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How the funding will fuel housing supply</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a shortage of about 200,000 affordable housing units and a housing demand of about 4 million units overall, according to a </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/landing-2021-affordable-housing-in-virginia.asp" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and state government </span><a href="https://virginiabusiness.com/byline/department-of-housing-and-community-development/#:~:text=Virginia%20has%20a%20housing%20supply,according%20to%20the%20executive%20order." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the new investments aim to help foster construction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin anticipates his new order can help create about 5,000 units. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/eo/EO---42---Catalyzing-Housing-Development-for-Critical-Workforce-and-Economic-Development-Needs-with-Interagency-Collaboration.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Executive Order 42</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Workforce Housing Investment Program will consist of loans, subsidies and grants for localities and nonprofits to develop new housing near new employers in regions of the state. It also states that localities planning to tap into the Virginia Business Ready Sites Program will need to provide housing plans to demonstrate how they can accommodate job growth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One such example could be near the Berry Hill megasite in Pittsylvania County, which spans over 3,500 acres near Danville and has emerged as a development-ready site that could attract companies to the area. Ahead of Youngkin’s workforce housing announcement, Tennessee-based Microporous </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/11/14/how-big-is-the-microporous-announcement-here-are-11-ways/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced plans </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">for a battery plant at the location that is slated to provide over 2,000 jobs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Danny Marshall, R-Danville, said in an interview this summer that he anticipated the area could be ripe for tapping into various funding opportunities to address the conflation of job growth and housing strains. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Macaulay Porter, a deputy communications director for the governor, noted that while the funding is going to be available statewide, “localities with the highest imbalance of job growth to housing” stand to benefit the most. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysis from the state’s housing department has indicated that feature typically applies to areas in Southwest Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the Virginia Tobacco Region Revitalization Commission had also announced a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/workforce-housing-pilot-launches-to-support-southern-and-southwestern-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">workforce housing funding program </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">over the summer. That pilot program has about $2 million in its coffers to disperse to applicants on a rolling basis.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Virginia Housing and Community Development study from 2022 noted how the state’s </span><a href="https://dmz1.dhcd.virginia.gov/HB854/pdf/hb854-full-report-print.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fastest growing regions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the previous decade were  Northern Virginia, the Northern Shenandoah Valley and central Virginia’s Richmond. Conversely, rural areas of the state saw job losses. Those numbers could change in future census data as economic developments in rural areas attract or retain populations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some of her district entails urban areas, Sen. Lashresce Aird, D-Petersburg, previously told The Mercury that she anticipates rural portions of her district could benefit from workforce and housing development. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Housing continues to be a big strain on how we’re going to get workers to come here,” she said. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the 2025 legislative session on the horizon, lawmakers will continue to work on </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/10/these-new-housing-laws-will-take-effect-next-month/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">various other housing proposals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — ranging from preserving existing affordable housing to rental assistance or protections, to support for ways localities can tap into federal housing development funds. </span></strong></p>

A historic recovery in manufacturing jobs between 2019 and 2023 was concentrated in small urban areas such as McLean County, where Normal is located, and where car and candy factories have added jobs. (Courtesy of Rivian)</p><p>Before the COVID-19 pandemic, McLean County, Illinois, was known mostly as the home of State Farm Insurance in Bloomington and Illinois State University in Normal.</p>
<p>Now, the area illustrates a trend that’s bringing more factories to small cities with lower costs of living: It has thousands of new jobs manufacturing Rivian electric vehicles and a new candy factory that will produce Kinder Bueno and other Ferrero candies.</p>
<p>“Food and electric cars. This is not something we were known for before 2019,” said Patrick Hoban, president of Bloomington-Normal Economic Development Council in McLean County.</p>
<p>“We’re primarily an insurance and university town that’s just now seeing a rise in manufacturing. Rivian has ramped up from 300 to 8,000 employees, and I don’t think anyone realized how fast that was going to happen,” Hoban said.</p>
<p>President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to rebuild American manufacturing, and he won handily in most areas hollowed out by the movement of factory jobs overseas. But the rebound Trump promises has already been underway in many places: McLean County is part of an unusually strong jump in manufacturing jobs between 2019 and 2023 — the first time manufacturing employment has recovered fully from a recession since the 1970s, according to a <a href="https://eig.org/manufacturing-rebound/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent report</a> from the Economic Innovation Group, a bipartisan public policy organization in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>There were about 12.9 million manufacturing jobs in 2023, slightly more than in 2019. However, the number of manufacturing jobs has declined precipitously since the all-time peak in 1979, when there were 19.4 million of them and they were a much larger share of overall employment.</p>
<p><iframe id="datawrapper-chart-Y3XBW" title="U.S. manufacturing jobs" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Y3XBW/5/" height="400" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" aria-label="Interactive line chart" data-external="1" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>Joseph McCartin, a Georgetown University professor and labor history expert, said manufacturing has been on an upswing since 2010 as the nation started recovering from the Great Recession. The pandemic interrupted the trajectory, but the United States recently saw a hopeful increase in pay for the new jobs, he said, as the Biden administration aimed to increase both wages and jobs through the CHIPS and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act.</p>
<p>“The Biden administration tried to use policy to ensure that more of these would be union jobs or at least offer union-level wages,” McCartin said. “This approach is almost certainly dead due to the results of the election.”</p>
<p>Employers may have a hard time filling lower-paying manufacturing jobs such as meat processing if the new Trump administration deports the immigrants who fill them, said William Jones, a University of Minnesota history professor and former president of the Labor and Working Class History Association.</p>
<p>“These will be hard hit if Trump follows up on his deportation plan,” Jones said. “The political rhetoric is that a bunch of native-born workers will move into these jobs, that they’re getting squeezed out, but that’s actually not the case. Some of these industries are extremely dependent on immigrant labor.”</p>
<h4 class="editorialSubhed">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Where growth happened</h4>

	</h4>
<p>Small urban areas such as McLean County got most of the increase in manufacturing jobs between 2019 and 2023, according to the Economic Innovation Group report. Rural areas lost those jobs, and large cities saw no change.</p>
<p>It was mostly Sun Belt and Western states that saw the increases during those years, according to a Stateline analysis of federal Bureau of Labor Statistics data.</p>
<p>The largest percentage changes in manufacturing jobs were in Nevada (up 14%), Utah (up 11%), and Arizona and Florida (each up 9%). The largest raw numbers of new manufacturing jobs were in Texas (up 48,200), Florida (up 35,100) and Georgia (up 22,900).</p>
<p>Southern states such as Alabama and Mississippi also have seen more automotive jobs as manufacturers have taken advantage of lower costs and state “right-to-work” laws that weaken unions. Vehicle manufacturing jumped by 7,800 in Alabama and 6,600 in Mississippi, the largest increases outside California.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, traditional Rust Belt states have seen continued declines, with manufacturing jobs down about 2% in Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, and also in Illinois — despite McLean County’s success.</p>
<p><iframe id="datawrapper-chart-6eENR" title="Manufacturing jobs bounce back after pandemic" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/6eENR/3/" height="594" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" aria-label="Map" data-external="1" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>Manufacturing is playing a critical role in Nevada as it tries to diversify its tourist-oriented economy so it can better weather downturns such as the one during the pandemic, said Steve Scheetz, research manager for the Nevada Governor’s Office of Economic Development.</p>
<p>Automotive and other battery manufacturing and recycling, driven by electric carmaker Tesla and battery recycling firm Redwood Materials, account for much of the increase in Nevada manufacturing, Scheetz said.</p>
<p>As in Illinois, the job growth tended to be in smaller areas outside big cities, such as Storey County, just east of Reno, with a population of about 4,200.</p>
<p>“Fifteen years ago, this small county in rural Nevada was relatively unknown,” Scheetz said, adding that jobs and economic output has risen tenfold and the number of total jobs — including manufacturing — has grown from less than 4,000 to almost 16,000 in those 15 years. The county also is home to plants making building materials, industrial minerals and molded rubber, among other products.</p>
<p>The Biden administration focused on bringing more blue-collar jobs to small cities like Normal and Bloomington, said Jones, the University of Minnesota professor.</p>
<p>“Much of the growth is due to [President Joe] Biden’s manufacturing investments. There was a conscious strategy to focus on small towns to get the political benefit in places that tended to vote Republican,” said Jones.</p>
<p>If there was a play for political benefit, it got mixed results: Vice President Kamala Harris <a href="https://apnews.com/projects/election-results-2024/illinois/?r=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">carried McLean County</a>, Illinois, on Nov. 5, but she lost <a href="https://silverstateelection.nv.gov/county-results/storey.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Storey County</a>, Nevada, by the largest margin for a Democrat in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storey_County,_Nevada" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40 years</a>.</p>
<h4 class="editorialSubhed">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Blue-collar wages</h4>

	</h4>
<p>The decline of unions and the availability of cheaper labor overseas have dampened U.S. factory job wages in recent decades. Even so, manufacturing jobs remain an attractive path for blue-collar workers.</p>
<p>Manufacturing pay still <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1zA74#0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ranks fairly high</a> among the blue-collar fields at an average $34.42 per hour as of October — less than wages in energy ($39.98) or construction ($38.72), but considerably more than hospitality ($22.23) or retail ($24.76). That also was the case in 2019, and it has led many state and cities to seek more factory positions to balance out the lower-paying service jobs that have blossomed as manufacturing has waned.</p>
<p>But in the past year, state Republican leaders have pushed back on a burgeoning Southern labor movement that aims to bring higher wages and better benefits to blue-collar workers.</p>
<p>In Alabama, Republican Gov. Kay Ivey signed a new law in May that would claw back state incentives from companies that voluntarily recognize labor unions. GOP leaders in Georgia and Tennessee also <a href="https://stateline.org/2024/05/20/as-a-key-labor-union-pushes-into-the-south-red-states-push-back/" target="_blank">passed laws</a> pushing against a reinvigorated labor movement, viewing unions as a threat to the states’ manufacturing economies.</p>
<p>Much of the increase in Alabama manufacturing jobs has been in the northern part of the state, near Tennessee and Georgia. Since the pandemic began, Mazda Toyota Manufacturing came on line with the goal of hiring 4,000 vehicle production workers and another 2,000 in nearby parts factories as other manufacturers also boosted hiring. Private investment in Alabama automotive manufacturing totaled $7 billion over the same time frame, Stefania Jones, a spokesperson for state Commerce Secretary Ellen McNair, said in a statement to Stateline.</p>
<p>Supply-chain problems during the pandemic illustrated the advantages of American-made goods, said McCartin, the Georgetown University professor. However, without union support, today’s factory workers are unlikely to achieve the middle-class lifestyle enjoyed by earlier generations, he said.</p>
<p>“The growth of manufacturing itself is unlikely to become a panacea for what ails working-class America,” McCartin said.</p>

(Photo by Kent Nishimura/Getty Images)</p><p>The Federal Reserve cut its key rate on Thursday — one of many factors that will decide what kind of economy Americans remember from President Joe Biden’s final days in office and what  President-elect Donald Trump is left with at the start of his second term.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve cut the rate by a quarter of a percentage point, which was in line with economist expectations. The Federal Open Market Committee’s vote was unanimous in favor of the cut. At its <a href="https://marylandmatters.org/2024/09/19/fed-says-long-awaited-rate-cut-is-apolitical-even-close-to-the-presidential-election/" target="_blank">previous meeting</a> in September, the Fed cut the rate by half a percentage point for the first time in four years as inflation continued to show signs of cooling and moved further toward its target rate of 2%.</p>
<p>Chair Jerome Powell said that the job market remains solid, that economic activity has continued to expand, and that consumer spending is resilient. He said inflation is close to the Fed’s 2% goal, at 2.1% in September, and core inflation, which excludes food and energy, is still elevated, at 2.7%.</p>
<p>“We continue to be confident that with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, strength in the economy and labor market can be maintained with inflation moving sustainably down to 2%,” Powell said.</p>
<p>The Fed’s new benchmark rate is 4.5% to 4.75%. It’s the Fed’s second cut since it paused rates last year following an aggressive rate-hiking campaign to tame inflation. The Fed raised rates 11 times between March 2022 and July 2023.</p>
<p>Dante DeAntonio, labor economist at Moody’s Analytics, said the general public probably won’t feel a significant change from an individual rate cut, but he expects that in the medium-term, the cuts will affect housing and consumer spending.</p>
<p>“I think generally speaking we should expect to see rates across the spectrum come down from credit card rates to auto loans to mortgages but that’s not going to happen in a quick way – day-to-day or month-to-month, and it’s not going to make a huge impact,” he said.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics released a less-than-stellar jobs report Friday, showing the labor market added only <a href="https://michiganadvance.com/2024/11/04/final-report-before-presidential-election-shows-just-12000-jobs-added-after-hurricanes-strikes/" target="_blank">12,000 jobs</a>. But Powell said on Thursday that this was mostly reflective of strikes and major hurricanes, and that job growth would have been higher if not for these factors.</p>
<p>Trump’s election on Tuesday could mean substantial changes for the economy and has implications for the Fed’s own policy choices.</p>
<p>If Trump is able to fully enact ideas he floated while campaigning – such as heavy tariffs on imports from China and mass deportation of immigrants, <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/rhetoric-versus-reality-addressing-common-175649927.html" target="_blank">could reduce</a> households’ purchasing power and harm labor supply, some policy experts, researchers and economists say.</p>
<p>Indivar Dutta-Gupta, who focuses on policy research and seminars at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy, said Trump’s immigration policies could result in a large reduction of labor supply.</p>
<p>“The economy has benefited and native-born workers have benefited in recent years from the growth in workers coming in from abroad. One would expect that to slow and potentially net in the other direction,” Dutta-Gupta said.</p>
<p>Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, said that based on what we know now about Trump’s proposals, the Fed will have to contend with an inflationary environment.</p>
<p>“The policies President Trump espoused on the campaign trail, which include higher broad-based tariffs, mass deportation of unauthorized immigrants already in the country, tax cuts that are largely deficit-financed, and the view that the president should have input into the decision making process of the Federal Reserve around interest rates – all of that is inflationary,” he said.</p>
<p>This could mean that in the future, it’s less likely the Fed would continue to cut rates and would potentially raise rates.</p>
<p>“It all depends on whether President Trump follows through on those things he said during the campaign and to what degree and over what period of time. But all of those things are directionally towards higher inflation, which means higher interest rates than otherwise would be the case,” he added.</p>
<p>Trump has talked about the possibility of the president having greater “say” over the Fed’s decisions on the campaign trail. During his first term in office, he was very <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/31/trump-rails-against-powell-day-after-fed-cuts-rates-for-a-third-time-this-year.html" target="_blank">vocal</a> in his displeasure with some of the Fed’s decisions on interest rates.</p>
<p>In October <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-president-should-weigh-not-order-fed-rate-decisions-2024-10-15/" target="_blank">he said</a> that although he should not be able to order the Fed to make the decisions he favors, “I think I have the right to put in comments as to whether or not the interest rates should go up or down.”</p>
<p>Powell responded to questions about a second Trump administration’s effect on the independence of the Fed on Thursday. When asked if the president can demote him or other leadership at the Fed, he said: “Not permitted under the law.”</p>
<p>The Fed is <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/fed-says-its-long-awaited-rate-cut-apolitical-even-close-presidential-election" target="_blank">designed to operate on data</a>, not politics.</p>
<p>Powell said that the election will have no effects on the Fed’s policy decisions in the near term. He added that the Fed doesn’t yet know the timing or policy substance of the incoming administration.</p>
<p>“We don’t guess, we don’t speculate and we don’t assume,” he said.</p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Port Authority will receive $380 million in federal funding to purchase new zero-emission cargo handling equipment and charging infrastructure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to members of Virginia’s congressional delegation, the funding was provided through the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Clean Ports </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/ports-initiative/cleanports" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">grant program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, stemming from the </span><a href="https://www.energy.gov/lpo/inflation-reduction-act-2022#:~:text=The%20President's%20Inflation%20Reduction%20Act,energy%20manufacturing%2C%20and%20putting%20the" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inflation Reduction Act of 2022</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, designed to address and support environmental issues and climate goals nationwide, and achieve a net-zero economy by 2050. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the Port’s </span><a href="https://www.portofvirginia.com/gateway/environmental-sustainability/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sustainability efforts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, officials said that the grant money will be used to buy and install electric assets and equipment as legacy equipment powered by gasoline or diesel fuel engines is retired.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Port will replace several pieces of equipment including specialized cranes for all rail operations, shuttle carriers for moving containers, electric locomotives, on-terminal trucks and shuttle buses to move people to and from work areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This grant is truly transformative for our port and our community,” said Stephen A. Edwards, CEO and executive director of the Virginia Port Authority in a statement. “It will make our operations more efficient and sustainable, enhance our capabilities and allow us to continue making strides toward becoming the U.S. East Coast’s first net-zero port.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that the Port’s approach to sustainability and efficiency aims to advance opportunities for its workforce and reduce pollution in  communities that host its terminals, in the state’s Tidewater region. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are building the U.S. East Coast’s most modern gateway and this is accelerating economic development and workforce enrichment to ensure that Virginia is not just prepared for, but ahead of the future,” Edwards said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the EPA, the Port of Virginia was one of </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/ports-initiative/clean-ports-program-selections" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">55 applicants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across 27 states and territories, receiving a total of $3 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger, D-Prince William, who said she voted for the Reduction Act to “help build a stronger future for the next generation of Americans,” said in a statement that the investment will help grow the commonwealth’s economy and support the nation’s economic competitiveness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now, I’m proud to see these federal investments coming home to Virginia,” Spanberger said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congressman Bobby Scott, D-Newport News, and Democrat Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, all of whom supported the Act, echoed similar sentiments and stressed that the Port is “critical” to Virginia’s economy and offshore wind industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As the Port of Virginia continues to grow thanks to investments we’re making, we must also ensure we’re reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which result in negative health and environmental impacts for our communities,” the lawmakers said in a statement. The funds for the Port will “further cement Virginia’s place as a leader in clean energy,” they wrote.</span></p>

(Courtesy Port of Virginia)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As experts anticipated, members of the International Longshoremen’s Association went on strike Tuesday, hoping to settle on a new agreement with the United States Maritime Alliance, leaving cargo in limbo at East and Gulf Coast ports, including at the Port of Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Workers want better pay and restrictions on how automation can be used at ports, according to the association. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Representing members working at American ports from Maine to Texas, the association </span><a href="https://ilaunion.org/ila-update-monday-september-30-2024-at-11-am/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Monday that USMX continues to “block the path” towards an agreement by refusing the association’s demands for a “fair and decent contract.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“ILA longshore workers deserve to be compensated for the important work they do keeping American commerce moving and growing,” the association stated. The group is the largest union of maritime workers in North America. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some ILA members work at the Port of Virginia, which suspended operations on Monday in anticipation of the work stoppage. It’s uncertain how long the stoppage will last, or the full impact on delayed shipments of goods to stores and businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts at Sea-Intelligence, a Copenhagen-based shipping advisory firm, </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/possible-us-seaport-strike-could-back-up-goods-months-shipping-experts-say-2024-08-14/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Reuters in August that the backlog from a one-day strike could take between four to six days to clear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our hope is for a speedy resolution that allows The Port of Virginia to implement its resumption of operations plan to methodically and safely bring terminals back online,” representatives of the Port of Virginia said in a </span><a href="https://www.portofvirginia.com/work-stoppage-impact/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until an agreement is reached, the Port of Virginia said operations at the following areas would be closed: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Norfolk International Terminals</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia International Gateway</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Newport News Marine Terminal</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pinners Point Container Yard</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Portsmouth Chassis Yard</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reefer Service Area</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Damage Annex</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The offices of the Virginia Port Authority, Virginia International Terminals and Hampton Roads Chassis Pool II are open according to their regular schedules.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Portsmouth Marine Terminal will remain open. Richmond Marine Terminal and Virginia Inland Port will also stay open, but customers should expect cargo operations to be impacted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to last May’s State of the Port, a total of 3.7 million units of cargo were processed in 2022, a 5% increase since 2021. </span></p>

Every voting bloc will count – including members of labor unions and other people in their households.</p>
<p>The majority of union leaders have over generations <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7591/j.ctv3s8mr0" target="_blank">endorsed Democratic candidates</a>, and <a href="https://theconversation.com/democratic-partys-embrace-of-organized-labor-in-2024-elections-has-long-roots-that-had-started-to-wither-237002" target="_blank">this race is no exception</a>. Although rank-and-file union members have also historically sided with the Democratic Party by large margins, that support has wavered for at least the past 45 years. In 2016, <a href="https://onlabor.org/the-union-household-vote-revisited/" target="_blank">exit polls indicated</a> that voters in union households supported Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton over Trump by only 8 percentage points, down from 18 percentage points in 2012 when Barack Obama was on the ballot.</p>
<p>No Democratic presidential nominee had fared worse with union voters since Ronald <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/labor-unions-hillary-clinton-mobilization-231223" target="_blank">Reagan’s wins over Jimmy Carter and Walter Mondale in 1980 and 1984</a>.</p>
<p>Union voters are particularly <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/union2.pdf" target="_blank">prominent in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Nevada</a>, three swing states where the share of voters who belong to unions is above the national average of 10%.</p>
<p>A late 2023 <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/31/politics/union-voters-election-trump-biden/index.html" target="_blank">New York Times/Siena College poll of six swing states</a> that Joe Biden won in 2020 – those three plus Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin – shows that Biden and Trump were tied at 47% among union voters when they were asked who they’d vote for in 2024. Biden had an <a href="https://cces.gov.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">8 percentage point advantage with these same voters in 2020</a>, according to a different survey.</p>
<h2>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">3 key issues</h4>

	</h2>
<p>Union voters, like all U.S. citizens, are concerned about many issues. But they are more likely than most people to seriously consider a candidate’s record in terms of support for workers and organized labor. Labor historians generally concur that the <a href="https://theconversation.com/bidens-labor-report-card-historian-gives-union-joe-a-higher-grade-than-any-president-since-fdr-228771" target="_blank">Biden administration</a> has the second-strongest labor-friendly record, after Franklin D. Roosevelt.</p>
<p>And I find that <a href="https://prospect.org/labor/2024-07-18-grand-old-party-for-workers/" target="_blank">historian Nelson Lichtenstein, who contends that Trump’s years</a> in office were bad for organized labor, is representative of how labor experts see his track record.</p>
<p>In my view as a labor studies scholar, three aspects of the candidates’ records are the most likely to sway union members one way or the other.</p>
<p><strong>Federal workers</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/10/21/2019-23021/executive-orders-13836-13837-and-13839" target="_blank">Trump signed</a> <a href="https://www.federaltimes.com/management/2018/05/25/trump-targets-feds-in-latest-series-of-executive-orders/" target="_blank">three executive orders in 2018</a> that restricted the labor rights of approximately 950,000 federal government employees who belong to unions. In 2020, he signed another measure, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/02/28/trump-plan-omb-schedule-f-nteu/" target="_blank">known as Schedule F</a>, that The Washington Post described as “designed to gut civil service job protections.”</p>
<p>Biden <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/22/executive-order-protecting-the-federal-workforce." target="_blank">rescinded those executive orders</a>. He also established a White House task force charged with making recommendations for how to streamline the procedures for federal worker union organizing, which Harris chaired. The number of <a href="https://www.afge.org/article/union-membership-in-federal-sector-went-up-in-2023/" target="_blank">federal employees in unions</a> has <a href="https://www.govexec.com/federal-news/2024/07/unpacking-kamala-harris-record-federal-workforce-issues/398226/" target="_blank">risen by tens of thousands</a> during the Biden administration.</p>
<p><strong>Union elections</strong></p>
<p>Rules governing how elections are conducted once workers express an interest in forming a union date back to the 1930s, when Roosevelt signed the <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/guidance/key-reference-materials/national-labor-relations-act" target="_blank">National Labor Relations Act</a> into law. The <a href="https://sunypress.edu/Books/T/The-Making-of-the-National-Labor-Relations-Board2" target="_blank">National Labor Relations Board</a>, created by that legislation, oversees union elections.</p>
<p>In 2019, when Trump appointees held a majority of the NLRB’s five seats, the board overturned an Obama-era NLRB ruling mandating speedy elections. In 2023, when Biden’s appointees were in the majority, the board issued a ruling favorable to unions that rolled back that Trump-era ruling.</p>
<p>Today, when a majority of workers in a workplace say they want union representation, an employer must either recognize and bargain with the union or seek an election. If that employer violates labor law in the period before the election, the election is called off and the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/nlrb-restores-obama-era-rule-speeding-up-union-election-process-2023-08-24/" target="_blank">NLRB may order the employer</a> to recognize and bargain with the union.</p>
<p><strong>OSHA</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.osha.gov/aboutosha" target="_blank">Occupational Safety and Health Administration</a>, a Labor Department agency, is responsible for U.S. workers’ health and safety.</p>
<p>Fewer workplace inspections occurred during the Trump administration than during <a href="https://www.osha.gov/enforcement/2015-enforcement-summary" target="_blank">Obama’s second term</a>. This decline is largely attributable to the slow hiring of new OSHA inspectors to <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/8/18/21366388/osha-worker-safety-trump" target="_blank">replace those who had retired</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/safety/inspector-numbers-up-20-during-biden-administration-osha-says" target="_blank">number of inspections is rising again</a>. However, by OSHA’s calculations, workplace accidents and fatalities have <a href="https://publicintegrity.org/politics/system-failure/deaths-cutbacks-workplace-safety-inspections-osha/" target="_blank">increased during the Biden administration</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/03/02/osha-inspections-covid-oig-report/" target="_blank">Trump administration issued no workplace rules</a> about coronavirus safety, leaving hundreds of thousands of people employed in health care, groceries, meatpacking and education at risk.</p>
<p>By comparison, two days after taking office in 2021, Biden issued an executive order that established masking guidelines, and his administration <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/agencies/asa/hhs-covid-19-workplace-safety-plan/index.html" target="_blank">made health and safety protocols on the job</a> during the rest of the COVID-19 pandemic a high priority.</p>
<p>Compared with the inaction by the Trump administration during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Biden administration has been more active in proposing health and safety measures. For example, in July 2024 it proposed rules designed to protect some 36 million workers from <a href="https://www.osha.gov/news/newsreleases/national/07022024" target="_blank">health risks associated with extreme heat</a>. After a period for written comments, public hearings will be held on the bill.</p>
<p>When Trump tried cutting OSHA funding for 2018 by approximately US$10 million, Congress blocked his efforts. The Biden administration is <a href="https://www.safetyandhealthmagazine.com/articles/25147-biden-administration-seeking-a-37-budget-increase-for-osha" target="_blank">seeking a 3.7% increase in OSHA’s budget</a> for the 2025 fiscal year.</p>
<h2>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Legislative and gubernatorial records</h4>

	</h2>
<p>Harris was a U.S. senator before she became vice president; her vice presidential running mate, Tim Walz, is the governor of Minnesota and was a member of Congress before that; and Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance is currently a U.S. senator as well. The candidates’ records in those positions are also indicators of what they might attempt to do in the White House.</p>
<p>The AFL-CIO, the largest umbrella organization for U.S. unions, gave Harris a <a href="https://aflcio.org/scorecard/legislators/kamala-harris" target="_blank">lifetime score of 98%</a> on her Senate voting record. <a href="https://aflcio.org/scorecard/legislators/tim-walz" target="_blank">Walz</a> got a 93% rating for his votes from the AFL-CIO when he served in the House of Representatives. He belonged to the <a href="https://www.nea.org/about-nea/media-center/press-releases/nea-endorses-vp-walz" target="_blank">National Education Association</a>, the nation’s largest labor union, while working as a high school teacher.</p>
<p>As Minnesota’s governor, Walz signed into law <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/06/nx-s1-5065626/labor-unions-tim-walz-minnesota-running-mate-vp" target="_blank">paid sick days for the state’s workers</a> and a measure that made Minnesota the first state to establish a minimum wage for Uber and Lyft drivers. In 2023, Walz also signed a law that established the Nursing Home Workforce Standards Board to oversee the health and welfare of nursing home workers.</p>
<p>The AFL-CIO has given <a href="https://aflcio.org/scorecard/legislators/jd-vance" target="_blank">Vance a 0%</a> rating for his Senate votes as of mid-2024. Among other things, Vance opposed the nominations of several judges and government officials with pro-labor track records.</p>
<h2>Addressing auto workers</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most visible sign of <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/biden-makes-history-striking-auto-workers-picket-line-rcna117348" target="_blank">Biden’s support for labor unions</a> came when he walked a Michigan picket line with striking members of the United Auto Workers in September 2023. He was the first president to do so.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/sep/27/donald-trump-michigan-uaw-autoworkers" target="_blank">Trump turned up nearby</a> the next day. He gave a speech at a nonunion auto parts plant.</p>
<p>More recently, Trump did himself no favors with labor voters and their allies when, in a highly publicized conversation with Tesla, SpaceX and X CEO Elon Musk, <a href="https://x.com/UAW/status/1823343962012123254" target="_blank">he praised Musk for firing employees</a> who <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-and-musk-discussed-firing-striking-workers-the-uaw-is-now-seeking-an-nlrb-investigation" target="_blank">spoke out on workplace problems</a> and attempted to unionize.</p>
<p>How union households will vote in 2024 is not clear. But there’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/29/swing-states-candidate-visits-summer/" target="_blank">no doubt that the Harris and Trump campaigns</a> are certain that it will matter, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/silver-bulletpoints-the-union-vote-could-swing-the-election/" target="_blank">just as it did in 2020</a>, when Biden narrowly won <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/11/10/joe-biden-flipped-blue-wall-states-michigan-wisconsin-pennsylvania/6221295002/" target="_blank">Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania</a> – and in 2016, when Clinton lost those states.</p>

Some economists believe the central bank has waited too long to cut rates. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)</p><p>The unemployment rate climbed to 4.3% in July, up 0.2% from June, the Friday employment <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows, alarming some economists who believe the Federal Reserve has waited too long to cut interest rates.</p>
<p>The economy added 114,000 jobs and the number of people who were on temporary layoff rose by 249,000. The economy continued to add jobs in health care, social assistance and construction. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the addition of government jobs slowed down in the past few months and was little changed in July, with the sector’s jobs increasing by 17,000 jobs.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen for several months a bit of softening in the labor market even though it is quite strong by historical standards …,” said Elise Gould, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-of-center economic think tank. “There’s been no inflationary pressures coming from the labor market as wage growth continues to decelerate.”</p>
<p>Gould added that she thinks the Fed has waited too long to cut interest rates given what the labor market data shows.</p>
<p>“The softening is a little bit more concerning and we might be getting there sooner, that sort of cooling, than is necessary,” she said.</p>
<p>The Fed decided not to cut rates during its most recent meeting, it announced on Wednesday. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank  still needs to see more data showing that inflation is dropping enough to justify cutting rates. Despite recent upticks in the unemployment rate, Powell said the labor market was normalizing from a hotter job market. But he indicated that it is possible the Fed will be ready to cut rates by September.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen one quarter of good inflation and we’ve seen the labor market move quite a bit. As I mentioned, I don’t think it needs to cool off any more for us to get the inflation results that are related to the labor market … That time could be in September if the data supported that,” he said.</p>
<p>Powell added that he did not see evidence in the economic data that the economy is “sharply weakening.”</p>
<p>The Fed began raising interest rates in March of 2022 to combat inflation but stopped raising rates in the fall of last year. The Fed <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20230920a.htm" target="_blank">said</a> it was still attentive to getting inflation back down to its target of 2% but also needed to meet its dual mandate, which includes maximum employment. The Fed has used higher interest rates as a tool to cool the economy when it has seen it as heating too quickly, but it is often a controversial one because of the risks it presents to the labor market. In June, the inflation measure most valued by the Fed, the personal consumption expenditures price index, <a href="https://www.bea.gov/news/2024/personal-income-and-outlays-june-2024" target="_blank">rose</a> 0.1% and increased 2.5% over the past 12 months.</p>
<p>Although economists say that the economy is in a healthy place, that can change quickly, and many have advised the Fed to stay cautious to that risk by cutting rates quickly and deeply. Although inflation has squeezed families, high interest rates have also affected the <a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2024/07/26/u-s-home-prices-hit-a-record-high-as-sales-fell-heres-how-housing-experts-explain-the-trends/" target="_blank">housing market</a>, where homeownership remains out of reach for many and rent has climbed as a result of greater demand in the rental market. Higher interest rates have also been a source of frustration for families because it has increased the cost of borrowing money, economists told States Newsroom.</p>
<p>“The consequence of having an extremely high interest rate for a really, really long time is that the labor market starts to crack. That’s what high interest rates are designed to do,” said Dr. Rakeen Mabud, chief economist at the Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive think tank. “It’s always anyone’s guess about exactly when that crack will open up into a giant chasm, and I hope we don’t get to that point. But I think the longer that the Fed keeps rates high, the more they’re playing chicken with people’s lives.”</p>
<p>Mabud added that she does not see how the root causes of inflation will be addressed by the Fed keeping rates where they are, since she attributes them to factors outside of the Fed’s control, including supply chain issues, a shift in demand because of the pandemic, and <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2024/03/08/looking-toward-november-biden-targets-shrinkflation-in-state-of-the-union-speech/" target="_blank">companies</a> that used “their market power and inflation to jack up prices.”</p>
<p>Economists have been paying close attention to the unemployment rate because the Sahm rule, a measure  to figure out whether the country is entering a recession, was triggered by the current unemployment rate.  The Sahm <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SAHMREALTIME" target="_blank">rule</a> is when the unemployment rate moves up by certain percentage points compared to previous employment data. July’s unemployment rate has entered into the territory that economists say “triggers” the rule. Still, there may be reason not to panic just yet.</p>
<p>Gould said that in the case of this report, it’s key to understand that the unemployment rate can rise because people who were not counted as part of the labor force, because they were not actively looking for work, are coming back into it and being included in the group of people who are unemployed.</p>
<p>“People are feeling optimistic about their job opportunities. They’re coming back in or they’re entering the labor force for the first time trying to find jobs, and many of them did not find jobs in July, but they are feeling good about it,” Gould said.</p>
<p>Jesse Rothstein, professor of public policy and economics at the University of California, Berkeley, said it may be time for the Fed to adjust its policy and put the foot back on the gas of the economy.</p>
<p>“This is a kind of softening that we haven’t really seen before,” he said. “It’s not quite as quick as it’s been when we go into recessions, despite triggering the Sahm rule. We’ve been aiming for a soft landing and I think the Fed has been doing an extremely good job of that so far, but a soft landing requires frequent kinds of small adjustments.”</p>
<p>The labor market has shown encouraging signs for the fight to slow inflation. Wages have increased by 3.6% from a year ago. Gould said 3.6% is the lowest gain economists have seen in two years, which shows that there are not inflationary pressures in wages for the Fed to worry about in this report. The news for workers isn’t all bad either.</p>
<p>“You can applaud nominal wage growth decelerating because we saw inflation come down faster and so real wages continue to rise. When we think about workers’ living standards, even though we’re seeing that deceleration, living standards are increasing and have been for over well over a year now on average because inflation came down much faster,” she said.</p>

Kaela Berg, a Democrat, listens this week to testimony on a mental health education bill during a House Education Policy Committee meeting at the Minnesota State Capitol in St. Paul, Minn. Berg, a single mother and flight attendant without a college degree, is one of the few state lawmakers across the nation who qualify as “working class,” according to recent research. (Michelle Griffith/Minnesota Reformer)</p><p>In her first few months as a Minnesota state legislator in 2021, state Rep. Kaela Berg often wondered: “What the hell am I doing here?”</p>
<p>A single mother and flight attendant without a college degree or prior political experience, Berg now had a seat at the legislative table, shaping policy decisions in her home state.</p>
<p>As she ran against a former two-term Republican representative — a commercial real estate agent — she also was struggling for housing and living in a friend’s basement.</p>
<p>“I’m living in [her] basement, running for office, and the pandemic hits,” said Berg. “I went from three jobs to one. … I found that while I can pay my bills, I can’t qualify for a new apartment because you have to show two or three times the rent and I can’t do that.”</p>
<p>While it was gratifying to receive support from working families in her district, her transition to state policymaker felt overwhelming.</p>
<p>“I had the worst case of impostor syndrome,” Berg, a member of Minnesota’s Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, said in an interview. “I’m thinking, ‘Who do I think I am? I’m a working flight attendant. I don’t have a college degree. Why did I let somebody talk me into this?’”</p>
<p>Berg is a rarity in politics: a working-class state legislator.</p>
<p>Just 116 of the nearly 7,400 state legislators in the United States come from working-class backgrounds, <a href="https://today.duke.edu/2024/02/less-2-percent-state-legislators-are-working-class" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to </a><a href="https://today.duke.edu/2024/02/less-2-percent-state-legislators-are-working-class" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a </a><a href="https://today.duke.edu/2024/02/less-2-percent-state-legislators-are-working-class" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bi</a><a href="https://today.duke.edu/2024/02/less-2-percent-state-legislators-are-working-class" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ennial study</a> conducted by Nicholas Carnes and Eric Hansen, political scientists at Duke University and Loyola University Chicago, respectively.</p>
<p>The researchers <a href="https://today.duke.edu/2024/02/less-2-percent-state-legislators-are-working-class" target="_blank" rel="noopener">define legislators as “working class”</a> if they currently or last worked in manual labor, service industry, clerical or labor union jobs. They found that 1.6% of state lawmakers meet that definition, compared with 50% of U.S. workers. Only about 2% of Democrats and 1% of Republicans qualified as working class.</p>
<p>Ten states — Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Virginia — have no working-class state lawmakers.</p>
<p>The dearth of working-class legislators raises concerns that economic challenges such as wage stagnation and the rising cost of living will get short shrift in state capitols.</p>

<p>Working-class politicians are more likely to have personally experienced economic hardship, so they are more interested in policies to mitigate it, Carnes said. And they often propose solutions that differ from those put forward by colleagues who aren’t working class, even if it means diverging from party doctrine.</p>
<p>“State legislatures make consequential decisions, and if you have an entire economic class of people that are not in the room when policy decisions are being made, that’s going to tilt the kind of problems politicians pay attention to,” said Carnes. “It also dictates the kinds of solutions they consider against the interests of whoever’s out of the room.”</p>
<p>Working-class representation in state legislatures has always been low, he noted, but the most recent count is even lower than it was two years ago, when the percentage was about 1.8%.</p>
<p>The state legislature with the highest percentage of working-class lawmakers is Alaska, with 5% — that’s three of 60 lawmakers. Maine has the highest total number of working-class legislators, eight of 151 legislators, with a <a href="https://hobbs.mainecandidate.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transportation worker</a> and <a href="https://legislature.maine.gov/housedems/supical/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a bartender</a> among the ranks.</p>

<p>After a 32-year career as an electrician, Democratic state Rep. Nate Roberts was part of a new wave of <a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2022/11/11/idaho-legislative-leaders-try-to-prepare-for-session-where-1-in-3-lawmakers-are-rookies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first-time Idaho lawmakers entering </a><a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2022/11/11/idaho-legislative-leaders-try-to-prepare-for-session-where-1-in-3-lawmakers-are-rookies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">office</a><a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2022/11/11/idaho-legislative-leaders-try-to-prepare-for-session-where-1-in-3-lawmakers-are-rookies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> in 2023</a>.</p>
<p>Roberts knew that it wasn’t just his relative political inexperience that separated him from the rest of his colleagues.</p>
<p>He also was one of the only state lawmakers who had worked a union job. And during his first few weeks in office, he was shocked by how rarely issues such as wage theft, low pay and housing affordability had been talked about in committee meetings.</p>
<figure id="attachment_38139" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/working-class-Roberts-768x512-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-38139 size-medium" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/working-class-Roberts-768x512-1-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/working-class-Roberts-768x512-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/working-class-Roberts-768x512-1.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Nate Roberts is a longtime electrician who won a seat in the Idaho legislature.

<p>“That’s when I realized that the only person that’s going to advocate for working-class people is a working-class person,” he told Stateline. “When I moved from state to state working different jobs, I realized how differently states were influenced when it came to policies for working people.”</p>
<p>Roberts learned the power of unions as a journeyman — and fighting to increase worker protections has become his life, he said.</p>
<p>Idaho is one of 26 so-called right-to-work states, where no person can be forced, as a condition of employment, to join a union. Such laws limit unions’ bargaining power.</p>
<p>Roberts would like Idaho to follow the lead of Michigan, which in 2023 <a href="https://apnews.com/article/right-to-work-repeal-michigan-democrats-b4304a2780909d37e76f211c7b070a6b#:~:text=Michigan%20becomes%20the%20first%20state,there%20restored%20it%20in%202012." target="_blank" rel="noopener">became the first state</a> in decades to <a href="https://michiganadvance.com/2023/03/15/workers-flock-to-see-right-to-work-reversal-prevailing-wage-restoration-pass-michigan-senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repeal</a> a right-to-work law. That is unlikely in Idaho, given the state’s conservative political orientation. But Roberts also is pushing to update Idaho’s child labor laws, which were enacted in 1907 and have been superseded by the federal Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.</p>
<p>Roberts said his experience as a laborer in his younger years has emboldened him to speak out against legislation such as a Senate <a href="https://legislature.idaho.gov/sessioninfo/2024/legislation/s1300/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bill</a> that would repeal limits on the number of hours and how late in the day a child under the age of 16 can work.</p>
<p>“I’m still shocked when I get pushback for going against these bills, particularly ones that I feel regress our child labor laws,” said Roberts. “I’ve experienced it. We need to not only protect our kids, but we also need to protect our workers.”</p>

<p>The political climate is far different in Minnesota, where the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party has controlled the governor’s office, the state House and the state Senate since January 2023. Last year, the state enacted a <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2023/05/17/labor-victory-minnesota-lawmakers-approve-9-major-worker-friendly-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major package of labor-friendly laws</a>.</p>
<p>Minnesota also passed a slew of tenant-landlord laws, with <a href="https://stateline.org/2023/09/26/amid-rising-evictions-and-rents-states-grapple-with-protections-in-tenant-landlord-laws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protections favoring the state’s renters</a>.</p>
<p>Berg said the backgrounds of working-class legislators like herself can inform statehouse conversations, even if lawmakers with different backgrounds support pro-labor policies.</p>
<p>“I don’t think there’s enough value in having people with lived experience in the legislature,” Berg said. “When you take someone who … still lives paycheck to paycheck, they are bringing that personal experience to fight for a bill that will impact working families.”</p>
<p>For Wisconsin state Rep. Jenna Jacobson, joining the legislature in 2023 was a lot like “drinking from a fire hose,” she recalled.</p>
<p>One of her policy priorities — expanding aid for <a href="https://www.billtrack50.com/billdetail/1651957" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free school meals</a> — was influenced by her experience as a schoolkid.</p>
<p>“I was one of the kids on free and reduced lunches growing up. I had the special colored cards because of that,” said Jacobson, a Democrat. “I know so many of our kids who are in a similar spot.”</p>
<h4 class="editorialSubhed">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Barriers abound</h4>

	</h4>
<p>For working-class Americans, financial and societal barriers are a major disincentive to pursuing state offices, said Amanda Litman, co-founder and co-executive director of Run for Something, a progressive organization that recruits candidates for down-ballot races.</p>
<p>A 2021 <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0160323X221130449" target="_blank" rel="noopener">national survey</a> by Tufts University found that local candidates who experienced poverty in their youth felt especially constrained.</p>
<p>“Structurally, it’s really hard for people who aren’t already rich, or already independently wealthy, have rich partners or rich families to enter politics,” Litman said. “And the gatekeepers at the state level have typically recruited candidates who were safe bets, which is a candidate who can independently raise money.”</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" title="“More Hispanic families are reaching the middle class” — Stateline" src="https://stateline.org/2023/12/18/more-hispanic-families-are-reaching-the-middle-class/embed/#?secret=EQzQqyctuB#?secret=unHVasKEQH" width="500" height="388" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-scripts" data-secret="unHVasKEQH" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>The eligibility criteria for statewide office <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/eligibility-requirements-to-run-for-the-state-legislature" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vary greatly by state</a>. Only five states — Arizona, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine and Minnesota — allow <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/public-financing-of-campaigns-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public financing options</a> for candidates vying for state legislative seats.</p>
<p>Becoming comfortable wielding political power as a working-class person is a transition that can take a while, Indiana Republican state Rep. Peggy Mayfield told Stateline.</p>
<p>Mayfield, who worked as a secretary at the insurance company she and her husband owned together, is now a 12-year veteran in the legislature who knows how to navigate state politics and get bills passed.</p>
<p>But running for office, much less holding state office, is time-consuming and requires sacrifices, she said.</p>
<p>“If I had an employee who came to me and said, ‘I wanna run for office,’ I’m faced with saying, ‘I’m gonna let you off four months a year,’ or make a difficult choice,” said Mayfield, describing how hard it is for many workers who don’t have that privilege. “Running for office itself becomes a full-time job … and for some in the working class it may not make sense to go into politics, if they can pursue more profitable opportunities in the private sector.”</p>
<p>Some states have worked to raise legislative pay, which could entice more working-class people to take a shot at elective office.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Kansas <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2024-02-08/kansas-lawmakers-are-allowing-a-93-pay-raise-for-themselves-to-take-effect-next-year" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised salaries</a> for rank-and-file lawmakers from about $29,000 to $57,000 after some said the lower pay wasn’t enough to live on. <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/restricted/?return=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.azcentral.com%2Fstory%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2Flegislature%2F2024%2F02%2F23%2Faz-lawmakers-want-to-increase-salaries-for-state-elected-officials%2F72700150007%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arizona</a>, <a href="https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/record/24rs/hb396.html#:~:text=House%20Bill%20396,-Actions&amp;text=AN%20ACT%20relating%20to%20compensation%20of%20members%20of%20the%20General%20Assembly." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kentucky</a>, <a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2024/01/04/new-jersey-lawmakers-eyeing-big-pay-raises-for-themselves/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Jersey</a> and <a href="https://legislature.vermont.gov/bill/status/2024/S.224" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vermont</a> are among the states with measures this session that could increase lawmakers’ pay.</p>
<p>New York passed legislation in 2022 that made <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-new-york-state-government-california-kathy-hochul-32de11eab6133e10899f14467822a2c2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its</a><a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-new-york-state-government-california-kathy-hochul-32de11eab6133e10899f14467822a2c2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> lawmakers the highest</a> <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-new-york-state-government-california-kathy-hochul-32de11eab6133e10899f14467822a2c2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paid in the country</a>. <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2023/12/pennsylvania-legislature-automatic-pay-increase-cost-of-living-adjustment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pennsylvania</a> has cost-of-living adjustments.</p>
<p>Roberts, the electrician-turned-lawmaker in Idaho, said: “We don’t do this for the pay, and some of us certainly aren’t getting rich off this job. Some of us are making ends meet.</p>
<p>“But we have residents who are also making ends meet, and they rely on us to speak on the issues affecting them, and that’s what keeps you going,” Roberts added.</p>
<p>Lawmakers in Idaho make $19,927, after a pay raise <a href="https://www.lmtribune.com/northwest/idaho-lawmakers-to-get-2-75-raise-each-of-next-two-years/article_e2b33a2f-4db8-5c49-a522-f93ee0941edb.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed in 2022</a>.</p>
<p>Another barrier for would-be working-class lawmakers, Carnes said, is running a viable campaign against more established political candidates. The working class needs infrastructure and coalition-building to compete politically, he said, similar to women candidates who get support from EMILY’s List (a pro-abortion rights group).</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" title="“‘Who’s going to work there?’: Lawmakers grapple with labor shortages” — Stateline" src="https://stateline.org/2023/08/22/whos-going-to-work-there-lawmakers-grapple-with-labor-shortages/embed/#?secret=quSkwWiakC#?secret=wbk4FgEwNc" width="500" height="437" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-scripts" data-secret="wbk4FgEwNc" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>“The solution is pretty straightforward,” said Carnes. “If you commit to working-class people and partner with labor unions and political parties on recruiting and training working-class people to run for office — it’s possible you will see more working-class state legislators.”</p>
<p>In Minnesota, Rep. Berg soon realized that her best legislative asset was her ability to vouch for the working experiences of everyday Minnesotans.</p>
<p>A flight attendant for Endeavor Air, Berg has signed on to a <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/bill.php?b=House&amp;f=HF3882&amp;ssn=0&amp;y=2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bill</a> that, among other provisions, would delete the exemption for air flight crews in the state’s law on employee sick time. Her experience allowed her to confidently explain to legislative peers how the exemption had hurt flight crews.</p>
<p>“Government works best when all types of personal experience are at the legislative table,” Berg said. “I knew that I was uniquely able to speak on issues that my other colleagues never experienced.”</p>

Jennifer Boysko again presented legislation to require employers to list a wage or salary range in all job postings and prohibit them from asking prospective employees for a salary history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is the eighth time I have introduced this legislation,” Boysko told the Senate Commerce and Labor Committee before vowing to keep reintroducing the measure until it reaches the governor’s desk. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boysko has pitched </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB370" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 370</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a way to help remedy gender pay gaps by deterring employers from relying on prior salaries to craft future compensation. The idea is that because women in Virginia as a group still make less than men, basing salary offers on past wages could perpetuate those disparities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Salary history is often a reflection of past discrimination,” Emily Yen, a lobbyist for the Virginia Education Association, told lawmakers.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last April, </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/regions/mid-atlantic/news-release/womensearnings_virginia.htm#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20Virginia%20women%20who,of%20Labor%20Statistics%20reported%20today." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that in Virginia, the median usual weekly earnings of women who worked full-time were 80% of what their male counterparts received. Full-time workers were considered people who usually worked 35 or more hours per week at their sole or principal job. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women’s labor advocates have also argued requiring employers to disclose wage or salary ranges provides needed transparency that can dampen inequalities by putting male and female applicants on more equal footing in compensation negotiations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When employers negotiate without giving salary range information to job applicants, applicants are more likely to rely on their past pay as a negotiation reference point, which perpetuates existing pay gaps,” </span><a href="https://nwlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/NWLC-Pay-Range-Transparency-Factsheet_2023-1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote the National Women’s Law Center in a brief</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boysko’s legislation would not prohibit prospective employees from “voluntarily disclosing wage or salary history, including for the purpose of negotiating wages or salary after an initial offer of employment.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employers who violated the new rules would be subject to civil penalties of between $1,000 and $4,000, depending on their history of violations, as well as potential damages. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate committee passed Boysko’s legislation on a 9-6 party-line vote after concerns from Republicans about whether the bill offered employers a right to appeal any violation determinations by the state Commissioner of Labor and Industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you’re having a penalty, you should be able to appeal it to a court,” said Senate Minority Leader Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill was amended in committee to outline an appeals process. It now heads to the Senate Finance and Appropriations Committee for review. </span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislation to raise the state minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2026 is moving briskly through the Virginia General Assembly as Democrats take advantage of their narrow majorities in both chambers to complete an effort they began in 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a simple bill,” said Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville, who chairs the Senate Commerce and Labor Committee. “It just reenacts what we did before.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carried by Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, as </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Jeion Ward</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, D-Hampton, as </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the legislation is a signature priority of Democrats this session and would bring the wage to $13.50 in 2025 and $15 in 2026. The measure cleared the Senate and House committees on labor and commerce this week on party-line votes and is headed to the chamber’s money committees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But while Democrats have the numbers to pass the increases out of the General Assembly, they fall short of what they would need to override a possible veto from Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin. Asked about the governor’s stance on the proposals, spokesperson Christian Martinez said only that Youngkin “will review any legislation that comes to his desk.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, when the party held more decisive control of the legislature and was backed by Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam, Democrats pushed through bills </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/03/08/virginia-lawmakers-vote-to-raise-the-minimum-wage-to-12/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raising the state minimum wage incrementally</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the $7.25 federal floor to $12 by 2023. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But because the chambers disagreed on how high the wage should go — House Democrats wanted $15, while the Senate was in favor of $11.50 and resulting smaller increases that varied regionally — the final law delayed further hikes until 2024, when the General Assembly would again be required to endorse them. It also asked for a study on whether regionally set minimum wages could be workable.   </span></p>
<p><a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2023/SD6/PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">That study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wasn’t completed until December 2023, and during debate in the Senate Commerce and Labor Committee Monday, many senators seemed unaware of its publication. Its findings indicated that a half-million Virginians were making $12 or less in 2021, with $1 million making $15 or less. Minimum wage workers were “younger, more likely to be female, less educated, and more likely to belong to a racial and ethnic minority than the total labor force.” They were most prevalent in Southwest Virginia and least prevalent in Northern Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cost of living also varied widely: The study found that at the highest end of the spectrum, a family in Alexandria needed to earn $22.42 per hour to afford basic necessities, while at the lowest end, a Tazewell family needed $14.55 per hour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As to whether regional variation in a minimum wage might offer a solution, the report was uncertain. “There is not conclusive evidence demonstrating the clear advantage or disadvantage of a regional minimum wage over a statewide minimum wage,” it found. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans expressed unease over the varied impacts the wage hikes could have on less affluent parts of the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We ought to look at the impact of this legislation on other areas of the state first,” said Sen. Mark Obenshain, R-Harrisonburg, who described the bill as “an example of shooting first and asking questions later.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats, however, argued that cost of living hikes due to inflation have increased the urgency of the wage bumps. Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, noted that according to the </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ inflation calculator</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, $12 in July 2020 was equal to $14.21 in December 2023.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re just actually keeping up with inflation barely with this change,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the House Labor and Commerce Committee, Republicans and business groups said Thursday that increasing the minimum wage would lead to problems with wage compression and further drive up costs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you continue to ratchet up the cost of labor, you’re just going to continue to ratchet up the cost of products,” said Del. Wren Williams, R-Patrick. “You’re just going to create more struggle.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, Del. Tony Wilt, R-Harrisonburg, said, “It appears that as the wage goes up, the cost of living is going to go up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you ever see us getting ahead where folks are saying, ‘I make enough money, I’m good’?” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats countered that they had heard many of the same fears in response to the 2020 law beginning the wage increases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Those of us who were here when [Ward] led the last effort to do this remember all the hand-wringing and the predictions that people were going to lose their jobs and the economy was going to tank and businesses were going to shutter,” said Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax. “Well, I’ve sat through several speeches that our governor has given the last several months touting, thankfully, historic low unemployment in Virginia. Wages are up, incomes are up, more Virginians are working than ever before. Those predictions of doom and gloom just have not happened.”</span></p>

<p>Friday’s jobs data showed a strong, resilient U.S. labor market with wages outpacing inflation — welcome news for Americans hoping to have more purchasing power in 2024.</p>
<p>The December jobs report unveiled another unemployment rate below 4%, as it has for two years, at 3.7%, the same as it was for November. The economy added 216,000 jobs, many of which were concentrated in health care, local government, construction and social assistance, which includes child care, social workers and home care aides, <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm" target="_blank">according</a> to the Bureau of Labor Statistics data.</p>
<p>Democrats celebrated the news and took it as an opportunity to voice their frustrations with Republicans as policymakers grapple with another possible government shutdown over <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/house-gop-resolves-to-shut-down-the-border-or-shut-down-the-government-in-16-days-220548866.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJvtFqMbXEixD7zsawwn8fbWf86qFE8j35WYaNBvL8QtTy8WumYTyvQZ2LqOZShhk2o9D_Vmw5UU5u3EQqr0ISxtpuNEhjTTG9NKRJ4JWAH0_4V1pn1K5XjqN-jnByuJmi3IkTjwqc1Yh96T9vDy07Tu-1GRdA6TWwGVQam1oJnM" target="_blank">U.S.-Mexico border policy</a> and other issues. Congress has <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2024/01/05/congress-was-full-of-postponements-in-2023-now-2024-could-be-even-less-productive/" target="_blank">deadlines</a> of Jan. 19 for four government spending bills and Feb. 2 for eight government spending bills.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/01/05/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-the-december-jobs-report/#:~:text=Statement%20from%20President%20Joe%20Biden%20on%20the%20December%20Jobs%20Report,-Home&amp;text=This%20morning%27s%20report%20confirms%20that,year%20of%20the%20prior%20Administration" target="_blank">stated</a> on Friday morning that the jobs data “confirms that 2023 was a great year for American workers.”</p>
<p>“The strong job creation continued even as inflation fell to the pre-pandemic level of 2 percent over the last six months …,” he added.</p>
<p>Rep. Bobby Scott (D-VA), ranking member of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, touted the strong jobs report and stated, “Now is not the time to reverse our progress on the economy. I remain committed to opposing any effort that gambles with the lives of everyday Americans in order to engage in political grandstanding.”</p>
<p>Economists and data analysts provided States Newsroom with their takeaways on key news in the report, from wages to job growth in healthcare.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Wage growth and cooling inflation provide relief</h4>

	
<p>Wages are outpacing inflation, with average hourly earnings increasing by 15 cents and rising by 4.1% over the past year, well over <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm" target="_blank">3.1%</a> inflation. With inflation coming down fairly quickly, wages are solidly above inflation, economists said.</p>
<p>Moody’s Analytics Chief Economist Mark Zandi said wage growth is now firmly above the rate of inflation, which means people’s real purchasing power is improving.</p>
<p>“They got creamed back in 2021 and particularly in 2022 when inflation outpaced wages,” Zandi said. “And I think that’s one reason why people are so uncomfortable with their financial position, but that’s improving now and improving very quickly as wage growth remains strong and firm and inflation is lower and continues to moderate.”</p>
<p>Elise Gould, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, added that lower wage workers in particular have seen that increased purchasing power for longer.</p>
<p>“For the last six months, the average hourly earnings for private sector workers has been beating inflation so their purchasing power has increased and on average, over the last few months, we also know from other data that lower wage workers have been seeing stronger wage growth,” she said. “They’ve been beating inflation for a lot longer. Overall, the purchasing power has certainly been increasing as inflation has been coming down faster.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Health care and government continue to add jobs </h4>

	
<p>The government workforce grew by 52,000 people with the majority of those jobs — 37,000 — in local governments.  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average gains of jobs per month in 2023 was more than double the average for job growth in 2022.</p>
<p>Gould said there still seems to be room for government employment to continue to grow.</p>
<p>“We still have a lot of catching up to do there because when we think about government employment, it has not kept up with population growth in any way,” she said. “You would think that the services that are being provided by the government would need to grow even more. So I think there’s a fair amount of room there that we are not back to normal in that sense.”</p>
<p>Health care also continues to see job growth, which Gould expects to continue partly because of the U.S.’s aging population. Health care jobs rose by 38,000 in December. Ambulatory health care services and hospitals added 19,000 jobs and 15,000 jobs, respectively.</p>
<p>Zandi sees these sectors as mostly playing catchup after the private sector crowded out some of these jobs during the recovery by offering higher pay.</p>
<p>“Private businesses were willing to pay up big wage increases to hold on to workers and hire new ones,” he said. “And that was impossible for local governments or for hospitals to keep up with. But now that the private sector is fully recovered, we’re now starting to see these other sectors be able to hire again, find workers and bring them on the payrolls.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Economists watch for signs of a slowdown</h4>

	
<p>Economists had mixed responses to the changes in the labor force participation rate and employment-population ratio, which both fell 0.3% percentage point in December. The labor force participation rate sheds light on the economy through the percentage of working age people in the labor force, which includes both those actively seeking work and people who are currently employed. The employment-population ratio shows the number of people employed as part of the working age population.</p>
<p>Gould said she’s watching this data closely to see whether these changes are a source for concern but she says it’s important to keep in mind that unemployment is still very low.</p>
<p>“Is that just volatility in the series or is there something to watch for?” she said. “…It’s not indicative of some huge problem but it’s something we want to keep watching. I didn’t like the drop in employment, particularly prime-age employment and participation is soft.”</p>
<p>Zandi said it’s hard to read too much into any month-to-month change in this data yet but that the labor market is slowing down a bit.</p>
<p>“I think the general pattern in the data shows that the job market is resilient, continues to create lots of jobs, and unemployment remains low. But it is throttling back. Job growth is definitively slowing and other measures of the strength of the labor market are, are moderating. You’re seeing fewer hours of work and temp employment is declining,” he said.</p>
<p>On the labor force participation rate, Zandi said he suspects that participation is not going to continue to rise.</p>
<p>“Boomers are retiring en masse and that’s going to wash out any increase in participation by other groups. Broadly speaking, I think the report is consistent with an economy that remains strong but is slow and consistent with getting inflation back to something we all feel comfortable with,” he said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trends in state pay</h4>

	
<p>Data <a href="https://payinsights.adp.com/" target="_blank">released by ADP</a>, a payroll processing firm, on Thursday, confirmed Zandi’s view on a cooling labor market as pay increases for people staying at their jobs were down in December from November. ADP’s median year-over-year pay change was higher in states such as Montana, where pay shot up 8.2% and Idaho, where pay rose 7.5%. New Mexico and Arizona also had higher increases in pay compared to many other states at 6.7% and 6.2%. Washington, Oregon, Wyoming, North Dakota, and South Dakota also had pay growth over that time period.</p>
<p>Liv Wang, lead data scientist at the ADP Research Institute, told States Newsroom that ADP saw higher pay growth for lower-paid workers during the recovery.</p>
<p>Wang added in an email, “….some of the states with higher percentage increases in pay have lower median pay levels. This is true for some states in both the Northwest and Southwest. This same trend also applies to the Leisure and Hospitality industry, which has been leading pay increases. However more broadly, pay gains have slowed down recently and the pay premium for changing jobs has been falling.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the Friday prior to Thanksgiving, 27 teachers at Charlottesville High School were absent from work following a series of violent student brawls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Charlottesville City Schools said the number of absences is “not much higher than it would be for a regular Friday,” the division ultimately closed the school through the Thanksgiving holiday and </span><a href="https://www.parentsquare.com/feeds/26345594" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">issued a statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> saying staff would “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">continue planning for a ‘reset’ of school policies, procedures, and culture so that we can return to our core purpose – offering a safe learning environment in which our students will grow and thrive.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the episode bears many significant similarities to a strike, officials have been reluctant to identify it as such — possibly because Virginia law, like that in many other states, calls for the termination of any public employee who goes on strike.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ann Hodges, a law professor at the University of Richmond, said she’s uncertain if the teachers’ act is a violation of state law given questions surrounding how coordinated the callouts were.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If in fact it was coordinated, it might be interpreted to be a strike,” said Hodges. “On the other hand, you could argue that&#8217;s really not a strike. Generally a strike is considered withholding of labor, and I think you could argue that the teachers are not withholding their labor. … They are not refusing when they are supposed to work. They are taking their [leave] days that they are entitled to by virtue of their employment.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virginia law</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia state law has forbidden public employees from going on strike at least as far back as 1946, when a wave of worker dissatisfaction over working conditions and wages swept the nation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That year, according to Richmond Times-Dispatch reports, Virginia Gov. William Tuck condemned the prospect of public sector unionization, telling the General Assembly that public worker strikes would “jeopardize the safety and welfare of the people.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Such an intolerable situation is utterly incompatible with sound and orderly government,” the Times-Dispatch quoted Tuck as saying. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the same session, the General Assembly passed legislation known as the Moncure-Locher bill that forbid any public employee who participated in a strike from working for state or local government for five years. An earlier version would have forbidden public employment indefinitely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers also passed a joint resolution declaring it against public policy for public employee organizations to affiliate with labor unions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title40.1/chapter4/section40.1-55/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> continues to prohibit public employees from striking and makes them ineligible to work in any public position for up to a year if they do so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any employee who “strikes or willfully refuses to perform the duties of his employment shall, by such action, be deemed to have terminated his employment,” the Code of Virginia states. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia isn’t alone in having such a statute on its books: Only a handful of states give teachers the right to strike, according to </span><a href="https://stateline.org/2012/09/25/public-strikes-explained-why-there-arent-more-of-them/#:~:text=Why%20aren%27t%20they%20more,although%20they%20occasionally%20break%20out." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a 2012 Stateline report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Currently, 37 states prohibit teacher strikes, </span><a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/map-where-school-employees-can-and-cant-strike/2023/03" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Education Week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reports. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, a Democratic-controlled General Assembly passed </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title40.1/chapter4/section40.1-57.3/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">laws</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> giving local governments the ability to allow collective bargaining by public employees, including teachers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">News reports show that as far back as 1969, the Virginia Education Association was lobbying for collective bargaining rights for teachers, with then-VEA President Dan Rapier saying they would help prevent teacher strikes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final version of the 2020 law specifically said the state’s prohibition on public employee strikes remains in force after concerns raised by groups including the Virginia School Boards Association.</span></p>
<p>https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-lawmakers-open-door-to-collective-bargaining-with-public-employees-but-only-at-local-level/</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During debates on the 2020 legislation, VSBA lobbyist Stacy Haney contended an original version of the bill “bill arguably does allow teachers to strike. It doesn’t allow employees of counties, cities or towns to strike, but … school board employees are carved out.” Lawmakers subsequently added language clarifying the strike prohibition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, former Del. Lee Carter, D-Manassas, </span><a href="https://www.insidenova.com/news/politics/va-teachers-would-be-allowed-to-strike-under-proposed-legislation/article_fd81d0ea-4f51-11eb-adb8-7bb750e0e8ca.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposed a bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would have allowed teachers to strike, but it died in committee without being voted on.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Strike or no?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether the Charlottesville callout would be considered a strike under state law remains uncertain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Office of the Attorney General declined to comment on the issue. And Beth Cheuk, a spokeswoman with Charlottesville City Public Schools, did not directly answer a question about whether the school division views the act by the teachers as a strike.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, she said in an email to the Mercury that high levels of staff absenteeism are common on Fridays. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we look back at Friday&#8217;s absentee rates, it was not much higher than it would be for a regular Friday,” she wrote, adding that the high school has a few vacancies, and teachers were also out for personal reasons such as parental leave and conferences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you add to this some additional teachers who were out because they felt like they needed this reset, it pushed the school beyond the ability to safely staff on Friday,” Cheuk said.  </span></p>
<p>Amanda Korman with Charlottesville Public Schools said that &#8220;fewer than half&#8221; of the teachers absent from school on Nov. 17 had called out of work after student violence. &#8220;The rest were already on FMLA, were at a planned conference, or were using previously scheduled personal time,&#8221; she wrote in an email, referring to the federal Family and Medical Leave Act.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shannon Gillikin, president of the Charlottesville Education Association, also did not answer a question about whether the action was a strike but said the association did not help plan any of the actions by the teachers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The increase in unsafe conditions, the lack of substitute teachers and coverage, and the lack of response from administration led staff to take action. CHS staff believes in their community and their students; they need our help,” she wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hodges said that even if the teacher callouts were coordinated, she questioned whether the district would go as far as to terminate all of the teachers involved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Does that mean half the teachers in the Charlottesville school district, or whatever number it is, are gone immediately?” Hodges asked. “How do you run a school if you implement this?”</span></p>

The city erected the signs in several retail areas. (Roger Chesley/The Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alexandria’s City Council recently voted</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/10/14/alexandria-repeal-panhandling-law/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to repeal some restrictions on panhandling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, noting the regulations violated federal court rulings involving free speech.</span><a href="https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/local/virginia/townhall-held-to-address-panhandling-concerns-in-prince-william-fairfax-counties/65-407e3da3-0a30-4c73-825f-7940a925028c" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Other localities around Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have taken</span><a href="https://www.dailypress.com/2017/10/11/panhandling-is-protected/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">similar actions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the past decade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The unanimous council vote in Alexandria, a city of 155,000, evinces compassion for people often struggling to find food, shelter – and a dose of humanity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bigger issue, though, is this: What are communities doing to transform panhandlers’ lives so they achieve stability – and won’t shuffle along streets with a proverbial tin cup? Also, do we actually </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">harm</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> supplicants when donating spare bills?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I get the impression, based on news reports, the official response is mixed. Some officeholders wish beggars would just disappear and leave residents alone. Others actively direct panhandlers – who are often homeless – to services ranging from mental health counseling to job seeking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We try to encourage people not to give” to panhandlers but donate instead “to one of the many organizations that serve the homeless,” Mary Riley, community programs administrator in Chesapeake’s Human Services Department, told me. Signs around the city, for example, urge people to “contribute to the solution” by donating to local charities and directing the homeless population to a housing crisis hotline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few years ago, Chesapeake opened a</span><a href="https://www.cityofchesapeake.net/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=183" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">resource center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where homeless individuals can take showers, wash their clothes, get a meal and receive help landing a job. Some 25 to 30 people visit the center each day, Riley said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fairfax County goes even further: It runs a program called</span><a href="https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/publicworks/operation-stream-shield" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“Operation Stream Shield”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in which homeless persons are paid to pick up litter, landscape and remove invasive plants in waterways. It started as a pilot project in 2019 and now includes nonprofit organizations that partner with the county.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The locality copied the idea from a program that began in 2015 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, called</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2017/03/22/give-panhandlers-a-new-task/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s A Better Way.”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> That city wanted to reduce panhandling, remove litter and provide dignity through work. (The city has since overhauled the program using a “a holistic approach to do case management and other supportive services,” Heidi Shultz, Albuquerque homeless program division manager, told me this week.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several communities around the country – including</span><a href="https://whyy.org/articles/new-philly-work-program-offers-alternative-to-panhandling/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Philadelphia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.oklahoman.com/story/news/local/2022/08/06/okc-program-helps-panhandlers-homlessness-jobs-housing/65388965007/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Oklahoma City</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – have adopted components of Albuquerque’s original model, tailoring it to their own circumstances and goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Philadelphia, for example, the program uses a lottery to select who “won” the chance to work that day. The lucky few earn $50 for a half-day’s work cleaning up streets around the City of Brotherly Love.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pat Herrity is Springfield’s longtime representative on the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors. He said ending panhandling is a public safety issue, too. People begging on roadways put themselves and motorists at risk – the latter as they slow down while being generous. They could get rear-ended.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve all seen close calls,” Herrity told me Wednesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The county’s clean-up program last year collected 270 tons of litter and 373 bags of invasive plants, he said. Some 30 participants garnered full-time employment, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s impressive. Maybe even life-changing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re like me, you probably go through a range of emotions when encountering panhandlers: Many look vulnerable, especially elderly women and adults who bring children with them. They pull at our heartstrings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or they may be on a never-ending grift, taking advantage of our sympathy – and naiveté. Some may look intimidating. “I’ve had businesses tell me that employees have left to go panhandle” because it’s more lucrative, Herrity said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Riley, from Chesapeake, calls some beggars “professionals” who raise a lot of money but aren’t homeless. That’s not always the case, however.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is giving a couple of bucks, or even a couple of Lincolns, so bad? Or does such generosity do more harm than good, allowing people to use the cash for drugs or alcohol?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I remember a column I wrote for</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2017/03/22/give-panhandlers-a-new-task/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginian-Pilot in 2017</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in which I’d interviewed a frequent panhandler who was begging along an interstate exit in Virginia Beach. He was well known to local police.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="aBevXkuMsl"><p><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2017/03/22/give-panhandlers-a-new-task/" target="_blank">Give panhandlers a new task</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Give panhandlers a new task&#8221; &#8212; The Virginian-Pilot" src="https://www.pilotonline.com/2017/03/22/give-panhandlers-a-new-task/embed/#?secret=cS3P0EslGb#?secret=aBevXkuMsl" data-secret="aBevXkuMsl" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same day the column ran, a guy called me claiming to know the panhandler and his family. He said the panhandler was playing on the goodwill of people, had a home to live in and wasn’t destitute.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My takeaway? We simply don’t know all the circumstances when we encounter folks begging for help – and looking like they need it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why the responses in places like Chesapeake and Fairfax County are laudable. Some people will always try to get over. Others, though, would jump at a chance to put away their tin cups. </span></p>

(Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)</p><p>Some 3,800 union health care workers in Virginia, Maryland and Washington, D.C., are threatening to go on strike at the end of this month if the leadership at Kaiser Permanente and the union cannot agree to a new contract addressing staffing shortages and low pay for workers.</p>
<p>According to a Monday statement from the Office of Professional Employees International Union (OPEIU) Local 2, which represents 8,000 workers in the region, about 98% of health care workers from the union voted to authorize a strike to protest “unfair labor practices” if no agreement is reached by Sept. 30.</p>
<p>The health care workers represented by OPEIU Local 2 union include optometrists, pharmacists, nurses and certified nursing assistants. The union includes a variety of technicians involved in health care too, including surgical, imaging and emergency department technicians.</p>
<p>The OPEIU Local 2 union has voted to join thousands of other Kaiser Permanente workers planning to strike on Sept. 30 over contract negotiations, including health care workers in Colorado, California, Oregon and Southwest Washington. Virginia has about 17 Kaiser Permanente-owned or -affiliated centers across the state, <a href="https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/maryland-virginia-washington-dc/doctors-locations#/facility-results" target="_blank">according to the Kaiser Permanente website</a>.</p>
<p>A primary concern is what the union called “unsafe” staffing shortages, which “can lead to dangerously long wait times and rushed in-person care.”</p>
<p>The group claims that if the strike takes place, it could be the “largest healthcare strike in U.S. history.”</p>
<p>The coalition of unions and Kaiser Permanente last negotiated contracts in 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic took hold in the United States. The pressures of the global health crisis “worsened working conditions and exacerbated a healthcare staffing crisis,” according to the Monday press release.</p>
<p>“Kaiser used to hold itself out as the best place to get care and the best place to work, but it is now failing at both. Kaiser can and must do better,” Linda Bridges, president of OPEIU Local 2, said in a written statement. “We are demanding Kaiser bargain in good faith, stop violating the law, and address the healthcare staffing crisis.”</p>
<p>The union argues that decisions from Kaiser Permanente executives have contributed to the staff issues, including cutting bonuses for frontline workers, insufficiently raising wages to match the rising cost of living and offering low wages for entry-level workers that are not competitive with fast food service or retail work.</p>
<p>In a written statement released on Monday, Kaiser Permanente said that the strike authorization vote was “a disappointing action.”</p>
<p>Kaiser Permanente noted the parties involved have two more bargaining sessions scheduled this week, before the Sept. 30 deadline.</p>
<p>“We are confident we’ll reach an agreement before the national agreement expires on September 30 that strengthens our position as a best place to work and ensures that the high-quality care our members expect from us remains affordable and easy to access,” the Kaiser statement said.</p>
<p>Kaiser argued that the wage grievances by OPEIU Local 2 are misleading, claiming that current proposals would set a $21 an hour minimum wage, when the union is asking for $26 an hour. The nonprofit health organization also argues that they’ve put millions into continued education and training opportunities for employees to help deal with staffing concerns.</p>
<p>“We take any threat to disrupt care for our members seriously and have comprehensive plans to ensure continued access to needed health care services, should a strike occur later this year,” according to the written statement.</p>
<p>The union countered that Kaiser Permanente has made ​​$3 billion in the first six months of 2023, based on a <a href="https://about.kaiserpermanente.org/news/kaiser-foundation-health-plan-and-hospitals-q2-2023-financials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent financial report</a> from the company.</p>
<p>“Workers say that Kaiser is committing unfair labor practices and also that under-staffing is boosting Kaiser’s profits but hurting patients,” according to a union statement. “In a <a href="https://www.unioncoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2022-04_Report_Staffing-Survey-10.1_DIGITAL.pdf?emci=11db37e0-b5df-ed11-8e8b-00224832eb73&amp;emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&amp;ceid=%7B%7BContactsEmailID%7D%7D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent survey</a> of 33,000 employees, 2/3 of workers said they’d seen care delayed or denied due to short staffing.”</p>

(Brandon Bell/Getty Images)</p><div id="modal-ready">
<p>Salaried workers who have been ineligible for overtime pay would benefit from a proposed Biden administration regulation.</p>
<p>The Department of Labor’s new rule would require employers to compensate full-time workers in management, administrative or other professional roles for any overtime worked if they make less than $55,068 annually. Currently, the salary threshold is $35,568. The change is expected to affect <a href="https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20230830" target="_blank">3.6 million</a> workers.</p>
<p>The rule would also provide automatic changes every three years to the salary level to keep up with changes in earnings. U.S. territories that are subject to the federal minimum wage would have these same overtime protections, rolling back a Trump administration change made in 2019.</p>
<p>“I’ve heard from workers again and again about working long hours, for no extra pay, all while earning low salaries that don’t come anywhere close to compensating them for their sacrifice,” said Acting Secretary of Labor Julie Su in a statement.</p>
<p>The new standard salary level proposed by the agency would be tied to the 35th percentile of weekly earnings of salaried workers in the lowest-wage region of the country. There is voter support for a change in the current regulations. <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2022/9/5/expanding-overtime-pay-is-overwhelmingly-popular" target="_blank">According to</a> a 2022 Data for Progress survey of likely voters, 65% said they either strongly supported or somewhat supported raising the salary threshold for overtime pay.</p>
<p>The rule will go through a public comment period as part of the rulemaking process to give supporters and opponents time to offer feedback. The process can take months, which could mean it won’t be finalized until next year. Labor rights advocates and economists say that people working in retail, restaurants and health care would be among the workers most affected by the regulation.</p>
<p>Judy Conti, director of government affairs at the National Employment Law Project, a worker advocacy nonprofit, said many workers who do overtime-eligible work are paid just over the current threshold so their companies can avoid paying time-and-a-half. The proposed rule would help address this, she said.</p>
<p>“A lot of these dollar stores call people managers and supervisors and pay them $36,000 a year. Then they claim that they’re overtime exempt and they may do a little managing and they may do a little supervising, but mostly they’re working the cash register or they’re stocking shelves or they’re unloading in the back. They’re not doing work that is considered truly bona fide executive, professional or administrative work,” she said.</p>
<p>Conti added that this rule would provide incentives to employers to manage employee time wisely or hire more workers to handle the workload.</p>

		<p style="font-size:13px"><b>– Erica Groshen, senior economics adviser at the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations</b></p>

<p>“There’s [currently] no incentive to really manage that time wisely and see if it should instead be spread to other people,” Conti said.</p>
<p>Erica Groshen, senior economics adviser at the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations, said the regulation should be fair on employers.</p>
<p>“I think the important thing to realize is that this will affect all of those employers equally,” she said. “It’s not putting some at a disadvantage compared to others. It’s going to change the playing field for everybody. You could argue that it’s going to change the playing field more for employers who were actively trying to take advantage of the erosion of the applicability of the law.”</p>
<p>In terms of the potential effects on the economy, Groshen said there could be some pass through to prices for consumers depending on how competitive the industry is.</p>
<p>“To the extent that these companies are quite profitable, then the employers might try to hold on to market share by not increasing prices as much. Their profits might be a bit lower. Right now, nationally profit rates are actually quite high. They’ve been high for a while and rising. This would tend to reduce inequality if it comes out of profits. Otherwise, then the money is going to come from somewhere,” Groshen said.</p>
<p>That may mean that some employers will automate more services such as electronic ordering at restaurants or buying equipment for food preparation, she added.</p>
<p>The Trump administration last changed the salary threshold in 2019 from $23,660, set in 2004, to its current $35,568 salary level, which was significantly lower than the $47,476 level the Obama administration tried to implement in 2016. A federal judge blocked the Obama administration’s effort saying that the threshold was too high and that the administration did not have the authority to make that particular change. Twenty-one states, including Nevada, Arizona, Kentucky and Wisconsin, brought the lawsuit. The states <a href="https://www.wagehourinsights.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/849/2016/09/DOL-OT-Rule-Complaint-Filed.pdf" target="_blank">argued</a> that the rule “could deliberately exhaust state budgets” and was unconstitutional. In 2017, the same judge, an Obama appointee, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-overtime/u-s-judge-strikes-down-obama-administration-overtime-pay-rule-idUSKCN1BB2Y8" target="_blank">ruled against</a> the regulation again.</p>
<p>Conti said she’s optimistic that the rule is less likely to be blocked this time. She argues that the judge’s reasoning for stopping implementation of the rule lacked “legal or economic support.” Attorneys for law firms specializing in employment and labor law, however, are still anticipating legal action against the rule. Some <a href="https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/legal-and-compliance/employment-law/pages/proposed-overtime-rule-likely-challenge-audit.aspx#:~:text=Employment%20Law-,Proposed%20Overtime%20Rule%20Likely%20to%20Face%20Court%20Challenge,Positions%20Should%20Be%20Audited%20Anyway&amp;text=Even%20though%20the%20proposed%20overtime,their%20workplaces%2C%20legal%20experts%20say." target="_blank">attorneys suggest</a> that the lack of a Senate-confirmed labor secretary makes the regulation more vulnerable to legal action. Biden <a href="https://thehill.com/business/4182984-acting-labor-secretary-i-dont-have-an-intention-of-going-anywhere/" target="_blank">nominated</a> Su for labor secretary six months ago.</p>
<p>Many <a href="https://www.uschamber.com/employment-law/us-chamber-statement-overtime-rule-decision" target="_blank">of</a> <a href="https://www.fsrmagazine.com/content/nra-obama-administrations-overtime-overhaul-will-harm-restaurant-employees" target="_blank">the</a> <a href="https://www.epi.org/blog/national-association-of-manufacturers-criticisms-of-the-obama-overtime-proposal-all-miss-their-mark/" target="_blank">same</a> groups that opposed or were critical of the overhaul of overtime regulations during the Obama administration have taken similar positions on the Biden administration’s effort. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has <a href="https://www.uschamber.com/employment-law/u-s-chamber-calls-on-dol-to-adjust-proposed-overtime-rule" target="_blank">called on</a> the Department of Labor to “adjust” the rule. It did not release any specifics for what it wants the agency to do, but criticized the department’s proposal to automatically change the salary threshold every few years.</p>
<p>“The Department of Labor’s proposed overtime regulation is the wrong rulemaking at the wrong time,” Marc Freedman, vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Workplace Policy, said in a <a href="https://www.uschamber.com/employment-law/u-s-chamber-calls-on-dol-to-adjust-proposed-overtime-rule" target="_blank">statement</a>. “It represents a more than 50% spike in the salary threshold and will increase costs for small businesses, nonprofits, and other employers at a time when businesses already face persistent workforce shortages that are hindering the economy.”</p>
<p>Industry groups such as the National Restaurant Association and National Association of Manufacturers have <a href="https://restaurant.org/research-and-media/media/press-releases/national-restaurant-association-statement-on-proposed-changes-to-overtime-calculations/#:~:text=The%20DOL%20Proposed%20Rulemaking(Opens,the%20threshold%20every%20three%20years." target="_blank">been</a> <a href="https://www.nam.org/manufacturers-signal-concerns-with-proposed-dol-overtime-rule-28280/" target="_blank">critical</a> of the rule for similar reasons.</p>
<p>Conti said she sees the proposed rule as stimulating for the economy and good for employees as well as employers.</p>
<p>“Adding jobs and getting more money into more people’s hands is good for the economy,” Conti said. “We’ve seen a lot of workers over the past couple of years walking away from jobs when they’re overworked, when they don’t have time for themselves and when they don’t have time for their families. Making sure that workers have moderate work weeks that are 40 hours is good for employers. They’re not going to burn out their employees.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislators from around the country suggested incentives like child care, affordable housing and mental health services as ways to lure people off the couch and back to work. All of that’s welcome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I don’t weep for the employers whose policies and stingy pay convinced people that risking their lives during a pandemic was foolish, perhaps suicidal. Discerning Virginians are now assessing their own cost-benefit analysis before they punch the clock again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They want to ensure the work-family-life balance is recalibrated in their favor. They have a different perspective after watching relatives, co-workers and friends die from COVID-19; it has</span><a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">killed more than 1.13 million Americans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and hospitalized more than 6.27 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That means employers have to think differently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you’re someone who owns a business, man it’s tough. … You need to pay more,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alice Louise Kassens, an economics professor and senior analyst at the Roanoke College Institute for Policy and Opinion Research, told me.</span><b> “</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re the supplier – people, households and workers – then it’s a pretty good situation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Folks around the state aren’t lazy, said Jay Speer, executive director of the Virginia Poverty Law Center, assailing an oft-leveled complaint. “They need stability,” he told me. “But they don’t want crappy jobs for crappy pay.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’re willing to flex their muscles – and they should.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My view is the labor market should be seen as robust. The state’s</span><a href="https://www.vec.virginia.gov/node/17700" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">unemployment rate in July was just 2.5%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, slightly less than the same period in 2022 and a percentage point below the national rate. It was the most recent month available as I wrote this. Those stats should be applauded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The labor force participation rate, which measures the proportion of the civilian population aged 16 and older that has a job or is actively looking for work, increased by 0.1 percentage points to 66.7% in July in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The highest labor participation rate in the state was nearly 71% in 1992, said Timothy Aylor, a senior economist with the Virginia Employment Commission. His statistics go back to 1990. The lowest participation rate was 63.4% in June 2020, a few months into the pandemic after many workplaces had shut down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don’t fully understand” why some job-seekers are still on the sidelines, Aylor told me, though “there remains a big skills mismatch between what employers need and what the unemployed have to offer.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kassens said employers and government officials can entice potential workers in a variety of ways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Providing job training for work that actually exists is one method, she noted. Raising pay is another, as is making child care more accessible and more affordable for parents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Easing immigration rules – a potential non-starter for some politicians – would also add to the labor pool, Kassens added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One thing is clear: The canard that people would rather get jobless benefits –</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/07/27/unemployment-benefits-arent-the-only-thing-keeping-workers-at-home/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">including $300 a week from the feds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – than find work should be buried, once and for all. Those enhanced benefits ended roughly two years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/06/04/theres-an-easy-fix-for-complaints-about-a-labor-shortage-cutting-benefits-isnt-it/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">rich chamber of commerce types</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> earlier denigrated the unemployed essentially as being lazy, and that the jobless should be pushed to return to restaurants and hotels – and risk their lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If those benefits had truly kept people home, though, the labor participation rate would be even higher now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not saying employers can find everybody they need. Professions like air traffic controllers and policing</span><a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/08/27/labor-shortages-air-traffic-health-care-teachers-police" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">are truly stressed, according to a recent Axios article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Help Wanted” signs or internet job postings are easy to find elsewhere, especially in restaurants, clothing stores and certain specialty businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Jobs are here for everybody,” Nate Phillips, a manager at a Chili’s restaurant in Chesapeake, told me last week. A sign on the front door seeking “Chili Heads” touted perks including medical benefits, help with education costs and so-called “competitive” salaries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The job market is hot,” Phillips continued, noting he had openings for servers, a bartender and kitchen staff. “I did four interviews yesterday.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet he acknowledged people were voting with their feet, too. “Turnover is really high,” he said. Some of his employees “just get better offers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fancy that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies should get creative with their hiring strategies, obviously. Boost pay. Improve the working environment. Create clear management tracks for people who desire them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That way, both employers </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> employees would get what they want. </span></p>

<p>Almost two months after workplace accommodations for pregnant workers became law, the rules surrounding what employers can and cannot do have yet to be finalized — but that doesn’t mean the protections are not in place.</p>
<p>The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s proposed regulations are expected to offer more clarity once finalized, but workers can still access their rights under the new Pregnant Workers Fairness Act and employers are still required to understand the law and follow it.</p>
<p>Here’s what you need to know about why workers say the law was needed, what workers’ rights are under the law and employers’ obligations to employees.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Why the law was needed</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Other federal laws cover the rights of pregnant workers, but advocates have long argued that many of them are too narrow to address the situations pregnant workers face when they seek accommodations. The Americans with Disabilities Act, for instance, does not consider pregnancy to be a disability, but pregnancy-related complications, such as preeclampsia, do qualify. Under the ADA, a pregnant worker can’t seek out an accommodation in the hope of preventing dangerous pregnancy-related complications.</p>
<p>The Pregnancy Discrimination Act, passed in 1978, prohibits discrimination against pregnant employees, but it’s difficult in practice for workers to receive accommodations under the law because it requires finding another worker who received accommodations like the ones they’re seeking. This can be a challenging and time-consuming process because workers may not be aware of what kinds of accommodations their coworkers are seeking or may not have access to this information in the way their employer does.</p>
<p>Despite those laws, <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/bpc-morning-consult-pregnancy-discrimination/" target="_blank">23%</a> of mothers said in a survey last year that they had weighed whether or not to leave their job because their workplace lacked reasonable accommodations or they were worried about pregnancy discrimination.</p>
<p>The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which passed in December, has been in the works for a decade. In the intervening years, states began taking their own action. As of April, 30 states — including Alaska, Colorado, Minnesota and Tennessee — as well as the District of Columbia and four localities had similar laws to the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, some of which may offer stronger protections in certain situations than the PWFA, <a href="https://www.abetterbalance.org/resources/pregnant-worker-fairness-legislative-successes/" target="_blank">according to</a> A Better Balance, a worker advocacy nonprofit. Twenty states did not have state protections like these at the time of its state analysis, including Alabama, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. The nonprofit has a comprehensive <a href="https://www.abetterbalance.org/resources/pregnant-worker-fairness-legislative-successes/" target="_blank">list</a> of state policies on pregnant workers’ rights.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What are your employee rights </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Congress and federal agencies, employment agencies, labor organizations, private employers with 15 or more workers, and state and local governments with 15 or more workers are subject to the law, according to the EEOC.</p>
<p>While the rules haven’t been finalized, if you think your rights have been violated, you can already take action. On June 27, the EEOC began allowing workers to file charges under the law for violations that occurred on that day or later. Workers need to take this step before they can file a lawsuit against their employer. The law protects employees and job applicants who need accommodations because of pregnancy, childbirth or conditions related to pregnancy and childbirth. Under the PWFA, pregnant workers should be able to make requests for reasonable accommodations, such as closer parking, uniforms in their size and additional rest time.</p>
<p>The PWFA is similar in many ways to the Americans with Disabilities Act. It does not require an employer to provide an accommodation if doing so would bring it “undue hardship,” or in other words, it would come at great difficulty or expense to the employer.</p>
<p>But the law is also a bit different than the ADA. Unlike the ADA, where the employee has to be able to do the essential functions of their job or they no longer qualify for accommodations, the PWFA says that workers do not always have to be able to perform an essential function temporarily because of their pregnancy. It is expected that they will be able to resume those duties in the near future.</p>
<p>The EEOC’s proposed rules define the “near future,” or when workers will be able to perform essential functions of their job after being temporarily unable to do so, as generally going up to 40 weeks. This does not mean workers will always have 40 weeks but that needing 40 weeks doesn’t disqualify an employee from the accommodations. The regulations also say that if there are multiple options for effective accommodations, the employer should favor the worker’s preferred accommodation.</p>
<p>Liz Morris, deputy director for the Center for WorkLife Law, said applicants and new employees who want to work remotely because of their pregnancy will also be covered in the PWFA. Applicants can request accommodations during the hiring process itself, such as making modifications to a physical test. If a pregnant applicant anticipates that they will need adjustments from an employer because of their pregnancy, the applicant can agree to a general policy without accommodations and then request them once they are employed.</p>
<p>The EEOC regulations also get into detail about pregnancy-related medical conditions that apply to workers under the PWFA, A Better Balance Vice President Elizabeth Gedmark said.</p>

<p>“The proposed rule discusses pregnancy-related issues ranging from preterm labor to anxiety and depression while also making clear that limitations can also be ‘modest, minor, and/or episodic,’” she told States Newsroom over email.</p>
<p>Lactation, potential pregnancy, miscarriage, infertility and fertility treatments, and having an abortion are also listed in the regulation. An employee who needs to take leave because of a limitation due to a condition related to pregnancy and childbirth should qualify for that leave under the PWFA, according to the proposed rules. The EEOC gives miscarriage and childbirth as examples of reasons for workers to take different forms of leave. The same definition of “near future” also applies.</p>
<p>A Better Balance provides <a href="https://www.abetterbalance.org/resources/sample-letters-to-give-to-your-employer-about-the-pregnant-workers-fairness-act/" target="_blank">sample letters</a> for employees to use when requesting work accommodations related to pregnancy.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What employers need to know</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The rules are going through a public comment period through Oct. 10, and Victor Chen, director of communications at the EEOC, told States Newsroom that employers are not required to follow the proposed rules just yet. But he added that the PWFA itself provides direction for employers. He suggested employers read the EEOC’s list of <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/wysk/what-you-should-know-about-pregnant-workers-fairness-act" target="_blank">commonly asked questions</a> and listen to its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftxYyTlXetE" target="_blank">webinar</a>. He said the EEOC “will move as quickly as possible to finalize the regulation” after the comment period closes.</p>
<p>Morris said that although the regulations aren’t set in stone, “If I were an employer, I would certainly follow them for now, as they are an excellent indication of how the law will ultimately be interpreted.”</p>
<p>The rules specify that employers can’t deny work to an applicant or employee because of their need for an accommodation, make a decision for a pregnant worker without any discussion on which accommodation they will receive or force them to go on leave if there is an accommodation they could take to continue working. They also can’t retaliate against workers for advocating for themselves under the law and reporting discrimination, nor can they try to stop workers from enjoying their legal protections.</p>
<p>Michael Fallings, the managing partner of Tully Rinckey PLLC’s Austin office, who specializes in federal employment law, said he thinks it will be useful for employers to have more information on how to fairly treat pregnant workers seeking reasonable accommodations.</p>
<p>“I think it could be helpful for employers because I think some employers are in fear of litigation at times, and now that you have a law in place that says what you can or cannot do, it provides some basis for the employers,” he said.</p>
<p>Morris said that employers should keep in mind that they need to swiftly provide accommodations, and if they can’t, they should think about interim accommodations. The proposed EEOC regulations explain that an “unnecessary delay” could result in a violation of the law.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The future of the law and its regulations</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The law’s regulations may be tweaked during the rulemaking process and could be eventually challenged in the courts. The Alliance Defending Freedom, which has been involved in numerous lawsuits challenging abortion rights,  called the proposed regulations <a href="https://adflegal.org/press-release/biden-admin-hijacks-pregnant-workers-law-impose-illegal-abortion-mandate" target="_blank">“federal overreach.”</a> The ADF, a legal advocacy group, has argued that the administration doesn’t have the legal authority to include abortion in its implementation. Morris said that accommodations related to abortion are reasonable to include because the EEOC has always defined pregnancy, childbirth and related medical conditions in the courts as including abortion.</p>
<p>Organizations that supported or opposed the law will also have the opportunity to suggest changes to the regulations. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce advocated for the passage of the law and will provide a public comment on parts of the rule that could be changed, the group told States Newsroom, but declined to elaborate on what should be revised.</p>
<p>Morris said her organization also plans to submit a public comment on the proposed EEOC regulations. She wants to see some revisions on the issue of medical certification to make it even easier for employees to receive accommodations.</p>
<p>“A shocking number of people don’t receive prenatal care because they don’t have access to it either because of financial barriers or because they live in a remote area where it’s difficult to travel to, to receive prenatal care,” she said.</p>

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) </p><p>INDIANAPOLIS — For years, Indiana’s GOP-controlled legislature has focused on creating a business-friendly climate by pushing favorable tax rates and regulations, aiming to foster the creation of good-paying jobs across the state.</p>
<p>The way Republican state Sen. Michael Crider sees it, those moves have worked: Companies such as Amazon and Walmart have built new warehouses and fulfillment centers in his district just east of Indianapolis.</p>
<p>But it didn’t take long for him to realize how all those new private-sector jobs could further strain short-handed local governments, particularly school systems, by luring away bus drivers and teachers’ aides.</p>
<p>“That is a general theme in almost every conversation: An able-bodied person that desires to work can find a job just about anywhere in Indiana right now,” said Crider, the Senate majority whip. “And it’s reached the point where I think in some areas, businesses are saying we can’t expand, we would like to expand, we would expand, but we cannot because we don’t have enough workers.”</p>
<p>State legislators from across the country point to the labor shortage as a major concern. While they have been pushing job training and career readiness programs, they increasingly are addressing other factors that can keep people from joining the workforce, such as a lack of child care, affordable housing or mental health services. Some want to attract more immigrants.</p>
<p>The national worker shortage and those indirect solutions came up time and again during the annual summit of the National Conference of State Legislatures, which brought hundreds of lawmakers, policy experts and lobbyists together at the Indiana Convention Center.</p>
<p>Crider, for example, said a persistent lack of mental health resources has limited the work potential of some people in his state.</p>
<p>“It not only keeps people out of the workforce, but it also affects people’s attendance and focus on the task at hand when somebody in their family is struggling,” he said. “And so that’s one of the things I think we talked about quite a bit.”</p>
<p>Research from Indiana’s behavioral health commission in 2022 found that mental illness was <a href="https://indianactsi.org/news_/untreated-mental-illness-is-costing-indiana-more-than-4-billion-per-year/" target="_blank">costing the state more than $4 billion</a> in lost productivity and health care costs each year. The potential to improve worker productivity was one reason the legislature earlier this year near-unanimously approved Crider’s legislation that <a href="https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/2023/07/10/game-changer-bill-aims-to-revolutionize-mental-healthcare-system/" target="_blank">overhauled the state’s antiquated mental health system</a> and aims to infuse $130 million more per year into services.</p>
<p>Crider said the workforce shortage requires a comprehensive set of solutions. Quality of life is as important as job opportunities — and that is especially true for remote workers who can live anywhere.</p>

<p>Doug Howard, senior vice president of human services at government services provider Maximus, said employers across the country have had to get creative to fill job openings: Some have lured retirees back into the workforce or targeted young people for part-time work.</p>
<p>“The punchline here is that we don’t have enough people,” he told a group of lawmakers at the summit.</p>
<p>Howard cited <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/jolts.nr0.htm" target="_blank">federal labor data showing there are nearly 10 million unfilled jobs</a> across the country, but just under 6 million people seeking jobs. The nation’s labor force participation rate, which measures the percentage of the civilian population in the workforce, has not returned to its pre-pandemic rate, which even then had steadily been falling for decades. (In July, the national rate was 62.6% compared with 66.2% in July 2003.)</p>
<p>“Those all equal a math problem,” he said.</p>
<p>Those challenges are only exacerbated by state efforts to recruit new employers. A new factory doesn’t just need workers on the assembly line, Howard noted. Contractors need workers to build the plant. Those workers need housing. And both permanent and temporary workers need child care.</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">States target housing and child care</h4>

	</h4>
<p>While the labor market has been squeezed since the pandemic recovery, experts say things could still get worse.</p>
<p>In Indianapolis, several labor experts said three massive federal spending bills will heighten the need for workers: the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act. The infrastructure bill alone is expected to spend $1.2 trillion on bridges, ports and mass transit systems.</p>
<p>“That is a lot of money for projects at a time when the U.S. is facing a very tight labor market,” Suzanne Hultin, the director of the National Conference of State Legislatures’ employment, labor and retirement program, said during one panel in Indianapolis.</p>
<p>New Hampshire Democratic state Rep. Brian Sullivan said the impending federal investments weren’t on his radar before the conference — but definitely are now.</p>
<p>“If we can’t fill the jobs we’ve got now and we start building more manufacturing plants and that sort of thing, who’s going to work there?” he said.</p>
<p>The ranking member of the New Hampshire House Labor, Industrial and Rehabilitative Services Committee, Sullivan said he views housing as a major driver of workforce challenges in his state.</p>
<p>He pointed to Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center, New Hampshire’s only academic medical center and an employer of more than 8,000 people.</p>
<p>“They are having huge problems being able to attract workers who then can find some place to live,” Sullivan said in an interview with Stateline. “They’re not bad jobs. But the cost of housing is so high that a lot of these people will say, ‘I can’t work here, I’ve got to go live somewhere where I can afford housing.’”</p>
<p>Sullivan said two recently launched bipartisan special committees — one on workforce housing and one on child care — should help tackle labor challenges. He expects legislation soon from those efforts, though <a href="https://www.seacoastonline.com/restricted/?return=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.seacoastonline.com%2Fstory%2Fopinion%2Fcolumns%2F2023%2F07%2F23%2Fcommentary-nh-has-made-great-strides-to-benefit-children-families%2F70441806007%2F" target="_blank">the legislature has already added $60 million for child care services</a>.</p>

<p>“I don’t know if it’s the best way,” Sullivan said. “But it’s the way the legislature can contribute. I think employers are going to have to contribute and I think it’s got to be a communitywide effort.”</p>
<p><i></i>In Washington state, a lack of child care is a major driver of the labor shortage, said Democratic state Sen. Karen Keiser. While all industries have struggled to hire, she said hospitality and health care employers are especially hard pressed in Washington.</p>
<p>“There are so many workers who cannot work unpredictable schedules because they do not have reliable child care,” she said. “Well, hospitality has unpredictable schedules and so does health care. And those kinds of systemic problems are just running up against each other.”</p>
<p>In 2021, Washington state <a href="https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/about/government-affairs/fair-start-for-kids-act" target="_blank">approved a $1.1 billion plan</a> to make child care and early learning programs more affordable and accessible. This year, the legislature added <a href="https://washingtonstatestandard.com/2023/05/10/the-states-child-care-gap-proves-tough-to-solve/" target="_blank">more than $400 million in new funds</a> to raise child care provider pay and increase subsidies for families over the next two years.</p>
<p>Keiser, president pro tempore of the state Senate, said the ongoing labor shortage does provide workers more leverage, even if it’s a pain for employers.</p>
<p>“And that’s good,” she said, “because they have seen pay stagnation for the last 20 years. … At the same time, we do need to get to work. We need the economy to grow.”</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Immigration, education efforts</h4>

	</h4>
<p>North Dakota Republican state Rep. Karen Karls sees it in the grocery stores.</p>
<p>She used to encounter mostly young people running registers and bagging groceries in the capital city of Bismarck. Now, many of those workers are older adults.</p>
<p>“That’s a little scary,” said Karls, a 17-year veteran of the legislature. “Their work ethic is fabulous, but I just think we need younger workers.”</p>
<p>She said the problem in North Dakota is complex: She blames the pandemic for getting people “used to not working.” For others, it instilled a strong preference for remote work, a challenge for many employers demanding on-site attendance, she said.</p>
<p>North Dakota has more than 20,000 job openings — a huge number for a state of just over 770,000 people. The state has 0.3 unemployed people per job opening, per the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
<p>“We’re just not having enough babies,” Karls said.</p>

<p>The state is examining immigration as a potential solution.</p>
<p>In April, Republican Gov. Doug Burgum signed bipartisan legislation <a href="https://www.governor.nd.gov/news/burgum-signs-bill-creating-office-legal-immigration-help-address-north-dakotas-workforce" target="_blank">creating the Office of Legal Immigration</a> within the state’s Department of Commerce to help businesses recruit and retain foreign labor.</p>
<p>And Brent Sanford, a former GOP lieutenant governor, is leading a pilot program called <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-refugee-russia-war-biden-humanitarian-parole-1a57fb5f59d150380a6a1f3e7a5ef093" target="_blank">Uniting for Ukraine</a>. Run by the North Dakota Petroleum Council, the program brings refugees and migrants from Ukraine to work in the state’s Bakken oil fields. Karls said jobs in that remote portion of the state pay very well, but because the oil patch is surrounded by very small towns, housing is a major struggle for workers.</p>
<p>Not all lawmakers agree state government should help private companies.</p>
<p>“I think it’s more of a free market issue,” said Texas Democratic state Rep. Penny Morales Shaw. “Employers have to figure out a way to retain people, they’ve got to figure out a way to attract people.”</p>
<p>In Arkansas, the state government has focused on building up careers in the trades.</p>
<p>Arkansas state Rep. Stephen Meeks, a Republican, pointed to the state’s <a href="https://www.beprobeproudar.org/" target="_blank">Be Pro Be Proud </a>campaign. An initiative led by the Associated Industries of Arkansas Foundation, it encourages young people to enter fields such as construction, railroading and manufacturing.</p>
<p>State leaders even hold a Draft Day, pairing graduating seniors enrolled in career and technical education courses with employers ready to hire them.</p>
<p>Meeks said the state has also had a difficult time filling public school teaching positions.</p>
<p>That was part of the motivation behind the state’s <a href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2023/mar/10/what-you-need-to-know-about-arkansas-learns/" target="_blank">LEARNS Act,</a> which passed earlier this year. In addition to a new school voucher program, Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ signature education bill also raised minimum teacher pay to $50,000 across the state.</p>
<p>Meeks said some Arkansas teachers were making as little as $36,000 per year before that legislation, making it difficult for the state to retain teachers whose degrees could command a higher salary in the private sector.</p>
<p>“I think that’ll definitely help,” he said, “especially in the rural areas of our state.”</p>

<p>Construction workers who work on federal projects are poised to receive better wages and worker protections under a Department of Labor rule touted by Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Speaking at a union hall in Philadelphia, Harris praised the Biden administration’s economic agenda and pointed out that the new rule would be the first update in more than 40 years to the Davis-Bacon Act, which requires paying prevailing wages on public works projects. The Reagan administration changed the definition of prevailing wages in 1983.</p>
<p>“Let’s agree these workers deserve our recognition and appreciation and they deserve something more,” Harris said. “They deserve a raise. … Many workers are paid much less than they deserve, much less than the value of their work … in some cases by thousands of dollars a year, and that is wrong and completely unacceptable.”</p>
<p>The final rule transforms how prevailing wages, or the hourly rate of wages paid to workers in a given area, are calculated. It would base wages off of at least 30% of workers instead of 50% of workers in a trade in a certain locality, which the Biden administration said will help ensure workers’ prevailing wages aren’t dragged down by employers who pay low wages.</p>
<p>The regulation also makes it easier for the agency to withhold funds from contractors to ensure workers are paid properly and protects workers from employer retaliation, Biden administration officials have stated.</p>
<p>The rule will be effective in about two months and would affect an estimated 1.2 million workers.</p>
<p>Harris praised the work of union leaders during her speech. She called Sean McGarvey, president of North America’s Building Trades Unions (NABTU), who was present at the speech, “a partner,” and thanked Jimmy Williams, the general president of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades. After the speech, she planned to tour Interstate 95. In June, part of I-95 <a href="https://www.fox29.com/news/i-95-collapse-medical-examiner-confirms-identity-cause-of-death-of-tanker-truck-driver#:~:text=The%20Philadelphia%20Medical%20Examiner%27s%20Office,ruled%20an%20accident%2C%20officials%20said." target="_blank">collapsed</a> when a gasoline tanker exploded, and the man driving the vehicle died. Harris applauded the swift rebuild of the section, which took only 12 days. The rebuilding effort received <a href="https://boyle.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/boyle-casey-fetterman-announce-3-million-emergency-funding-i-95#:~:text=Boyle%20PA%2D02%20along%20with,Philadelphia%20on%20June%2011%2C%202023." target="_blank">federal funding</a>.</p>
<p>Sharita Gruberg, vice president for economic justice at the National Partnership for Women and Families, said that the original formula for wage standards was supposed to make sure that federal contracts are paying workers a competitive wage, but the Reagan administration’s changes in the 1980s weakened the rules.</p>
<p>“There’s just been all of these artificial barriers constructed since the ’80s that weaken this really strong rule that’s supposed to protect the local economy and protect workers,” Gruberg said. She added that the idea was “to make sure that these local economies are not subject to a large influx of federal dollars going to construction companies that are paying less than market rate and creating a race to the bottom.”</p>
<p>The administration is prioritizing these changes after it has invested billions in manufacturing facilities and repairing roads through the CHIPS and Science Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Gruberg said the administration is trying to make the most out of those investments by making these reforms.</p>
<p>“There’s two paths here,” she said. “One, we update these rules and make sure that these investments are reaching their full potential for communities, or we don’t and lose workers a lot of money.”</p>
<p>Progressive think tanks have argued that such changes will make it easier for workers to receive higher pay and better benefits. In its comment on the proposed rule in May 2022, the Economic Policy Institute <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/epi-comments-on-davis-bacon-updates-nprm/" target="_blank">said</a> research has established that prevailing wage laws increase worker pay, help more workers get pension plans, and improve workers’ health care coverage as well as make the construction industry more equitable for women and workers of color.</p>
<p>The Laborers’ International Union of North America also supports the change and said it will protect many LIUNA members.</p>
<p>“With massive investments in infrastructure through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs with prevailing wage rules, construction workers across the nation will benefit from the strengthened wage floor,” LIUNA <a href="https://www.liuna.org/news/story/construction-workers-celebrate-strengthened-prevailing-wages" target="_blank">stated</a>.</p>
<p>There is still opposition to the rule from the Associated Builders and Contractors, a non-union trade group, which has said it will take legal action in response to the rule. The trade association said there’s no timeline yet for when they will bring a lawsuit.</p>
<p>Ben Brubeck, vice president of regulatory, labor, and state affairs at the Associated Builders and Contractors, called the rule a “handout to organized labor on the backs of taxpayers, small businesses and the free market” and said the regulation is “unnecessary, costly and burdensome.”</p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Country singer Jason Aldean has reaped a whirlwind of big-media scorn for his intemperate new hit titled “Try That in a Small Town.” As he should.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seething tone of the lyrics alone are an unvarnished and bellicose call for vigilantism by “good ol’ boys, raised up right” in towns and crossroads outside America’s cities and suburbs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It widens the troubling geographic and cultural fissure between urban America and its leafy, prosperous bedroom communities and the struggling rural towns that feel they were denied growth and opportunity in recent decades, a split Virginia illustrates well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aldean’s lyrics inventory a litany of violent street-level crimes such as sucker-punching someone on a sidewalk, carjacking senior motorists, robbing a liquor store, desecrating the American flag or cursing and spitting on police. Then this warning:</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, try that in a small town</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">See how far ya make it down the road</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;Round here, we take care of our own</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">You cross that line, it won&#8217;t take long</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">For you to find out, I recommend you don&#8217;t</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try that in a small town.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aldean’s video, however, is far more menacing and malignant. That’s why I’m not linking to it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He and his band were filmed outside the Maury County Courthouse in Columbia, Tennessee, infamous as the site where a white mob</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/21/arts/music/jason-aldean-song-video-lynching-courthouse-choate.html?auth=login-google1tap&amp;login=google1tap" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">lynched a Black teenager</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> named Henry Choate in 1927. Accused, without proof, of attacking a 16-year-old white girl, Choate was seized from his jail cell, beaten with a sledgehammer and dragged through Columbia’s streets behind a car before he was hanged from a courthouse balcony.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interspersed throughout Aldean’s video is footage of riots and confrontations with police juxtaposed with heartwarming scenes of downhome bonhomie: men hunting ducks, crops being harvested, flags being raised, home movies of backyard football, youth baseball and such. Together, it evokes the sort of unsettling moral dissonance one might experience from watching bits of Ronald Reagan’s hopeful 1984 “</span><a href="https://youtu.be/Zn9fR_-X9uw" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morning in America</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” reelection ad spliced randomly into “</span><a href="https://youtu.be/n2i917l5RFc" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full Metal Jacket</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In three minutes and nine seconds, the video crystallizes America’s intractable tribalism that threatens the stability of the republic. It manifested itself Jan. 6 2021, when a mob, exhorted by a defeated president, overran the U.S. Capitol in a failed bid to subvert an election’s legitimate outcome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CMT, the country music cable network,</span><a href="https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&amp;&amp;p=c2aa5d692ee7a522JmltdHM9MTY4OTgxMTIwMCZpZ3VpZD0wNWJjNzdhYy0yNmI4LTZmOTctMmNjNC02NGZkMjc0NTZlNWImaW5zaWQ9NTIxMw&amp;ptn=3&amp;hsh=3&amp;fclid=05bc77ac-26b8-6f97-2cc4-64fd27456e5b&amp;psq=try+that+in+a+small+town+video&amp;u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wNy8xOS9hcnRzL211c2ljL2phc29uLWFsZGVhbi10cnktdGhhdC1pbi1hLXNtYWxsLXRvd24tY210Lmh0bWw&amp;ntb=1" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">pulled the tune</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from its lineup. The mayor of Columbia, where the video was shot, told Billboard that he hopes the next video shot in his city will “seek a more positive message.” Rocker Sheryl Crow, who grew up amid the soybean, cotton and corn farms near Kennett in Missouri’s rural Bootheel,</span><a href="https://twitter.com/SherylCrow/status/1681485292425867264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1681485292425867264%7Ctwgr%5E8d2d6730841844b095e4ac9eec368c927f211dd6%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.stltoday.com%2Flife-entertainment%2Fnation-world%2Fmusic%2Fsheryl-crow-jason-aldean-song-controversy%2Farticle_f052d7bd-4ed4-5477-ae20-73a95809dcb4.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">tweeted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the video is “not American or small town-like. It’s just lame.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scorn, however, will supercharge the song and video in segments of rural America via streaming platforms and small-market radio. It thrives there because of its defiant message to urban and suburban America whose denizens, on average, are more liberal, more affluent, have higher levels of educational attainment and enjoy more stable employment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The imbalance, regardless of its reasons, is real, and Virginia illustrates the disparity well with its suburban/exurban “Golden Crescent” that arcs from Northern Virginia south to the Richmond region, then southeast down the Peninsula to the thriving cities and counties of Hampton Roads. Comparable pockets of prosperity are clustered around major university towns such as Charlottesville, Harrisonburg and Blacksburg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Little of the recent development, job creation and population growth those regions enjoyed reached the rural farming, factory and mining communities in Virginia’s fertile Southside and the mountainous Southwest that were the commonwealth’s economic engine for most of the 20th century.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global trade deals and U.S. policy decisions during the  past 30 years hastened the decay of many rural areas. International trade agreements made after the Cold War — the</span><a href="https://youtu.be/UpvMVTNSV6I" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">North American Free Trade Agreement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (or NAFTA) and China’s admission to the World Trade Organization — sent U.S. manufacturing jobs to cheaper overseas labor markets and helped turn once-bustling textile and furniture factories in cities like Danville and Martinsville into derelict husks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The</span><a href="https://www.lung.org/research/trends-in-lung-disease/tobacco-trends-brief/overall-tobacco-trends#:~:text=1%20The%20proportion%20of%20people%20smoking%20more%20than,108%20percent%20from%2032%20percent%20to%2066%20percent." target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">decline in domestic cigarette use</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> gradually curbed demand for the cash crop on which Virginia was founded. The tobacco-growing Southside bore the brunt of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clear and present</span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/summer-of-record-breaking-heat-paints-story-of-a-warming-world-scientists-say" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">climate concerns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have animated a move toward less-polluting energy sources and</span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=48696" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">away from coal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the digital “knowledge economy” flourished in Virginia’s most populous regions where broadband internet abounds, rural areas</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/04/19/pushing-broadband-into-rural-va-gives-us-a-chance-to-act-like-a-commonwealth/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">found themselves left behind</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Promises of high-speed digital service, made decades ago, and the jobs they can bring are only now slowly being honored in those areas.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s jarring for state policymakers in Richmond to hear that the vast outlands of Southwest and Southside Virginia are their afterthoughts, but driving through those towns and seeing the bare foundations and blank windows of shuttered factories and storefronts speaks a discomfiting truth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research by the University of Virginia’s Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service shows that 18 localities lost one-tenth or more of their population from</span><a href="https://demographics.coopercenter.org/sites/demographics/files/VA-Intercensal-Estimates_2000-2010.xls" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">2000</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to</span><a href="https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fdemographics.coopercenter.org%2Fsites%2Fdemographics%2Ffiles%2Fmedia%2Ffiles%2F2023-01%2FPopulationEstimates_July2022_VA_CooperCenter_0.xlsx&amp;wdOrigin=BROWSELINK" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">2022</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. All of them, except for Accomack County on the Eastern Shore, were in Southside or Southwest Virginia including Buchanan County, which decreased by 28%. Conversely, 60 localities grew by 10% or more, including 44 with a growth rate at or above 20% in the past 22 years. Northern Virginia exurb Loudoun County saw its population balloon by nearly 2 ½ times since the turn of the century.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rural areas are not without hope. A</span><a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/328268/country-living-enjoys-renewed-appeal.aspx" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">2021 national Gallup survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showed that 48% of respondents prefer to live in small towns or rural areas if possible, up from 39% three years earlier. People are indeed moving to the country, particularly since the pandemic, said Cooper Center demographer Hamilton Lombard. Many rural areas have done a good job attracting, he said, but not at a rate that equals or exceeds death rates from the older rural populations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In some rural counties, there are two or even three times more residents in their sixties than in their twenties. For me, the most significant gap that has opened up between rural and urban Virginia has been the age gap,” Lombard said in an email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cooper Center’s</span><a href="https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fdemographics.coopercenter.org%2Fsites%2Fdemographics%2Ffiles%2F2022-06%2FVAPopProjections_Total_2030-2050.xls&amp;wdOrigin=BROWSELINK" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">projections for future growth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suggest the gap will widen. By 2050, the populations of 14 rural counties — again, all in Southside or Southwest Virginia — will drop by one-fifth or more, with Buchanan projected to hemorrhage by 51%. At the same time, 37 localities are projected to increase by 20% or more, with Loudoun expected to increase by 77%. Only one — the Richmond exurb of Powhatan County — could be marginally construed as being in Southside Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That, along with seeing their small-town folkways and mores mocked in pop culture, makes some rural audiences receptive to hustlers exploiting grievance for their own gain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s only so long that the have-nots can watch the haves enjoy the growth and prosperity they’ve missed before disappointment ossifies into overt hostility. Sadly, as Aldean cynically proves, there’s more money to be made from widening that chasm than from bridging it.</span></p>

<p>Artificial intelligence, commonly known as AI, has been adopted by a quarter of businesses in the United States, according to the 2022 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson/resources/ai-adoption" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IBM</a> Global AI Adoption Index, a jump of more than 13% over the previous year. Many are beginning to <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/newsroom/eeoc-releases-new-resource-artificial-intelligence-and-title-vii" target="_blank" rel="noopener">use it</a> in the hiring process.</p>
<p>State laws haven’t kept up. Only Illinois, Maryland and New York City require employers to ask for consent first if using AI during certain parts of the hiring process. A handful of states are  considering similar legislation.</p>
<p>“Legislators are critical, and as always, legislators are always late to the party,” said Maryland state Del. Mark Fisher, a Republican. Fisher sponsored his state’s <a href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Legislation/Details/HB1202?ys=2020RS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">law</a>, which went into effect in 2020, regulating the use of facial recognition programs in hiring. It prohibits an employer from using certain facial recognition services — such as those that might cross-check applicants’ faces against outside databases — during an applicant’s interview process unless the applicant consents.</p>
<p>“Technology innovates first, and then it always seems like a good idea, until it isn’t,” Fisher said. “That’s when legislators step up and try to regulate things as best as they can.”</p>
<p>Where AI developers are interested in innovating as fast as possible with or without legislation, both developers and policymakers must think about the implications of their decisions, said Hayley Tsukayama, senior legislative activist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which advocates for civil liberties on the internet.</p>
<p>For policymakers to write effective legislation, developers must be transparent about what systems are being used and open to considering what the potential problems could be, Tsukayama said.</p>
<p>“It’s probably not exciting to people who want to move faster or people who want to put these systems in their workplace right now or already have them in the workplace right now,” she said. “But I do think for policymakers, it’s really important to talk to a lot of different people, particularly people who are going to be affected by this.”</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" title="“AI is used widely, but lawmakers have set few rules” — Stateline" src="https://stateline.org/2023/06/05/ai-is-used-widely-but-lawmakers-have-set-few-rules/embed/#?secret=qHK9MN8gEb#?secret=DuvUOQLARR" width="500" height="390" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-scripts" data-secret="DuvUOQLARR" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<h4 class="editorialSubhed">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">AI in hiring</h4>

	</h4>
<p>AI can help with the hiring process by performing resume evaluations, scheduling candidate interviews and sourcing data, according to an <a href="https://skillroads.com/blog/ai-and-facial-recognition-are-game-changers-for-recruitment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analysis</a> by Skillroads, which provides professional resume-writing services that incorporate AI.</p>
<p>Some members of Congress are trying to act too. The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8152/text" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposed</a> American Data Privacy and Protection Act aims to set rules for artificial intelligence, including AI risk assessments and its overall use, and would cover data collected during the hiring process. Introduced last year by U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone Jr., a New Jersey Democrat, it currently sits in the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee.</p>
<p>The Biden administration last year issued the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights, a set of principles to guide organizations and individuals on the design, use and deployment of automated systems, according to the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/what-is-the-blueprint-for-an-ai-bill-of-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">document</a>.</p>
<p>In the meantime, lawmakers in some states and localities have worked to create policies.</p>
<p>Maryland, Illinois and New York City are the only places with laws explicitly for job seekers dealing with artificial intelligence during the hiring process by requiring companies to inform them when it’s being used at certain points and ask for consent before moving forward, according to <a href="https://www.bclplaw.com/en-US/events-insights-news/2023-state-by-state-artificial-intelligence-legislation-snapshot.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data</a> from Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner, a global law firm providing legal advice to clients regarding business litigation, finance, real estate and more.</p>
<p>California, New Jersey, New York and Vermont also have considered bills that would regulate AI in hiring systems, according to The New York Times.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-21-526" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Face recognition technology</a> is used by many federal agencies, including for cybersecurity and policing, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office. Some industries are using it as well.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence can link face recognition programs with applicant databases in seconds, Fisher said, which he cited as the concern that motivated his bill.</p>
<p>His goal, he said, was to craft a narrow measure that could open the door for potential future AI-related legislation. The bill, which took effect in 2020 without being signed into law by then-Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, only includes the private sector, but Fisher said he’d like for it to be expanded to include public employers.</p>
<h4 class="editorialSubhed">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Legislative challenges</h4>

	</h4>
<p>Policymakers’ understanding of artificial intelligence, particularly when it comes to its civil rights implications, is almost nonexistent, said Clarence Okoh, the senior policy counsel at the Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit Center for Law and Social Policy (CLASP) and a Social Science Research Council Just Tech Fellow.</p>
<p>As a result, he said, companies that use AI often are regulating themselves.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, I think what’s happened is a lot of AI developers and sales have been very effective at crowding out the conversation with policymakers around how to govern AI and to mitigate social consequences,” Okoh said. “And so unfortunately, there’s a lot of interest in developing self-regulatory schemes.”</p>
<p>Some self-regulatory practices include audits or compliance that use general guidance such as the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights, Okoh said.</p>
<p>The results have sometimes raised concerns. Some organizations operating under their own guidelines have used AI recruiting tools that showed bias.</p>
<p>In 2014, a group of developers at Amazon began creating an experimental, automated program to review job applicants’ resumes for top talent, according to a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight/amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-women-idUSKCN1MK08G" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters</a> investigation, but by 2015, the company found that its system effectively had taught itself that male candidates were preferable.</p>
<p>Those close to the project told Reuters the experimental system was trained to filter applicants by observing patterns in resumes submitted to the company over a 10-year period — most of which came from men. Amazon told Reuters the tool “was never used by Amazon recruiters to evaluate candidates.”</p>
<p>But some companies say AI is helpful and that strong ethics rules are in place.</p>
<p>Helena Almeida, vice president-managing counsel at ADP, a human resources management software company, says its approach to using artificial intelligence in its products follows the same ethical guidelines as before the technology emerged. Regardless of the legal requirements, Almeida said, ADP considers it an obligation to go above and beyond the basic framework to ensure its products don’t discriminate.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence and machine learning is used in several of ADP’s hiring support services.  And many current laws apply to the artificial intelligence world, she said. ADP also offers its clients <a href="https://sbshrs.adpinfo.com/adp-time-kiosk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">certain services</a> that use face recognition technology, according to its website. As the technology evolves, ADP has <a href="https://www.adp.com/about-adp/artificial-intelligence.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adopted a set of principles</a> to govern its use of AI, machine learning and more.</p>
<p>“You can’t discriminate against a particular demographic group without AI, and you also can’t do it with AI,” Almeida said. “So, that’s an essential part of our framework and how we look at bias in these tools.”</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" title="“Programmers, Lawmakers Want A.I. to Eliminate Bias, Not Promote It” — Stateline" src="https://stateline.org/2021/06/09/programmers-lawmakers-want-a-i-to-eliminate-bias-not-promote-it/embed/#?secret=lf7ZWHaRkv#?secret=lpllSfaXct" width="500" height="531" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-scripts" data-secret="lpllSfaXct" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>One way to avoid issues with AI in the hiring process is to maintain human involvement, from product design to regular monitoring of automated decisions.</p>
<p>Samantha Gordon, the chief programs officer at TechEquity Collaborative, an organization advocating for tech workers in the industry, said in situations where machine learning or data collection is used with no human input, the machine is at risk of being biased toward certain groups.</p>
<p>In one example, HireVue, a platform helping employers collect video interviews and assessments from job seekers, announced in 2021 the removal of its facial analysis component after finding during an internal review that the system had less correlation to job performance than other elements of the algorithmic assessment, according to a release from the organization.</p>
<p>“I think that’s the thing that you don’t have to be a computer scientist to understand,” Gordon said. Speeding up the hiring process, she said, leaves room for error. That’s where Gordon said legislators are going to have to intervene.</p>
<p>And on both sides of the aisle, Fisher said, legislators think companies ought to show their work.</p>
<p>“I would like to think that, generally speaking, people would like to see there be a lot more transparency and disclosure in the use of this technology,” Fisher said. “Who’s using this technology? And why?”</p>
<p><em>Editors: This article has been corrected to reflect that an internal Amazon artificial intelligence hiring program was experimental, and, the company says, never used by recruiters to evaluate job candidates. It also has been corrected to note that the law in Maryland went into effect without being signed by then-Gov. Larry Hogan.</em></p>

<p>But Monday morning, she stood marching outside Maximus’ offices in the Hillsborough County, Florida town of Riverview east of Tampa, joining dozens of her colleagues and labor allies in a one-day strike against the company. Employees are calling for higher wages and better working conditions. She said it wasn’t something that was easy for her to do.</p>
<p>“It’s extremely hard. It’s nerve wracking. I don’t want to be laid off like many of my co-workers were recently, with very little notice,” Charles said. “It is scary, but I’m doing this for my children, and I’m doing it also for my fellow employees.”</p>
<p>Maximus is a Virginia-based, multi-million federal communications contractor with over 35,000 employees based in the U.S. and around the world. It is <a href="https://maximus.com/news/maximus-awarded-centers-medicare-medicaid-services-contract-contact-center-operations" target="_blank">contracted</a> with the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) to provide call center operations for 75 million Americans seeking information about their Medicare benefits as well as learning about programs available through the federal marketplace established by the Affordable Care Act (ACA), often known as Obamacare.</p>
<p>The Maximus workers are represented by the Communication Workers of America (CWA).</p>
<p>The company recently <a href="https://investor.maximus.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/517/maximus-reports-fiscal-year-2023-second-quarter-results" target="_blank">announced</a> that its revenue had increased to $1.21 billion, and it <a href="https://maximus.com/news/maximus-awarded-centers-medicare-medicaid-services-contract-contact-center-operations" target="_blank">announced</a> last September that it had been awarded a new contract with the CMS valued at $6.6 billion.</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">More layoffs</h4>

	</h4>
<p>However, last month the company laid off more than 700 employees at Maximus call centers around the country, prompting the Communications Workers of America (CWA) to file Unfair Labor Practice <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/cwa-files-unfair-labor-practice-charges-against-billion-dollar-federal-contractor#:~:text=WASHINGTON%2C%20D.C.%20%E2%80%93%20Today%2C%20Communications,of%20mass%20layoffs%20this%20year." target="_blank">charges</a> against them, alleging that some workers were laid off in retaliation for speaking out about their working conditions.</p>
<p>Starting pay for call center employees at Maximus begins at $16.20 an hour. Workers want to see that rise to $25 an hour.</p>
<p>“We want fair pay,” says Steven McLeary, 24, who has been working at another Maximus office in Tampa for the past year. “We’re getting $17 an hour while people at Social Security and Medicaid are getting paid $25 an hour, because we’re through a contract instead of directly for the government. We deserve that $25 an hour. “</p>
<p>Similar one-day strikes were held outside Maximus offices Monday in Hattiesburg, Mississippi; Chester, Virginia; and Bogalusa, Louisiana, near the border of Mississippi.<i></i></p>
<p>Delora Brown worked for Maximus for a year and a half before being let go by the company in August 2022. She now works at another call center in the Tampa Bay area as a customer service representative for Medicare Advantage, where she says the pay and working conditions are much better. At Maximus, Brown said she did not like the fact that she was docked pay if it took longer than three minutes to use the restroom.</p>
<p>“Whenever you clock out, you put [your computer] on a bathroom break, it starts the timer,” she explained. “So if it goes over a certain time, you have to report that you were at the bathroom. ‘Why were you at the bathroom so long?’ I’m like – I don’t feel like I need to elaborate on that, on me going to the bathroom. It was kind of disgusting.”</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Maximus provided a statement that included a reference to bathroom breaks: “Employees can take a bathroom break at any time. No one is denied a break; no one is shamed for taking a break.”</p>
<p>The one-day strike comes a month after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill into law passed in the recent legislative session that cracks down on public employee unions in Florida. The measure prevents dues from being deducted automatically from workers’ paychecks, forcing them to make separate payments. And it would decertify any public employee union (such as a teacher union) if fewer than 60% of the employees choose to become a dues-paying members.</p>
<p>Notably the law omitted unions representing law enforcement officers, corrections officers and firefighters.<i></i></p>
<p>That rankles former Hillsborough County Democratic state Rep. Sean Shaw, who attended Monday’s protest to show solidarity with the striking Maximus employees.</p>
<p>“Listen, what’s good for one union should be good for all unions,” he said. “So if all unions need to end, then let’s end them all. Why are we picking out certain unions?  You and I know why they’re picking them out, because they don’t want to get on the wrong side of our first responders who we all love and respect, but no union is worse or better than another; if this union had to end because Tallahassee thinks that it shouldn’t exist, the police union should be held to the same standard. The firefighter union ought to be held to the same standard. I don’t know why one is better than another.”</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Strikes taking place</h4>

	</h4>
<p>A representative from Maximus issued a statement to the Florida Phoenix regarding the strikes taking place in Florida and elsewhere on Monday.</p>
<p><em>Maximus welcomes the opportunity to engage directly with our employees and work together to resolve their concerns. We respect our employees’ legal right to attempt to organize, and any information we provide is designed to help them make an informed decision about union representation.  Maximus follows all labor laws and regulations, and we strive to treat all employees equally with respect and sensitivity.</em></p>
<p><em>Our employees are engaged and motivated to deliver high-quality customer service to millions of Americans</em><em>. </em><em> With competitive wages and benefits, our employees believe Maximus is a great place to work. We know this because we have historically lower attrition rates than normal.</em></p>
<p><em>With the end of open enrollment season for Medicare and the Federal Health Insurance Exchange, we entered the time of year when there is diminished demand for our call center services.  As an organization, we hold ourselves accountable for our actions. Whenever we make staffing decisions, we prioritize treating all our people with respect and sensitivity. To that end, as a company-wide practice, we coordinate with other Maximus programs to identify available positions for impacted employees. </em></p>
<p><em>Due in part to the administration’s action raising the minimum wage to $16.20 per hour for employees of federal contractors, Maximus staff turnover this year was lower than expected in our Contact Center Operations program. Determining compensation requires input and approval from our government customers. We work with every customer to strike the right balance between competitive compensation and achieving successful results at scale and value. </em></p>
<p><em>Additionally, </em><em>our most recent employee engagement survey shows that 84% of our employees plan to stay with the company for at least another 12 months.  Over the past several years, Maximus has improved pay and compensation, reduced employees’ out-of-pocket health care expenses and improved work processes and safety.  We continue to look for ways to assure that Maximus is an employer of choice. Employees can take a bathroom break at any time. No one is denied a break; no one is shamed for taking a break.</em></p>
<p><em>Our people want to work for Maximus and their passion is making a difference. They consistently provide high-quality service and demonstrate deep knowledge about the programs we support. Thanks to our employees’ performance, we continue to provide the best customer experience to the American public when they need help navigating government programs<strong>. </strong></em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.bls.gov/web/laus/lauhsthl.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twenty states reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an unemployment rate under 3% in April, while 15 states saw record lows, led by South Dakota at 1.9%, followed by Nebraska at 2%, and New Hampshire and North Dakota at 2.1%.

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virginia unemployment </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>According to Bureau of Labor Statistics data, Virginia&#8217;s unemployment rate dropped to 3.1% in April, a slight decrease from its March rate and below the national rate of 3.4%. A May 19 press release from Gov. Glenn Youngkin&#8217;s office also noted the state recorded its highest labor force participation rate since June 2014 in April, at 66.2%.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Virginia labor market continues to show strength during the first part of 2023,&#8221; said Secretary of Commerce and Trade Caren Merrick. &#8220;Despite large gains in labor force participation, filling open positions remains a challenge for businesses in the commonwealth and we remain laserfocused on getting more Virginians into the workforce.&#8221;</p>
<p>Recent data from the Virginia Employment Commission also found there was just under one unemployed worker for every two job openings in Virginia in March 2023 <span style="font-weight: 400;">— a measurement known as the &#8220;job seekers ratio.&#8221; That ratio has held steady since July 2021. </span></p>

<p>Mark Vitner, chief economist at Piedmont Crescent Capital in Charlotte, North Carolina, said major metropolitan areas and emerging metropolitan areas in the South have benefited from recent shifts in the labor market. In Florida, the labor market in Miami, Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach, Orlando, Tampa and Jacksonville has been growing rapidly, he said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Huntsville, Alabama, is one of the fastest growing markets and it&#8217;s a big tech market in aerospace and in defense. We&#8217;ve seen a huge influx from California into Huntsville and Chattanooga, Tennessee, has seen an influx of investment in the automotive industry,” he said. “The Port of Savannah has been the fastest growing port in the country. It&#8217;s just fueled enormous growth in the industrial market in Savannah and more broadly in south Georgia. These markets have low unemployment rates and very strong job growth and so that&#8217;s what you want to see that mix of.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vitner added that the rural areas of states with low unemployment may have a different story to tell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“States that have a larger rural population tend to have lower labor force participation and given the stronger overall job growth, it results in some very low unemployment rates without particularly strong nonfarm employment,” Vitner said.</span></p>
<p><iframe id="datawrapper-chart-JpTDK" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" title="State unemployment rates for April 2023" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/JpTDK/2/" height="483" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" aria-label="Map" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();

</script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be sure, in some states, the number of people who have lost work has increased. Ten states had rates of 4% or higher than the nation. Nevada, which had the highest unemployment rate in the country in 2020, has seen job gains but still had the nation’s highest rate in April, at 5.4%. States like Washington and California, which have seen large layoffs among tech companies, also have seen their job markets slightly worsen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the recovery has also lifted up workers often sidelined in worse economic times. Bureau of Labor Statistics data on the demographics of workers and their unemployment rates for April showed that employment among Black women climbed to a 22-year high. Women’s labor force participation is also moving up. It increased by 0.6 of a percentage point in the past year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That growth is affecting women of all ages and education levels, and Black women and Hispanic women have had some of the biggest labor force participation growth, at a 2.2% and 2.1% increase over the same period, according to an </span><a href="https://poverty.umich.edu/2023/05/05/april-jobs-report-black-womens-employment-rate-at-22-year-high/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the University of Michigan’s Betsey Stevenson, a professor of economics, and Benny Docter, a senior policy analyst. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The unemployment rate for people with disabilities, while still high compared to the overall unemployment rate, is </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">6.3%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> compared to 8.3% a year ago. In March, the unemployment rate for people aged 16 to 24, who are already benefiting from pre-pandemic labor market conditions, marked a 70-year low at </span><a href="https://www.epi.org/blog/class-of-2023-young-adults-are-graduating-into-a-strong-labor-market/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">7.5%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to the Economic Policy Institute. In April, it dipped further for that age group, to </span><a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS14024887" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">6.5%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What happens when the economy is strong is that you can bring marginalized groups of workers off of the sidelines because employers are more open to different folks essentially,” said Katherine Gallagher Robbins, senior fellow at the National Partnership for Women &amp; Families. “Part of the consequence of this strong labor market is that you're seeing low unemployment rates for Black workers, and in particular Black women and for disabled workers. The rates for disabled workers have been both in terms of unemployment, but also in terms of participation, really strong compared to what we have seen in years gone by.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gallagher Robbins added that Gen Z workers came into a very strong labor market, which bodes better for them than previous generations, but it also means they have more to lose if the economy falters soon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They're hopefully in a position of setting themselves up for lifelong higher earnings, and yet they will be amongst the first to go. They tend to work in industries where there's more churn,” she said, such as retail and hospitality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many industries are also showing fast job growth right now, Docter said, and growth has been largest in education and health care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Private sector education and health services "had been the strongest job grower through the time between the last recession and 2020, and it got knocked pretty far off course in a way that was pretty atypical. Since then, we've seen really steady, really impressive growth most months (in those areas) and I expect that we still will for a while,” he said. “It’s nowhere near its pre-pandemic trajectory, so there'd be over 700,000 more jobs in that industry today than there are. And so there's a lot of space there to grow if you look at the numbers this month. … There's nothing really to say that those industries are going to falter any time soon.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The labor market is still leaning toward greater power for workers as well, which has been positive for labor organizers, Gallagher Robbins said. Americans’ approval of labor unions has </span><a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/398303/approval-labor-unions-highest-point-1965.aspx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increased</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from 64% before the pandemic to 71% in 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[Worker bargaining] is on the rise and not accidentally. … Not everything has been successful, but those [organizing efforts] coming to the fore now, I think are no coincidence,” she said. “That is also something that is interacting and intersecting with the economy of the moment, and if we shift back towards a place where workers have less bargaining power, I think that that's going to have an impact on the ability to organize.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vitner said the retirement of Baby Boomers provides many workers with greater labor power than they previously enjoyed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Workers clearly have more negotiating power today. One of the things that's in their favor is that we have a rising tide of Baby Boomers that are leaving the workforce. And that makes for a very tight labor market and certain industries have even greater challenges because their workforce skews a bit older,” he said. “Younger workers have a bit more negotiating power but they have a brighter outlook. They’re entering the workforce at a time where there's going to be opportunities to advance relatively quickly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inflation has made it more difficult for many workers to enjoy these gains, but that could be changing. Although inflation is still </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/cpi/#:~:text=The%20Consumer%20Price%20Index%20(CPI,U.S.%20and%20various%20geographic%20areas." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">far above</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, it is moderating, and wages are now </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/wkyeng.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">outpacing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> inflation, at a 6.1% increase in median weekly earnings for January, February and March compared to a year before. During the same period, there was a 5.8% rise in consumer prices. In April, </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">average hourly earnings rose</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by 4.4% over the past 12 months.</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><em><strong>By Lisa D. Dance</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic is “officially” over. But, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">like thousands of other people in Virginia, I&#8217;m still waiting to receive my full <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/09/20/in-numbers-virginias-struggle-to-distribute-unemployment-benefits/" target="_blank">unemployment benefits</a> from the pandemic. I’m lucky; I can cover my bills. I worry about the people who can’t pay theirs and have waited over a year for the unemployment benefits they are entitled to. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week marks two frustrating anniversaries dealing with the Virginia Employment Commission (VEC). It has been two years since my initial online unemployment application was submitted and, due to an issue, could not be completed. It’s been six months since notification of my successful appeal. During this time, I’ve made countless calls to the VEC, endured a 15-month wait for my appeal hearing, and faced communication and technology dead ends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As someone who works as a User Experience researcher, VEC’s ineffective communication and use of technology as a barrier has made the experience even more frustrating.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Caring about the human costs </h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one has made a full accounting of the harmful impact the VEC delays have caused to actual people. There’s the</span> <a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/local/mycity/norfolk/norfolk-woman-breast-cancer-unemployment-benefits-two-years-after-appeal/291-4faf3968-d3bd-4813-9ff5-f776ca7af2e2" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">woman battling breast cancer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who waited two years for unemployment after being laid off, an Air</span><a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/money/vec-missing-unemployment-benefits/291-b896cf20-4f97-4180-81d5-5ed78885ee44" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Force veteran with PTSD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who couldn’t reach VEC for months,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Richmond </span><a href="https://www.wtvr.com/problem-solvers/richmond-woman-still-dealing-with-same-issues-after-vec-system-update" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">woman whose power was cut off temporarily while waiting for VEC benefits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and many more who didn’t get a news story. I can only imagine the missed bills, maxed out credit cards, unfilled prescriptions, potential homelessness, hunger and other problems <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/07/08/virginia-employment-commissions-overpayments-shouldnt-cause-people-stress-or-heartburn/" target="_blank">people owed benefits</a> have faced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://oui.doleta.gov/unemploy/ui_insurance_appeal.asp" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Department of Labor statistics on unemployment benefits for March 2023</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">show the “Number of (Appeal) Cases Waiting over 360 days” for the VEC was <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-03_la_appeals_9055L-3.xlsx" target="_blank">41,202</a>. That’s 41,202 people whose necessities of life – food, mortgage, medical expenses, childcare, car payments – may remain unmet. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Continued failure to act in a timely manner </h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I appreciate VEC employees who worked hard to process the unprecedented number of claims during the pandemic. They were already dealing with the VEC being underfunded, understaffed, and in need of a long-delayed technology upgrade. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, VEC’s previous leadership made a bad situation worse by delaying hiring more staff, ineffectively deploying contractors and telling people to keep calling the VEC, knowing most of the calls could not be answered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under new leadership, the VEC has made some changes but </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/virginia-employment-commission-vec-unemployment-youngkin/article_14b8fbaa-d7b6-11ed-b574-f36458599424.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ranks last among states in the percentage of initial claims paid in 21 days and is next to last in handling lower level appeals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">In March 2023, the average age of pending appeals was 427 days. Unfortunately, the time from filing my appeal to a hearing was 475 days. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, earlier this year VEC asked the General Assembly to </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/virginia-employment-commission-vec-unemployment-youngkin/article_14b8fbaa-d7b6-11ed-b574-f36458599424.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reduce the time someone could file an appeal from 30 to 15 days</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Thankfully, that legislation was withdrawn. </span><a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/politics/virginia-unemployment-benefits-appeals-hearings-deadline/291-537370cd-c12a-4e2e-a03e-95368d3073b3" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, the VEC began sending notices to dismiss appeals they said were not filed on time</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">At present, the VEC is still not handling claims or appeals in a timely manner.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Communication is still ineffective, technology is still used as a barrier </h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I received a letter from the VEC almost six months ago stating my appeal was successful, but it didn’t state what the next steps were. I called the First Level Appeals office and was directed to another department whose phone went unanswered or had a full mailbox over the span of several weeks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I called First Level Appeals again, I was given a phone number for the Customer Contact Center and instructed to request “the release of my funds” from them. The Customer Contact Center&#8217;s automated messaging encouraged me to use the online system to complete tasks, but none of the tasks related to actions to take after an appeal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I tried to reach an actual person, I went through a series of prompts including entering my Social Security number, only to hear a message stating the Customer Contact Center was unable to answer any questions about appeals. The automated voice then said “Goodbye” and hung up on me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that, I tried the VEC website. Neither the “VEC Online Services” nor “Information on the Appeals Process” page had information on what to do after a successful appeal. The “Frequently Asked Questions – Appeals” page said to contact the local office where your claim was filed (which didn’t apply to me) or call the Customer Contact Center. It’s a long loop of confusion and unanswered questions.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Changes and accountability needed</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s baffling to me that tens of thousands of people have engaged in the VEC appeals process since the pandemic and yet there are no instructions on what to do after a successful appeal. How could such an obvious need for communication be missed at every touchpoint?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the VEC continues to struggle, who is thinking about the most vulnerable Virginians who are due unemployment benefits and still have not received them? What is the VEC’s obligation to provide timely services? Who ensures the VEC complies? Who ensures the VEC’s processes, communication and technology are effective for the people who need to use them? We can only hope these questions will not also go unanswered. </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest morale boost for Richmond Starbucks barista Tyler Hofmann is when customers make up names like “union solidarity” to identify their orders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It gets printed out and [employees] have to call out union stuff in the café,” he said. That opens up an opportunity for discussion about workers’ ongoing grievances against the specialty coffee giant. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hofmann is working at Starbucks again after having been fired last May in what his union and the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) claimed was illegal retaliation for his organizing efforts at the Richmond store. A private settlement was reached between the company and the regional board of the Workers United union, according to the NLRB, and Hofmann was reinstated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The barista battle for higher wages and better hours has spread since a group of employees in Buffalo, New York voted in December 2021 to become the first unionized Starbucks in the nation. To date, workers in nearly 300 of the more than 9,000 U.S. locations have voted to unionize, but Starbucks has yet to reach a contract agreement with any of those stores. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Five Starbucks locations in the Richmond area were the first in Virginia to vote to unionize in April 2022, becoming local units of Workers United, which is affiliated with the Service Employees International Union. Workers at Starbucks stores in Merrifield and Leesburg quickly followed suit. In November, employees at the Arlington Courthouse Plaza store joined the list.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But unionization efforts, while legal under the National Labor Relations Act, the nation’s signature law guaranteeing the right of workers to organize, have run into challenges in many parts of the country, including Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law says that employers may not discharge, lay off or discipline employees or refuse to hire job applicants because they are pro-union.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But at the beginning of March, an NLRB administrative law judge in New York issued a decision finding Starbucks had violated the act hundreds of times in the western part of the state through “egregious and widespread misconduct demonstrating a general disregard for the employees’ fundamental rights.” His decision requires Starbucks to bargain with the union, reinstate unlawfully fired workers, reopen an unlawfully closed facility, reimburse workers for consequential harm they suffered as a result of Starbucks’ unlawful conduct and post a notice, on all forms of social media, with an explanation of workers’ rights, according to the NLRB Office of Public Affairs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">there are now more than a dozen active cases concerning the company. Some cases include charges that Starbucks has retaliated against and fired workers for engaging in union activities and has conducted coercive actions such as surveillance. The Virginia cases also allege the company has refused to bargain with workers and bargained in bad faith</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew W. Trull, Starbucks senior manager of corporate communications, said in an email that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the charges filed by Workers United for stores in Virginia, </span><b>“</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">the NLRB has only filed a </span><a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/case/05-CA-296459" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">complaint</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in one case</span><b>, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">at this time. Moreover, nine of the open cases originate from a single store in Leesburg, Virginia — of which, one has been </span><a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/case/05-CA-300673" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">withdrawn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Workers United (making for a total of 15 active charges in Virginia).”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NLRB has not made a final decision resolving the merits of any of these cases addressing union-related issues involving Workers United, Trull said. “We believe the allegations made by Workers United and the NLRB in these matters are meritless and that actions taken in our Virginia stores were lawful and in alignment with long-established partner policies — not in retaliation for any partners’ participation in, or support of, concerted union activities.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Starbucks’ Founders Day — a March 22 event created to honor CEO Howard Schultz — employees from about 100 stores, including one in Richmond and one in Arlington, walked out in protest.</span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following day, Starbucks shareholders approved a proposal for the board of directors to conduct a third-party assessment of how the company is treating its workers. The company said it already has undertaken its own “human rights assessment.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later, before a U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee hearing, Schultz testified that the company has not broken labor laws and is willing to bargain with unionized workers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Rebecca Hess, an organizer for the Mid-Atlantic Regional Joint Board of Workers United, said Starbucks has committed multiple unfair practices in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s been multiple firings for union activity. They’ve violated [employees’] rights when they’ve refused to provide credit card tipping” in stores with union representation, she said. “There is disparate treatment. Store managers are telling our partners, ‘I would love to promote you or give you more hours,’” she continued, but then saying they cannot because the employees are union supporters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hofmann, an organizer who has worked at Starbucks for four years, said a number of other workers who say they were fired over their union activities are still waiting for their hearings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firings “are always for something different. I was terminated for ‘not living up to the Starbucks mission and values,’” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An in-person bargaining session between the company and workers at a unionized Chesterfield store has been scheduled for April 17, but Hofmann complained about the length of time it has taken to get to that step. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve been waiting for a year for bargaining,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hess also criticized the company for its slowness to engage in bargaining.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bargaining for initial contracts is a notoriously slow process in the United States. According to a Bloomberg Law labor report, it takes an average of 465 days for a company to negotiate a first contract with a union.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starbucks has said that at some stores employees have rejected in-person bargaining sessions and are insisting on negotiations that could include online sessions.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Starbucks believes in-person negotiations would best facilitate the give and take of negotiations,” the company said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Workers continue to push for unionization, Hess said, because they believe “Starbucks is going in the wrong direction.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They want Starbucks to listen to them,”</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">she said. “Stores are understaffed everywhere. They want a living wage. They are okay with regular rates, but when you are cut down to nine hours a week, how do you live on that? They are starving people out by not giving them adequate hours and not adequately staffing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inadequate staffing, she continued, has led to other problems, including numerous customer complaints. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don’t expect them to give away the farm, but why not be the union coffee company? At one time, Starbucks did treat the partners right. They forget what made them great,” Hess said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Fairfax County continues its yearly budget ritual and holds public hearings on April 11-13, workers and citizens alike always look for clues about priorities and a shared vision for the future. For Fairfax County employees like myself, we are often left with a sense of disillusionment and this year is no different. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What message does it send when general county employees are offered a meager 2% pay increase? This is hard to take, especially when compared to the </span><a href="https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/boardofsupervisors/sites/boardofsupervisors/files/assets/03-21-23%20final%20summary.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent raises</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of almost 40% for the chairman’s office and nearly 30% for individual supervisors. Current workers are also frustrated by salary compression, exacerbated by chronic underfunding in past budget cycles. During the pandemic, we were considered essential employees who helped keep things running in our county. Now it&#8217;s back to more of the same.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fairfax County has long been considered a premier place to work in the DC metro area and now, also in surrounding counties like Prince William and Loudoun, not to mention Federal agencies and private sector firms, are attracting interest from our employees. For Fairfax to compete and maintain a qualified workforce with high morale, it must value its employees. However, the </span><a href="https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/budget/fy-2024-advertised-budget-plan-volume-1-general-fund" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">current proposed budget</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows that priorities are headed in another direction. As we say, values are measured by numbers more than the words that accompany them. With a $90 million budget surplus, it’s clear there is room to make a difference. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what is the solution to strengthen and appreciate the Fairfax workforce during the budget process and beyond?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s collective bargaining and a strong union contract. When employees have a seat at the table and work in collaboration with county leaders, we can improve services and the lives of those who  do the work every day. County employees look forward to joining our fire/rescue and police colleagues with collective bargaining rights to improve the compensation, benefits and working conditions that we all deserve. My colleagues have renewed optimism after seeing the growth of the union movement throughout Virginia – especially Richmond city workers who recently filed for their union election. Change is possible and we are ready to fight for it.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a leader in our Fairfax chapter of SEIU Virginia 512, I am proud of the work we have done so far when coming together in our union and I look forward to what else we can do in the future. We played a pivotal role in winning paid family medical leave, for example. This has already resulted in the ability of workers to avoid agonizing choices between carrying out work, versus losing pay while tending to people at home who truly need care and loving support. When employees are free of stress concerning scheduling, benefits, and wages, we will be free to provide the best services possible for county residents. A union contract will help lock this in place and create stability for years to come. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether it is in the budget or otherwise funded, it’s time for the County to prioritize fairly paying its workforce and truly recognize us for what we are and what we have always been: essential workers. </span></p>

This rate would continue to increase incrementally until 2027, when it reached Virginia minimum wage. The slow increase is meant to help employers adjust, according to Del. Patrick Hope, D-Arlington, who introduced the measure.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Hope’s bill passed the House unanimously on a block vote, meaning it was not discussed prior to voting. The bill passed the Senate 22-18.</p>

It would remove the incremental pay bumps of the original bill. Instead, the wages of all previously exempt employees would be raised to Virginia’s minimum wage when use of the certificates ended in 2030.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Any currently certified employer would be grandfathered in until 2030, but no new certificates would be issued after July 1.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The national average for workers being paid subminimum wage is $3.34 an hour, according to a U.S. Commission on Civil Rights <a href="https://www.usccr.gov/files/2020/2020-09-17-Subminimum-Wages-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.usccr.gov/files/2020/2020-09-17-Subminimum-Wages-Report.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1680807933396000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2SJ9rt97qEGGTJ9bTDb8Si">2020 report</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I don’t know how anybody could pay that and look themselves in the mirror,” said Senate Majority Leader Dick Saslaw, D-Fairfax, when speaking to the Senate. “That’s disgusting. And there’s no other way to describe that.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">Disabled workers can encounter long Labor Department processing times that prevent them from getting back pay owed due to incorrectly calculated wages, according to <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-105116" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-105116&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1680807933396000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3qG17nypZrLovtKY8Iu7BR">a study</a> by the U.S. Government Accountability Office.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The certificates gave disabled workers “an entry point” into the workforce in the 1930s, said Jewelyn Cosgrove, <a href="https://melwood.org/newsroom/hb1924vatoeliminate14c/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://melwood.org/newsroom/hb1924vatoeliminate14c/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1680807933396000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0yy0ISwPfem9LhEH05hsYd">Melwood</a>’s vice president of government and public relations. Such exemptions need to be reevaluated through a modern lens, she said.</p>

It held a certificate until 2014, Cosgrove said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Disabled workers have access to more jobs these days, versus when it used to be “get a job, any job,” Cosgrove said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“People with disabilities should be and can be engaged in the workforce in meaningful ways in the careers of their choosing,” Cosgrove said.</p>

These employers pay at least 286 total workers subminimum wage, according to the Labor Department. Four more employers in Virginia are pending approval for their certificates.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Active certificates are down 46% since 2018, according to <a href="https://apse.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10_20_21-APSE-14c-Update-REV.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://apse.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10_20_21-APSE-14c-Update-REV.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1680807933396000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1CsoRXUXC8WLssqODihdWZ">a study</a> by the Association of People Supporting Employment First.

<p dir="ltr">“I would never, ever accept a job where I was making $3 an hour,” said <a href="https://apse.org/state-legislation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://apse.org/state-legislation/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1680807933396000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3HmS8wZH4ovAafEfQKRtyc">Virginia APSE</a> lobbyist Matthew Shapiro. “You wouldn’t do that, so why is it OK for us to do that to more vulnerable … folks than me?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Shapiro was born with cerebral palsy, a condition that affects almost every part of his life, he said. He is the founder and CEO of the consulting firm <a href="https://www.6wheelsconsulting.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.6wheelsconsulting.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1680807933396000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3S83I3PQ5dquSAlH5X_jX-">6 Wheels Consulting</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Resources such as job coaches, at-home work and self-employment render the certificate exemption no longer necessary, Shapiro said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“What kind of Virginia do we want to be?” Shapiro said. “Do we want to be one that pays people fairly for the work that they do, and at good wages? Or are we OK saying we’re going to pay somebody $10 a week?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Thirteen states already have legislation in place to prevent employers from paying subminimum wage, according to the APSE study. Reforms are also being attempted <a href="https://www.aging.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/transformation_to_competitive_integrated_employment_act.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.aging.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/transformation_to_competitive_integrated_employment_act.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1680807933396000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2OhF4dSq_V32mb_Zl55lqC">at the federal level</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This is a very demoralizing issue, and it shouldn’t really be an issue in the 21st century,” said Charlotte Woodward, the <a href="https://ndss.org/Virginia-HB-1924" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ndss.org/Virginia-HB-1924&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1680807933396000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3BFL5Gco8VFQW8x_IcvwCk">National Down Syndrome Society</a>’s education program associate.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Woodward was born with Down syndrome, she said. Her <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ndssorg/video/6858333590355201286" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.tiktok.com/@ndssorg/video/6858333590355201286&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1680807933396000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3-Q5DdmdGYizVBDqNxHgud">advocacy work</a> is important to her because she believes disabled voices provide needed visibility, she said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The doctor told my mom I would never learn to read or write,” Woodward said. “That, when I grew up, I would work in a sheltered workshop.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">A sheltered workshop is traditionally <a href="https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0302101270" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0302101270&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1680807933396000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0UAWsi2uQULvPEojzHMsGF">defined</a> as a supervised workplace for adults who have a physical or intellectual disability.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Of course, my mom didn’t take those words to heart,” Woodward added.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Opponents of the bill question if sheltered workshops and subminimum wage are harmful to disabled workers. Senate Minority Leader Tommy Norment, R-Williamsburg, spoke to the Senate about the disabled son of his former administrative assistant.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“He never once, never once, mentioned how much he was paid or what the compensation was,” Norment said. “It was the intangible reward and satisfaction and fulfillment of his day that he got going to work.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sen. Jill Vogel, R-Fauquier, also opposed the bill. It would take away opportunities for employers to provide “a haven, a place, a job for people where they do not pay them minimum wage,” she said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Almost all of the workers originally employed under Melwood’s former certificate are still employed by the organization, but now at “full wage,” Cosgrove said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It’s about recognizing that our employees’ voices, and their desire for that full wage, brought that dignity — brought that stability,” Cosgrove said. “It improved our employee morale immediately.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">To assume disabled workers will thrive in sheltered production does not account for individual ability and interest, said Tonya Milling, executive director of The Arc of Virginia.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Think of it as the same way you approach things in your own life,” Milling said. “When I looked for a job, I looked for something that matched my skills, matched my abilities and could hold my interest.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Shapiro sympathized with concerns over disabled workers and their well-being.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“There is a ‘dignity of risk’ argument that can be made here,” Shapiro said. “Are we going to allow [them] to go out into the world and break a nail? Or are we going to keep [them] in a bubble their entire lives?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Virginia Department of Aging and Rehabilitative Services plans to aid transitioning employers with nearly $14 million in provided federal funding, according to the <a href="https://www.dlcv.org/employment-feb-23" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.dlcv.org/employment-feb-23&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1680807933396000&amp;usg=AOvVaw31SQvRdeQywOoEt2mHu5P9">Disability Law Center of Virginia</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Youngkin’s amendment, in addition to codifying the funds, would require DARS to report to the governor’s office in 2024 about the transition away from certificates.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lawmakers will vote on Youngkin’s changes when they reconvene on April 12.</p>

The bill failed to advance out of a House subcommittee by a 3-5 vote.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Fowler introduced a similar bill in <a href="https://www.richmondsunlight.com/bill/2019/hb1990/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.richmondsunlight.com/bill/2019/hb1990/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1680202171777000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1DsR4ninFK5m814MpcHjzb">2019</a>, and Del.

<p dir="ltr">Convirs-Fowler did not return multiple calls and emails for a statement about the bill.</p>
<p dir="ltr">DPOR did not bring the bill to the General Assembly, and declined to comment on the legislation when contacted.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Meagan Forbes, director of legislation and senior legislative counsel for the Arlington-based Institute for Justice, testified to the subcommittee panel on behalf of the bill.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> “Threading is a safe hair removal technique,” Forbes said. “It does not involve chemicals or dangerous devices, threaders simply use their hands and a single piece of cotton thread to remove hairs.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Twenty states currently exempt threading “without issue,” according to Forbes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Zahra Lakhani, a DPOR-licensed educator, recently retired after doing eyebrow threading for approximately 30 years.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It would be a step backwards to remove the license requirement for threading, she said. The education an eyebrow threader receives through instruction is important, Lakhani said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It’s very important to know the sanitary part of it, how to keep yourself safe, how to keep your customer safe, how to do the practice well and well skilled,” Lakhnai said.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> Sanitization is essential for threading because technicians roll the thread on the clients’ faces, which could cause cross-contamination, according to Lakhani.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> Rolling the thread cuts or burns the skin if the skin is not tight and held a specific way while removing hair from your face, she said.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> “The consumer and the provider should always be protected,” Lakhani said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If the waxing education requirement was removed, Lakhani thinks at least 60 hours of threading training would be “sufficient,” and should include sanitation training, theory and practice hours.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Stefania Rafeedie, who owns Arch and Beauty Studio LLC in Fairfax County, <a href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/GetFile.cfm?File=meeting%5C134%5C32616%5CAgenda_DPOR_32616_v1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/GetFile.cfm?File%3Dmeeting%255C134%255C32616%255CAgenda_DPOR_32616_v1.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1680202171777000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3XKFuTNjkvMx4Or0eaqkbn">wrote</a> DPOR to request an “Eyebrow Specialist” license in 2021, according to the letter accessed from the regulatory agency. More specific training is needed to provide specialized eyebrow treatments, according to Rafeedie.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It is puzzling to me that while one of the above licenses are required, none of them teach a future practitioner how to perform these services,” Rafeedie stated.</p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tyson Foods will continue to be eligible for millions in state economic development grants linked to a facility it’s constructing in Pittsylvania County despite its announcement it will close a major plant in Hanover County that will lead to the loss of 692 jobs, said the Virginia Economic Development Partnership. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, former Gov. Ralph Northam’s administration announced Tyson would receive $8 million in incentives, in addition to tax credits, to site a new plant in Pittsylvania. In return, the company promised to invest almost $300 million and create 376 new jobs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incentives offered to Tyson included a $3 million grant from the Commonwealth’s Opportunity Fund, a $3 million Virginia Investment Performance Grant — which “encourages continued capital investment by existing Virginia companies” — a $500,000 grant from the Governor’s Agriculture and Forestry Industries Development Fund and $1.5 million in grants and loans from the Tobacco Region Opportunity Fund. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tyson was also eligible for state job creation tax credits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than $6.5 million of those incentives will remain available to Tyson even as it shutters its Glen Allen plant because the performance agreements for the Commonwealth’s Opportunity Fund and Virginia Investment Performance grants linked to the Pittsylvania project “are solely based on the investment and jobs performance at that particular facility,” said VEDP spokesperson Suzanne Clark in an email. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The closing of the Hanover plant is not related to the opening of the Pittsylvania plant and the two facilities produce different product lines; therefore, the COF and VIP incentive contracts that VEDP has entered into for the Pittsylvania County project are not impacted by the closure,” Clark said. </span></p>
<p>Jordan Butler, a spokesperson for the Tobacco Region Opportunity Fund, also said Tyson remains eligible for TROF funding. The $1.5 million offered to the company was a combination of a $707,000 grant and an $821,000 loan, and Tyson opted not to use the loan portion, said Butler.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clark said Tyson has not yet received any payments from the Commonwealth’s Opportunity Fund or Virginia Investment Performance grants. Butler said the $707,000 Tobacco Region Opportunity Fund grant has also not yet been issued, since &#8220;funds are to be awarded post-performance &#8230; and will not until performance is verified.&#8221; The facility is expected to open later this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Pittsylvania plant will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">produce cooked chicken nuggets and other products. The Glen Allen plant hatches and raises broilers and then processes them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2015, the Pittsylvania Board of Supervisors </span><a href="https://www.chathamstartribune.com/news/article_4f33ca0e-0f7c-11e5-92c2-3fe5625d10ba.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">visited the Glen Allen plant as part of a “fact-finding mission”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to determine whether they should try to recruit a poultry processor to their county.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Glen Allen closure was first publicly announced Monday by the United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Local 400 Union, which represents the plant workers and said it had not received advance notice from Tyson. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These men and women risked their lives and the safety of their families to keep this plant operational during the pandemic, and this is the thanks they get?” asked Local 400 President Mark Federici in a statement. “This is not how we show gratitude to essential workers in Virginia.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federici also criticized Tyson for “continu[ing] to reap the lavish benefits of taxpayer dollars while Virginia will have 300 fewer jobs.” </span></p>
<p><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-115/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> says that money from the Commonwealth’s Opportunity Fund “shall not be used for any economic development project in which a business relocates or expands its operations in one or more Virginia localities and simultaneously closes its operations or substantially reduces the number of its employees in another Virginia locality” unless the Major Economic Incentives Commission has approved the project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The MEI Commission is made up of lawmakers from both the House and Senate money committees, as well as the secretaries of finance and commerce and trade.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2015-16, state officials under former Gov. Terry McAuliffe approved almost $2 million in state incentives from the Commonwealth’s Opportunity Fund for Norfolk Southern to move jobs from Roanoke to Hampton Roads. Internal communications from the Virginia Economic Development Partnership obtained at the time by The Roanoke Times </span><a href="https://roanoke.com/business/state-economic-development-officials-questioned-norfolk-southern-job-relocation-grant/article_a0932e43-7a61-5c22-a1d2-1dfa938bf85b.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">showed discomfort among some agency officials over the decision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Clark said the Tyson case is different because it doesn’t involve the simultaneous closing and opening of facilities, and the law about use of opportunity funds “does not apply to situations that emerge well after a grant is awarded and a contract is signed.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The closing of the Hanover plant is not related to the opening of the Pittsylvania plant, and the plan was not to replace the Hanover plant with the Pittsylvania plant,” she said. “Given the multi-year lag between the Pittsylvania announcement (August 2021) and the Hanover closure announcement, they were not simultaneous or related, and therefore an exception approval from the MEI Commission was not needed.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokesperson for Tyson did not respond to questions about the closure or grant eligibility. A March 13 notification from the company of the pending closure and associated layoffs <a href="https://richmond.com/business/local/glen-allen-tyson-foods/article_48cc29a8-c1db-11ed-a578-afd9cdfd39b5.html" target="_blank">obtained by The Richmond Times-Dispatch</a> says that &#8220;as part of the Company&#8217;s business strategy to operate more efficiently, Tyson Foods has determined that it must eliminate all jobs at its Glen Allen processing complex.&#8221; The last day of work is expected to occur &#8220;on or about&#8221; May 12. </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury) </p><p>Kroger employees in Virginia and West Virginia are pursuing a class-action suit against the grocery giant, alleging that bugs in the company’s new payroll software system cheat them out of their rightful wages.</p>
<p>The class-action lawsuit filed in Richmond in January is one of four filed by employees in five states against the country’s largest supermarket chain. Allegations include nonpayment for overtime or vacation time and unauthorized deductions from paychecks.</p>
<p>The new payroll system, called My Time, has not been accurate since it was introduced last spring, said Horace Campfield, a Richmond Kroger employee who has worked for the company for more than 17 years. “They try to tell you to set it up through your cell phone. They put a bulletin out to tell us to make sure our time is right. We did our job. We clocked in. How are you making it our responsibility? It’s unfair to make it seem it like it’s on us.”</p>
<p>Wage theft occurs when employers do not pay workers according to the law. The Kroger case falls in that category but is a little different.</p>
<p>“Most cases we encounter are not due to some computer error. This is a bit unique,” said Matthew Handley, an attorney for United Food and Commercial Workers International Unit Local 400 workers in Virginia and West Virginia. He is a partner at Handley Farah &amp; Anderson, based in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Payroll errors are common enough, Handley said, but in the Kroger suit, “it’s the scope and duration that is remarkable. The rollout of the new payroll system has really been an unmitigated disaster. People have not been paid for weeks at a time or had things double deducted. … It’s not only that wages aren’t going to workers, but that Kroger is effectively keeping them.”</p>
<p>Jonathan Williams, a spokesperson for UFCW Local 400, said when the union first responded to reports of payroll issues, “we understood this to be a small local problem, a glitch or two here and there” but quickly realized the problem was nationwide.</p>
<p>“People were missing paychecks or they were having taxes deducted from locations they didn’t live in. It was not even consistent within one store,” according to Williams.</p>
<p>The company has not been helpful, he said. “We would not be filing if they were addressing the problem.”</p>
<p>Kroger, which also owns Fred Meyer, Ralphs and other grocery chains, did not respond to a request for a statement.</p>
<p>In wage theft lawsuits, “the important part is the penalties,” Handley said. “Virginia was slow coming to the table compared to D.C. and Maryland, but it has in recent years given a bit more teeth to the wage theft laws over and above what federal law requires.”</p>
<p>Under federal law, the penalty for wage theft is “two times what you were underpaid,” said Handley.  In Maryland the penalty is three times the pay due to the employee, and in the District of Columbia the penalty is four times. A few states have also begun treating wage theft as a criminal, not civil, violation, making jail time a possibility.</p>
<p>Prior to 2020, Virginia law didn’t allow employees who thought they had been subject to wage theft to sue their employers over the dispute. Instead, they had to file an administrative claim with the Virginia Department of Labor and Industry (DOLI).</p>
<p>That year, legislation known as the Wage Theft Law created a private right of action for employees to sue their employers. Under that law, employees who can show a violation was egregious can get up to three times their pay.</p>
<p>Another recent change in Virginia law that is pertinent to the Kroger lawsuit came in 2019, when an <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+CHAP0836&amp;191+ful+CHAP0836" target="_blank">amendment</a> to the Virginia Payment of Wage Law began requiring employers to provide employees with written statements of their pay, either by paystub or through online accounting.</p>
<p>The new paystubs issued by Kroger “are complicated documents,” according to Handley. But, he added, at least employees in Virginia now must receive them.</p>
<p>Williams said that when it comes to the Kroger paystubs, “even attorneys had trouble making heads or tails of them. There are terms that appear on the paystub that are never mentioned in the bargaining agreement. It’s not always clear what the rate is being based on, based on federal law.”</p>
<p>Campfield agreed the paystubs are confusing.</p>
<p>“It’s a mess to me,” he said. “I went on vacation for Thanksgiving, and after I got back I had not received my check. It took three weeks.”</p>
<p>He said he’s heard a number of similar complaints from coworkers. “We recently had a guy who went about five weeks before he got his pay right,” Campfield said. It’s a particular problem because “some people are living check to check.”</p>
<p>Wage theft in general is a commonplace problem. The <a href="https://www.epi.org/press/wage-theft-costs-american-workers-50-billion/" target="_blank">Economic Policy Institute</a> estimates that it costs U.S. workers as much as $50 billion per year.</p>
<p>Handley said it is particularly rampant in the construction industry, where workers are often employed by contractors and “members of immigrant communit[ies] are vulnerable and easily exploited.”</p>
<p>According to Williams, “there are ways big and small” to cheat people out of their pay, such as not paying for holidays, vacation days or break times or not paying overtime when it is required. “Every minute you work for an employer you should be paid for.”</p>
<p>“Our members have a union and a grievance system and can recover back pay,” he said. “For non-union workers, it may go unnoticed and there’s no clear channel to address it.”</p>
<p>In Virginia, the Virginia Interfaith Center for Public Policy and Virginia Employment Lawyers Association operate a hotline at 804-821-1768 that workers can call if they believe their employer is engaging in wage theft.</p>
<p>The calls to the hotline come from “construction workers, people incorrectly classified as independent contractors, home health workers or caretakers of the elderly or children,” said Sheila Herlihy Hennessee, an organizer for the interfaith center. “Wage theft hits low-wage workers more than higher-wage workers. It’s people who are just trying to make ends meet.”</p>
<p>Workers can submit a complaint to the hotline and someone at the center can draft a letter to try to address the issue, she said. If that doesn’t work, the groups can put the employee in touch with an attorney.</p>
<p>“Once in a while we find people of good will who didn’t know they were committing wage theft and we have a lovely conversation,” she said. “More often they won’t respond to the letter.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House Commerce and Energy subcommittee voted 4-3 to recommend approval of a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1669" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Del. Danny Marshall, R-Danville, that would require employers to pay employees younger than 18 no less than the greater of $9 per hour or the federal minimum wage, which is currently $7.25 per hour. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The minimum wage in Virginia has risen from $7.25 an hour to the current $12 an hour over the past three years following Democrat-backed </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+HB395" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">signed into law in 2020. That law included provisions further increasing the minimum wage to $13.50 an hour in 2025 and $15 an hour in 2026, but those increases will require additional approval from the General Assembly to go into effect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title40.1/chapter3/article1.1/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">law lists</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 16 categories of workers not subject to the state increases, including those under the age of 16 and those younger than 18 who are enrolled in school full-time while working less than 20 hours per week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Workers aged 16 and 17 who don’t fall under any of the exemptions must be paid at least the state minimum of $12 an hour. Marshall’s legislation would reduce that wage floor to $9 an hour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marshall told the panel the push for lower wages for minors was brought to him by small business owners in his area over concerns they will be unable to afford to pay workers in the event the state’s minimum wage increases up to $15 an hour in 2026.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small businesses “cannot afford to pay $15 for someone who comes into a business less than 18 with a small skillset,” Marshall said. “They have to be trained that 8 o’clock means 8 o’clock.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kilgore, as well as Del. Cliff Hayes, D-Chesapeake, and House Minority Leader Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, voted against the bill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 10 individuals and organizations spoke in opposition to the bill, saying it promotes age discrimination and doesn’t take into account the financial needs of employed teenagers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abby Garber, a 17-year old with the student group Coalition for Virginia’s Future, told the subcommittee she’s been working since she was 14 to save money for college, and many of her friends are forced to work long hours after school to support their families.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill “would force many of my friends to take up multiple jobs to make ends meet and might even force them to leave school to survive,” Garber said. “This bill would be detrimental to our commonwealth’s youth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mel Borja, a policy analyst for the progressive think tank Commonwealth Institute for Fiscal Analysis, said the legislation would also have a disproportionate impact on Black and other workers of color, youth in rural communities and first- and second-generation immigrant children. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This bill burns a hole in the wallets of teenage workers in a time of high inflation that has made it harder to make ends meet,” Borja said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While no one spoke in support of the bill Tuesday, Marshall said if minors continue to be paid the state’s minimum wage as it inches up to $15 an hour, “we’re going to have an unintended consequence that is actually going to have a reverse effect that we’ll have less people that will be hired.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If people come to the job at less than 18 and they have certain skills,” Marshall said, “then they will be able to get paid a higher wage.”</span></p>

<p>Thirty-seven percent of U.S. workers employed by state and local governments belong to a union, compared to only 7% of private-sector employees, according to Gallup, Inc.’s <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/265958/percentage-workers-union-members.aspx" target="_blank">2021-22 Work and Education survey</a>.</p>
<p>But for years, those statistics wouldn’t have included local government workers in Virginia, where collective bargaining had been paused in 1977 after a Virginia Supreme Court ruling stopped local governments from bargaining with their employees.</p>
<p>Then, in 2020, the newly Democrat-controlled General Assembly passed legislation empowering local governments to allow collective bargaining, while leaving them free to decide the specifics. House Bill 582 took effect in May 2021.</p>
<p>David Broder, president of Service Employees International Union (SEIU) 512 Virginia, called the law “the most important piece of labor law reform” but said that “at the same time, it is the smallest of first steps. The legislature needs to realize that that patchwork system, that instability, is bad for Virginia. &#8230; Ordinances look different in every locality.”</p>
<p>Eric Paltell, an attorney with Maryland-based law firm Kollman &amp; Saucier who is outside counsel for the Prince William School Board, called the law “an arcane process” that allows counties, cities, towns and school boards to reach various agreements with employees, sometimes leading to different agreements within one county.</p>
<p>In Prince William County, it was the eight-member school board that authorized the two bargaining units that vote this month. One, the school system’s classified staff bargaining unit, includes bus drivers, food service workers and janitorial staff. The certified staff bargaining unit is made up of teachers, nurses, counselors, librarians and social workers. The county has about 4,000 classified employees and about 7,000 state-certified employees.</p>
<p>The mechanics of voting have been complicated to work out, according to Paltell. After votes are cast, a third party must determine whether 50% of employees in each bargaining unit voted. If so, and if the union wins the majority of the votes cast, it then becomes the exclusive representative for employees in that bargaining unit.</p>
<p>Prince William’s requirement that 50% of employees in the bargaining union must turn out to vote “is more the exception than the rule,” Paltell said, but “it’s not quite as onerous as some” localities’ criteria.</p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Collective bargaining across the U.S.</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>According to the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, “some states, such as Ohio and California, have state labor boards, and any group that wants to organize, local or state, follows the state law and organizes in a similar manner to private-sector unions.”</p>
<p>In Virginia and other states like Maryland, Alabama, and Colorado, “public-sector bargaining is permitted but not required. The precise systems differ state to state. In Virginia, no state worker can organize. If a public employee locally wants to organize, the locality can then pass or not pass a bargaining ordinance under their own terms.”</p>
<p>Complicating Virginia’s situation is the Dillon Rule, a rule that forbids local governments from exercising any powers not explicitly given to them by state law. As a result, prior to the passage of HB 582, localities had no authority to allow collective bargaining by their public-sector workers.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
    </div>

	
<p>Mel Borja, a policy analyst for the Commonwealth Institute for Fiscal Analysis, a progressive think tank that advocates for strengthening collective bargaining rights, noted that the process of moving from interest in unionizing to actual contract bargaining “can take a long time. It’s an ever-evolving space.”</p>
<p>But Borja said she sees signs of activity now taking place in areas such as Virginia Beach, Norfolk and Charlottesville, as well as in Northern Virginia and Richmond.</p>
<p>Broder said he’s also seeing interest across the commonwealth. His union represents more than 4,000 public service employees — home care providers, nurses, social workers, sanitation workers, inspectors, librarians and park staff — in Prince William, Fairfax, Loudon and Richmond.</p>
<p>Although the state leaves it up to localities to decide whether or not to allow collective bargaining, once bargaining rights are secured, they generally cover the same territory, he said — pay, benefits, working conditions and terms of employment.</p>
<p>One concern, Broder added, is that it remains illegal under Virginia law for public-sector workers to strike.</p>
<p>“No local ordinance can change that,” he said. “We have seen some localities try to weaponize that” by trying to frame actions by individuals as unlawful union activity.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Cities and counties step up</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Since the collecting bargaining prohibition was lifted, the cities of Alexandria and Richmond and Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun and Prince William counties have passed some type of ordinance or resolution allowing public-sector collective bargaining.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="djjxGXun78"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/07/28/where-can-public-sector-employees-collectively-bargain-in-virginia/">Where can public sector employees collectively bargain in Virginia?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Where can public sector employees collectively bargain in Virginia?&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/07/28/where-can-public-sector-employees-collectively-bargain-in-virginia/embed/#?secret=KBdkxe5UeH#?secret=djjxGXun78" data-secret="djjxGXun78" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>The city of Alexandria got off to the quickest start, with its ordinance going into effect May 1, 2021, the earliest date possible under HB 582.</p>
<p>The Fairfax County Board of Supervisors voted in October 2021 to adopt a collective bargaining ordinance. Under the ordinance, the county recognizes separate bargaining units for the fire department, police and other county workers.</p>
<p>Last July, Richmond City Council voted to allow collective bargaining with most city employees, including police, firefighters, emergency personnel, municipal labor and trade workers, professional workers, and administrative and technical staff.</p>
<p>And in November, the Prince William Board of County Supervisors voted in favor of a collective bargaining ordinance that covers county employees.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">School boards take action</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>A similar pattern has emerged in the efforts to organize teachers, with Northern Virginia and Richmond taking the lead.</p>
<p>In December 2021, the Richmond School Board approved a resolution allowing teachers and other school staff the right to join a union and bargain collectively. And the following December, the Richmond Education Association’s four bargaining units approved tentative contracts with the school system’s administration.</p>
<p>In June, the Arlington School Board voted unanimously to authorize collective bargaining for teachers and staff.</p>
<p>In October, the Prince William County School Board passed its collective bargaining resolution.</p>
<p>And in December, Fairfax County Public School administrators presented a draft resolution to the school board to allow employees to organize.</p>
<p>Prince William County organizers said they’ve seen misunderstanding and opposition to teachers’ efforts to unionize.</p>
<p>Maggie Hansford, president of the Prince William Education Association (PWEA), said that in discussions about unions, the public and public officials often focus just on compensation. But while she said compensation is an important issue — “We are second to last in pay in Northern Virginia,” she said — it’s not the only issue that matters to educators.</p>
<p>There’s not enough understanding of teachers’ concerns for other critical issues such as health, safety and “the basic human right to have a say in our career and work environment,” according to Hansford.</p>
<p>“We want employees to be able to say: ‘This is what I need for my students.’ When educators are making decisions there is a better learning environment for students,” she said.</p>
<p>Quality of education and working conditions are also major concerns for educators, “especially after COVID,” said Jerod Gay, an organizer who teaches language arts in Prince William County Public Schools. The problem is not only worries about the disease itself, but the disruption it has triggered in the schools, according to Gay: “It caused a lot of people to leave the division or the profession altogether. As people have left, it’s created an even bigger strain on the people who have to pick up the slack.”</p>
<p>That’s because often, he said, newcomers “haven’t been through the normal professional development. They have none of the pedagogical experience. They’re not certified and are limited in the tools they have.”</p>
<p>Gay said he believes that teachers who take the lead in organizing are often seen as too “progressive.”</p>
<p>“We’re receiving resistance where other people are not,” he said. “We are targets of demonization.”</p>
<p>But Gay also said he is seeing “a renaissance of class consciousness. When I was growing up, the mentality people had was that unions were unnecessary at best, at worst they hurt. Over time, as people see lower wages and can’t afford to pay their bills, they get desperate” and rediscover unions.</p>
<p>Data show a shift in attitudes about union representation. <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/12751/labor-unions.aspx" target="_blank">According to Gallup</a>, 71% of Americans now approve of labor unions, the highest percentage the polling organization has recorded on this measure since 1965. And the National Labor Relations Board reported a 57% increase in union election petitions filed during the first six months of fiscal year 2021.</p>
<p>Broder attributes some of that shift in attitude to the pandemic.</p>
<p>One thing COVID made clear “is how much we need a safe and healthy workplace and also how much inequity there is,” he said, pointing out that unsafe work is <a href="https://www.oecd.org/coronavirus/policy-responses/the-unequal-impact-of-covid-19-a-spotlight-on-frontline-workers-migrants-and-racial-ethnic-minorities-f36e931e/" target="_blank">disproportionately done by people of color</a> and women who lack paid sick days and safe scheduling.</p>
<p>As a result of that concern, “workers are organizing in the public and private sector, across race and gender,” Broder said. “The public sector and the private sector are inspiring each other.”</p>

(Joe Raedle / Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the 20 states that have failed to raise the minimum wage above the federal $7.25 an hour standard, 16 have more than 12% of their children living in poverty, according to a States Newsroom analysis of wage and poverty data. Anti-poverty advocates say that’s a sign that there’s an urgent need for lawmakers to increase the federal minimum wage and do more to help struggling families.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congress had the opportunity to achieve the latter by expanding the child tax credit before the end of the year, but lawmakers </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/child-tax-credit-expansion-left-out-congressional-omnibus-package" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">did not arrive at a deal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with Republicans to include it in the omnibus spending package. The expansion, which was part of the American Rescue Plan, provided as much as $3,600 in monthly installments to qualifying families and is credited with lifting </span><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Child-Tax-Credit-Report-Final_Updated.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3.7 million children out of poverty</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at least temporarily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raising the minimum wage would not lead to as fast or drastic an improvement, but a <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2019-07/CBO-55410-MinimumWage2019.pdf" target="_blank">2019 </a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congressional Budget Office analysis</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that increasing the amount to $15 an hour would lift more than 500,000 children from poverty. And the Economic Policy Institute </span><a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/raising-the-federal-minimum-wage-to-15-by-2025-would-lift-the-pay-of-32-million-workers/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">estimated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2021 that if Congress passed a bill raising the minimum wage to $15 by 2025, up to 3.7 million people wouldn’t have to live in poverty — 1.3 million of those being children.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ben Zipperer, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, said there is a strong connection between the minimum wage and poverty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s not a 1-1 connection, but there is a pretty strong connection,” said Zipperer, whose expertise is on the minimum wage, inequality, and low-wage labor markets. “The main determinants of poverty in this country are whether you work and how much you work, so whether you have a job during the year and how many hours a week or weeks per year you work at that job. … And then the third [determinant] is how much you were paid for an hour of work at your job. If you&#8217;re getting paid relatively low wages, the minimum wage affects that.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congress last raised the minimum wage in 2009, but </span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/labor-and-employment/state-minimum-wage-chart.aspx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">30 states</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> now require employers to pay more than the federal standard, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Numerous municipalities have also passed living wage laws for city or county workers.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.epi.org/minimum-wage-tracker/#/min_wage/Connecticut" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twenty-seven states</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including </span><a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2022/08/05/inflation-will-push-new-jerseys-minimum-wage-above-14-in-january/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Jersey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.fox35orlando.com/news/floridas-minimum-wage-to-increase-in-2023" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Florida</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB3" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">California</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Missouri_Proposition_B,_%2412_Minimum_Wage_Initiative_(2018)" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Missouri</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, will raise their state’s minimum wage in 2023 after passing legislation or </span><a href="https://www.fox35orlando.com/news/floridas-minimum-wage-to-increase-in-2023" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voter-approved</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ballot measures that gradually increase the state minimum wage over several years or tie it to inflation. Washington ($15.74), California ($15.50) and Massachusetts ($15) will have some of the highest state minimum wages in 2023, although the high cost of living in those states mitigates the effect on poverty rates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Missouri, where the minimum wage will be $12 next year, a 2018 </span><a href="https://www.nelp.org/publication/raising-missouris-minimum-wage-to-12-by-2023-more-than-100000-working-seniors-and-near-retirees-would-benefit/#_ednref4" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Economic Policy Institute found that Proposition B, the ballot measure that is responsible for raising the wage, would increase wages for 677,000 people in Missouri. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">States where legislatures have not raised the minimum above the federal $7.25 an hour include Mississippi, Louisiana, Georgia, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Kentucky, North Carolina and South Carolina. All have child poverty rates of 20% or higher, </span><a href="https://247wallst.com/special-report/2022/05/19/states-where-the-most-children-live-in-poverty/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> U.S. Census data analyzed by 24/7 Wall Street, a financial news site. Mississippi has the highest child poverty rate in the United States, at 27.6%, with Louisiana following at 26.3%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zipperer said that many of these low-minimum wage states are concentrated in the southern United States for a reason. He pointed to political deals lawmakers made to </span><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/how-labor-laws-disfavor-people-color" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">leave Black workers out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 1930s labor rights gains, which were done for the benefit of Southern Democrats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That legacy of racism plagued the initial years of the national minimum wage and labor law generally in the United States, and while it was somewhat improved and overcome through the civil rights movement, you see the parallel to that now where you have a lot of places in the South that don&#8217;t have minimum wages and or have very low minimum wages, and so they follow the federal standard which Congress has refused to raise over the past 13 years,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added, “That kind of decline in the cost-of-living adjusted value of the minimum wage disproportionately harms the people who are paid the lowest wages in the U.S. economy, and because of our sexist and racist labor market, that is women and people of color.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Louisiana, for instance, 64% of women of color earn less than $15 an hour, while 58% of Black workers and 50% of Hispanic workers also earn less than $15 an hour, according to </span><a href="https://www.oxfamamerica.org/explore/countries/united-states/poverty-in-the-us/low-wage-map-2022/scorecard/?state=LA" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oxfam America</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s analysis of U.S. Census data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congress last </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/05/us/minimum-wage-senate.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">failed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to increase the minimum wage in 2021, when it was proposed as part of a larger pandemic relief package. </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/05/us/minimum-wage-senate.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fifty</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate Republicans and seven Senate Democrats voted against raising the minimum wage to $15 by 2025. The exclusion of the expansion of the child tax credit in Congress’ omnibus bill is one more lost chance to reduce child poverty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The child tax credit enormously reduced poverty during the recent expansion of that program, and unfortunately that was temporary,” Zipperer said. “But I think that&#8217;s a very clear demonstration that we actually have, to some degree, the capacity to eliminate a lot of poverty in this country. All it takes is overcoming the political opposition to do that.”</span></p>

(Scott Elmquist / Style Weekly) </p><p>WASHINGTON — U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Monday said the House will take up legislation to ratify an agreement between rail workers and operators in order to avert a nationwide rail strike.</p>
<p>“This week, the House will take up a bill adopting the Tentative Agreement — with no poison pills or changes to the negotiated terms — and send it to the Senate,” the California Democrat said in a statement. “It is my hope that this necessary, strike-averting legislation will earn a strongly bipartisan vote, giving America’s families confidence in our commitment to protecting their financial futures.”</p>
<p>The announcement follows President Joe Biden’s call on Monday directing Congress to adopt the agreement reached in September, which was based on recommendations from an emergency board that Biden established in July.</p>
<p>That agreement would give workers a 24% raise over five years, from 2020 to 2024; one additional personal day; and some protection from the rail carriers&#8217; punitive attendance policies so that workers can take time off for medical needs without fear of discipline.</p>
<p>But paid sick leave was not on the table and the board recommended to the unions that they withdraw their proposal to have 15 paid sick days.</p>
<p>The way rail unions work is that all 12 unions — representing 115,000 freight rail workers — need to agree on a contract, and if one doesn’t agree, workers represented by the others don’t cross the picket line.</p>
<p>Eight of the 12 voted to adopt and ratify the union’s tentative agreement, so the unions went into a cooling-off period that was set to end Dec. 9, meaning the unions then could strike.</p>
<p>The unions that did not ratify the September deal are the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division-International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers, the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen and the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, which represent roughly more than half of rail workers.</p>
<p>“The most common sticking point for BMWED, BRS and IBB Members has been the lack of quality-of-life improvements, namely the lack of paid sick leave,” according to BMWED’s <a href="https://www.bmwe.org/secondary.aspx?id=718" target="_blank">website</a>. “BMWED, BRS and IBB have made paid sick leave proposals to the railroads, but the railroads have made it clear that they will neither engage in any meaningful discussions nor accept any sort of proposal regarding such.”</p>
<p>Biden said that he is concerned about no paid sick leave for rail workers and that he has pressed for legislation to enact it.</p>
<p>“Every other developed country in the world has such protections for its workers,” Biden said in a statement. “But at this critical moment for our economy, in the holiday season, we cannot let our strongly held conviction for better outcomes for workers deny workers the benefits of the bargain they reached, and hurl this nation into a devastating rail freight shutdown.”</p>
<p>These negotiations over employee pay, ability to take time off for medical appointments and paid sick leave have been going on since 2019 between labor unions representing railway employees and the National Carriers’ Conference Committee, which represents the railway carriers.</p>
<p><a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/LSB/LSB10861" target="_blank">Congress has the ability to intervene</a>, due to the Railway Labor Act, which governs disputes between railway carriers and labor unions.</p>
<p>“We are reluctant to bypass the standard ratification process for the Tentative Agreement — but we must act to prevent a catastrophic nationwide rail strike, which would grind our economy to a halt,” Pelosi said.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a strongly worded letter to the Prince William Board of County Supervisors this month, union leaders pointed out the draft ordinance, prepared by the county administration with the help of an outside employment consultant, gives management the final say over “work rules, policies, procedures and standards of conduct.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At a minimum, staff and their outside counsel have misled the board — if not outright lied to you —  into believing we will be able to bargain over working conditions,” wrote the labor leaders from three groups representing police, firefighters and other public workers. “The list of exclusions is so broad that there would be no bargaining over working conditions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The letter also proposed clearer language ensuring part-time employees can be included in collective bargaining units and more authority for a neutral labor relations administrator who would handle arbitration and investigation of unfair labor practice claims.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia General Assembly passed legislation in 2020 empowering local governments to allow collective bargaining by their workers, while leaving localities free to decide specifics of what would and wouldn’t be up for negotiation. The battle in Prince William, which potentially impacts roughly 4,000 county employees, appears to be the most sharp-elbowed labor versus management dispute so far as Democratic-leaning localities look to convey pro-worker stances under the new law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The draft ordinance in Prince William, if passed in its current form, would mostly limit collective bargaining to wages and benefits, a less extensive version of </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/07/28/where-can-public-sector-employees-collectively-bargain-in-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">similar laws</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> already approved by Fairfax, Loudoun and Arlington counties, as well as the cities of Alexandria and Richmond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“County staff has been excluding all labor unions from the entire process,” Katie Zaimis, president of the Prince William County Police Association, said in an interview this week. &#8220;Everything was done behind closed doors. And every draft that comes out we&#8217;ve had no input.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokesperson for the county declined to comment on behalf of the county administration, which is drafting the ordinance with the help of an outside attorney, employment consultant Eric Paltell, and presenting it to the county board for approval. A hearing on the </span><a href="https://www.pwcva.gov/department/board-county-supervisors/collective-bargaining" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">collective bargaining ordinance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is scheduled for Nov. 22.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Prince William County School Board adopted its own collective bargaining plan last month in a 7-1 vote,</span><a href="https://wtop.com/prince-william-county/2022/10/prince-william-school-board-passes-collective-bargaining-rights-as-rancor-continues-between-board-and-education-association/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> according to WTOP</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a prior board discussion of the proposal last month, County Attorney Michelle Robl suggested Prince William was taking a more prudent approach than other Northern Virginia localities that have already authorized collective bargaining.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They&#8217;re having some growing pains with them,” Robl said. “They still don&#8217;t have a collective bargaining agreement in place. We are taking the experience of Mr. Paltell’s 30-plus years in states that have had it, along with seeing what&#8217;s happened in the other Northern Virginia jurisdictions that don&#8217;t seem to be working as smoothly as possible.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Broder, president of the Service Employees International Union Virginia 512 chapter, said the county’s staff has resisted the board’s request for an ordinance “that would give their employees the same rights as employees in Fairfax and Loudoun and Arlington and Alexandria.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This simply does not do it,” Broder said, adding that it’s taking time for other Northern Virginia jurisdictions to strike new labor agreements because it’s “very difficult in America for workers to come together and form unions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the Nov. 2 letter, Broder said, none of the labor groups’ proposed changes were implemented before the ordinance was advertised for a public hearing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Since we sent that letter I think we&#8217;ve sadly seen the same dynamic occur, which is county staff… continue to shove workers out of this process,” Broder said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robl did not respond to a message left with her office Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While discussing a recommendation for the county and labor unions to split the costs of arbitration proceedings to avoid “frivolous” labor claims, Paltell told the board his guidance was based on common practices in other states, even if it didn’t align with what other Northern Virginia jurisdictions have done under a brand-new law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our client is the county,” said Paltell, who works for the Maryland-based Kollman &amp; Saucier law firm. “We&#8217;re trying to put some kind of controls on the county&#8217;s financial exposure in these proceedings.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prince William Board Chair Ann Wheeler did not respond to emailed requests for comment for this story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several labor leaders said they hope the board will take more time to amend the ordinance before moving forward. In the Nov. 2 letter, labor groups urged the board not to follow the guidance of “union-busting outside counsel.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process of drafting the collective bargaining ordinance has been greatly hampered by the anti-union, unelected staff’s outright refusal to include the labor organizations in discussions,” the labor groups wrote. “Tellingly, county staff and the county attorney meet regularly with real estate developers about land use issues in the County, yet refuse to meet with unions about core workers rights issues.”</span></p>

Chronic fatigue is what plagues her the most, she says. (Photo by Gino Gutierrez)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emily Withnall caught COVID-19 from her teenager in July 2020. In the more than two years since, the 40-year-old has suffered from debilitating fatigue, spinal pain and heart palpitations.  In addition to her primary care doctor, she regularly sees a cardiologist and says her acupuncturist and craniosacral therapy help relieve her pain and the trouble she has focusing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although her condition is improving, Withnall said she still isn’t back to her pre-COVID-19 health, and she’s had to ask her employer, New Mexico Highlands University, for accommodations, which include time off to go to her various medical appointments and the ability to work remotely. When she does commute, it takes her an hour to get to the office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There were a couple of times I had to commute and that was really, really hard and exhausting just physically,” she said. It doesn’t take much to cause a health setback. A simple cold can last weeks, so she worries about getting the flu or, even worse, COVID again. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have no idea how bad it could be for me,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long COVID, which the Mayo Clinic classifies as suffering from new, returning or ongoing symptoms, can include fatigue, chest pain, joint pain, dizziness, headaches, digestive issues, blood clots and brain fog, which makes it difficult to concentrate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sixteen million people of working age in the U.S. suffer with long COVID, and of those, 2 to 4 million people were unemployed in June and July, </span><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/new-data-shows-long-covid-is-keeping-as-many-as-4-million-people-out-of-work/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an August 2022 Brookings Institution report, which analyzes Census Bureau survey information. It’s one of numerous papers, surveys and studies attempting to assess the effect of long COVID on workers, businesses and the overall economy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The unemployment of so many Americans with long COVID, a lack of a social safety net for many of them, and a labor market that is beginning to turn in favor of employers could collide to create wider economic problems, some economic experts say. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cost in lost wages has already been great. The Brookings Institution report puts the amount between $170 billion to $230 billion a year. And a National Bureau of Economic Research </span><a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w30435/w30435.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">paper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published in September found that workers with COVID-19 absences could see their earnings fall by about $9,000 in the 14 months afterward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew Goodman-Bacon, a senior research economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said it’s unclear how the spending habits of people with long COVID will be affected by their illness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Some households will certainly have to cut back,” he said. “But some subset of those households will also have ways to sort of insure themselves or be insured by these public programs. … What is aggregate spending going to look like if we enter a recession with a large group of workers with a health condition, a newly acquired health condition hard to predict? It will pull a lot of these levers in the economy, some of which will make consumption patterns change more and some of which might kind of push the other direction.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goodman-Bacon added, “The health of the workforce really does matter and it&#8217;s mattered for a long time. … We&#8217;re all really trying to understand the same questions of just how much and right now we don&#8217;t know.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Taking care of workers</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Withnall said that at the beginning of the pandemic she was living in Missoula, Montana and teaching creative writing at schools. That work ended when schools shut down. It also became harder to place her freelance writing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then her landlord raised the rent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The real estate prices were skyrocketing, and still are actually, and so as a single parent with a meager freelance income and very little teaching left, I was just really, really struggling even with the unemployment benefits,” she said in a phone interview. “I was also really not able to work a lot because of how bad my COVID symptoms were.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said for the first six weeks after she tested positive for COVID, her neck and back “felt like it had been turned into concrete.” At one point, a walk to the bathroom could leave her gasping for air. She ended up in the emergency room three times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She still struggles financially because of health care costs despite her job as a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ssociate director for communications at the university and writing a few articles each month as the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">economic justice fellow for the nonprofit Community Change. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I also don’t have savings or the ability to even think about bigger things like buying a house,” she said. “My oldest teen just started college and I can’t afford to help pay for it at all. I’d love to be able to put the money I’m paying in medical expenses towards my teen’s college, but that’s not yet possible. I’m still hoping that full recovery from long COVID will happen, but we will see.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the accommodations she has received from her employer have allowed Withnall to keep working,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Katie Bach, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of the 2022 report, said that with a changing labor market, there’s a question of whether employers will be less likely to support workers with long COVID who need accommodations at work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Labor market participation among the disabled has gone up about 2 percentage</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">points during the pandemic,” Bach said “Now there are a bunch of reasons that could be the case. One potential explanation is employers are more incentivized to find ways to accommodate people because they are short on people. If the macroeconomic conditions are such that over the next year we really see a move away from this kind of labor market tightness, employers are a little less motivated.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And there are some signs that the labor market may indeed be cooling down. The </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. unemployment rate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was 3.5% in September, the same as in </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/empsit_10042019.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">September 2019</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before the pandemic. Companies throughout the U.S. are having less trouble hiring staff, </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/03/business/economy/job-market-recession.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The New York Times’ reporting, and the rate of people leaving their jobs </span><a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/sce/labor#/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sunk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to 4.1% in July 2022 from 5.9% in July 2021, according to a Federal Reserve Bank of New York SCE labor market survey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If employers become unwilling to keep on people with long COVID or if those workers are forced to quit for health reasons, many parts of the social safety net, including the unemployment system, are not set up well to help them, researchers say. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew Stettner, director of workforce policy and senior fellow at the Century Foundation, said there are a few states with laws that allow people to collect state unemployment benefits if they cannot work because of their own illness, but “that&#8217;s definitely not the majority.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration has taken some action to ensure that people with long COVID have safeguards against discrimination, including </span><a href="https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/civil-rights-covid19/guidance-long-covid-disability/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">guidance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on treating long COVID as a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act. The Department of Labor&#8217;s Office of Disability Employment Policy also has a </span><a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/odep/topics/coronavirus-covid-19-long-covid" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that links to resources for employers on workplace accommodations for people with long COVID.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Goodman-Bacon pointed out that as more people return to work, employers may be more likely to keep only the accommodations they find useful and cost-saving, such as allowing remote work, which has been shown to </span><a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w28731/w28731.pdf?utm_campaign=PANTHEON_STRIPPED&amp;amp%3Butm_medium=PANTHEON_STRIPPED&amp;amp%3Butm_source=PANTHEON_STRIPPED" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increase productivity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may also be difficult for people to receive workers&#8217; compensation when they get long COVID. Tom Wiese, vice president of claims at the MEMIC Group, said that claims of work-related long COVID are challenging to investigate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even if the medical causation and/or origin of the symptoms/disease diagnosis can somehow be linked to COVID, there still remains the workers&#8217; compensation causality from a legal principle perspective. Did that causation arise out of and occur within the scope of their employment?” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, a woman who had COVID-19 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">lost a workers&#8217; comp case in Virginia in 2021 even though she worked in a nursing home when she became sick. Her weekly trips to the grocery store hurt her claim, </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/09/07/experts-are-expecting-a-legal-battle-over-covid-related-workers-compensation-in-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Virginia Mercury.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advocates and researchers have proposed a number of policies to provide economic stability to long COVID sufferers, whose numbers the Brookings report says could increase by 10% each year — and lead to a half trillion dollars in lost wages in 10 years — if people don’t begin to recover at greater rates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to better treatment options, the Brookings </span><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/new-data-shows-long-covid-is-keeping-as-many-as-4-million-people-out-of-work/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report recommends</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expanding paid sick leave, which could reduce the spread of COVID;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improving accommodations offered to workers such as flexibility on deadlines, longer and more frequent breaks, flexible hours and remote work; and </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Providing greater and and more timely access to Social Security Disability Insurance.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bach and Stettner say Census Bureau and Bureau of Labor Statistics need more questions on long COVID and employment on their surveys to better guide policymakers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Patient-Led Research Collaborative, which is a group of long COVID patients and researchers, </span><a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF14/20210428/112514/HHRG-117-IF14-Wstate-McCorkellL-20210428.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">says</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that there should be a federal advisory committee on long COVID at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and that Congress should appropriate money for states to fund or open clinics treating people with long COVID, pass universal healthcare and expand access to disability benefits, among other policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lisa McCorkell, a long COVID patient and the cofounder of and researcher for the Patient-Led Research Collaborative, said that although the Biden administration guidance is helpful, there’s a lot of people with long COVID who will still encounter discrimination at work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re still seeing a lot of people not get the accommodations that they need,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can be difficult for some long COVID patients to access the health care they need to establish that they are covered, and some employers still don’t believe they need to offer accommodations such as breaks or the ability to start work later in the day, McCorkell said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said that although she’s seen people forced out of the workforce due to a lack of accommodations from employers, not many people have the resources to fight that termination, and it’s also hard to take on legal issues when you’re sick.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stettner said that it’s important employers adjust and provide accommodations for workers with long COVID, because the workforce is changing in the long term.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We had a very large generation of workers born in the ’40s and ’50s and those workers are reaching retirement age,” he said. “We really don&#8217;t have enough workers to grow the economy and we need to be able to accommodate those who are able to work, even if they&#8217;re not able to work full time, 12 months a year. We have to do better at that. It&#8217;s an economic necessity for us to do that as a society.”</span></p>

(Service Employees International Union)</p><p><strong>By John Logan</strong></p>
<p>Labor Day 2022 comes smack bang in the middle of what is increasingly looking like a pivotal year in the history of American unions.</p>
<p>The summer has seen a steady stream of workforce mobilizations. Employees at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/28/trader-joes-union-employees-massachusetts" target="_blank">Trader Joe’s locations in Massachusetts</a> <a href="https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2022/08/15/trader-joes-unions-could-signal-the-future-of-grocery-store-organizing-food-writer-says" target="_blank">and Minneapolis</a> both voted to unionize. Meanwhile, restaurant chain Chipotle saw the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/08/25/chipotle-union-victory-fastfood-michigan/" target="_blank">first of its stores unionize</a>, following a vote by workers at an outlet in Lansing, Michigan.</p>
<p>It comes on the back of a wave of successful efforts to mobilize at Starbucks and Amazon. The growth of unionized stores at Starbucks in particular has been stunning. Since baristas <a href="https://apnews.com/article/starbucks-union-vote-buffalo-c7dc3c2ec8b838e9f4ed641f54fc9035" target="_blank">in Buffalo, New York, became the first at the chain to unionize</a> in December 2021, colleagues at a further 234 outlets have followed suit in recent months.</p>
<p>Likewise, the success of an independent <a href="https://www.amazonlaborunion.org/" target="_blank">Amazon Labor Union</a> – <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/04/01/chris-smalls-amazon-union/" target="_blank">formed in 2020 by Chris Smalls</a>, an <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/04/02/1090353185/amazon-union-chris-smalls-organizer-staten-island" target="_blank">Amazon worker fired</a> for protesting what he saw as inadequate COVID-19 safety precautions – in forming the <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/23005336/amazon-union-new-york-warehouse" target="_blank">first plant of the retail giant to have a unionized workforce</a> has inspired others to do likewise.</p>
<p>It comes as polling shows that public support of unions is at its <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/398303/approval-labor-unions-highest-point-1965.aspx?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosmarkets&amp;stream=business" target="_blank">highest since 1965</a>, with the backing of 71% of Americans. Something is definitely happening in the labor movement in 2022.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A different kind of organizing</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>As a <a href="https://cob.sfsu.edu/directory/john-logan" target="_blank">scholar of the labor movement</a> who has observed union drives for two decades, what I find almost as striking as the victories is the unconventional nature of the organizing campaigns.</p>
<p>Workers at Amazon and Trader Joe’s are setting up independent unions, whereas at Starbucks and Chipotle, employees are teaming up with established unions. But that difference apart, the dynamics at play are remarkably similar: The campaigns are being led by <a href="https://prospect.org/labor/generational-worker-revolt-hits-its-stride-amazon-union/" target="_blank">determined young workers</a>. For the most part, it is bottom-up unionizing, rather than being driven by official, seasoned union representatives.</p>
<p>Inspired by pro-union sentiment in political movements, such as <a href="https://berniesanders.com/issues/workplace-democracy/" target="_blank">Bernie Sanders’ presidential bids</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/10/black-lives-matter-labor-unions-factory-workers-unite" target="_blank">Black Lives Matter</a> and the <a href="https://labor.dsausa.org/" target="_blank">Democratic Socialists of America</a>, individuals are spearheading the efforts for workplace reform rather than professional union organizers. Indeed, one would be hard-pressed to find many experienced organizers among the recent successful campaigns.</p>
<p>Instead, the campaigns have involved a significant degree of “self-organization” – that is, workers “talking union” to each other in the warehouse and coffee shops and reaching out to colleagues in other shops in the same city and across the nation. <a href="https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9780801457227/building-more-effective-unions/#bookTabs=1" target="_blank">This marks a sea change</a> from the way the labor movement has traditionally operated, which has tended to be more centralized and led by seasoned union officials.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A labor revival</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps more important than the victories at Starbucks, Amazon, Trader Joe’s and Chipotle themselves is their potential for creating a sense of optimism and enthusiasm around union organizing, especially among younger workers.</p>
<p>The elections follow <a href="https://psmag.com/economics/what-caused-the-decline-of-unions-in-america" target="_blank">years of union decline in the U.S.</a>, both in terms of membership and influence.</p>
<p>Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, these recent labor wins would probably have seemed unimaginable. Powerful, wealthy <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-spent-43-million-on-anti-union-consultants-in-2021-alone-082051777.html" target="_blank">corporations like Amazon</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/nov/23/starbucks-aggressive-anti-union-effort-new-york-stores-organize" target="_blank">and Starbucks</a> appeared invincible then, at least in the context of <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/" target="_blank">National Labor Relations Board</a> rules, which are stacked heavily <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/unprecedented-the-trump-nlrbs-attack-on-workers-rights/" target="_blank">against pro-union workers</a>. Under NLRB rules, employers can – and do – force workers, on the threat of dismissal, to attend <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/nov/23/starbucks-aggressive-anti-union-effort-new-york-stores-organize" target="_blank">anti-union sessions</a>, often led by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-spent-43-million-on-anti-union-consultants-in-2021-alone-082051777.html" target="_blank">highly paid external consultants</a>.</p>
<p>Starbucks <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-15/starbucks-retaliated-against-pro-union-staff-nlrb-alleges" target="_blank">has said it has been</a> “consistent in denying any claims of anti-union activity. They are categorically false.” But the NLRB has alleged that the coffee chain <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/nlrb-region-15-wins-injunction-requiring-starbucks-to-rehire-seven" target="_blank">has fired and coerced workers</a>, placed union supporters <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/06/starbucks-accused-of-more-than-200-labor-violations-in-nlrb-complaint.html" target="_blank">under surveillance and retaliated</a> against them.</p>
<p>The NLRB has also <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/labor-board-files-complaint-against-starbucks-for-withholding-raises-from-unionized-stores" target="_blank">filed a complaint against Starbucks</a> for unlawfully withholding wage and benefit increases from pro-union workers, and currently has almost 300 open unfair labor practices charges lodged against Starbucks management. Amazon, which in the past <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/01/amazon-seeks-intelligence-analyst-to-track-labor-organizing-threats.html" target="_blank">has advertised for analysts to monitor “labor organizing threats</a>,” has said it <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/24/how-amazon-prevents-unions-by-surveilling-employee-activism.html" target="_blank">respects workers’ rights to join or not join unions</a>.</p>
<p>The significance of the recent victories is not primarily about the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/04/01/1089318684/amazon-labor-union-staten-island-election-bessemer-alabama-warehouse-workers" target="_blank">8,000 new union members</a> at Amazon or a gradual flow of new union members at Starbucks. It is about instilling in workers the belief that if pro-union workers can win at Amazon and Starbucks, they can win anywhere.</p>
<p>Historic precedents show that labor mobilization can be infectious.</p>
<p>In 1936 and 1937, workers at the Flint plant of General Motors <a href="https://www.history.com/news/flint-sit-down-strike-general-motors-uaw" target="_blank">brought the powerful automaker to its knees</a> in a sit-down strike that <a href="https://labornotes.org/2009/07/once-started-sit-downs-spread-wildfire" target="_blank">quickly inspired similar action</a> elsewhere. In the reported words of a Chicago doctor, when explaining a subsequent sit-down strike by wet nurses in the city: “It’s just one of those funny things. They want to strike because everyone else is doing it.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Seizing the moment</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/10/17/1046850192/the-pandemic-could-be-leading-to-a-golden-age-for-unions" target="_blank">pandemic has created an opportunity for unions</a>.</p>
<p>After working on the front lines for over two years, many essential workers such as those at Amazon and Trader Joe’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/may/26/starbuck-employees-intense-work-customer-abuse-understaffing" target="_blank">believe they have not been adequately rewarded</a> for their service during the pandemic and have not been treated with respect by their employers.</p>
<p>This appears to have helped spur <a href="https://prospect.org/labor/generational-worker-revolt-hits-its-stride-amazon-union/" target="_blank">the popularity</a> of smaller, workplace-specific unions.</p>
<p>The homegrown nature of these campaigns deprives chains of employing a decades-old trope at the heart of corporate anti-union campaigns: that a <a href="https://one.starbucks.com/" target="_blank">union is an external “third party</a>” that doesn’t understand or care about the concerns of employees and is more interested in collecting dues.</p>
<p>But those arguments mostly ring hollow <a href="https://labornotes.org/2022/04/amazon-workers-staten-island-clinch-historic-victory?fbclid=IwAR1pwcYb45xVPpvkuWV0JmkHb_1jwEwkUIwF56-aJFsT2B9O_AahdQj8Kdk" target="_blank">when the people doing the unionizing</a> are colleagues they work alongside day in and day out.</p>
<p>It has the effect of nullifying that central argument of anti-union campaigns despite the <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/unlawful-employer-opposition-to-union-election-campaigns/" target="_blank">many millions of dollars</a> that companies often pumped into them.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">An unfavorable legal landscape</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>This “self-organization” is consistent with what was envisioned by the authors of the <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/who-we-are/our-history/1935-passage-of-the-wagner-act" target="_blank">1935 Wagner Act</a>, the statute that provides the foundation of today’s union representation procedures.</p>
<p>The National Labor Relations Board’s first chair, J. Warren Madden, understood that self-organization could be fatally undermined if corporations were allowed to engage in anti-union pressure tactics:</p>
<p>“Upon this fundamental principle – that an employer shall keep his hands off the self-organization of employees – the entire structure of the act rests,” <a href="https://digitalcommons.law.seattleu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1631&amp;context=sulr" target="_blank">he wrote</a>.“ Any compromise or weakening of that principle strikes at the root of the law.”</p>
<p>Over the past half century, anti-union corporations and their consultants and law firms – assisted by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-labor-nlrb/unions-brace-for-big-changes-under-republican-led-u-s-labor-board-idUSKBN1HI328" target="_blank">Republican-controlled NLRBs</a> and right-wing judges – have <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-greenhouse-janus-supreme-court-20180627-story.html" target="_blank">undermined that process</a> of worker self-organization by enabling union elections to become employer-dominated.</p>
<p>But for the long-term decline in union membership to be reversed, I believe pro-union workers will need stronger protections. Labor law reform is essential if the <a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1177/0019793918806250" target="_blank">almost 50% of nonunion American workers</a> who say they want union representation are to have any chance of getting it.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Dispelling fear, futility and apathy</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Lack of popular interest <a href="https://www.filesforprogress.org/memos/worker-power.pdf" target="_blank">has long been an obstacle</a> to labor law reform.</p>
<p>Meaningful labor law reform is unlikely to happen unless people are engaged with the issues, understand them and believe they have a stake in the outcome.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://theconversation.com/union-battles-at-amazon-and-starbucks-are-hot-news-which-can-only-be-good-for-the-labor-movement-172932" target="_blank">media interest in the campaigns at Starbucks and Amazon</a> suggests the American public may finally be paying attention.</p>
<p>It isn’t known where this latest labor movement – or moment – will lead. It could evaporate or it may just spark a wave of organizing across the low-wage service sector, stimulating a national debate over workers’ rights in the process.</p>
<p>The biggest weapons that anti-union corporations have in suppressing labor momentum are the fear of retaliation and a sense that unionization is futile. The recent successes show unionizing no longer seems so frightening or so futile.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Ronaldo Gonzalez Vasquez says his employer owed him two weeks of pay when his once-reliable boss stopped responding to phone calls and text messages.</p>
<p>So the 21-year-old construction worker who had been building offices in Tyson’s Corner and McLean turned to the state for help, filling out an unpaid wage claim with the Department of Labor and Industry, which is the sole recourse for many low wage workers attempting to recover money owed by employers.</p>
<p>The subsequent investigation yielded a glimmer of hope — his boss admitted to the officer assigned to the case that he owed at least a portion of what Gonzalez Vasquez was claiming — followed by a serious let down. The state said in a letter that that wasn’t enough to collect.</p>
<p>“I didn’t get anything,” Gonzalez Vasquez, who says he moved to the United States from Guatemala to study architecture. “That’s not cheap. I pay my rent. I support myself. I need this money.”</p>
<p>Gonzalez Vasquez&#8217;s experience is surprising, but typical, according to the Legal Aid Justice Center, which released an <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Getting-Workers-What-Theyre-Owed-11-21-19-1.pdf" target="_blank">analysis</a> last month that found the department rarely recovers wages for workers while going easy on employers accused of wage theft.</p>
<p>The review, which included cases closed between January 2015 and May of this year, concluded:</p>
<p>• The state ordered employers to pay back wages in less than 19 percent of cases, or 736 of 3,948 claims.</p>
<p>• The state didn’t investigate nearly half of the wage claims filed, dismissing 47 percent without a review, many times based on internal policies that block claims in cases where, for instance, a worker received tips, had a written contract, or consulted a lawyer about their case.</p>
<p>• The department almost never holds employers it finds have committed wage theft accountable beyond seeking repayment, issuing just nine fines and referring no cases for follow-up by law enforcement.</p>
<p>“This has been a problem for a long, long time,” said Nicholas Marritz, a Legal Aid Justice Center lawyer and co-author of the report. “It finally just got to the point where we found the situation to be just so intolerable that we didn’t want to refer workers anymore because we just knew that nine times out of 10 the agency is going to find any reason to dismiss your case.</p>
<p>“We didn’t want to give people false hope.”</p>
<p>The Department of Labor and Industry declined to respond to questions about the report and its findings. In a series of emails exchanged over a two-week period, a representative also declined to comment on Gonzalez Vasquez’s account of his experience or the response he received from the department. They also refused to make anyone from the department available to speak about the wage claim process generally.</p>
<p>“We are in the process of reviewing our wage-claim policies and procedures,” said Jennifer Rose, a director with the department. “We will fully consider their recommendations as part of that process, along with Governor Northam&#8217;s recommendations to combat worker misclassification. We look forward to working with (Legal Aid Justice Center) and others to ensure Virginia workers get the pay they deserve.”</p>
<p>Under Virginia law, workers can sue employers for unpaid wages, but that approach rarely makes sense for low wage workers, for whom the cost of hiring a lawyer and lost time in court would outstrip any potential money recovered.</p>
<p>That leaves the Department of Labor and Industry as the primary recourse, and while Marritz acknowledges that not every claim filed is likely valid, he says it’s not plausible that only 18 percent over a four-year period were actionable.</p>
<p>The Legal Aid Justice Center offered about a dozen recommendations they say will improve outcomes for workers, all of which they say can be implemented immediately because the policies that are causing problems were developed internally and are not based on existing laws or regulations.</p>
<p>Among them: Do a better job determining if workers are correctly classified as independent contractors, give workers a chance to respond or provide additional information before claims are dismissed, allow workers to pursue wage claims against businesses that closed but have not filed for bankruptcy, stop rejecting claims from workers that received tips, consulted an attorney or had a written work contract.</p>
<p>They’re also calling for the department to step up enforcement against employers who have been credibly accused of wage theft, with fines and additional referrals to law enforcement.</p>
<p>“There&#8217;s basically no incentive for employers to pay their workers on time under Virginia law because the penalty is, ‘Ok, fine, pay them late,’” Marritz says. “It&#8217;s madness. It&#8217;s got to change. But until that changes, DOLI can do a lot more without passing any new laws and regulations.”</p>
<p>In Gonzalez Vasquez’s case, Marritz says the employer should have been ordered to pay the $400 he admitted to “probably” owing immediately while Gonzalez Vasquez was given an opportunity to present evidence justifying his claim for the full two weeks wages. And he argues that in the absence of any records kept by the employer, Gonzalez Vasquez’s testimony alone should be enough to pursue a claim.</p>
<p>Instead, Gonzalez Vasquez received a one-paragraph reply in the mail that said he would have to pursue the case in court. It requested a response within five days without indicating what if any information the case officer was seeking. And, in either case, Gonzalez Vasquez was out of the country when it arrived and couldn’t respond within the timeframe.</p>
<p>“Workers like Ronaldo did their job,” Marritz said. “All we&#8217;re asking is for (the department) to do their&#8217;s.”</p>
